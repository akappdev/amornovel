She leaned on the desk in the P.I.\u2019s dingy office, skirt tight against her curvaceous form, eyes sultry as she stared at the hero, Sam Stone. The film was dark and shadowy, and sexual tension between the players was palpable.</p><p>Sam Stone made no pretense of looking away from Dianna Breen\u2019s chest, modestly covered in frilly white cotton beneath the linen jacket of her suit. \u201cI do know the truth. I know you\u2019re a hussy and a thief, and I don\u2019t believe you\u2019d think twice before resorting to murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing!\u201d Dianna Breen leaned down to bring her face close to Sam Stone\u2019s. She reached past him, drew a cigarette from a pack on the desk and continued to stare at him as he fumbled for his lighter, then lit the cigarette.</p> <p>\u201cI know that you\u2019d do anything to own the Egyptian Museum, Dianna. Anything,\u201d he added softly.</p><p>She moved away from him at last, striding toward the window, her walk a study in slow sensuality. There, however, in what remained of the winter light, her face told the story; she was being wronged. She was not a murderess. She turned to him, hurt and passion in her eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand! You don\u2019t understand about...the museum,\u201d she said. She gazed back out on the Los Angeles street; beyond the window, day was dying. The city\u2019s shadows suited the ambience of the black-and-white film perfectly. \u201cIt was never mine\u2014you must understand. It was never mine. It was Frederick\u2019s, and it killed him, not I.\u201d</p><p>The sound of the old reels flipping through the projector suddenly seemed loud as Sam Stone watched Dianna Breen incredulously.</p><p>Sam\u2019s thoughts were heard then. He was narrating as he stood and walked over to the gorgeous and seductive widow. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. A museum didn\u2019t kill. But the way she was looking at me, those enormous blue eyes of hers brilliant with tears, a trembling in her lips\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p> <p>Alistair Archer nearly jumped out of his seat; he barely managed to cut off the startled scream that threatened to escape him. Jenny Henderson had come running in, slipping her arms around him from behind, and nearly giving him a heart attack.</p><p>He was in lust\u2014if not love\u2014with Jenny. There was something about her, an aura of film noir seductress. She had Lana Turner dark brown hair that swept over her forehead, and she wore rich dark shades of lipstick. Today, she was in tight-fitting jeans and a cotton tailored shirt that reminded him of Marilyn Monroe.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he said, standing and allowing her to slide into his arms. His voice was a little tremulous, his muscles a little unsteady. \u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d he asked, glancing back toward the door. Black Box Cinema was closed on Sundays; every other night of the week, a film noir movie played at 8:00 p.m. precisely. Or there might be more recent a movie influenced by the director\u2019s vision of film noir. The cinema was owned by Alistair\u2019s father, special effects whiz Eddie Archer, and stood just off Sunset Boulevard in the Los Feliz area. Eddie also owned the adjacent studio, and both buildings were situated on two acres surrounded by a very old cemetery.</p><p>Eddie Archer had bought the property twenty years ago when he started his special-effects business. For the previous five decades, the now-defunct Claymore Illusions had operated from the massive warehouse-style building in back. The company had been founded by the first Lucas Claymore and continued by his son, who\u2019d eventually sold the place. All Eddie had needed to do was update it to create Archer\u2019s Wizardry and Effects. While his artists and artisans sometimes found the cinema next door a bit annoying, with tourists parking here and there and everywhere, Eddie was adamant that it would stay. He loved film noir, and having his own cinema meant he could watch his favorite old movies on the big screen to his heart\u2019s content. He made them available to the public as a way of sharing his passion, infecting others with his personal enthusiasm.</p><p>An underground tunnel\u2014now a museum featuring posed mannequins in famous scenes from film noir and selected classic movies from the \u201940s and \u201950s\u2014connected the cinema and the studio. But the main doors to the studio, which were next door and about fifty feet behind the parking lot, remained locked and guarded. During production, the studio often went into lockdown, as it was now.</p><p>Lockdown was for secrecy as well as security. No one wanted a big-budget movie\u2019s effects and surprises out on the internet before the movie reached the screen. Archer\u2019s Wizardry and Effects was busy creating the costumes and creatures for The Unholy, the next remake to come to the silver screen.</p> <p>The Unholy was actually an updated version of Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum. Unlike remakes that simply remade an old film, like Psycho, The Unholy used the same characters and situations, but cast them in a contemporary light.</p><p>Sam Stone now had a cell phone and a computer.</p><p>Alistair was happy that the studio had the momentous task of bringing the film up-to-date, and he knew the effects would be splendid, but he still wasn\u2019t sure about a remake. In his opinion, some things were better off left alone. Film noir didn\u2019t really fit with computers and cell phones.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Alistair asked as the film wound on and the projector clicked, clicked, clicked. \u201cHow did you get in?\u201d Alistair had keys to the studio, to the doors that separated the underground tunnel from the studio, and to the Black Box Cinema. His father trusted him completely.</p><p>He hated to betray that trust in any way. Even for Jenny. But he\u2019d brought Jenny in with him before. It wasn\u2019t unusual that she\u2019d come; it was unusual that she\u2019d been able to just slip in.</p><p>She touched his cheek and smiled seductively. At twenty-two, his senior by a year, she already had the moves\u2014as well as the appearance\u2014of a femme fatale down pat. She eased away, flicking back the strands of hair that had hidden her eyes. \u201cYou left the front door open, silly,\u201d she told him. \u201cI started to knock, but...it was open.\u201d She grinned, and looked more like any other young Hollywood hopeful. \u201cThe rest of the place is tight as a drum, but my dear, darling, responsible Alistair, believe it or not, you left the front door open.\u201d She paused to give him a charming pout. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to call you. You didn\u2019t answer your cell.\u201d</p><p>He had to wonder what it was about one person that could turn the senses of another upside down. The senses and the sanity. Yes, Jenny was beautiful and perfect, but...it was Hollywood. The stunning, the perfect and the beautiful all walked about, ever hopeful, some willing to do whatever it took to get where they wanted to go, others starry-eyed and naive. He was the son of one of the most respected men in the movie business, and he suspected Jenny hung on to him because of what she thought he could do for her.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, and the tone of his voice was annoyingly husky. She knew she sent his libido off the charts, and he hated the pathetic puppy-dog tail-wagging demeanor he must put forth when she was around. \u201cI was watching the movie. It\u2019s my favorite. Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum. I really love the film, and the special effects for it were actually done here, when the place was still Claymore Illusions.\u201d That fact added to the pride his father took in securing the special-effects contract for The Unholy.</p> <p>Jenny shook her head. \u201cSilly boy, living in the past! Except, of course...\u201d</p><p>The production company was trying to keep the information about the Sam Stone remake quiet, but of course the rumor mill was already on the case. The company had neither rejected nor affirmed the claim. Rumors and anticipation could give a film a tremendous box-office advantage.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, why are you here?\u201d Alistair asked.</p><p>Despite her imitation of classic Hollywood vamps, Jenny was not a fan of film noir, or any other \u201cold\u201d movies. She loved silly modern-day romances and adventure flicks, the kind with \u00fcberbuff heroes who lived exciting adventures and saved the world.</p><p>She threw her head back and touched her hair again, one of her moves calculated to be uncalculatedly sexy.</p><p>\u201cI heard the studio\u2019s locked down!\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut not to the son of Eddie Archer!\u201d</p><p>He groaned aloud. \u201cJenny, you know it\u2019s not just my dad. It\u2019s the movie studio, the producers, the directors\u2014they don\u2019t want information on pictures or anything on costumes and effects getting out.\u201d</p><p>She gave him her pout again. She did it very well, making a little moue of hurt. \u201cAlistair, you know I\u2019d never tell a soul what I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019d never tell a soul I was even in there. But they\u2019re still casting for extras\u2014extras who might wind up with speaking roles. If I had a feel for what was going on, it would help me immensely. Please?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. Jenny always did pay up. If he took her through the studio, he\u2019d be rewarded that night.</p><p>He was pretty sure she\u2019d learned her lovemaking from the movies\u2014dirty ones, at that. She was vocal; she liked to crawl on top and twist around like a voodoo queen dancing around a pole.</p><p>\u201cYou have a key to the studio,\u201d she said.</p><p>He groaned again. \u201cIf I tried to go in with a guest, old Colin Bailey, who\u2019s on guard at the reception desk, would push his alarm button and every cop in the area would appear,\u201d he said. Colin Bailey had worked for his father for the full twenty years he\u2019d owned the studio\u2014which was most of Alistair\u2019s life. He was like a fixture, dedicated to the studio. And during lockdown, he was fierce.</p><p>She moved closer to him. \u201cI realize we can\u2019t go in by the front but we can sneak in because you have a key and the pass code to get there through the tunnel door. And Colin Bailey would never see us, because you know right where the cameras are so we can avoid them.\u201d</p><p>Almost involuntarily he felt his left pocket. He did have the keys. But he\u2019d told her the truth. Colin Bailey would report Alistair to his father without blinking an eye.</p><p>She shimmied up against him, her body pressed to his in just the right way to elicit an immediate response. Her perfect breasts\u2014albeit made that way with some saline enhancement\u2014were firm against his chest and her groin pushed against his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He forgot his father completely. He also forgot the danger\u2014and the fact that he was being used.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. Now his voice was flat-out hoarse. \u201cWe\u2019ll go by the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. She rose up on her toes and brought her lips to his and did things with her tongue that nearly made him climax on the spot. Then she stepped back. \u201cThat was a little promise of things to come!\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. He couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>He turned around. On the screen, Dianna Breen was screaming. She was being chased by the Egyptian robe-clad murderer, who was forcing her deeper and deeper into the museum.</p><p>Alistair stumbled through the audience chairs to the back. He entered the old lobby, where wine and beer were sold, along with various forms of high-end movie snack food. To the far left of the lobby were a few offices and conference rooms, and at the back of his father\u2019s favorite little meeting room was a door, nominally hidden by a movie poster.</p><p>\u201cOooh, this is like a high-tech spy adventure!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing high-tech about it,\u201d he said as guilt clashed with the near-desperate desire she elicited. \u201cIt\u2019s a movie poster covering a door.\u201d</p> <p>She was pressed to his back. Desire won out over guilt.</p><p>Alistair swept the canvas poster to the side, dug in his pocket and twisted the key in the lock, fumbling for a moment as he did so.</p><p>There were auxiliary lights set into the steps that led down to the tunnel; on the days that the small museum was open, before and after movies were screened, the stairway and the landing would be ablaze with light. But tonight, no one was expected.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he warned Jenny.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d she said.</p><p>Alistair walked slowly down the steps, ever aware of her sweet-smelling presence behind him. He reached the landing. He\u2019d never been here before when there was no illumination except the emergency lighting. It changed the entire appearance of the place.</p> <p>The museum\u2019s first scene was from The Maltese Falcon. Humphrey Bogart sat at his desk while femme fatale Mary Astor leaned toward him and a creepy Peter Lorre hovered off to the side. They were all caught in shadow, and even Bogie looked dangerous, ready to strangle Mary Astor. Across from that tableau, Orson Welles as the title character in Citizen Kane stood by the breakfast table, angry after ignoring Ruth Warrick, who played his first wife. The old mannequins, created in the mid-50s by the previous owner\u2019s special-effects studio, had been works of love, and in the dim red light and shadows, Alistair could almost believe that Orson Welles was about to speak angrily, his patience finally snapping him from the ennui of his marriage. Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake were together next, in a scene from The Glass Key, and then there were Dana Andrews, Vincent Price and Gene Tierney in Laura. The hall was long, and the exhibits were plentiful. A slim wooden barrier separated the walkway from the exhibits, and visitors could push buttons, which would let them hear the audio from the scene they were witnessing, along with information about the actors, producers, writers and directors. That night, to Alistair, all the characters looked as if they could speak without benefit of electronics.</p><p>Bogie made another appearance, with Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca; he was saying goodbye in front of the plane that would take her away. Bogie gripped Ingrid by the shoulders, and the emotion between them\u2014and the greater good of the war effort, the sacrifice required\u2014seemed palpable.</p><p>Toward the end of the hallway, Alistair stopped.</p><p>The scene was taken from the movie he had been watching that night, Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum.</p><p>There was hard-boiled Sam Stone, played by the ill-fated Jon de la Torre, arriving just a little too late in the fictional museum\u2019s \u201cHall of the Pharaohs.\u201d And there was the empty sarcophagus, and nearby, the man clad in the robes, his hands around the throat of femme fatale Dianna Breen, played by the equally ill-fated Audrey Grant. Snakes\u2014Egyptian cobras\u2014abounded on the floor, and Sam would have to make his way through them if he was to have any chance of saving Dianna.</p><p>Alistair stared at the scene and blinked; he could have sworn he saw one of the snakes move.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jenny said, pushing against his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Alistair asked, distracted. He kept staring at the tableau.</p> <p>\u201cThe door is open. The door to the studio is open!\u201d she told him, speaking softly.</p><p>He turned to look down to the end of the hallway. The door into the basement of the special-effects studio stood ajar. He frowned; it should have been locked. His father and upper-level management were adamant about the rules when it came to lockdown.</p><p>He glanced at Jenny. For a moment she seemed to look like every femme fatale who had ever graced a movie screen. There was something wrong here. He was being played, he thought, really played. Perhaps punked. There could be cameras somewhere that he didn\u2019t know about and other people ready to break into laughter. Yes, he was a fool, ready to do anything for a woman\u2019s touch. And, as in so many film noir scenarios, the woman was luring him to his doom. At least that was how it felt in his fearful and overheated imagination.</p><p>But there was something else about the night, the way the tableau seemed alive. Something that sent a chill raking his bones.</p><p>He warned Jenny with a glance that he was wise to the situation.</p><p>But when he started through the door to the studio he heard Jenny scream.</p><p>When he turned around, he was so stunned that at first his jaw just dropped.</p><p>The robed killer\u2014the evil priest, Amun Mopat\u2014had come down from the Sam Stone tableau. The thing seemed to have no face. There was only blackness where a face should have been. He, it, stood behind Jenny, and seemed to be staring at him, but it had no eyes....</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d He wanted to scream. The sound came out like a croak.</p><p>An act. It had to be part of an act.</p><p>A hand appeared, brandishing a long knife.</p><p>It was a special-effects studio, for God\u2019s sake! Someone was playing a game, he told himself, maybe even at his father\u2019s request. Maybe his dad had suspected him of doing something like this, hoping for a hot night with his girlfriend....</p><p>The knife looked very real.</p><p>\u201cHey, enough! Let her go!\u201d Alistair said, willing his feet to move toward Jenny and her costumed attacker.</p><p>Jenny was no movie femme fatale. She implored him, her blue eyes wide and filled with terror. \u201cAlistair!\u201d His name was a shriek of panic.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d he roared again.</p><p>Then he stood dead still. The thing attacked and, with a hard, quick motion, drew the blade across Jenny\u2019s throat. Blood didn\u2019t merely leak from the wound; it spurted. Her scream died in choking sounds that accompanied the blood, and it was cut off within seconds.</p><p>There was a scent in the air. Hot and tinny and fetid.</p><p>Because it wasn\u2019t stage blood being spewed.</p><p>The costumed form dropped Jenny and moved toward Alistair.</p><p>He\u2019d spent his life among the creepy and the macabre, the greatest movie heroes and most terrifying villains. Monsters, vampires, ghosts, alien slime...</p><p>But something within him\u2014logic, reason\u2014turned off, his terror was so great.</p><p>And he fell toward the floor as blackness seemed to overwhelm his vision.</p><p>He fell into a pool of blood. And he knew, from its smell, that no, it wasn\u2019t part of any special effect.</p><p>It was Jenny\u2019s death, all bloody. Bloody, and real.</p><p>Vengeance.</p><p>In Hollywood, every character needed a name.</p><p>Vengeance was a good name.</p><p>And so Vengeance stood hidden, watching, feeling such a sense of glee, it was almost frightening. The scent of blood remained; the first few minutes after the scene were all but imprinted on the moving reels of memory.</p><p>Most people would consider the act, and Vengeance, crazy. Stone-cold crazy. But that wasn\u2019t the case. Crazy could not have worked out all the technicalities and the precise timing that had been necessary.</p><p>Crazy could not have figured out everything that was needed to pull off the stunt.</p><p>Crazy could never act it all out, as it must now be acted out....</p><p>But it had gone better than could possibly be imagined. The girl...the blood.</p><p>And Alistair Archer, slipping, falling, knocking himself out.</p><p>Then waking, screaming...racing to the guard station.</p><p>And now...the blare of sirens in the street.</p><p>Cops would soon be crawling all over the place. But the cops would never suspect. Because the cops didn\u2019t know the studio, and the cops didn\u2019t know the past, and the cops would never recognize the brilliance that was bringing it all to fruition.</p><p>Ah, tomorrow!</p><p>Tomorrow...</p><p>Tomorrow, Vengeance would become normal, ordinary, once again. Vengeance would throw off the assumption of superpersonality, sympathize, go about day-to-day business....</p><p>And no one would ever, ever know.</p><p>Not in this lifetime.</p><p>Vengeance smiled, and Vengeance actually laughed aloud in the night; no matter, because Vengeance couldn\u2019t be heard.</p><p>It was all too good to be true....</p><p>Time to move, but Vengeance needed to savor the moment. Alone in the dark, watching...</p><p>Vengeance was good, and vengeance was sweet.</p><p>And Vengeance had just begun.</p><p>1</p><p>Madison Darvil wasn\u2019t really awake when the phone rang. She was in that delightful stage of half sleep, when the alarm had gone off...but the snooze button was on and she had a few minutes to lie lazily in the comfort of her bed before rising. Her phone was loud and strident. She rolled over groping for it, swearing softly as it dropped to the floor and she had to lean down to get it, banging her head on the bedside table.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d she muttered, and was further humiliated when she realized she\u2019d hit Answer as she\u2019d picked up the phone\u2014and the caller had heard her.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she said frowning. Seven thirty-three. Who was calling this early?</p><p>She could hear a soft chuckle, and then someone clearing his throat. \u201cMadison?\u201d</p><p>Inwardly, she groaned.</p><p>\u201cYes, Alfie?\u201d Alfie Longdale was her assistant at the studio. She loved the fact that she had an assistant and she loved Alfie. One day, he was going to rule the world, his eye for detail was so exceptional. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come in this morning. In fact, you can\u2019t come in.\u201d</p><p>Her heart seemed to sink to her knees. Had someone suddenly decided she was really a fake? That, despite her training, degree and experience, she was just a kid who played at working on the movies?</p><p>\u201cWhat...what\u2014?\u201d</p> <p>Alfie\u2019s voice became hushed. \u201cThere was a murder last night! In the tunnel. Lord, Madison, Alistair Archer was arrested for murder! Some little starlet he had the hots for\u2014they say her throat was slit from ear to ear. She\u2019s dead, Madison. And Eddie Archer\u2019s kid is saying that an Egyptian mummy\u2014you know, the priest in the original Sam Stone movie, a monster\u2014came down from one of the tableaux to commit the bloody carnage!\u201d</p><p>Alfie was being dramatic. He was dramatic. But right now, what he\u2019d said wasn\u2019t registering.</p><p>A mummy? A monster? Alfie had to be making it up. Monsters were what they did, what they created, quite frequently. Well, superheroes, giant rats for commercials, cute little pigs and other such creatures. But horror was big; horror movies could be reasonable in cost and make massive amounts of money.</p><p>\u201cAlfie, is this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It is not some kind of joke. It is not a movie script. Madison, it\u2019s real. A woman was killed in our tunnel. Anyway, the crime scene units are there today, and Eddie Archer\u2019s closed the entire place. No one goes in until the police have finished with the tunnel, the security tapes, the studio\u2014you name it. Anyway, I was up last night when it all hit the news. And Eddie Archer looked white\u2014I mean, white as a ghost!\u2014when they showed him on film. He said he wants the police to have complete access to everything because he\u2019s going to find out what really happened\u2014his son is not a murderer!\u201d</p> <p>Alfie was telling the truth. As shocking as it was, she knew he was telling the truth.</p><p>Madison felt her heart break for Eddie Archer. He was such a good man.</p><p>Alistair was a good kid, too. Could he have snapped and killed someone?</p><p>No.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t accept that. He was too nice and decent, even shy.</p><p>\u201cA monster,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou mean\u2014the Egyptian priest, the killer from Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly! Is that movie stuff or what? Everyone suspects The Unholy is a remake of that movie, but most people don\u2019t know for sure. And now, right in front of that tableau...a real murder! Anyway, I thought I\u2019d call because if you show up at work, you\u2019ll be sent home. This way, you might be able to get some more sleep.\u201d</p><p>Madison wrinkled her face at the phone, as if she could convey her expression to Alfie. What? Go back to sleep now?</p><p>\u201cThanks, Alfie. Thanks for letting me know. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get tons of extra sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep me posted if you hear more,\u201d Alfie said. He seemed not to notice her sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d she said, and ended the call.</p><p>She crawled out of bed, drawing an indignant meow from Ichabod, curled up at the foot of the bed. \u201cSorry, my friend,\u201d she told the cat, hurrying out to the parlor of her old rented bungalow and switching on the TV, going from channel to channel until she found a news station covering the murder.</p><p>The information Alfie had given her was true. The news showed the crime tape blocking off the cinema and the studio, then cut to an earlier interview with Eddie Archer in front of the courthouse. He denied his son\u2019s culpability, and swore that he\u2019d learn the truth behind the shocking murder.</p><p>Mike Greenwood, creative head of the studio and Madison\u2019s supervisor, stood beside him. When Eddie finished speaking, Mike stepped up to the microphone. He reasserted what Eddie had said, that the truth would be discovered and, while Alistair had been arraigned for the murder, the D.A.\u2019s office had acted only on what appeared to be the case\u2014not what was. They would work toward his release, and by the middle or end of the week, when the police had gone over every inch of the place, Archer\u2019s Wizardry and Effects would be back in business. They would move forward with their various projects while the investigation continued. Mike spoke so earnestly, he silenced the spate of questions that should have arisen. He seemed concerned, but in control.</p> <p>Mike was a steady man, excellent in stressful situations. Whenever they were on a tight deadline, Mike was the one who calmed down everyone at the studio, assuring them that, step by step, they\u2019d get it all done.</p><p>Eddie had acted with his usual composure, but Madison felt so sorry for him.</p><p>Eddie, nearing fifty, was still fit, but his face bore the tension of sorrow. As Alfie had said, he looked white as a sheet. He\u2019d run his fingers through his graying hair repeatedly as he spoke, his words calm but determined.</p><p>She was still staring at the TV in disbelief when her phone rang again. She\u2019d left it in the bedroom, and raced to retrieve it, thinking it would be Mike Greenwood giving her the message that Alfie had already conveyed.</p><p>Her \u201cHello?\u201d was breathless.</p><p>\u201cMadison?\u201d</p><p>The caller wasn\u2019t Mike Greenwood. It was Eddie Archer himself.</p><p>\u201cEddie!\u201d she said. \u201cOh, Eddie, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlistair didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that, Eddie. With my whole heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet.</p><p>\u201cI heard not to come in, Eddie,\u201d Madison said. \u201cAlfie called me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Madison, I do want you to come in. I have a friend arriving\u2014a film effects artist I worked with years ago. He\u2019s a member of the FBI now, and he\u2019s going to handle a special investigation for me. I\u2019d like you to meet with him, show him around the studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I thought it was closed down, other than for the police?\u201d FBI? How had he gotten the FBI involved? She wasn\u2019t savvy about law enforcement, but she\u2019d always assumed the FBI only came in for serial killers or kidnapping or crimes that spanned several states.</p><p>And how the hell did a special-effects artist wind up in the FBI?</p><p>And, oh, God, why had Eddie chosen her?</p><p>She knew exactly why Eddie had chosen her. He\u2019d never challenged her, he\u2019d never forced her into a corner over this. But he believed\u2014had reason to believe\u2014that she talked to the dead.</p><p>\u201cThe police closed the Black Box Cinema. But I closed the studio. And Sean\u2014Sean Cameron\u2014won\u2019t be here until this afternoon. I just talked to him in the wee hours of the morning and he\u2019s coming from Virginia. I\u2019m picking him up myself, so I\u2019ll swing by for you after I\u2019ve collected him from LAX. If that\u2019s all right with you.\u201d</p><p>Madison exhaled on a long breath. The man she had hero-worshipped for his artistry throughout her formative years was asking for her help. The same man who\u2019d hired her and opened up a world that she\u2019d only dreamed of knowing.</p><p>\u201cEddie, I would do anything for you,\u201d she assured him humbly. \u201cAnd for Alistair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I think you\u2019re the right person to work with Sean. And I deeply appreciate your friendship\u2014for Alistair and me. You can expect me around five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she murmured lamely.</p><p>Eddie wasn\u2019t ready to hang up. \u201cAlistair didn\u2019t do it\u2014he really didn\u2019t.\u201d He was quiet for a minute. \u201cHe told me that the Egyptian priest, Amun Mopat, came down from the Sam Stone tableau, and killed her. Alistair tried to reach Jenny, but slipped in the blood, conked himself out...and then came to and saw it was real\u2014he was lying in a pool of blood. I guess it\u2019s normal for the police to think that either he\u2019s crazy or his story is and that he\u2019s going to try for an insanity plea. But I know my son. I know he didn\u2019t do it. And only someone who\u2019s familiar with the studio can prove he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Hollywood\u2014a place filled with actors and effects,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Eddie agreed, sounding bitter. \u201cBut, oddly enough, I believe we\u2019re the only ones who see the possibility that Alistair didn\u2019t do it. Anyway, Madison, I\u2019ll be by for you. If you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to show your guy around the museum, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>Eddie Archer ended the call. Madison sank down into her art deco\u2013style sofa, setting her phone on the coffee table in front of it.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Madison nearly leaped a mile into the air at the sound of the voice. Her hand fluttered to her throat; her heart thudded.</p><p>She turned and saw the man who\u2019d spoken, standing just behind her.</p><p>The voice was soft. The man was slight, with dark graying hair and a wonderful face filled with character.</p><p>She let out a breath. Her sometime-resident \u201cinvisible\u201d friend\u2014whether extension of her imagination or real ghost\u2014was seated on the arm of the sofa, looking at her sorrowfully.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, kid?\u201d</p><p>She let out a breath, realizing that the very concept of someone being murdered where she worked was terrifying.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It would help if you didn\u2019t startle me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke quietly. And I\u2019m not exactly a surprise now, Madison, am I?\u201d</p><p>No, not anymore.</p><p>She could see him plain as day, as if he were flesh and blood, a good friend who\u2019d stopped by in a time of need. He had a fascinating, ruggedly masculine face\u2014including his slightly scarred lip\u2014and a lean, slight form. When he stood, he was on the short side at only five feet eight inches.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just stunned,\u201d Madison said. Then she rushed into words, well aware of how ridiculous she\u2019d look if anyone else was there\u2014because she saw Humphrey Bogart as he sat in her living room. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much you hear or fathom from phone conversations, but there was a murder at the studio last night. A starlet who was with Alistair Archer. I can\u2019t believe he killed her. I won\u2019t believe it\u2014not Alistair. Eddie must be beside himself, desperate to help him. He\u2019s such a loving father.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWatching a child suffer is a hard thing,\u201d Bogie said, his voice low and slightly nasal.</p><p>Bogie.</p><p>Madison stared at him. Was he an imaginary friend? She would never be sure. She\u2019d had strange experiences as a child. She\u2019d tried chalking them up to growing pains, teenage angst and, as her parents had suggested, an overactive imagination\u2014the kind that had led her right into a career. She\u2019d also had experiences that had broken her heart\u2014and might be part of the reason she embraced her work, day in and day out.</p> <p>Bogie hadn\u2019t come with the bungalow, though he\u2019d lived there briefly in the 1920s. He\u2019d told her once that he had loved it and loved living there. She\u2019d first met him at the wax museum when she was a college student; she\u2019d assumed he was a look-alike actor hired to play the part. They\u2019d spoken and laughed together....</p><p>And he\u2019d followed her home.</p><p>Bogie showed up whenever he wanted to. Apparently he had other places to haunt, as well. Madison simply accepted him as a friend\u2014imaginary though he might be. Sometimes she thought she was crazy; sometimes she thought she was incredibly lucky that such a man had chosen her to haunt. Although she believed that now, she hadn\u2019t always. He\u2019d scared her to death at first, and had occasionally made her life hell.</p><p>He\u2019d just startled her today; the first night she\u2019d seen him sitting on her sofa, however, he\u2019d practically given her a heart attack. She\u2019d fumbled to call the police, and they\u2019d come and almost arrested her, assuming she was another college kid trying to make trouble. Bogie had been apologetic and courteous\u2014so sorry for causing her distress. He was what he was, and he\u2019d tried to explain, but she hadn\u2019t believed him.</p><p>Maybe he was imaginary, but she didn\u2019t know what part of her mind triggered his appearances.</p> <p>And if he was, what about the other dead people who\u2019d spoken to her?</p><p>But imaginary or not, he was there for her now.</p><p>\u201cHave some coffee, kid. That\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure it will help me feel better. But at least it\u2019ll wake me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waking up for? You could go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it that everyone thinks I can sleep now?\u201d she muttered.</p> <p>Bogie ignored that, standing and stretching as he gazed out the windows. He turned to look at her. \u201cThe murder took place in the studio?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThe underground tunnel between the Black Box Cinema and the studio\u2014where Archer has his film noir museum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Bogie mused. \u201cBy which display?\u201d</p><p>Madison frowned. \u201cThe news didn\u2019t say, but Alfie told me it was by the tableau for Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum. Sounds crazy, doesn\u2019t it? I mean, especially since the studio is now in lockdown because of The Unholy\u2014the Sam Stone remake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot has been crazy in Hollywood through the years. You\u2019ve heard about the case of the Black Dahlia? Poor girl, tortured and then displayed, chopped right in two,\u201d Bogie said, shaking his head. \u201cThere\u2019s always been murder out here\u2014and out here, it becomes sensational, with more emphasis on the drama than the tragedy. You had Fatty Arbuckle and the murder of Virginia Rappe back in 1921, and later, you had the Manson murders and then the Simpson murders, and anytime anyone\u2019s killed here, the press is out looking for every sordid detail.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI watch the news, you know,\u201d he told her seriously, \u201cas well as old comedy reruns. And, kid, this is a big place full of illusion. Murder isn\u2019t confined to Tinseltown, but there\u2019s no way it\u2019s not going to occur here, too.\u201d</p><p>Madison nodded absently. She glanced over at Bogie and wondered sometimes why he didn\u2019t haunt some of the other places he\u2019d loved. And some of the people... He\u2019d told her once, though, \u201cThey can\u2019t see me. I can\u2019t reach them. So it just hurts, kid. It just hurts.\u201d And he\u2019d grinned at her. \u201cYou reply when I speak to you and I like that. It\u2019s why I keep coming back, kid.\u201d</p><p>And now, most of the time, she was glad. Very glad.</p><p>\u201cSam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum,\u201d Bogie said. \u201cI could\u2019ve been in that movie. I think I was busy at the time. Something else going on. Might have been Casablanca. Yeah, probably. That was 1942. Anyway, I always thanked God I wasn\u2019t on that set, because there was a death back then\u2014and it might have been a murder, too.\u201d</p> <p>Madison tried to see if she could remember her Hollywood lore and legend well enough to recall a murder that had happened during the making of Sam Stone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall ever seeing anything about it\u2014in any of the lurid books about true Hollywood murders or on any of the history or entertainment channels,\u201d she said.</p><p>Bogie joined her on the couch again. Watching him, she hid a smile. He seemed to sit differently from other people she knew. He was relaxed, and still, somehow appeared proper.</p><p>\u201cIt was 1942. The war effort was in full swing. Movies were being made to encourage heroism\u2014or to try and divert the public from the war. Casablanca,\u201d he said, and grew thoughtful. \u201cAh, that was a good one for me. There was some great writing on that movie. I wish some of those lines had been my own. That and The African Queen...some of those were my ad-libs. And both of them gave me a persona to live up to.\u201d He paused and looked at her with his famous lopsided grin. \u201cAnyway, I digress, kid. And I\u2019m talking out of line. The death of Pete Krakowski was never officially called a murder. No real inquiries were made, no one was investigated and no one was arrested. There were just rumors on the set, rumors that traveled around. Gotta remember, back then, the studios were king, and they were powerful. Krakowski\u2019s death was seen as a tragic accident, and that\u2019s the way it went. It was long ago and in the middle of a world war, and it wasn\u2019t particularly noted at the time\u2014he was a bit player, not a big star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did Krakowski die?\u201d Madison asked, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cThere was some kind of fault with the wiring. He was electrocuted. From what I understood, he was fooling around on set before the filming was to start, and then he was dead. Fried,\u201d Bogie said, shaking his head sadly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing a remake of that movie\u2014and I never even heard about it. Why do you say it might\u2019ve been a murder?\u201d Madison asked.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear about it because there were accidents on sets from time to time. Krakowski wasn\u2019t the only film person who died that you\u2019ve probably never heard of\u2014no internet back then. You just heard about these things if they happened to a major star or if someone was killed by a lover or a spouse.\u201d He cocked his head toward her. \u201cBit player, and what was deemed an accident. Nothing sensational about it, and Krakowski was hardly a household name. Like I said, no way for every little piece of news to be known across the country back then. No Twitter, no Facebook and no Google.\u201d He was quiet for a minute. \u201cI woulda liked a Facebook page,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cActually, there are several devoted to you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut why would someone suspect it was murder? It sounds like an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew the key grip and the lead electrician on that film. They were the best in the business. If they were working the rigging and electric, both were safe.\u201d Bogie waved a hand. \u201cAnyway, Krakowski\u2019s death is a far cry from a starlet being sliced up in the tunnel. A far cry, indeed.\u201d He leaned back, nostalgic. \u201cI remember that old cinema from way back. Played silent films, even before my time. It\u2019s a shame, a damned shame. That Eddie Archer has a real appreciation for the past\u2014this shouldn\u2019t have happened on his property. Shouldn\u2019t have happened to the poor girl, either.\u201d</p><p>Madison realized that she\u2019d been feeling sorry for and worried about Eddie Archer and his son, Alistair. She\u2019d almost forgotten the victim.</p><p>Was that how it had been when the death had occurred during the original filming?</p><p>\u201cLord,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re right. The poor girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Hollywood for you,\u201d Bogie said. \u201cIt\u2019ll steal your soul, if not your life. There\u2019ve been so many who came here with such dreams and wound up dead. Christa Helm, Dorothy Stratton, Dominique Dunne, Elizabeth Short or the Black Dahlia, Sharon Tate. Peg Entwhistle, the only one to really jump from the Hollywood sign. I remember that,\u201d Bogie said. \u201cShe found her fame in death. And we may never find out what really happened to Marilyn Monroe.\u201d He paused. \u201cDid you know the young woman who was killed?\u201d</p><p>Madison nodded, then shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t say I knew her. I met her a few times when she was with Alistair and once at an office party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou work too much, kid. You\u2019ve gotta remember, none of it\u2019s worth anything if you don\u2019t have a life.\u201d</p><p>Madison arched a brow and refrained from reminding him that the last time she\u2019d brought a date home, she\u2019d acted like an idiot because Bogie had been watching something on her television and had said, \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, kid.\u201d He loved TV. He couldn\u2019t do a lot on the physical plane, but he could manage such simple tasks as pushing buttons on the remote control. He adored old sitcoms and liked to keep up with the television news.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be some information on Krakowski\u2019s death,\u201d she said, returning to their previous topic.</p><p>\u201cThere was\u2014one newspaper article. No follow-up. He died. It was sad. He was buried. And that was that. I\u2019m sure many of us thought about it back then. But time goes by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so horrible. For the poor girl, yes, of course. And for everyone who will be touched by it.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAlistair really loves his dad. He didn\u2019t usually bring people to the studio. I mean, I don\u2019t know what went on before\u2014I\u2019ve been there for about three years now. But as far as I can tell, Alistair respects the studio. And he loves film. He wants to get into directing rather than special effects, but...although I didn\u2019t really know Jenny Henderson, I saw the way Alistair followed her around like a puppy dog. He had a huge crush on her. I can\u2019t believe he would\u2019ve killed anyone. And I especially can\u2019t believe he would\u2019ve hurt Jenny. He was crazy about her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bogie shook his head sadly. \u201cSometimes I think it might have been better back in the bad old days when we were contract players for the major studios. Now, the young and the beautiful come out here willing to do anything for stardom. Anything. Can\u2019t help wondering what Jenny Henderson did\u2014or was willing to do. Or maybe her dreams had nothing to do with her death. Maybe she was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d</p><p>The wrong place at the wrong time. How could that be possible? The studio was in lockdown. There should have been no one with access to the museum\u2014other than Alistair, Eddie and some of the department heads.</p><p>She winced inwardly.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t look good for Eddie Archer. And it sure didn\u2019t look good for Alistair.</p><p>\u201cSam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum,\u201d Bogie said. \u201cYou know, the costuming and effects for that movie were done where you work. The place was Claymore Illusions back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Madison told him. \u201cThat\u2019s why it seemed so perfect that the studio was hired for the remake. I think the fact that the place was used for creating props, costumes, illusions and whatever was needed for film noir is half the reason Eddie Archer loves it so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie appears to be a talented man with a real appreciation for the past,\u201d Bogie said, not for the first time.</p><p>Madison let out a little cry, startled as something pounced onto the sofa beside her. She laughed at herself.</p> <p>As if he knew she was upset and needed some warmth, Ichabod meowed and settled his furry body next to hers.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Bogie said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right. Don\u2019t go getting all jumpy on me now.\u201d</p><p>Madison forced a smile despite feeling a sense of dread.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t going to be all right.</p><p>Sean Cameron arrived in L.A. in the afternoon, when the sun seemed to spray down light like a fountain, and the bustle of the city was as frantic as ever. This might be Tinseltown, and massive movie deals might be taking place in any coffee shop, but it was also where he\u2019d learned that it was often the B-lister who had to put on pretensions, and where the working moguls could be as down-to-earth as their gardeners.</p><p>Such was the case with Eddie Archer.</p> <p>Sean had spent five formative years working under Archer. The man was a genius when it came to creating creatures and special effects. To this day, Eddie loathed straight CGI or computer-generated imagery. Of course, effects were effects, but in Eddie\u2019s view, to create what looked real, you had to start with something real. Thanks to Archer, Sean had learned a great deal about physical illusion as well as computer-generated magic. He\u2019d worked with Eddie in many capacities, learning to create costumes and attachments, build creatures, as well as work with computers.</p><p>Archer certainly enjoyed his income and the fact that he was customarily sought out by the most important and influential names in the business. But above all, he still loved his art, and he loved sharing that excitement and enthusiasm with promising young artists, wide-eyed and in awe of the chance to work for him.</p><p>Sean had gotten a frantic call from Archer an hour before he\u2019d gotten the call from Logan Raintree, head of their Krewe of Hunters unit, telling him he\u2019d received an official request that they be brought in. He assumed that Eddie Archer had used his influence with someone above the local police and even the state police, because just when he\u2019d been about to tell Logan Raintree that he had to go to L.A. one way or another, Raintree had asked him to head out on the first flight and look into the situation.</p><p>\u201cRemember, if something\u2019s impossible\u2014then it\u2019s impossible,\u201d Logan had said. \u201cI know this man is an old friend of yours, a mentor. And I know you don\u2019t want his son to be guilty of murder. But our job isn\u2019t to hide things, fix things or help with creative defense mechanisms. Our job is to discover the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that, Logan,\u201d Sean had been quick to reply. He hadn\u2019t taken offense. Whenever a team member had any personal involvement in a case, it was important to note what priorities had to be maintained. He\u2019d gone on to say, \u201cBut I knew Alistair when he was a kid. Nice boy. He\u2019s trying to figure out how to be his father\u2019s son and his own man. And no, murder wouldn\u2019t be how he\u2019d plan to make his name. From what I understand from Eddie so far, the kid loved this girl. She used him, but he was crazy about her. And he\u2019s a basket case now. He was immediately arraigned, and he\u2019s out on bail\u2014Archer money and pull, I imagine\u2014but he\u2019s basically locked up, anyway. He\u2019s wearing an ankle monitor and he\u2019s at a mental hospital that deals with dangerous and suicidal clients. A posh place, I understand. Apparently it\u2019s where the A-listers go when there\u2019s some kind of serious question about rehab, sanity...or possibility of a criminal offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure this place is the best money can buy,\u201d Logan had said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Archer loves his kid,\u201d Sean had told him.</p><p>And Eddie Archer did love his one and only son. Married three times, Eddie Archie had just the one child. Alistair was the son of his first marriage, to Annie Smith, with whom he\u2019d grown up in Valencia, California. Annie had been a fledgling actress, but her first love had been her family. She\u2019d died when a vicious flu strain had swept through the world, shocking everyone with the deaths it had caused. Eddie had been absolutely bereft.</p> <p>And then lonely. And Alistair had been left without the mother who\u2019d adored him. Eddie made up for that the best he could; he was always there for his son.</p><p>But although Annie had been as sweet and dedicated to a man as a woman could be, Eddie hadn\u2019t had much luck with women since her death five and a half years ago. When he\u2019d married Benita Lowe two years after Annie\u2019s death, Sean had come to the wedding. He could have said right then that it wouldn\u2019t last. Benita had practically snatched the bill from the caterer\u2019s hand and had a few things to say about the cost of the reception. Turned out she wanted Eddie to save his money\u2014for her. That marriage had ended in a matter of months. A year ago, Eddie had given marriage another try, again with an actress, Helena LaRoux. Sean knew Helena; she\u2019d attended Eddie\u2019s second wedding with her third husband. Sean hadn\u2019t gone to that wedding. He\u2019d sent his best wishes to Eddie, hoping he was wrong in his judgment of Helena. They\u2019d had a few minutes to talk at Eddie\u2019s wedding to Benita, and he\u2019d discovered that Helena apparently thought Benita\u2019s then-husband was superior to her own, as far as contacts and possibilities went.</p><p>Sean heard a horn beep and when he saw Eddie\u2019s car across the divider realized he\u2019d been waiting in the wrong place, pretty sad considering the fact that he\u2019d lived in L.A. for five years and visited frequently ever since. He threw his garment bag over his shoulder and hurried over to slide into the passenger seat of Eddie\u2019s sporty little Ford hybrid.</p><p>\u201cHey, old friend,\u201d Eddie greeted him. \u201cI\u2019d give you a big man-hug, but they don\u2019t let you sit here long these days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust drive, my friend, drive,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Eddie nodded and focused his gaze on the road ahead and the insanity of LAX. \u201cThank you for coming,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAh, Eddie, you knew I\u2019d come if you called me.\u201d</p><p>Sean glanced at Eddie, who looked drawn and haggard, a lot older than his years. That was natural under the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re okay, Eddie? Okay to be driving around?\u201d</p><p>Eddie nodded gravely. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t risk your life\u2014or my own. Alistair needs me. I\u2019m strong. I know my son is innocent, and it has to be proven.\u201d</p><p>Eddie did seem rational and in control, driving like an expert as he maneuvered the complicated airport exit and the California highway system.</p><p>\u201cFrom special effects to the FBI?\u201d Eddie asked. He tried to smile. \u201cI still marvel at that. I was in shock when you told me. Guess it must be your ability to create giant man-eating rats against a green background.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, now,\u201d Sean said, trying to speak lightly. \u201cThey didn\u2019t just pluck me out of the studio, you know. All right, well, they did at first, but you remember I\u2019d done some work with Texas law enforcement groups. And now we\u2019ve gone through the training system at Quantico. My team and I, that is,\u201d he added. \u201cNone of us was FBI when we formed. But you must know something about my team, Eddie\u2014besides the little we\u2019ve exchanged in phone conversations. Because I got the call from our team leader not long after I talked to you.\u201d</p><p>Eddie nodded. \u201cEver since I was informed that my son was in a jail cell, covered in blood, I\u2019ve done nothing except rack my brains to figure out how we can prove that Alistair didn\u2019t do this\u2014that he couldn\u2019t have done it. I thought about you instantly, and the fact that you\u2019ve become part of an elite unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure they call us elite,\u201d Sean murmured.</p><p>\u201cSean, the cops have gone through the security tapes. There was no one in or out of the cinema or the studio, other than Alistair and Jenny Henderson. There were no cameras running in the museum. It was closed. The whole thing is impossible. I know Alistair didn\u2019t do it. My attorney is suggesting we consider an insanity plea...but Alistair isn\u2019t crazy. He didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Sean studied Eddie as he drove. The man was a father, desperate to save his son. Sean groaned inwardly; he hoped Eddie hadn\u2019t wanted the Krewe involved because he believed he had an old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 working with a group that was part of the federal government. Did he figure Sean might help with an insanity plea? It seemed to him that a good defense attorney could get a person off on insanity in a dozen different ways. The television made me do it. The voices in my head made me do it. A video game made me do it, a book made me do it. The ghosts living in the old Black Box Cinema did it, not me. And if you imagined that a ghost did it\u2014or made you do it\u2014was that as good as actual insanity?</p><p>\u201cEddie, a ghost\u2014or a creature\u2014didn\u2019t kill the girl. I mean, if you\u2019re hoping we can come up with the spirit of a dead noir actor, it\u2019s not going to fly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eddie looked at him, frowning. \u201cSean, I...I know that. I don\u2019t believe a ghost killed anyone, either. Can ghosts kill someone? Or if a ghost ever did kill anyone, wouldn\u2019t it be that guilt or fear or terror simply overwhelmed that person? Sean, trust me, I don\u2019t think a ghost killed Jenny Henderson. But someone did,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cSomeone who knows the studio. Whether it\u2019s someone working there now or not, I have no idea. The police checked out the security footage and said, Hey, cut and dried, no one in there that night except for the security guard\u2014who never moved. The guy didn\u2019t even take a piss until Alistair came running in to get him. Someone else was in that studio, Sean, and you know as well as anyone that what we see isn\u2019t always real, and that what looks real can be illusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Eddie,\u201d Sean said, feeling a little foolish. Was he a bit testy about being part of a unit that many questioned? The Ghostbusters of the FBI? They were still a new unit, and they\u2019d met all the members of the original Krewe, so they knew what they were up against. He\u2019d been involved in the case that had put this second group together, and it had been unusual, to say the least. But like most evil, it had come down to human greed and the horrible twists and turns the mind could take.</p><p>But...</p> <p>He\u2019d also learned that there were others like himself and his cousin Kelsey. Those who could hear voices and see visions of people who\u2019d departed the physical realm.</p><p>He\u2019d also gone through rigorous training. He was an excellent shot, should the need occur, even if he\u2019d always planned on living his life creating fantasy for entertainment purposes.</p><p>On both fronts, he\u2019d learned that perception was everything. They were dealing with a locked-room mystery, he thought. A classic puzzle, and every puzzle had a solution.</p><p>And Eddie had seen this, the key to vindicating his son.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been in the studio in years, Eddie,\u201d Sean reminded him.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I figured that, and some things have changed. Some storage has been moved around, but most of the structure is the same. Climate control or cold room, sewing section, construction\u2014those areas are all the same. Anyway, I\u2019ve asked one of my top young prot\u00e9g\u00e9es to be your guide. She\u2019ll take you through the studio, answer any of your questions. She\u2019s the perfect assistant for you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Why is she so perfect?\u201d</p><p>Eddie glanced his way before looking back at the road, somber and thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s a lot like you. She\u2019s quiet, doesn\u2019t say much about anything that affects her, but...well, she\u2019s either certifiable, crazy as a loon, or just like you. She talks to the dead.\u201d</p><p>2</p><p>Los Angeles County was known for its smog, but this afternoon was worse than usual. When Madison stepped outside to wait for Eddie Archer, she felt as though the day itself was in mourning for Jenny Henderson and the Archer family.</p> <p>It was just the beginning of summer, and in the past few days the sky had been powder-blue with wonderful puffs of snow-white clouds; today, a fog had rolled in from somewhere and joined with the pollution of the massively populated area. She almost expected to hear crows caw in warning while bats took flight across a darkening sky. Like something of a \u201950s horror movie...</p><p>Eddie Archer\u2019s little hybrid car pulling up in front of her place brought her back to reality.</p><p>Eddie pulled to the curb. A man slid out of the passenger seat watching her as she approached. He seemed to fit right in to the California scene. He was tall, wearing dark glasses, and appeared to be fit and athletic, with a lean muscled frame. She slipped her own sunglasses on; sunglasses camouflaged a multitude of sins, or so they said\u2014and allowed one to hide one\u2019s emotions.</p><p>As she reached the car, he extended a hand. \u201cSean Cameron, Ms. Darvil. Please, take the front. I\u2019ll get in behind you.\u201d He had a low, smooth, throaty voice that suited his physique. Bogie, she thought, would label him \u201ca man\u2019s man.\u201d There was a quality about him that conveyed an inner easy confidence. She sensed his compelling masculinity and realized that meeting him, just feeling his handshake, made her want to know him. She lowered her head for a swift moment, willing herself not to flush.</p><p>Why on earth was she instantly attracted to a man she\u2019d barely met?</p><p>She steeled herself mentally, disturbed and annoyed with her own thoughts. Eddie was troubled. Alistair was in a grave situation. A beautiful young woman had been murdered. She was here to escort this man around the studio today, and that was it.</p><p>\u201cAfter you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t short, but neither was she exceptionally tall, at five-eight.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no\u2014you take the front.\u201d She managed a casual grimace. \u201cSince I\u2019m staring up at you, it\u2019s obvious you have much longer legs.\u201d He had to be six-three or six-four, she estimated. She felt she should tell him it was a pleasure to meet him, except that seemed kind of ridiculous at the moment. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here for Eddie,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>He gave her a tight-lipped smile and a nod. \u201cI\u2019ll say the same,\u201d he told her huskily. \u201cPlease, take the seat next to Eddie. There\u2019s plenty of legroom in the back. Humor me\u2014it\u2019s a Texas thing.\u201d</p><p>Madison decided she wasn\u2019t going to wage a war over a car seat and got in.</p><p>When she was seated, Eddie turned to her. \u201cThanks, Maddie,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThank you, sincerely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the police still have the museum area\u2014the tunnel\u2014cordoned off. Naturally, Sean has jurisdiction anywhere, but I\u2019d like you to show him the studio. You can answer any questions he might have.\u201d Eddie\u2019s voice grew emotional as he added, \u201cI\u2019m going to abandon you two and get back to the hospital to see Alistair. I don\u2019t like leaving him alone. I don\u2019t mean alone\u2014I mean, without seeing me as much as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, Eddie,\u201d Madison said quietly. Alistair\u2014assuming he was innocent\u2014definitely needed family support at a time like this.</p><p>But he had a stepmother, too, although it was true that Alistair had never called his father\u2019s wives \u201cMother.\u201d But he seemed to have a friendly relationship with Helena LaRoux, and as far as she could tell, Helena liked Alistair. Alistair was happy if his father was happy, and he found it amusing that Helena had made no bones about the fact that she\u2019d loved Eddie and wanted to be Mrs. Eddie Archer. She claimed to love Eddie and maybe she did. It was a nice bonus that he was as powerful as he was\u2014and Helena never pretended that she wasn\u2019t eager to be rich and famous on her own. It seemed, however, that she was happy to share her journey with Eddie\u2019s son.</p><p>Appearances, Madison thought. Hollywood was all smoke and mirrors.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got family there now,\u201d Eddie told her. \u201cHelena is with him. But we\u2019ve only been married a year, and although she and Alistair get along fine, she\u2019s not his real mom, and certainly not his dad, you know?\u201d he ended hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cNo one else is you, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>She noticed that Sean Cameron reached over from the backseat, placed a hand on Eddie\u2019s shoulder and squeezed.</p><p>She\u2019d heard about Cameron before; she knew his name, and that he\u2019d worked at the studio. Now that she was with him, she realized she\u2019d even seen pictures of him with past creatures created at the studio and at industry parties. Once she\u2019d actually wondered about him and joked with Carla, a seamstress, about him. Why didn\u2019t he still work there, huh? she\u2019d asked. She often worked a double shift, seventy to eighty hours, with a group that was seventy to eighty percent male. All those hours and all those men, and they were like fathers, uncles, little brothers or obnoxious cousins. Or uninterested in the opposite sex.</p><p>Carla had reminded her that she dressed some of the hottest actors in the business, and she\u2019d been asked out often enough.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as if she was totally averse to a whirlwind romance\u2014here today, gone tomorrow\u2014it was just that the right opportunity hadn\u2019t come along. She preferred to remain friends with men she might work with again, and she didn\u2019t want the girlfriends, wives and lovers of actors or colleagues not wanting her to be part of future projects. So she kept her distance. Sometimes the actors she worked with could be cold and full of themselves, but luckily, that was seldom the case. And when she kept her distance, she earned their respect. Maybe men always admired and longed for what they couldn\u2019t have. Maybe women, too.</p><p>And maybe she was just damaged. Maybe a friend like Bogie was a reward for the strange and painful things that had happened to her.</p><p>Right now, she needed to concentrate and focus on the moment\u2014and not on Sean Cameron. She didn\u2019t know the man. Not at all. She\u2019d seen him standing outside a car. She\u2019d heard his voice and shaken his hand. Watched how he\u2019d silently laid his hand on Eddie\u2019s shoulder, a true sign of friendship and support. There was something about his voice, though. It seemed to enclose her and make her feel his words were sincere, that he was some kind of secure bastion against the world. Eddie had called on him in a time of need.</p><p>As they pulled up in front of the cinema and studio, Madison saw that there were four police cars guarding the entrance. She looked past the cars and the crime scene tape to the beautiful Art Deco\u2013style Black Box Cinema with its terra-cotta sunburst facade, and the elegantly crafted sign. The building itself was a handsome and historic structure; it appeared sad, though, wrapped in crime scene tape as it was.</p><p>When she looked to the side she saw the parking lot, empty now of cars. During lockdown it was usually crowded even at night\u2014all hands on deck.</p><p>She noted a vintage Cadillac that was out of place among the clearly marked patrol cars. It was parked at the far end; there was a man standing outside the car, staring at the buildings, as if he was carefully watching the police and every move they made.</p><p>He turned as they drove up. Before they could exit, he walked over to the car, and Eddie rolled down the driver\u2019s-seat window. From the passenger seat, Madison leaned over and saw that it was Andy Simons, Eddie\u2019s partner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, you doing okay?\u201d Simons asked Eddie.</p><p>Madison didn\u2019t know him half as well as she knew Eddie; Simons was money, Eddie was art. But the two were longtime friends and Simons\u2014like everyone else associated with the studio\u2014would stand by Eddie to the very end. Eddie and Andy were complete opposites in more ways than one. Eddie was slim and athletic, an attractive middle-aged man, casual and easy in his manner and dress. Andy was muscular and his clothing\u2014even his jogging attire, as she\u2019d seen once\u2014was pure designer quality. He had a head of light blond hair that he kept artfully colored and his nails were manicured. He\u2019d always been nice when Madison encountered him, he just didn\u2019t have Eddie\u2019s natural ease with the artisans and employees of the studio. However, that didn\u2019t matter much, since he was seldom around.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Andy,\u201d Eddie said huskily. \u201cI\u2019m doing all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd Alistair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best he can be\u2014under the circumstances.\u201d Eddie gestured at Sean. \u201cAndy, you remember Sean Cameron\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Andy said, looking into the backseat and smiling. \u201cNice to see you, Sean. We missed you\u2014and your talent\u2014when you left. Odd timing, though,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here for his old job,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cSean is with the FBI. His unit is going to take the lead on the investigation. I told you I was going to call in some favors to see that Alistair got a fair shake, that I wanted to bring in an FBI unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. But, Sean\u2014you\u2019re FBI?\u201d Simons asked.</p> <p>\u201cCareer change,\u201d Sean said with a shrug. \u201cLife takes us to some strange places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a major change.\u201d Simons looked at Eddie, frowning. \u201cI knew you wanted the FBI involved, but I wasn\u2019t sure you could pull it off. But then, you\u2019ve always been able to create magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever hurts to have two law enforcement agencies working together\u2014we can bring different specialties to the table,\u201d Sean explained.</p><p>\u201cBut from fabricator...to FBI?\u201d Simons said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cYou never know,\u201d Sean Cameron said.</p><p>There was an air of expectancy in the silence that followed, but Cameron didn\u2019t say anything else and Eddie spoke up.</p> <p>\u201cMadison is going to show him around the studio. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>Simons nodded. \u201cGreat.\u201d He smiled at Eddie and tried to sound cheerful. \u201cNo one works harder than Madison, and I\u2019d say she\u2019s definitely a good choice for bringing Sean up-to-date. And we can\u2019t ask for anything better than the FBI,\u201d he said. He bent lower and grinned at her. \u201cYou\u2019re the best, too, Madison. We all appreciate what you\u2019re doing, but I have to ask\u2014you okay with this? You don\u2019t have to be here, you know. We can only ask so much of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just fine. I\u2019ll do anything to help Alistair,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d Simons repeated. His comment seemed odd to Madison, or maybe not. To the outside world, there was no way that Alistair hadn\u2019t committed the murder. Maybe he was really asking if she\u2019d be willing to lie, if necessary. Was he? she wondered. Andy Simons\u2019s fortune was tied to Eddie\u2019s, and while he might have had the seed money, it was Eddie\u2019s talent that had kept them both going.</p><p>The one aspect of the business Andy didn\u2019t have anything to do with was the Black Box Cinema. That was strictly Eddie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAgent Cameron, welcome, and thank you,\u201d Simons was saying. He straightened a bit. \u201cGlad you\u2019re with us. I\u2019ve been standing in the parking lot for hours\u2014don\u2019t know why, except that I want the police to realize that all of us at the studio believe in Alistair, and we\u2019ll be watching them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know why you\u2019re here. You\u2019re my friend,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m grateful for the support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. With Sean on the case now, I\u2019ll head home. But, Eddie, if you need me\u2014for anything, anything at all\u2014just call.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Andy,\u201d Eddie said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. And I will be calling on you.\u201d Sean Cameron reached through an open window to shake the man\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later, then.\u201d Simons gave them all a grave nod and walked to his car.</p><p>\u201cThank God I do have friends on board, and we\u2019re not just throwing Alistair to the wolves,\u201d Eddie said.</p><p>\u201cCharacter can mean everything, Eddie. And a vicious murder isn\u2019t in Alistair\u2019s character.\u201d Sean Cameron opened his door to exit the car and Madison did the same.</p><p>\u201cKeep the faith, Eddie,\u201d Sean said, ducking his head down to the window.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Eddie nodded, and eased the car toward the road.</p><p>One of the police officers on guard duty approached Madison and Sean. Madison felt awkward about this; Sean Cameron did not. He smoothly produced his credentials and they were ushered through the massive gates. They were stopped once again, at the entrance to the cinema.</p><p>\u201cEven though you\u2019re FBI, are you sure they\u2019re going to let us in here?\u201d Madison asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019re required to. The agencies will be working in tandem. I want to see the studio today. The crime scene experts are probably still in there\u2014looking for anything and everything. But it\u2019s important that I meet the LAPD detective in charge,\u201d he told her. \u201cHow do you feel about Andy Simons?\u201d he asked, looking at her closely.</p><p>\u201cAndy? Honestly, I don\u2019t see him that often. Neither Eddie nor Andy comes to the studio daily, although Eddie\u2019s in far more often and is usually with us when we go on location,\u201d Madison said. \u201cWhen Andy does come in\u2014maybe once every couple of weeks\u2014he\u2019s cordial, interested and decent to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about him?\u201d Sean persisted.</p><p>She smiled suddenly. \u201cWell, I guess Eddie\u2019s a man of the people. Andy is more like royalty condescending from on high. But like I said, he\u2019s always been decent, and, odd couple though they are, he and Eddie have been friends for years. You don\u2019t think Andy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anything yet. We\u2019ve got a long way to go, Madison.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d paused to look at her and she was startled by the little tremor that rippled down her spine. She\u2019d just met him, and she was alarmed by her strange and instant admiration for him. She liked the steady gravity in his eyes as he spoke, and still felt touched by the sound of his voice and the honesty and sincerity with which he seemed to speak. He wasn\u2019t muscle-bound like a prizefighter, but she had the feeling he was all lean strength.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she said quickly, stepping back. She was making far too much of a simple moment they were sharing in the pursuit of justice.</p><p>They were approached by another officer and stood at the door, waiting, while he went into the building.</p><p>\u201cWe will get in there,\u201d Sean muttered.</p><p>The officer returned, leading a tall, bald-headed man of about forty. The newcomer eyed Sean suspiciously, but had apparently expected him. He was Detective Benny Knox, and he was polite enough, although he glanced at Madison as if he wasn\u2019t impressed and was, in fact, indifferent to her presence. She wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d figured out that she didn\u2019t know a thing about crime scenes. Sean, however, introduced her as \u201cEddie Archer\u2019s most trusted studio artist,\u201d and the detective assessed her again and nodded grimly.</p><p>\u201cI heard you worked here once, Cameron,\u201d Knox said.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed they brought you in because you know the place yourself.\u201d</p><p>Sean gave a slight shrug. \u201cBut things change over time. Madison has the position I had years ago, so she\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about when I ask a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s Eddie\u2019s girl,\u201d Knox said.</p><p>Madison frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not anyone\u2019s \u2018girl,\u2019 Detective. I\u2019m here to make sure Agent Cameron has knowledgeable updates on any changes in the studio.\u201d</p><p>Knox raised his eyebrows, then nodded.</p><p>It was fine for them to be in the studio, Knox assured them. Fingerprints had been taken from the door that connected the tunnel to the studio, and the rooms had been searched. Knox actually managed something of a smile when he told her that some of his most seasoned people had been startled more than once, running into the creatures in production and in storage. She forced a weak smile in return.</p><p>The police were finishing up in the cinema and the tunnel, he went on to say, and, as law enforcement, Sean would understand that they didn\u2019t want tainted evidence. But before the biohazard teams were called in to clean up, Sean would have access to everything.</p><p>\u201cNotes from the first officer on the scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014and my own. Officer Braden was pretty thorough, and he knew the drill. He didn\u2019t touch anything until I was called. Of course, there\u2019s no such thing as a pristine crime scene in a situation like this\u2014Alistair Archer had been slipping around in the blood, the guard rushed in and he had blood on him. But after that, the scene was contained. Let me know what you want when, and I\u2019ll see that you get it.\u201d</p><p>Once Knox had finished speaking, he studied Sean carefully. \u201cWhat I hear\u2014and this comes straight from the governor\u2019s office\u2014is that you\u2019re lead investigator on this, along with your team. It\u2019s your ball game,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot all\u2014we need and appreciate you and your men, Knox. I\u2019d like you to keep the lead until we\u2019re completely established. I want to get the lay of the land again, so to speak. Raintree is due tonight or tomorrow morning with the rest of the team. I\u2019m not sure what plans they\u2019ve made as yet. Now...we\u2019ll go through the parking lot to the studio, staying out of the way of the forensic experts.\u201d</p><p>Knox seemed mollified. He kept nodding.</p><p>Madison and Sean started across to the main studio entrance.</p><p>As they walked, Madison asked, \u201cIs it always like that? I mean, it felt like he was throwing massive webs of power and testosterone there. Aren\u2019t you both working toward the same goal, as in the truth of what happened?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean Cameron grinned at her; he was strikingly good-looking, she realized again, and could have been in the movies instead of the magic behind them.</p><p>Step back, think sanely. You\u2019re just here as a guide, she reminded herself.</p><p>She still wasn\u2019t quite sure how one went from being a visual fabricator and creator to an FBI agent, but she was glad to see his grin. She had to admit she hadn\u2019t relished this assignment and wished they could rewind time\u2014go back twenty-four hours, make sure Alistair Archer was nowhere near the Black Box Cinema last night and that the entire place had been locked down tight. Then she\u2019d be at work, consulting with her colleagues, studying sketches, and then computer simulations, discussing materials....</p> <p>\u201cSometimes the L.A. cops have taken a beating when they haven\u2019t been the ones to mess things up. And if you\u2019re asking whether law enforcement agencies can be territorial\u2014you bet. I actually belong to a unit of people who are ready to stand down, suck up when necessary and just get our part done. But yes, we are all working toward the same goal, and a team like mine doesn\u2019t have the manpower to do it alone. If you have good cops on your side, you\u2019re ahead of the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worked for Eddie for several years, right?\u201d Madison asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes. Then I returned to Texas\u2014had a close friend with cancer, and I wanted to be around to help with what was needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find your way into law enforcement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. It found me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>They were in front of the studio door now. He indicated that she should get out her key, and she knew that their conversation on his history was over.</p><p>Madison fumbled in her purse and produced the key, then opened the door and stepped inside. As she\u2019d expected, once they\u2019d entered the vestibule, she saw Colin Bailey on duty behind the little glassed-in reception area.</p><p>During the day, when work was in progress, two people handled the reception desk. The hallways that led down to the studios, work areas and offices weren\u2019t locked, but a security officer usually sat in front with the receptionist. Today, no receptionist was on duty, but Colin Bailey was there, formidable despite his age. Colin had been a boxer in his day. Like the cop she\u2019d just met, he was bald, but his bare pate was a present from nature, and not the work of careful shaving. He had bright blue eyes and jowls that would have done a bulldog proud. His nose had been broken a dozen times and looked it.</p><p>He could be gentle as a lamb, but when it came to defending Eddie Archer or his property and reputation, Colin turned into a cobra.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no entrance! Absolutely no\u2014Oh! Madison, it\u2019s you. And the FBI man, I assume?\u201d Bailey rose from his swivel chair, opened the door dividing the entry from the reception area and came out to greet them. He inspected Sean, and then smiled. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s you, kid!\u201d he said with enthusiasm. \u201cI thought I got the name wrong or something!\u201d He took Sean\u2019s hand and shook it with enthusiasm. \u201cWow, it\u2019s true! So you\u2019re a G-man, huh? For real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real, Colin, my friend, for real,\u201d Sean told him. \u201cSo, you\u2019re doing well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Bailey said. \u201cWell, until last night,\u201d he added, his smile fading.</p><p>\u201cYou were on duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. And I take that seriously, as you know, especially during lockdown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had your eye on the video screens?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Bailey grimaced. \u201cFor all the good it did. And the cops have the video now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cameras still cover the same areas?\u201d</p><p>Bailey nodded. He motioned to them to join him in the reception area. As they walked in, Madison realized she\u2019d never been there herself; she\u2019d never thought about the security cameras.</p><p>There was a bank with six screens. One showed the entry. Another focused on the main work area, encompassing the shop, the main construction area and, somewhat obscured, the rest of the floor. Another screen covered the parking lot, and yet another, the upstairs hallway. One showed the cemetery and parking lot to the right if one were facing the studio entrance, and another showed the side of the Black Box Cinema.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t see the entrance to the Black Box,\u201d Madison noted.</p><p>\u201cThe Black Box Cinema has its own security camera that focuses on anyone coming through the main entrance,\u201d Bailey told her. \u201cBut as you can see, these screens will tell you if anyone is entering the studio by the main entrance, and if anyone tried to get through the fire exits, an alarm would have gone off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no security footage for the tunnel\u2014the museum\u2014itself?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s seldom used,\u201d Colin said. \u201cThere never seemed to be a reason. No one\u2019s allowed down there except by appointment or on movie nights, and there\u2019s always a guide with anyone who does go down. Film noir buffs always want to see it, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s the biggest tourist attraction in Hollywood or anything. The cinema\u2019s Eddie\u2019s baby\u2014has been from the start. He grew up loving film noir, and I guess he feels it\u2019s just a little collection he shows friends, even if the friends are people he doesn\u2019t know. You can ask for a tour if you\u2019ve come to see a movie. You don\u2019t even have to pay the nominal five bucks, just bring your ticket stub during opening hours. Like I said, there never seemed to be much need for security down there.\u201d</p><p>Sean Cameron didn\u2019t respond to that. Maintaining a pleasant expression, he said, \u201cThanks, Colin. Madison\u2019s going to catch me up on any of the changes that have happened around here since I left. We\u2019ll check back in before we leave. Obviously, we have to leave this way, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Bailey nodded. \u201cUnless you open a fire door and, if you do, alarms will go off like firecrackers.\u201d He grinned at his own mild joke.</p><p>Sean looked at Madison. \u201cIf we go to the right, that\u2019ll still lead us to the main work areas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the hallway to the left has two meeting rooms, plus the stairs up to the offices and meeting rooms on the second floor.\u201d</p><p>He moved quickly, heading to the right. She followed him at the same pace.</p><p>The studio seemed strange. Empty. She came in early sometimes, but a lot of workers did, and Madison couldn\u2019t remember a single time when she\u2019d come in and one of the seamstresses or construction engineers hadn\u2019t already been at work. The sounds of sewing machines, electric saws, hammers and other work-related noises were constant, although someone usually had a stereo system playing pop music or rock classics. Today, there was no stereo on. Materials were piled up on the tables that stood by the sewing machines, and the shop area itself felt eerie. It was almost like walking into a home whose owners had mysteriously disappeared.</p><p>The walls were pinned with fabric and materials and drawings. Creatures they\u2019d made for movies, shows or advertisements were lined up on the floor and arranged on shelves\u2014some might be used again, and some were kept because they\u2019d required a great deal of work and had turned out exceptionally well. They also kept some of the projects that hadn\u2019t worked quite as well, a reminder of the thought and care that needed to go into any creation.</p><p>A giant rat stood next to an equally large penguin. The rat had been used in a public service announcement and the penguin had been animated to advertise a new adventure park in Oregon. Robotic creatures from the last sci-fi movie they\u2019d worked on were lined up together, and above them was an old bicycle being ridden by a very evil-looking big, bad wolf. Zombies created for Apocalypse from Beneath the Sea were against the far rear wall, and the bloodied victims from a Victorian-era murder mystery were on the high shelving ten feet above the floor\u2014above the zombies. Madison noted that Sean was staring at the victims, Miss Mary, Parson Bridge and Myra Sue. He was thoughtful, and she suspected he was imagining that the appearance of Jenny Henderson\u2019s body must have been disturbingly similar to these props. The studio was known for the realism of what they created.</p><p>\u201cLife imitates art and art imitates life. In this case, the question is which came first,\u201d Sean murmured.</p><p>Madison glanced down, troubled by the creatures that were just rubber, plastic, fabric and paint. She\u2019d drawn the designs for some of them; she\u2019d dressed Myra Sue. Suddenly, Myra Sue and the other \u201cvictims\u201d didn\u2019t seem like props designed for a movie. They looked like flesh and blood.</p><p>A lot of blood.</p><p>Madison found herself turning away from Myra Sue\u2019s one sightless eye.</p><p>\u201cFire door is still in the back, right?\u201d Sean asked her.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBetween these guys and the Planet Mondo air creatures over there,\u201d she said, pointing to the door. There was a large sign that said Fire Door, but it was partially obstructed by the wings of one of the Planet Mondo air creatures.</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t changed much,\u201d Sean said. He nodded to one of the giant robots across the workstations, beside the climate control room. \u201cI worked on Hugoman. He\u2019s been here awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? He\u2019s fantastic. And I love the movie!\u201d Madison said. She did love the creature in the movie Hugoman. He was the invention of a mad scientist who\u2019d given him his son\u2019s personality through partial cloning; the massive machinelike creature was kind and fought only to save lives. Of course, he\u2019d been misunderstood, and when he\u2019d saved the community from an attack by mutant creatures, he had died\u2014a moral about judging people, or creatures, on appearances. Hugoman had actually been low-budget and promoted as an action/monster flick, but it had been extremely well written and had become a cult classic.</p><p>She flushed; they were here because of a murder, and because someone they both cared about had been accused of that murder. And yet, she wasn\u2019t sure why they were just touring the studio. The murder hadn\u2019t taken place in the studio; it had happened in the museum tunnel.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t appalled by her sudden enthusiasm; he smiled at her. \u201cThanks. I loved working here. I needed to go back to Texas for a bit, and then...then you get swept up in life, so I wound up staying and working there. But I did love the time I spent here, working for Eddie Archer. I was proud that we helped create a cult classic on a budget.\u201d His tone became businesslike. \u201cSo, as far as I know, that\u2019s our fire door on this side of the building downstairs, and we have another over by the offices?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It took her a second to follow his quick change of subject, but she managed not to blink.</p><p>\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, yes,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd there are corresponding exits upstairs, with ladders in case of fire. Eddie\u2019s always been very careful, dealing with some of the flammable materials as we do.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s going on in the shop. What are you working on right now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of ironic. We\u2019re working on a remake of Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum. It\u2019s updated, and it\u2019s been retitled The Unholy. The script is really good\u2014and different enough to make this a different movie. From what I\u2019ve seen so far, I\u2019d compare it to Disturbing Behavior, which was, in essence, a remake of Hitchcock\u2019s Rear Window.\u201d</p><p>Sean frowned. \u201cA remake of the movie\u2014and Jenny was killed in front of the tableau?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not just ironic,\u201d he told her. \u201cThat sounds intentional. And it changes everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe original movie was filmed well over half a century ago. What could this have to do with the movie we\u2019re making now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cIt could be a motive for murder. And lockdown\u2014that\u2019s incredibly important, too. Lockdown should eliminate anyone who isn\u2019t close to the studio.\u201d</p><p>Madison spoke through clenched jaws. She wasn\u2019t in the FBI or the police; she wasn\u2019t required to understand motive and investigation. \u201cEven when we\u2019re not in lockdown, the curious can\u2019t just wander in. I have to have permission to bring in a guest on a regular day, and I wouldn\u2019t have been given permission at all now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s permission, and there\u2019s giving yourself permission by dodging the rules. On a regular day, someone could try to slip someone else in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the security cameras, Sean? People here don\u2019t want to risk their jobs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not. Still...\u201d</p><p>He walked toward the climate-controlled room, but looked through the windows for a moment, and never tried the door. He seemed uninterested.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your workstation?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Her work area was a few feet from the climate-controlled area. She pointed it out to him, and he went over to it.</p><p>It seemed bizarre that everything was just where she\u2019d left it on Friday night. There were pieces of the leather coat she\u2019d chosen for the costume of actor Oliver Marshall, playing antihero Sam Stone in the new movie.</p><p>\u201cI saw the movie as a kid. But refresh me,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>What did this have to do with the murder?</p><p>\u201cIn a nutshell? There are a series of murders\u2014people ripped to shreds by something in the night. Then an incredibly wealthy philanthropist with a gorgeous young wife is found murdered in a similar manner in his Egyptian Museum. The cops want to arrest the wife, so she goes to Sam Stone. Various clues suggest she\u2019s the murderer, but she denies it. The movie is great because it leaves the audience wondering\u2014was something supernatural happening, or could it all be explained? The Egyptian mummy supposedly sent from the Department of Antiquities turns out to be a priest heading an ancient cult and in the end, needless to say, he proves to be the murderer. Sam Stone falls in love with the wife\u2014Dianna Breen\u2014but she dies at the hand of the priest before she\u2019s proven innocent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s playing Sam Stone?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cOliver Marshall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. How is he to work with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He\u2019s always in the tabloids for being a party boy, but he\u2019s polite and courteous, shows up for his fittings and works well with everyone behind the scenes. He\u2019s very pleasant and makes everyone at the studio think he\u2019s just one of the gang. I like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to hear. When\u2019s the last time he was in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday. I was working on his costume.\u201d She gestured at the fabric on the table. \u201cHe was in for fittings. Sam Stone carries concealed weapons, so everything about the costume has to fit perfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose...creatures evoked by the Egyptian priest\u2014what\u2019s his name?\u201d Sean pointed to some of their newest creations, including giant fanged jackals, birds and bizarre giant snakes.</p><p>\u201cThe priest is Amun Mopat, and yes, they\u2019re for the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will the priest be wearing? Same type of costume as in the film noir?\u201d Sean asked. \u201cAnd who\u2019s playing him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat role hasn\u2019t been cast yet,\u201d Madison told him. \u201cThere\u2019s a mannequin over by the wall with a mock-up of the robe he\u2019ll be wearing. It\u2019s an homage to the original film. Almost exactly the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere? Show me.\u201d</p><p>Madison walked over to the mannequin that stood behind one of the jackal-like monsters created for the movie.</p><p>There was nothing but a plain brown monk\u2019s robe on it.</p><p>She looked at Sean as shivers of fear streaked down her spine.</p><p>\u201cThe robe\u2014it was just a mock-up. But it\u2019s gone,\u201d she said. \u201cI suppose someone might have taken it.... Mike Greenwood could have shown it to someone. I\u2019ll ask Mike and Eddie where it is.\u201d</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cThey won\u2019t know\u2014and the robe isn\u2019t coming back. It\u2019s been used,\u201d he said grimly, \u201cby the killer.\u201d He turned to look at her. \u201cFind that robe, and we\u2019ll be on our way to finding a killer.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Sean touched her cheek. \u201cThis is a good thing. Seeing that the robe is gone actually helps. I\u2019m almost astounded that everyone assumes it was Alistair, to tell you the truth. The girl was killed in front of the Sam Stone tableau, the studio is doing a remake, the robe is gone. To me, all of that points to someone with an agenda against the studio or the movie.\u201d</p><p>Madison nodded. But she didn\u2019t agree that the robe\u2019s disappearance was a good thing! A killer had been here, where she worked. A killer had used the robe she\u2019d made to sneak onto a tableau or into the tunnel and slice open a young woman\u2019s throat.</p><p>Sean turned her to face the construction area. \u201cWhat are they working on here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAn old Western scaffold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor The Unholy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s the tail end of our last project\u2014Ways of the West.\u201d She gave herself a mental shake and turned toward the sewing machines and a rack of clothing. \u201cProjects overlap, but you know that. Or sometimes we work on several at the same time. Right now, though, as soon as the scaffolding\u2019s out of here, we\u2019ll be doing nothing but The Unholy. Or...I assume we\u2019ll still be working on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe world goes on, despite murder,\u201d Sean said. He motioned to the far wall of the construction area. \u201cAnd there\u2019s the door that leads from the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t really a question. She said, \u201cYes,\u201d anyway.</p><p>He walked over but didn\u2019t touch it. Madison followed him and saw powder all over the whitewashed floor nearby. Black powder.</p><p>\u201cThe police dusted here,\u201d he said.</p><p>Madison felt a moment\u2019s discomfort. Her prints were on that door.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll get a lot of prints,\u201d she said. \u201cIncluding mine.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, the curl of his lips gentle, slightly amused. \u201cElimination,\u201d he told her. \u201cThey\u2019ll take everyone\u2019s prints for the purposes of comparison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElimination? But...you believe the killer works here, or is close to someone here? That means we\u2019ve all known him or her.... Actually, any of us might have been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think any of you could have been killed. The killer didn\u2019t want the police running around looking for a murderer. The killer wanted them to arrest Alistair. His habits were known\u2014he was being watched way ahead of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going through there?\u201d she asked, nodding at the door.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll let the police find everything they can with their forensic units. I\u2019ll go into the tunnel soon. You don\u2019t have to come with me.\u201d</p><p>An uncomfortable sensation crept over her. A horrible murder had just taken place there, in the tunnel. She\u2019d only seen crime scenes on television or at the movies. She didn\u2019t want to see the real thing.</p><p>But she was here to help. Help save Alistair. He couldn\u2019t be guilty\u2014and Eddie had called her to assist this man who was somehow going to prove it.</p><p>She had to go to the site. If what she\u2019d experienced during her life, the ordeals that had made it so painful, were worth anything at all, the one benefit might be that she could reach the dead girl. Did Jenny\u2019s spirit somehow remain, although her mortal life had been stolen? If so, wasn\u2019t she obliged to try to speak to the girl, to connect with her?</p><p>She shook her head, responding to Sean\u2019s comment. \u201cNo...if I\u2019m going to help you, I should go all the way.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. He was staring at the area around the door. Close to it on the left was another rack of costuming, while a supply of wood had been stacked up on the right. She began to wonder if anyone could have hidden behind the racks of clothing or the wood, staying out of sight of the video cameras. But if someone had been there, waiting, how had that person gotten into the building? Some of the construction crew had been working Saturday; she\u2019d been off herself, as had most of the shop. Sunday, as far as she knew, no one had planned on coming in. So that would\u2019ve meant the person had hidden behind the rack of clothing overnight, with the intent of killing someone who might or might not have been in the tunnel on a night when no one should have been there?</p><p>Or did she know the killer? Was it someone who walked among them, someone she saw on a day-to-day basis, worked with, laughed with?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a walk through the rest of the place,\u201d he said.</p><p>Madison turned and headed back to the hallway, then passed by the reception area and went on to the offices. There were two on the ground floor, both conference rooms more than offices but supplied with computers, printers, screens and other work equipment. The walls were lined with movie posters; the hallway had two circular areas decorated with mannequins, all from different movies. There was an adolescent werewolf, a beautiful evil witch, a torn-up robotic trooper, a vampire complete with cape and golden eyes that seemed to follow you and a zombie, a poor girl from one of those \u201cpark by the lake and make out even though a dozen couples have already been killed there\u201d movies. This girl had not done so well; she was missing most of her face, and the one blue eye that stared out at them was pretty gruesome. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Actually, with the exception of Myra Sue, their \u201ccreatures\u201d rarely bothered Madison. She was accustomed to them. But there were a few mannequins in the offices that were far more upsetting. They were incredibly realistic. In the first office, there was one on an autopsy table, the sheet drawn up, eyes glazed and open, blond hair streaming around a beautiful face. She was the first victim in a murder mystery. In the second office, there was a mannequin of a beautiful, terrorized woman peeking out from the leaves of a bush. Neither victim had been played by a living actress; the work was so good, it just looked like they\u2019d been real.</p><p>Entering the second office, Sean commented, \u201cSo Matilda is still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatilda?\u201d</p> <p>He flashed a smile. \u201cWe dubbed her Matilda. She didn\u2019t have a name, even in the script. She was just \u2018devoured victim number one.\u2019 But we all liked her when my crew was around, and we called her Matilda. She used to really creep out a lot of people. A guy named Harry Smith was working on digital back then, and he used to swear that he hated being in the office alone. He felt like Matilda was watching him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can feel like our characters are watching you,\u201d Madison said. \u201cThe studio\u2019s always done great work. And when it\u2019s great, it looks real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>Sean left the office, and for the first time, Madison felt that \u201cMatilda\u201d was watching her and she, too, hurried out.</p><p>In the second hallway circle\u2014complete with vampire, witch and slasher-movie victim\u2014Sean paused for a moment, then headed to the hall with the elevator and the emergency exit that led to the fire escape outside. He didn\u2019t touch the door; he saw that the police had dusted here, too. Instead, he returned to the elevator, then saw that the police had dusted there, as well. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it.\u201d He pushed the button and they waited for a moment, listening to the whir of motors.</p> <p>When they were inside the elevator, he said, \u201cDid you know there\u2019s a key to get to the basement\u2014or the end of the tunnel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Madison asked, surprised. As far as she was aware, the elevator only went down to the main level. There were two buttons to push in, for the first and second floors.</p><p>Sean pointed to a little metal piece where a key could be inserted. \u201cThe elevator can go to the first and second floors and to the basement...or to the tunnel entrance. As far as I\u2019m aware, no one\u2019s used it\u2014except for Eddie Archer, maybe\u2014since Eddie\u2019s owned the place. I think there\u2019s only one key and he has it. But I saw the plans once, and this elevator will go to the basement. I wonder if Eddie thought to mention that to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if he did,\u201d Madison said. \u201cI have my keys with me, of course. And I have keys to almost everything, but not the elevator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to try getting down to the basement yet. I\u2019m going to ask if anyone\u2019s checked it out. For now, we\u2019ll stay clear until the crime scene units have gotten what they need.\u201d</p><p>Upstairs, the basic floor design was the same. They passed by a circle of prop creatures and came to Eddie\u2019s office\u2014home to several charming little gnomelike beings from a children\u2019s fantasy movie\u2014and then moved on to the large office occupied by Mike Greenwood, managing artist of the studio. Mike liked aliens, and his office was filled with sci-fi and space creatures and miniatures of a spaceship that appeared several stories tall on film.</p> <p>A window in the back of his office looked over the rear of the property; it was high enough that the cemetery in back with its historic family vaults and funerary art could easily be seen. Sean paused there, gazing out.</p><p>\u201cPeace Cemetery,\u201d he murmured, glancing at her. \u201cDid it ever disturb you to work in the midst of a cemetery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said curtly, perhaps too curtly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an old, old place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd still accepting burials,\u201d Madison said. \u201cI think Eddie loves that it\u2019s there. He says it\u2019s a place where history and contemporary life meet.\u201d She hesitated a moment. Eddie knew she had a sixth sense, as he called it, because of the cemetery, because of the times they\u2019d walked there together\u2014and the day he\u2019d caught her talking to a ghost. \u201cThere are dozens of stories about the cemetery, secret burials and, of course, ghosts. Naturally, it\u2019s got a reputation for being haunted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost cemeteries do,\u201d Sean said. \u201cEddie told me once that if he ever had time between the projects that paid the bills, he\u2019d love to do a documentary on the cemetery.\u201d She had the uneasy feeling that he was looking inside her soul. Good Lord, Eddie hadn\u2019t told him she was some kind of a freak who talked to ghosts, had he?</p><p>\u201cDoes it mean anything to you?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe cemetery being there?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cRight now? I see it as a place where a killer could escape\u2014that\u2019s what I see. Let\u2019s keep going, shall we?\u201d</p> <p>They returned to the first floor and stopped at Bailey\u2019s station. Sean thanked him and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re not working around the clock now, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve always taken on the Sunday evening shift. You know how Eddie Archer loves his cinema. And it\u2019s not even like we have break-ins or anything of the kind, but I take over for Winston Nash at five in the afternoon on Sundays and work until morning. Today I\u2019m in because I was already here, and because I\u2019d do whatever I could for Eddie Archer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Nash didn\u2019t report anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Nash said it was quiet as a tomb all day. I saw Alistair when he went into the Black Box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see when Ms. Henderson showed up?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Bailey flushed. He shook his head. \u201cBut she knew I was here. Even if I weren\u2019t, there\u2019d still be a guard watching over the place. I think she parked on the other side of the cemetery\u2014well, that\u2019s where they found her car\u2014and came around through the graveyard. The front of the cemetery is only on the one side, but the graves stretch around to the back. I assume she slipped around the building. We must\u2019ve caught her entry on the security cameras, but I admit I wasn\u2019t watching that screen when she got in. From what I understand, Alistair told his father that Jenny Henderson said he\u2019d forgotten to lock the front door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd had he forgotten?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to Alistair since I raced over to the Black Box when he came for me. He was...he was crazy, hysterical, when I saw him. He was screaming that a monster killed Jenny. I went back to the tunnel with him...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt was a pure zoo here last night! When Alistair ran up to this door it was as if he was being pursued by demons. I saw the blood on him and hit the call button for the police, and they were here within minutes. I tried to calm Alistair down enough to talk, but he just kept screaming about the priest and the mummies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you go down to the tunnel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I walked in, saw Jenny Henderson and the blood and walked out again. But I had to check it out because he was so hysterical. It\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>Sean was thoughtful. Silent.</p><p>Bailey continued. \u201cIt was a slip-and-slide of blood down there. A slip and slide. When I saw the way the girl was lying there.... Well, I knew she was dead. I backed out, not wanting to mess anything up for the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the right thing to do, Colin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never had anything that resembled a coherent talk with Alistair. He was in shock. And then the police got here\u2014and Eddie. Eddie seemed to be in shock, too, and they arrested Alistair. Eddie told me not to leave my post, and it\u2019s been a long time now, but I haven\u2019t left,\u201d Bailey said, nodding with determined loyalty. \u201cI haven\u2019t left,\u201d he repeated doggedly.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Sean said. He handed Colin Bailey a card. \u201cIf you think of anything\u2014even something that might seem unimportant, will you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet, Sean. You know the police interviewed me for more than an hour. I think I said everything. But, Sean, yeah, you bet. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>They walked out into the dying sunlight. Sean paused. Some of the police cars were gone; they could see that Benny Knox was still standing outside the entrance to the Black Box Cinema, like a sentinel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going in,\u201d Sean said. \u201cThey should have finished up with the crime scene evidence by now.\u201d He turned to her. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to come.\u201d</p><p>Yes, there is. The reason Eddie picked me to be with you.</p><p>She studied him, wondering how to explain that she somehow knew it was important that she go in without sounding like a fool. She didn\u2019t want to say she might get some kind of feeling from the place. He\u2019d probably look at her as if she should be committed if she said, \u201cThere\u2019s a slim possibility that there\u2019s a ghost in there now, and that she might talk to me.\u201d</p><p>What would happen? This man wouldn\u2019t really react. He\u2019d hold his thoughts, be polite\u2014and then see that she was committed.</p><p>\u201cI really love Eddie Archer,\u201d she began. \u201cHe gave me my life. I want to go in, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll help, but maybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake,\u201d he said. He might be a legend, but she sensed that to him she was just the guide. No real help, just the guide.</p><p>\u201cEddie asked me to be here. I feel I should go in,\u201d she said stubbornly.</p><p>He knew she resented him at that moment and maybe he resented her back. He was the man in charge, so she understood.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to know what we were doing before I challenged the buzzard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe buzzard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetective Knox,\u201d he said, rolling his eyes toward the entrance\u2014and the man in question.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say any more as he headed toward the Black Box. Benny Knox had already been standing in a ramrod-stiff position, but his whole body seemed to straighten further as they approached. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou going in now?\u201d Knox asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cYou wait here, miss,\u201d Knox ordered.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s working with me, Detective,\u201d Sean said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be with my people on this.\u201d He kept speaking even though Knox\u2019s frown made it apparent that he planned to argue. \u201cThis case is looking more and more like an in-house situation, Detective. Madison knows all the players on the stage now, and I may not. She probably knows the killer, and I would say fairly well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn-house,\u201d Knox muttered. \u201cThe Archer kid was the only one here, Agent Cameron. Yeah, I guess you\u2019d call that in-house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Knox,\u201d Sean said. \u201cYou\u2019re a good detective or you wouldn\u2019t be on this. And you know as well as I do that what\u2019s most obvious isn\u2019t always the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this case? I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t.\u201d Knox wasn\u2019t being a wiseass, Madison thought; he was serious. The subdued way he spoke scared her for Eddie more than anything else.</p><p>Sean said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going with obvious. We\u2019re investigating. Madison is familiar with the working of this studio and the cinema, inside and out. She\u2019s with me.\u201d The last was quiet and firm.</p> <p>Madison watched Knox\u2019s inner struggle. His longing to argue was clearly there, but he didn\u2019t persist. She wondered what kind of power Sean and his people had\u2014exactly who they were, she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Knox nodded. \u201cHands gloved, feet bagged,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Sean agreed.</p><p>At the entry there was a box of supplies. Madison followed suit as Sean put plastic covers over his shoes and pulled latex gloves on his hands. She fumbled awkwardly as she tried to get the gloves on, perhaps because Knox was behind them, watching her every move.</p><p>The three of them went inside.</p><p>A tech in a jumpsuit was leaving, a plastic box filled with vials in his arms. He nodded. As they headed through the theater, she saw that Sean looked at everything, from the Art Deco popcorn stand to the rugs, the cinema itself\u2014and the office. As they reached the tunnel, she heard two of the techs talking.</p> <p>\u201cHazmat will have fun with this one,\u201d someone said.</p><p>\u201cThis is nothing! You should\u2019ve seen that murder site up on the hill. The killer wrote in blood everywhere. Wonder if that place will ever sell,\u201d another voice responded.</p><p>\u201cThis is Hollywood\u2014you can sell anything,\u201d the first man said. \u201cLet\u2019s finish up here. I\u2019m ready for a drink.\u201d</p><p>The techs nodded as they passed Knox, Sean and Madison.</p><p>\u201cYour team\u2019s covered everything?\u201d Knox asked.</p><p>\u201cSir, if we covered any more, we\u2019d have to take the walls,\u201d the man said.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>As they made their way down, Madison felt as if the place was closing in on them. It was actually a broad throughway, maybe fifty feet in width and a hundred and fifty in length.</p> <p>When they reached the tunnel, she felt dizzy. The smell of blood was overwhelming.</p><p>The museum in the tunnel had always been fascinating. It was an homage to a bygone era of film, one that played an important role in the evolution of movies. Although Madison preferred romantic comedy, fantasy, adventure and horror, she loved the feel of the little museum. She\u2019d learned new respect for film noir because of it, and she was impressed by the accuracy and detail of the old tableaux.</p><p>Today, it was different. The artistry seemed to be gone; it was merely a tunnel with props and policemen. There were little plastic clips with numbers, a photographer was still snapping photos and tape outlined the place where the body had fallen. The last tableau at the rear, the Sam Stone movie scene, was out of kilter. It had been photographed, fingerprinted and invaded.</p><p>Madison focused on that tableau, not wanting to see the blood on the floor.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t prop blood. It wasn\u2019t chocolate, as Hitchcock had used for the black-and-white murder scene in Psycho. It was real blood, and the person who\u2019d shed that blood was now dead.</p><p>Thankfully, the body had been taken to the morgue. Despite what Madison had said, and despite all the time she spent creating creatures that were sometimes heroic and most often terrible, she felt somewhat squeamish about being down here. She wondered if she\u2019d ever be able to come to the museum again without thinking about what had happened last night.</p><p>She\u2019d come for a reason! she reminded herself. She had to be here.</p><p>She stood several feet from the tape that marked the position of the body and tried not to see the remaining techs or pay attention to Sean Cameron as he moved about the room. Eventually he came to the marked-out tape line.</p><p>She realized that he was standing as still as she was, as if he felt the air and was waiting for some kind of message that would speak to him in silence from the tunnel.</p><p>The photographer packed up his equipment and told Knox he was done. Soon the other techs left, too, and then there were just the three of them. For a moment, the silence around them seemed...unnatural.</p><p>\u201cSam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum.\u201d Sean was looking at the tableau. \u201cAnd Alistair Archer swears that someone\u2014something\u2014came out of that tableau and attacked Jenny Henderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe priest\u2014Amun Mopat, I understand,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, the priest. And he\u2019s still wearing his robe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something missing\u2014something off in the scene,\u201d Madison said as she studied the tableau.</p><p>\u201cI have that feeling, too. But what?\u201d Sean asked. He stared at it, frowning.</p><p>Madison continued to study it, as well. Mannequins, snakes and the items in the \u201cEgyptian Museum\u201d had been moved by the police and put back, but they weren\u2019t experts on how the display had been set up. There was something wrong, but she couldn\u2019t pin it down.</p><p>Sam Stone was entering, ready to wrest the priest, Amun Mopat, away from Dianna Breen. The sarcophagus, the mummy fallen to the floor, the stand with the canopic jars\u2014all still there. So was the statue of the ancient Egyptian warrior, tilted to the wrong side, and the jackal and the sphinx.</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew this place as well as Alistair does,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Madison watched in silence as Sean noted where the body had been and he walked to the tableau, not touching the velvet cord that separated the scene from the hall passage. He stepped over the cord. There wasn\u2019t much he could do to mess up what had been a perfect recreation, since the police and the techs had already been through the entire place. She found it oddly disturbing, as if the characters were now out of focus, and far more haunting than the ferocious and bloody scenes in the studio.</p><p>Madison tried to shut herself off, tried to focus on the victim.</p><p>Jenny?</p><p>But she didn\u2019t feel the presence of anyone near her. She stood there alone in her little world, frozen. She could envision Alistair and Jenny coming here, Alistair walking ahead, Jenny sensing someone at her back, crying out desperately for help....</p><p>And then feeling a knife cut through her throat.</p><p>Madison gave herself a furious mental shake. She was in the tunnel; the murder had happened only a few feet from where she was standing.</p><p>But there was nothing here that wasn\u2019t solid and real.</p><p>Jenny Henderson\u2019s body was at the morgue. If she was hanging around the place she\u2019d been murdered, hoping to communicate, Madison could feel no impression of her.</p><p>She walked a step closer to the blood, hoping that didn\u2019t make her ghoulish. She closed her eyes and tried to imagine the scene. Jenny must have coerced Alistair into bringing her to the studio. Jenny was an actress, a budding actress who needed every possible opportunity. No casting was done at the studio, but she probably believed she could learn something that might give her an edge when they were casting bit parts.</p><p>Had Jenny and Alistair paused to look at the tableaux? Or had Jenny\u2019s mind been on her agenda\u2014and Alistair\u2019s mind on Jenny?</p><p>She took note of where the body had lain. There was a distance of perhaps twenty feet to the door. Alistair had walked ahead....</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Sean said, startling her. \u201cHere\u2019s how I heard the story from Eddie\u2014how it was told to him by Alistair. Jenny convinced him to bring her over\u2014she wanted to get into the studio, see the costumes and the Egyptian creatures. Or the mythical creatures the Egyptian priest, Amun Mopat, brought to life. And according to Alistair\u2014\u201d Sean paused, approaching the door that separated the tunnel from the studio \u201c\u2014he came this way, and turned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd saw a monster\u2014or the priest,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cWhich means\u2014\u201d Sean paused again, walking to the display \u201c\u2014that the killer was in the tableau. As soon as Alistair passed by, the killer came down.\u201d Sean moved up to the display, then got down, his movements silent. \u201cThe robed figure left his position and crawled over the velvet cord and attacked Jenny Henderson. He\u2019d left Sam Stone and his femme fatale where they belonged as he stepped down to seize Jenny, and cut her throat.\u201d</p><p>Sean was suddenly standing behind Madison.</p><p>For a moment, she could feel the fear, feel as if the killer\u2019s breath touched her....</p><p>She felt his hands on her shoulders, and the other girl\u2019s fear seemed to fill her. She could practically see\u2014feel, touch!\u2014what had happened.</p><p>Her throat closed; she could barely scream.</p><p>Alistair!</p><p>The sound didn\u2019t leave her lips. She managed to step forward before she began trembling noticeably.</p><p>She almost slipped on the blood.</p><p>Deep in his own thoughts, Sean hardly noticed her.</p><p>\u201cThis place, the movie\u2014they have everything to do with the murder,\u201d he said, repeating what he\u2019d told her before. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>Madison stared at Sean Cameron, feeling frozen at first, and completely lost. There was nothing she could do here. She\u2019d hoped there would be, but she felt nothing except cold and fear and dread. She could picture what had happened but she couldn\u2019t see a face. She imagined the mannequin of the priest moving, saw him walking swiftly.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Saw him kill.</p><p>\u201cPoor girl, poor Jenny Henderson\u2014and poor Alistair,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cAlistair didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Madison said. Her voice was low, but her words were passionate. \u201cIt happened just the way you reenacted it. He was ahead of her and then he got to the door. Someone was already in here, waiting. Someone who knew that Alistair came to see the noir movies on Sundays, and someone who also knew about Jenny. Yes, it was taking a chance that Jenny would show up and that Alistair would fall in with her plans, but it wasn\u2019t really that big a chance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomeone\u2014or the kid. The kid does tell it your way. But there\u2019s nothing to exonerate him.\u201d</p><p>Madison was startled by the voice of Benny Knox. He\u2019d come in behind them. She\u2019d been concentrating so hard, she\u2019d forgotten he was with them.</p><p>\u201cYep, according to the kid, he walked to the door\u2014and the thing came out of the tableau. I don\u2019t know what the kid was on, but temporary insanity or whatever is probably going to be his best defense,\u201d Knox went on.</p><p>\u201cIf he says that\u2019s what happened, it\u2019s what happened. Alistair isn\u2019t on drugs, and he doesn\u2019t drink. He\u2019s a good kid\u2014which is pretty amazing when you realize the money he has access to and how everyone tries to suck up to him because of what his father might be able to do for them!\u201d Madison said angrily.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Knox lifted a hand and took a step back in mock-horror. \u201cWell, when they need character witnesses, they can call you to the stand.\u201d</p> <p>Madison tried to check her temper, but he continued quickly, \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. We are going to investigate. If the L.A. police weren\u2019t determined on that, you can guarantee the FBI would be. But you\u2019ve got to understand\u2014you\u2019re looking at a locked-room mystery here, and the thing is, if a room is really locked, the people in that room are the suspects. Nine times out of ten what you see is what you get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you see is a kid in shock and a brutally murdered young woman,\u201d Sean Cameron said. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t go counting on there being no other answer. For one thing, a costume is missing from the studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissing?\u201d Knox asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not on the mannequin,\u201d Madison said, \u201cwhere it should be\u2014where it was before I left the studio on Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it may just be somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the robe the priest wears,\u201d Sean said. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely worth investigating.\u201d</p> <p>Knox didn\u2019t dismiss his words, but he didn\u2019t seem too impressed, either. \u201cThat studio is filled with shelves and desks and nooks and crannies and...stuff. The robe may turn up easily. Yes, we\u2019ll investigate\u2014I\u2019m sure you will, too, Agent Cameron,\u201d he said to Sean. \u201cI intend to go through all the steps on my end. I\u2019m just telling you it isn\u2019t looking good for young Archer. When you show me another way in and out of this locked room, I\u2019ll be happy to reexamine the evidence.\u201d He pointed to the tableau. \u201cAs you can see, those mannequins just stand there\u2014they don\u2019t move around. They don\u2019t speak, argue or step down to commit murder. But you\u2019re right. We have all kinds of hairs and fibers and plenty of blood. In fact, we\u2019ve got forensics up the wazoo. We\u2019ve checked the locks, we\u2019ve gone over the security footage...and nada. So when you find something, let me know.\u201d</p><p>As he finished speaking, they were all shocked by a noise from the tableau. Some piece of the little scenario had shifted. The three of them immediately looked over at the characters. There was Sam Stone, ready to race across the room to save his femme fatale. And there was the man in the robe, his fingers twined around the terrified woman\u2019s neck. There was the sarcophagus and the snakes\u2014cobras posed moving across the floor and in strike mode.</p><p>The scene had shifted, of course, because the crime scene techs had been up there, photographing, fingerprinting, moving things around. That obviously explained the odd, off-kilter look of the tableau. And yet...</p><p>Madison swallowed uncomfortably. Dianna Breen seemed to be gazing not at the mysterious man in the robes about to strangle her\u2014but at Madison. Huge blue glass eyes seemed to stare across time and space.</p><p>For a moment\u2014just for a moment!\u2014she thought there\u2019d been another presence in the tunnel.</p><p>Sean Cameron walked back toward and through the tableau. \u201cGravity, I guess. Something shifted from being handled by the crime scene techs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Knox said. His voice was harsh, and Madison looked over at him. Maybe the hard-boiled just-the-facts detective was a little on edge himself.</p><p>Madison tried to define exactly how the tableau had changed. The police and technicians apparently hadn\u2019t uncovered anything they considered evidence; they\u2019d left the scene almost as they\u2019d found it. But it had changed. And Dianna Breen still seemed to be staring at her with horrified eyes.</p> <p>Last night, those realistic glass eyes had witnessed a murder.</p><p>\u201cNo sign of the weapon yet, right?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Before you arrived today, two dozen of our guys\u2014the best at their jobs\u2014went through the studio. We needed that many, which won\u2019t surprise you. The place is a hotbed of fake weapons and fake blood and fake\u2014well, you name it.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut no, we don\u2019t have the weapon yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how are you figuring that Alistair murdered the girl, fell in the blood, passed out, came to and got emergency help and somehow hid the weapon?\u201d Sean asked him.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Agent Cameron. The kid was here alone. We have experts still going through all the surveillance. He claims he raced toward Ms. Henderson and the \u2018thing\u2019 killing her and that he fell in the blood, went down and passed out. According to him, he regained consciousness, called the security guard and came back with him when the guard rushed in, followed by the cops. He claims he passed out. God knows what he was really doing or what really happened. And if someone else was here, why kill the girl and not him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you have a scapegoat if you kill everyone?\u201d Sean asked reasonably.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Madison said. \u201cIf Alistair had been killed as well, he couldn\u2019t have been blamed for the murders.\u201d</p><p>Knox was quiet a moment. \u201cI\u2019m not discounting any possibilities. I\u2019m just not emotionally involved. Are you done here for the day? We\u2019re closing up until tomorrow and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Colin Bailey?\u201d Sean broke in. \u201cDid you confirm that he was in the studio, in the security station, watching the cameras the whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBailey was the only other person on the property at all,\u201d Knox said. \u201cEverything pans out\u2014and, of course, we verified his background. His record is clean as a whistle, he\u2019s worked here twenty years and his story checks out. We\u2019re not stupid local dicks, Agent Cameron. So, are you done here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks, Detective Knox. Can one of your guys give us a ride to Archer\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Go on out. There\u2019s a fellow named Duffy in his car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, said thank you to Knox, then followed Sean out. She noticed that Knox was behind them and had to wonder if he\u2014hard-boiled L.A. detective\u2014didn\u2019t want to be in the tunnel alone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to Archer\u2019s house?\u201d Madison asked Sean. Her part was finished for today, wasn\u2019t it? She felt as if she were in limbo. She had no idea what was happening with the studio the next day. Were they all on hold?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked down at her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She found herself bristling again. \u201cBecause Eddie asked me to be in on this. Because the studio is my life. Because I may be able to help.\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her. She had the uncomfortable feeling that she was being assessed\u2014and found wanting. He was going to tell her no, that she\u2019d done her duty. To her surprise, he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019ll both go,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked away, wondering how she could feel so attracted to a man and so hostile to him at the same time. He was physically impressive, she decided. That must be it. He was also a stranger, even though he\u2019d become a legend at the studio, and it was too easy to admire what she\u2019d heard about him. She had to remember: he was law enforcement here, and she was not.</p><p>Maybe she was crazy. Maybe she should go home and get out of this now, while she had the chance.</p><p>But she knew she couldn\u2019t. She did have...an extra sense. And it was possible that she could help Eddie. She just hoped it wouldn\u2019t mean sucking up too much to Agent Cameron!</p><p>\u201cIs Eddie there?\u201d she asked. \u201cI thought he was going to go and stay with Alistair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come home,\u201d Sean assured her. \u201cI need to get more of a feel for the lay of the land,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cYou suspect someone close,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst, Bailey, who\u2019s been the most loyal watchdog in the world. Bailey! And now, someone in Eddie\u2019s household?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect everyone,\u201d he said simply. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t your fight, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Think again. I live here and I work here, Agent Cameron. The studio\u2014and Eddie\u2014are everything to me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled suddenly and she had no idea what he was thinking. \u201cDo you have plans for the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d planned to work. Now, I\u2019m not working, so I plan to do everything I can for Eddie and Alistair. No, I\u2019m not FBI or a cop, but Eddie asked me to help you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to tell him she wouldn\u2019t have had any plans. Not social plans, anyway. Life had made her too much of a loner.</p><p>Except, of course, for her unearthly friends.</p><p>She straightened, trying to appear calm, confident\u2014and determined.</p><p>\u201cOfficer Duffy is waiting,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cHe\u2019ll take us to Eddie\u2019s. If you\u2019re sure you want to plunge in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d She glared at him icily. He seemed amused. That was even more irritating.</p><p>Officer Duffy was quiet as he drove. Sean didn\u2019t try to engage him in conversation.</p><p>Instead, he glanced over at his escort, Madison Darvil.</p> <p>She\u2019s either certifiable, crazy as a loon or just like you. She talks to the dead, Eddie had told him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t crazy; she was talented. But if she talked to the dead, she might wonder if there was something inside her that wasn\u2019t exactly normal. Most people learned early on not to admit that they could communicate with the souls of the departed. Madison was probably unaware that there were actually many people with her talent scattered around the world.</p><p>She was silent during the drive. Sean thought that Eddie had picked the perfect person to help him\u2014even if he hadn\u2019t meant to draw her in this far. She did know the studio and everyone working there now; she was in on meetings and certainly trusted if she dealt with major names in the business. And aside from all that, she was slim and well-proportioned, with large, dark-lashed eyes that were exceptionally expressive and beautiful.</p><p>He suddenly wished he\u2019d met her at a party or a bar or anywhere that would allow him to ask her out. He liked her passion when she defended Eddie and even her hostility when he suggested she was no longer necessary. Something within her\u2014integrity, honesty\u2014ran very deep, and it was compelling and seductive.</p><p>He turned away, surprised. He hadn\u2019t felt like this about anyone in a very long time. Work had been his escape for years now. It wasn\u2019t that he\u2019d eschewed people, women in particular, but he\u2019d never had this sense of knowing them as he already felt he knew her. He\u2019d functioned well enough when he and Melissa had split, even though he\u2019d really loved her, and she\u2019d loved him, too. He hadn\u2019t hesitated to go back when she needed him, and it hadn\u2019t seemed like any kind of chore or sacrifice to be with her.</p> <p>Her death had changed him.</p><p>He shook off the unhappy memory. Another friend needed him.</p><p>Eddie\u2019s place wasn\u2019t far from the studio. He lived in an elegant home in a cul-de-sac where the houses started at the seven-figure mark. There was a high wall around the property and gates protected it, but when they were dropped off and Sean pushed the call button, they were answered immediately.</p><p>Sean thought that Pierce Enderly, Eddie\u2019s \u201chouse manager,\u201d would be the one to greet them. He was wrong.</p><p>Mrs. Eddie Archer, Helena LaRoux, came clip-clopping to the door on high-heeled sandals as they arrived. She swiftly ushered them in, looking past them to the gates. \u201cWere you followed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Sean shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cThe paparazzi were out there for hours!\u201d she said. The little lapdog she carried\u2014some kind of designer Peke-teacup-poodle combo\u2014let out a yap.</p><p>\u201cShh, little darling,\u201d Helena said. \u201cIt\u2019s Sean\u2014and...Madison, right?\u201d</p><p>Madison nodded. Helena gave her a puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cMadison is taking me through the studio, Helena. It\u2019s been a while since I worked there,\u201d Sean told her.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Helena smiled at Madison as if she was trying to be warm and genuine, except something in her tone made it clear that she was still confused as to why the \u201chelp\u201d would now be at her door. \u201cI knew Eddie had called you in, just didn\u2019t know there\u2019d be anyone with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie asked her to hang around with me,\u201d Sean continued.</p><p>He realized that although Madison was quiet, she meant to hold her own. \u201cI would do anything for Eddie and Alistair, Helena. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Sean lowered his head to hide the smile that teased his lips. Oh, yes, Madison could hold her own.</p> <p>\u201cEddie\u2019s still with Alistair,\u201d Helena said. \u201cI\u2019ve spent time with the boy, but...well, I\u2019m not his mother. He really does need his father now. I\u2019m so distraught! Forgive me if I\u2019ve forgotten my manners. Come in, come in!\u201d</p><p>She started clip-clopping across the marble floor again. Helena might claim she hated the paparazzi, but her platinum-blond swath of hair was sleekly brushed, her makeup was perfect and she wore skintight pedal pushers with her high-heeled sandals and a low-cut T-shirt that nicely displayed her expensive cleavage.</p><p>She led them through the grand entry to a family room connected to a huge kitchen. He didn\u2019t know if Helena liked to cook, but Eddie was a fan of culinary shows; he loved to watch and cook along with them. He must have put his foot down at some point because the family room was just that, despite Helena\u2019s high-end presence. There was a large-screen TV on the far wall and a pricey stereo system with speakers all around the room. The sofa was old leather, worn and comfortable, and there were a number of magazines spread out on the coffee table. Helena gestured at the sofa and sat in the massive armchair next to it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here, Sean. I mean, thank you for coming. You\u2019re so important to Eddie. I was heartbroken when you couldn\u2019t make our wedding,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI was on a project, Helena. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Helena patted the little dog. \u201cIt was a beautiful affair! Oh, you were there, Madison!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was quite an affair,\u201d Madison said dryly.</p><p>Helena frowned. \u201cThis is awful, so awful,\u201d she moaned. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s just broken Eddie. Everyone in the media...they already have Alistair convicted, and Eddie loves that boy so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s natural for a father to love his son,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cHelena, the media craves sensationalism, and this is definitely a sensational case. But don\u2019t worry, the media might try someone, but there\u2019s still an investigation ahead, and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll prove Alistair innocent,\u201d Sean told her.</p><p>Helena\u2019s perfectly plucked brows shot up. \u201cYou think Alistair may be innocent?\u201d</p><p>Sean felt Madison shift beside him and he almost grinned again. Apparently, she liked the newest Mrs. Archer about as much as he did.</p><p>\u201cOf course I believe he\u2019s innocent. Now I have to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes! I\u2019ve tried to be there for him.... Eddie asked me to visit Alistair. They both say he didn\u2019t do it. How wonderful that you think you can prove it,\u201d Helena said. Her voice seemed thick with an air of insincerity.</p><p>\u201cHelena, you know Alistair. You can\u2019t possibly believe he could have done such a thing, can you?\u201d Madison asked.</p><p>Sean couldn\u2019t help giving her a little nudge with his elbow. He heard the grunt she tried to swallow. Luckily, Helena didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to believe it. But...I\u2019ve worried so often about poor Alistair. I mean, Eddie is a genius, and most people in the business can tell the difference between reality and imagination\u2014but I\u2019ve warned Eddie! Sometimes, being around all that gore and all that make-believe blood...it has to have an influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were with him earlier today, Helena. How is he doing?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s in bad shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t let him know you don\u2019t have complete faith in him, did you?\u201d Sean half smiled to take the sting from his question.</p><p>\u201cOh, no! I do have faith in him,\u201d Helena said.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Archer?\u201d</p><p>Sean turned to see that Pierce had arrived at last. He was glad; Pierce was one person who truly loved Eddie. He made a good wage for what he did, and he was another factor in Eddie\u2019s life on which he couldn\u2019t be dissuaded. Pierce had handled the household since the very first Mrs. Archer, Alistair\u2019s mother, had found him poring over classified ads at a coffee shop. She\u2019d brought him home and they\u2019d discovered that he could shop, clean and manage a school list without blinking an eye. He was indispensable. Pierce was gay and had been in a relationship with his high school love all of his adult life; his partner had died of bone cancer soon after Eddie\u2019s first wife, and since that time, Pierce had given his total love and loyalty to Eddie and Alistair. In other words, Pierce was family.</p><p>But not, apparently, to Helena.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Pierce?\u201d she asked irritably.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you would like to offer Mr. Archer\u2019s guests some refreshment.\u201d</p><p>Sean rose, walking over to Pierce and giving him a hug. \u201cPierce! Great to see you. How are you holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting through, Mr. Cameron, getting through,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cStaying strong, because that\u2019s what Eddie and Alistair need now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Agent Cameron, Pierce,\u201d Helena drawled.</p><p>\u201cAgent Cameron,\u201d Pierce repeated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sean. You\u2019ve known me forever, Pierce. I\u2019m still Sean.\u201d</p><p>Pierce wasn\u2019t exactly the epitome of an old-fashioned butler. Or maybe he was the California equivalent. He was dressed in khakis and a short-sleeved cotton tailored shirt, and he wore sandals. He looked like an aging pool boy, still handsome with his blond hair turning silver and his year-round tan.</p><p>Sean imagined that it must be interesting to watch the dynamics between him and the newest Mrs. Archer\u2014especially when no one else was around.</p><p>\u201cSean, what will you have?\u201d Helena asked abruptly. \u201cMadigan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Madison, Mrs. Archer,\u201d Madison said politely. She had risen, too. Ignoring Helena, she walked over to Pierce and took his hand. \u201cEddie is in a bad way, and Alistair\u2019s worse. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all are!\u201d Helena rose, as well, and walked over, handing Pierce the dog. \u201cWill you take Perla for a walk?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Sean wondered if she wanted him out of the way while they spoke or if she was just trying to prove that he was only the hired help.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tend to drinks for our friends,\u201d she went on. \u201cSean, a Jameson? That\u2019s your poison of choice, if I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d go for some coffee right now,\u201d Sean said. \u201cMadison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee would be great,\u201d Madison agreed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Helena snatched the dog back. Clearly she wasn\u2019t interested in the effort of actually brewing coffee. \u201cFine,\u201d she sniffed. \u201cCoffee, then, Pierce. Perla can run in the yard.\u201d She hurried toward the French doors that led to the pool and patio area. \u201cNow, no doo-doo by the water, Perla! Take it out to the back, that\u2019s a good girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee, coming right up,\u201d Pierce said. He walked over to the kitchen and began preparing it. Helena caught hold of Sean\u2019s arm, leading him back to the sofa and whispering, \u201cHonestly...this house is impossible. These men\u2014my husband, Pierce\u2014they\u2019re so lost. Oh, it\u2019s dreadful. Everything is at a standstill. Did you know I was about to read for the part of Lady Macbeth in a new Shakespeare project? It\u2019s going to be wonderful, filmed along the lines of Game of Thrones with lots of swords and sorcery. Even Eddie said that hot new director thought I\u2019d be perfect for the role!\u201d She pouted. \u201cOf course now, God knows...\u201d</p><p>The house phone rang and Pierce picked it up. \u201cYes, Eddie. They\u2019re here now. Yes, I\u2019ll tell them.\u201d</p> <p>He hung up a moment later and turned. \u201cMr. Archer is on his way,\u201d he announced. He\u2019d barely finished speaking when the phone rang again, and again Pierce answered it. As Helena looked at him expectantly, he covered the mouthpiece and said, \u201cIt\u2019s Benita, Mrs. Archer. She\u2019s calling to lend her support. Will you speak with her?\u201d</p><p>Helena started to rise. \u201cBenita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the ex\u2013Mrs. Archer,\u201d Pierce said politely.</p><p>Helena paused, eyeing him with venom. Sean wasn\u2019t sure if her dislike was now aimed at Pierce or Benita. She suddenly seemed to puff up. \u201cNo! You may tell her that I\u2019m busy with the FBI. You may tell her that I\u2019m far too distraught!\u201d</p><p>Pierce dutifully did as bidden, assuring the second Mrs. Archer that he\u2019d convey her feelings and support to her ex-husband. Sean suspected that Pierce used the word ex\u2013Mrs. Archer on purpose, either to remind Helena that there were others who had loved Eddie and whom Eddie had loved, or that she, too, could be replaced.</p> <p>\u201cOh, that woman! Calling now!\u201d Helena said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI thought you two were friends.\u201d Madison smiled sweetly. \u201cI always felt it was so wonderful that you could have remained such good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Helena. In fact, we met at Eddie\u2019s marriage to Benita,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Helena waved a hand in the air. \u201cWell, yes, we\u2019re friends! But this is an intimate time. I\u2019m here to support my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you and Eddie were together when you got the call from Alistair last night?\u201d Sean asked, keeping his tone sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. I was sound asleep,\u201d Helena said. \u201cAnd then the phone rang, and... My Eddie! My poor Eddie!\u201d She hid her face in her hands.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d both been here all evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier, Eddie was out at some meeting, but I was here all day. Pierce can tell you that.\u201d She turned, gesturing at him. He carried in a tray, then set it on the coffee table. He was quick and efficient; the silver serving tray had three filled cups and saucers, milk, cream, sugar and artificial sweetener\u2014anything they might have wanted\u2014as well as plates of cookies and scones.</p><p>\u201cI mean, if you\u2019re accusing me of anything!\u201d she said, as if she\u2019d just grasped the question, horrified at what it could imply. \u201cSeriously? Sean! How could you even imagine that I...or Eddie! Oh, Sean! I thought you came here to be Eddie\u2019s friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not accusing you of anything, Helena.\u201d Sean kept his voice calm. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get a complete picture of what happened last night. Eddie had a meeting, but you were here. And then Eddie came home. What about Alistair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019d have to ask Pierce. I was out in the afternoon.\u201d She paused, realizing that she\u2019d just said she\u2019d been home. \u201cI was only out for an hour or so. Shopping. I was on Sunset. I can give you a list of the stores,\u201d she said coldly.</p><p>\u201cHelena\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you like your coffee, Sean? Do you still take it black?\u201d Pierce asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAlistair didn\u2019t leave until seven-thirty last evening. He was up doing homework until then,\u201d Pierce informed.</p><p>\u201cSo you weren\u2019t home until after seven-thirty?\u201d Sean said to Helena.</p><p>\u201cWas it that late?\u201d Helena asked Pierce. \u201cI\u2019m sure I was home by late afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mrs. Archer. Alistair had gone about an hour before you returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, there you have it. Our living calendar and timepiece here\u2014Pierce\u2014can tell you exactly where I was!\u201d Helena said. \u201cAnd when,\u201d she added.</p><p>Pierce ignored her, apparently accustomed to anything she had to say. \u201cI saw her come home,\u201d he told Sean. \u201cShe retired to her room after that and I didn\u2019t see her again until the phone call came.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cI hear a car!\u201d Madison set down her coffee and rose. \u201cI think Eddie\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Pierce strode to the door and opened it quickly, waiting while Eddie Archer parked his car in the drive. Eddie trudged toward the house, looking haggard and sad. He seemed to perk up as he entered and saw that both Sean and Madison were there.</p><p>\u201cSean, welcome, and Madison, my dear, thank you for hanging in with this. In this town, the people who love you can turn against you in the blink of an eye, so it\u2019s good to have friends,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cReal friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just made coffee,\u201d Pierce said.</p><p>\u201cYes, darling.\u201d Helena walked over to Eddie, slipping an arm around him. \u201cI was so enjoying conversation with your friends.\u201d</p><p>Eddie didn\u2019t seem to hear the edge in her voice. He was distracted, squeezing her in return and pecking her cheek, his eyes never leaving Sean\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWell, can you help me?\u201d he asked anxiously. \u201cCan you at least stop them from crucifying Alistair without even looking into other possibilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie, there\u2019s definitely room for a great deal of investigation,\u201d Sean said. \u201cDon\u2019t lose heart. I want to see the security videos myself and search the studio some more, plus the surrounding area, and check out everyone and everything in the immediate vicinity. The D.A.\u2019s office will prepare their case against Alistair, but you and your attorneys have him at the best possible place for now. The kid has to be hurting, and they can help him there. Not only that, he\u2019s out of harm\u2019s way. Yes, you\u2019ll hear terrible things\u2014and you\u2019ll have to expect that.\u201d</p><p>Eddie nodded, and Sean prayed he could prove that Alistair was innocent. In the meantime, he wanted Eddie to remain positive, but it was going to be a long haul. He could imagine what the court case was going to be like.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my friend. Thank you. Where do we go from here?\u201d Eddie asked.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night, the rest of my team arrives. We\u2019ve already been invited in, so we can set up at the police station. I met Detective Benny Knox. We\u2019ll be working in conjunction with him.\u201d</p><p>Eddie made a face, and Sean tried to reassure him. \u201cEddie, I\u2019m with you all the way on this, but you have to see how it looks to others. As far as anyone\u2019s been able to tell thus far, Alistair was alone at the Black Box Cinema, Colin Bailey was on guard at the studio and Jenny Henderson managed to slip in. We have to prove otherwise, and that means delving into everything. Alistair\u2019s life, your life, friends, enemies\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me,\u201d Helena put in. \u201cEddie, Sean wanted to know where I was last night!\u201d</p><p>Eddie remained distracted. He didn\u2019t respond to her complaint, if he even heard it. \u201cAnything\u2014anything. Whatever you need. I\u2019m here, and I\u2019ll give you anything you want, and everyone around me will be as helpful as possible, too. Right?\u201d He looked at Helena, and it was evident that he\u2019d hardly been aware of her.</p><p>\u201cOf course, sweetheart, of course,\u201d Helena said.</p><p>Eddie stepped away to face Madison, taking her hands. \u201cThank you, thank you, Madison. I know this isn\u2019t what you do...but I need you. This is Alistair\u2019s life,\u201d he said passionately.</p><p>Madison gazed back at him, and Sean saw himself, years before, when he\u2019d first met Eddie. The guy was an absolute icon, an idol to anyone who loved special effects. And he was so down to earth, so generous...Sean could see that she was controlling her emotions as she listened to him and then spoke. \u201cEddie, Alistair is a great kid, a great person, and I\u2019m happy to be there for him\u2014and for you\u2014in any way possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, thank you,\u201d Eddie said again. \u201cSean, what do you need from me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour schedule yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Eddie nodded. \u201cWoke up, ate bran flakes here and ran by the studio, just to see that everything was okay for lockdown. After that, I left and met with Myron Silver and Harvey Anderson, producer and director on the Shakespeare movie that\u2019s gearing up. I went back to Harvey\u2019s home studio to look at his storyboards. I talked to Alistair on the phone about seven to see if he was up for dinner, but he\u2019d already eaten at home with Pierce, so I went to a fast-food drive-through, grabbed a veggie burger and came home. I watched a few of my cooking shows and went to bed. And then I got the phone call. I rushed to the Black Box, and then to the police station, where I called my lawyer. And soon after that, I called you and...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThen I called the governor. I campaigned for him, and I said I needed help and that I thought I knew the people who could provide it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you saw Alistair?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cAt breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Pierce cleared his throat. \u201cAlistair was here all afternoon. He was on the computer for a while, and he took a swim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think the kid\u2019s innocent, why are you asking questions about him?\u201d Helena demanded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause it proves where he was before the murder, and that he wasn\u2019t at the studio or the museum stashing the knife,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cBut if he killed the girl in a jealous rage\u2014\u201d Helena began to say, then obviously remembered that Eddie was there, and that while Alistair might not be her biological son he meant the world to her husband. She flushed. \u201cI\u2019m just afraid that\u2019s how the police will probably see it,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we have to find out who might\u2019ve been at the studio. Who knows it well enough to hide there and escape and to do it without tracking blood anywhere,\u201d Sean said evenly.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone could have planned this?\u201d Eddie asked in horror.</p><p>\u201cSomeone would have to have planned it. Someone who knew the studio, like I said, but also your son\u2019s schedule, the movie and special-effects business, and either knew about evidence or studied police and forensics procedure,\u201d Sean told him. \u201cThe answer isn\u2019t going to jump out at us. We\u2019re going to have to dig until we find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll dig. We\u2019ll dig into anything and everything. Everything.\u201d Eddie repeated the last word fervently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to visit Alistair tomorrow,\u201d Sean said. \u201cFor now, I\u2019m sure Madison wants to get home, and I need to check in to my hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can just stay here, you know,\u201d Eddie offered.</p> <p>\u201cEddie, you made wonderful hotel arrangements for us. Actually, I wouldn\u2019t mind some time alone, until my team shows up. Space to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, by all means, get checked in. I put your luggage in the little Prius outside. I figure you can use that while you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Thanks, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>Eddie groped in his pockets and came out with a handful of keys. He dropped several; they all bent down to retrieve them at the same time. Madison banged into Sean and he caught himself once again studying the young woman with the wide eyes who was supposed to help him.</p><p>The girl who spoke to ghosts, or so Eddie said.</p><p>He paused for a moment. She was stunning, and in a way a woman like Helena would never understand. Those eyes of hers! Blue as the sky and framed by rich dark lashes. Her face was a classic oval that no amount of money could buy. Her dark hair was long and naturally wavy. He couldn\u2019t avoid noticing that her body was shapely, lean, athletic\u2014with curves in all the right places. Curves that weren\u2019t exposed by a low-cut neckline or contained in sausage-skin pants.</p> <p>Startled by his assessment\u2014and trying to tell himself that it was so positive because he really disliked Helena\u2014he stood again, glancing at her apologetically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Madison. I\u2019m fumbling all over the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I dropped the keys,\u201d Eddie muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s understandable, Eddie,\u201d Madison said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was driving competently all day, I swear it,\u201d Eddie insisted, half-humorously.</p><p>Sean grinned. \u201cWe know. We drove with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow,\u201d Eddie said.</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I\u2019ll see Alistair,\u201d Sean told him. \u201cCan you tell them I\u2019ll be there, midmorning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely, and he\u2019ll be glad to see you\u2014and Madison, too. Will you come and assure him he has friends?\u201d Eddie asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Madison said. \u201cOf course I will.\u201d</p><p>Eddie nodded, his expression grateful. \u201cThey\u2019re giving Alistair a sedative tonight. Doctor says he\u2019ll sleep for hours.\u201d He looked at Sean again. \u201cIf the cops could just understand what this has done to him, how he\u2019s feeling...they\u2019d know he couldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d</p><p>Helena put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cAre they keeping the studio closed, Eddie? What about the work you have going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still down tomorrow. We\u2019ll be back up in a day,\u201d Eddie said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYou have so many people depending on you for their livelihood, dear,\u201d Helena said softly. \u201cLike Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with whatever you choose to do,\u201d Madison told Eddie. \u201cAs I\u2019m sure everyone at the studio is.\u201d</p><p>Eddie almost smiled. \u201cThe police want to go through the studio once more. And then, apparently, it\u2019s all right for business to go on as usual, even if your son had been accused of murder and a girl died horribly on your property. Oh, Sean, I\u2019m assuming your team will want to search the place, too?\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. He was fairly certain that Eddie believed their relationship meant there was someone who cared actively seeking the truth. He also realized that Eddie Archer had read up on the Krewe of Hunters. And he might have called them in simply because he had a greater belief in the FBI\u2014or because he\u2019d learned something about the Krewe and hoped that one of them could just speak to a ghost and come up with the answer he wanted.</p><p>It was never that easy. But tonight wasn\u2019t the time to tell Eddie that the Krewe worked like any other law enforcement agency, searching out clues, forensics and facts.</p><p>\u201cEddie, you need rest,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, but try to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, thank you,\u201d Eddie murmured. \u201cOh, hey! It\u2019s late. How about dinner? Would you like me to cook something?\u201d</p><p>Normally, Sean would\u2019ve said yes. Cooking would have taken Eddie\u2019s mind off his situation. But he still had things to do, things he wanted done that night.</p><p>\u201cWe can stop at an In-N-Out Burger, if that works for you, Madison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like a burger,\u201d she said.</p><p>They moved to the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for coming.\u201d Helena nodded her head regally.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your hospitality,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Madison waved to Pierce, who was hovering behind the group. He solemnly raised a hand in farewell.</p><p>As they went out to the front, Eddie followed them, pointing to a new Prius in the driveway. \u201cI\u2019ll hit the key guard on the gate,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd get in, get in!\u201d Helena called. \u201cEddie, that car over there\u2014it\u2019s paparazzi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let them take a picture of a grieving father,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d</p><p>Eddie really didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>Sean observed rather cynically that Helena joined him, and that she posed, her face arranged in a mask of deep concern, her hips jutting out and her breasts high, hands draped with loving tenderness over the arm of her famous husband.</p><p>5</p><p>They walked to the car, with Sean pausing to open the passenger-side door for Madison. She slid in silently. He came around to join her, and waved as Eddie opened the gate. Then he eased the car out into the cul-de-sac.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to drop me,\u201d Madison said. \u201cDo you need some directions? Oh\u2014there is an In-N-Out Burger on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was with Eddie today when we picked you up, remember?\u201d He laughed. \u201cAnd I know I can find a burger place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, but you don\u2019t live here anymore. I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d remember how to get around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lived here long enough,\u201d he told her. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s a little much to get used to again, after living in San Antonio. But I do still know my way around. I\u2019m about to prove it\u2014In-N-Out Burger ahead on the left. Shall we get something to go, or eat in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving, so eat in, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d she said.</p><p>They ordered and brought their food to a table. For a moment, they ate in silence; he was hungry, too. He found himself liking the fact that his companion ate with enthusiasm. She didn\u2019t play with her food or pretend she didn\u2019t intend to down her entire burger and fries, but she was fastidiously neat as she did so. It seemed they\u2019d tacitly agreed not to speak about the case during dinner. Instead, they casually discussed California weather and the differences between Texas and California. She thought that Texas created a breed all its own; he thought that was equally true of California, whether people were born there or became Californians by choice.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, they were done and back in the car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m much help to you,\u201d she said as they entered freeway traffic. \u201cI felt you knew the studio as well as I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. So much depends on the latest project. And that\u2019s especially important with this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever killed that girl knows the studio, beyond a doubt. Knows everything about it\u2014as it is right now.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThere are dozens of people who work there\u2014probably forty full-time staff, and another twenty brought in on special projects, some of whom end up staying. And there are the different actors and actresses, set designers, directors, cinematographers, prop masters and so on who come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the killer is not going to be a producer who stopped by to check on props or the costumer who drops in once. Whoever did this knows the studio. Backward and forward.\u201d He frowned. \u201cThis particular movie may well be a factor, too. Unless the connection\u2014between The Unholy and the Sam Stone film\u2014was intended to throw us off track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why didn\u2019t you start with the studio workers?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEveryone who\u2019s worked at the studio in any capacity is being questioned, and alibis will be examined. I\u2019m sure that Knox already has a list, and if there were any red flags, he would\u2019ve told me. When my team gets here, we can divide and conquer. But I have a feeling it\u2019s not going to be a regular employee or film person, unless it\u2019s someone really close to Eddie. Whoever did this not only knows the studio, as I said\u2014they know Eddie Archer. And Alistair...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone like a stepmother? Because that little visit was...interesting,\u201d Madison said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I guess interesting is the wrong description. Were we making a courtesy call, or were we trying to make sure she\u2019s supporting Eddie?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He flashed a smile. \u201cInteresting was exactly the right word. And we were doing both of those things. In this kind of situation, you do try to draw out everyone who\u2019s close to the victims\u2014and I\u2019m considering Eddie and Alistair victims, too.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her phone and then at him as he continued. \u201cI haven\u2019t been here in a while,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s been several years since I worked for Eddie. I\u2019ve met Helena before, but I can\u2019t say I really know her. Still, they haven\u2019t been married that long.\u201d</p><p>She looked away from him then, and Sean thought she\u2019d pursed her lips, trying to keep certain opinions to herself.</p> <p>Then, apparently, she couldn\u2019t. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t sound as if they\u2019re sharing a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>She grinned, lifting her phone. \u201cJust got a text from Pierce. I quote, \u2018Not trying to cause trouble, but FYI Helena and Eddie in different rooms. Eddie wouldn\u2019t know if she was there or not.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood old Pierce! Now, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the marriage is rotten\u2014some people snore, or toss and turn, and if you\u2019re rich enough and have enough rooms, you can afford to sleep separately if you choose. But most people married a little more than a year are still enamored of being married and happy to sleep together regardless of the snoring, tossing, morning breath\u2014whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the feeling that Helena likes her personal world to be ruled by her own desires,\u201d Madison said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019ll bet she has Eddie believing that they\u2019re happiest having their own private domains. I think Eddie\u2019s still committed to his marriage. And who am I to judge? Maybe they do love each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t treat us the way she\u2019d like to in front of him, that\u2019s for sure. Well, me especially. I\u2019m definitely servant status. But she\u2019s smart enough not to let Eddie know that,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Sean chuckled. \u201cAh, come on, spit it out. You don\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never had much to do with her,\u201d Madison explained. \u201cI was at the wedding, and all she did was sweep by the tables as a beautiful bride on Eddie\u2019s arm. They filmed the wedding and reception, so she was all smiles. She comes through the studio now and then, and never acknowledges any of us. I didn\u2019t think anything of it\u2014I was always working. Today is probably the most I\u2019ve ever spoken with her,\u201d Madison said. She was quiet for a minute. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t say I like Helena.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood instincts,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEddie loves her. He must love her, right? He married her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t love Alistair. It\u2019s funny, I always thought she at least liked him and cared about him, but today I realized that her affection for Alistair is really just a show for Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, because I think Helena loves Helena too much to be interested in someone else\u2019s child. But to be fair, she\u2019s hearing what everyone\u2019s heard so far\u2014that Alistair was the only person with a young woman when she was brutally murdered,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Sean turned down her street, noting that Madison remained pensive. When he pulled into her driveway, she took a deep breath. \u201cMrs. Archer is superficial, she\u2019s a caricature and she gives dozens of really great actresses a bad name. She\u2019s indifferent to Alistair at best, and I\u2019m not convinced she loves Eddie for anything other than what she figures he can do for her. But I don\u2019t believe she murdered anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I can tell, she\u2019s not bright enough to have done it, and no person with the ability to pull off that kind of stunt would have her as a conspirator.\u201d</p> <p>He had to grin at that.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Madison continued, \u201cwhy would she kill a budding actress who\u2019d never be up for the same roles, not to mention the fact that Jenny was just breaking in, trying for bit parts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it mattered that it was Jenny. I think the killer knew Alistair liked to go and watch movies alone on Sunday nights. And that Jenny planned to slip in and try to get Alistair to take her into the studio to learn what she could about The Unholy. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. It\u2019s someone close to Eddie, someone who wants to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlistair\u2019s the one being accused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlistair being accused is important. But Eddie\u2019s had more time to make enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone loves Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, someone does not,\u201d he said. He saw her lips tighten and discovered that he liked her more and more. She was a loyal friend\u2014and, of course, he shared her admiration for and love of Eddie Archer.</p><p>She stepped out of the car and peered at him through the window. \u201cThanks for the ride, Agent.\u201d She gave him a smile. \u201cAnd the burger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the escort,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He watched her as she walked up the pathway to her house and he found himself noting the way that she moved\u2014the lift of her head and the sway of dark hair down her back. She turned and waved. He raised a hand in return. He liked her, he recognized again.</p><p>She was the real deal.</p><p>Sometimes that was hard to find in Hollywood\u2014or anywhere.</p><p>She paused at the door, saw that he was still there and returned to the car, coming around to the driver\u2019s side. He lowered the window.</p><p>\u201cJust curious\u2014but are you this honest with everyone? I mean, should I be quiet about what you\u2019ve told me?\u201d she asked him worriedly.</p><p>\u201cIn my book, practically everyone is a suspect, Madison,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Eddie trusts you, and wants you to be my right hand. So, I may say things that really are just between us\u2014or you, me and the team.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOkay. Thanks. I guess I\u2019m not a suspect, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you last night?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHere. Except that I\u2019m not so sure I do have an alibi. I was with a friend at a coffee shop until about five, and that I can prove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGut instinct. It\u2019s never failed me yet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it, Agent. Well, good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not driving away,\u201d she said, eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cI will when you\u2019re inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Texas thing,\u201d he told her, grinning.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Good night again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see Alistair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>He waited until she\u2019d unlocked her door, pulling out his cell phone as he did, then watched her door close.</p><p>He sat another minute, gazing thoughtfully at her house. The last half year had been hectic; he\u2019d made an enormous change in his life. And before that...</p><p>Before that, for a long time, he\u2019d been going through the motions. He still loved film and effects\u2014he always would\u2014and in his new capacity on the team, film was his specialty. Work was the great panacea. It was odd to feel that he already knew Madison Darvil better than half the friends he had back in Texas, although the team had become his family. Of course, one member of the team actually was his family. Kelsey O\u2019Brien was his cousin, and maybe it wasn\u2019t so unusual that they\u2019d come to the same place at the same time, since they shared their strange talent. But before they\u2019d been brought together to solve the bizarre murders in San Antonio...</p><p>He\u2019d been going through the motions. Today...today had felt real. Something about Madison Darvil had gotten to him. She was smart, and she was beautiful in a completely natural way. But it was more than that.</p><p>He hit the cell number for LAPD\u2019s lead detective on the case. A weary-sounding Benny Knox answered and gave his grudging promise to meet Sean at the morgue in twenty minutes.</p><p>Bogie was watching reruns of I Love Lucy.</p><p>When she walked in, however, he immediately turned his full attention to her. The way he looked at her, with such concern, was moving. She thought that his ability to focus totally must have been part of what had made him such a great actor\u2014and screen icon.</p><p>\u201cYou look worn-out,\u201d he said.</p><p>Madison shrugged. \u201cI showed the FBI guy around the studio. We went down to the tunnel, and I saw all the blood, but that was nothing compared to seeing Mrs. Archer and then Eddie. My heart is breaking for him, Bogie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you still think the kid didn\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, crashing down on the sofa beside him. \u201cThis guy I took around today used to work at the studio before he moved back to Texas. How he went from film to the FBI, I don\u2019t know. But he believes in Alistair and Eddie, and he must be with some really special unit because they\u2019re being given the lead on the investigation. It probably helps that Eddie called the governor to get his way\u2014the first time I\u2019ve ever seen him throw his weight around. But I understand Eddie\u2019s logic. You almost have to understand the business to really grasp that someone could have gotten away with doing this and leaving no trace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there always a trace these days? At least, that\u2019s what I see on the forensic shows.\u201d</p><p>Madison waved a hand. \u201cSo they say. You take something and you leave something behind\u2014the law of science. But...it does look bad. Of course, I haven\u2019t spoken with Alistair yet. And until I do tomorrow, I won\u2019t know exactly what he saw and what he thought he saw. But I have to say, I have hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good, kid, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and patted her on the knee. She didn\u2019t feel his touch, but she felt something. Maybe it was movement in the air. Maybe it was some awareness deep inside her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do all right, kid. You\u2019re going to do all right. Remember, if you need me\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust whistle.\u201d She smiled at him and wondered if he knew that he\u2019d been buried with a whistle. She decided not to bring up the subject of his funeral services.</p><p>Instead, she got to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d she told Bogie. But before she could move, she heard a loud mewl of protest. The sound startled her so much that she jumped, and then realized she\u2019d ignored poor Ichabod. \u201cCorrection! I\u2019m going to feed Ichabod, and then go to bed!\u201d</p><p>The cat followed her into the kitchen, and she stroked his sleek fur as she gave him treats and filled his bowl. \u201cPoor Ichabod! I forgot you. What is this world coming to?\u201d she asked. The cat eyed her soulfully. \u201cFinish up, use the litter box and come cuddle when you\u2019re ready,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>Back in the living room, she saw that Bogie was no longer watching the television, which was still on. He stood thoughtfully by the window, staring out into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He glanced back at her. \u201cSleep tight, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. If you want to continue watching Lucy, please keep the volume low, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and gave her his rueful, self-mocking grin. \u201cWant a good old quote? \u2018Here\u2019s looking at you, kid.\u2019 And I like what I see. Go on now, and get some sleep.\u201d She saw a worried frown creasing his brow as she went to her room.</p> <p>Bogie had become a true legend, she reflected, and it wasn\u2019t just the roles he played\u2014the cynical tough guy with a heart of gold and courage to match. He was a brilliant actor, but she thought she was privy to something more. Bogie had been far more fascinating than even his greatest characters. More fascinating than any legend. Yes, he\u2019d been flawed\u2014who wasn\u2019t?\u2014but underneath it all, he was deeply moral and unfailingly kind.</p><p>She paused at her bedroom door and turned back. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Bogie, honestly. I want to do whatever I can to help Alistair and Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you should. And all is well. I\u2019m looking out for you, kid.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what he could do for her, but she smiled and said, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later she\u2019d had a bath and was ready for bed. The lights were out and she was curled comfortably under her sheets. But tired as she was, sleep eluded her.</p><p>She found herself thinking about Alistair, and then Sean Cameron. Eddie had chosen her specifically, but it wasn\u2019t because she knew special effects better than anyone else.</p> <p>It was because he\u2019d been with her in the cemetery one day.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see ghosts every time she was in a cemetery. She\u2019d come to understand that those not ready to move on usually didn\u2019t inhabit places where they hadn\u2019t been happy; it wasn\u2019t that they were unhappy at a cemetery\u2014they were just dead when they got there. The ghosts she\u2019d seen and communicated with tended to frequent places they\u2019d loved. For some, it was an old home, for others, maybe a bar or a dance hall. Once she\u2019d even met a young boy, who\u2019d died tragically in an auto accident, at a baseball field.</p><p>She didn\u2019t always know\u2014unless she reached out to touch and she just didn\u2019t touch that many strangers\u2014whether the people she met were alive or dead. Such had been the case with Bogie. She\u2019d been convinced that he was an actor. A damned good look-alike, but surely not the real thing.</p><p>But, of course, he was. Like the man she\u2019d talked to in Peace Cemetery, the graveyard that abutted the studio. It was one of the oldest in the city, only a few years behind Evergreen Cemetery, receiving its first burials in 1879. These included the faithful of St. Bartholomew\u2019s, which was now just a chapel but had been a small, functioning church. St. Bartholomew\u2019s and its parishioners had moved on to a new location in the 1920s and the cemetery had become the property of the county. It was a beautiful place, where late-Victorian funerary art mingled with modern black marble slabs and off-kilter art. The one-time owner of all the land in the area\u2014including the studio and the Black Box Cinema\u2014Lucas Claymore, was buried there, like the rest of his family. It was Lucas she met one day while walking with Eddie to sketch tombstones he liked. She had begun to chat with Lucas, and he\u2019d told her about the property. She hadn\u2019t understood that he wasn\u2019t real until she saw the way Eddie was staring at her. She\u2019d tried to explain it away, but obviously Eddie hadn\u2019t forgotten. A few years later, when one of his old employees died\u2014a master of masks\u2014she had seen him at his funeral. He\u2019d died at the age of ninety-something, and he was pleasantly surprised and gratified by all the people who\u2019d attended. She\u2019d thought she\u2019d been unnoticed, assuring the old man that he\u2019d been adored, but Eddie had slipped an arm around her shoulders and whispered, \u201cTell him goodbye for me.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d believed she could walk into the tunnel and emerge with an instant answer. But life wasn\u2019t like that. Apparently, neither was death.</p><p>The very first time, it had been her friend Billy. A bee sting on a sunny day had killed him when he was only six. As she\u2019d stood near his grave, her hand in her mother\u2019s, she\u2019d seen him across the cemetery. Later, at the reception, he\u2019d come to her and told her he was all right, and to please make sure his mother knew that. He wanted to go along the sunlit path ahead of him; he could hear children playing and the soft voice of a woman who\u2019d watch over him until he saw his own mother again.</p><p>But she\u2019d quickly learned that you didn\u2019t tell other people when you saw the dead. Her mother had gone white when Madison talked about Billy; she\u2019d pulled Madison aside and told her she mustn\u2019t say anything, anything at all. Billy\u2019s mother was in enough pain as it was.</p><p>Other people, she\u2019d soon figured out, didn\u2019t see or talk to the dead. And they didn\u2019t believe anyone else did or could, either. To them, the very suggestion was crazy.</p> <p>Her mother wasn\u2019t being cruel; she just didn\u2019t believe in ghosts and she empathized with Billy\u2019s mother. She couldn\u2019t begin to imagine how she would\u2019ve felt if it had been her child who\u2019d died, and she desperately wanted to spare Billy\u2019s family any more agony.</p><p>Madison listened to the low hum of voices from the TV in the living room and hoped they would lull her to sleep. She started as she felt the weight of Ichabod leaping up on the bed. She pulled him to her and rubbed his ears.</p><p>The worst had been during her last year in high school: Josh Bollyn, the sweetest jock in the universe and, at the time, the love of her life. A night of laughter and camaraderie with friends had been destroyed when someone threw something out of a car. A bottle. An empty liquor bottle. Someone who was just careless\u2014a litterbug, maybe a drunk litterbug\u2014had become a murderer because the bottle had hit Josh in the head as they walked along the street. The next thing she knew, he was in the emergency room because of the way the bottle had hit him.</p><p>And Josh was dying.</p><p>Nothing the doctors could do could change what the angle of the bottle had done, cracking Josh\u2019s skull and damaging the brain. She sat there and listened until his parents came, and she had to watch them and listen to the flatline....</p><p>And then Josh\u2019s words, \u201cHelp them, Madison, please, help them. Get my mother out of here, and help her. Just hold her, just stay with her....\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d stood beside her at his own funeral, sad, but saying things to her that he wanted said to others so they could let go. No one had deserved to live more than Josh, and she\u2019d stopped understanding. She had hated herself and withdrawn.</p><p>Into work. Dating had to be casual, she\u2019d decided. If she came too close, maybe... No, she hadn\u2019t caused what had happened to Josh. She knew that. But she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she was deadly luck for others, and it seemed best to retreat into herself.</p><p>And, of course, with Bogie\u2019s regular visits, even casual dates became a challenge!</p><p>Eventually, she drifted off to sleep, and her sleep was that of the exhausted, the restless\u2014and filled with dreams that really had no beginning or end.</p><p>In her dream she found herself at the studio. The L.A. smog had made its way in; low-lying gray mist pervaded the place and swept around all the creatures. Someone was behind her, chasing her, and when she turned around, she saw the evil Egyptian priest from The Unholy. She ran, and her only escape was through the door that would lead to the tunnel and the tableau of Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum.</p><p>The door to the tunnel was ajar.</p><p>She threw it open.</p><p>But when she reached the tunnel, she was slipping and sliding.</p><p>In blood.</p><p>When she tried to steady herself, another monster stood before her, blocking her escape. But it was actually the same one who\u2019d been chasing her. She stared at what should have been the mannequin of the priest, Amun Mopat\u2014but he wasn\u2019t a mannequin. He was alive and waiting for her, brandishing his curved knife.</p><p>And he had no face.</p><p>You want to see me? You want to see who I am? he asked her. Come on, keep coming, and rip away my mask. Can\u2019t walk? I\u2019ll come to you.</p><p>Madison awoke, heart pounding. She was clammy with sweat and had made a knot of the bedclothing.</p><p>But she was safe. Safe in her own room. And tomorrow was going to be a long day.</p><p>Ichabod let out a worried meow. He was at the foot of the bed, staring at her. She smiled. \u201cCome here, silly cat. I\u2019m okay now.\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t. The television in the living room wasn\u2019t loud enough. She wanted the reassurance of sound, of a benign presence on the television in her room, so she chose a cartoon channel. But she didn\u2019t lie back down right away; she walked over to her window and looked out. Chills ran down her spine.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see anything. Her street, with its rows of small old bungalows, was quiet and dark. A streetlight flickered, and for a moment, the darkness seemed heavier. There was an unrented house across the street, its foliage growing dense. The area around it looked like a dark hole\u2014no, oddly, it was more like some kind of gaping maw. Her imagination was rampant and she saw an image in the shadows created by the flickering streetlights. It was a face, a black-masked face, with malevolent eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Step outside, little girl, it seemed to say.</p><p>And she could feel the eyes, the evil in the eyes, and something that wanted her silenced.</p><p>She hurried out to the living room. Bogie wasn\u2019t there. \u201cBogie!\u201d she said, whispering his name.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t answer. She walked to the windows in the living room and gently drew back the curtain. She saw the empty house and overgrown lot from a different angle. They still seemed to create a face. And the feeling that the face had eyes that were staring at her was almost overwhelming.</p><p>Then she sensed a reassuring presence.</p><p>The L.A. County morgue was a vast place.</p><p>Sean wasn\u2019t familiar with it and despite his own credentials, he was glad he was there with a detective who knew the drill.</p><p>Benny Knox really wasn\u2019t a bad guy. It was ridiculously late at night, and only a handful of the customary staff was working. Nonetheless, getting through the formidable reception area might not have been so easy if it hadn\u2019t been for Knox, and finding a medical examiner on duty might have been a lot trickier. In a county the size of this one, few of the many bodies that went through the morgue on a daily basis were considered a middle-of-the-night priority.</p> <p>Some morgue employees managed to remember that every corpse had once been a living human being, breathing, laughing, working and playing, and, most often, loved by someone. Others became so jaded they could sit among dozens of corpses and see them as little more than evidence or specimens on a slab. In the middle of the night, most of the staff was just holding down the shift\u2014and praying there wasn\u2019t an onslaught of bodies due to an accident, earthquake or other disaster.</p><p>The attendant on duty, obviously a medical student\u2014he had his books open before him\u2014yawned. Of course, everyone had heard that it was Eddie Archer\u2019s son who\u2019d been accused of the murder, but that didn\u2019t make the victim\u2019s corpse any more exciting than all the others. The young man tracked down medical pathologist Dr. Herve Rodrique, and Rodrique, though puzzled by the hour, nodded, looked through his documentation and told them to wait. He\u2019d have the corpse taken back out to the autopsy room.</p><p>During the day, the high-profile murder victim had been a priority. The autopsy had been performed, evidenced by the Y incision clearly visible once the sheet was pulled away from Jenny Henderson\u2019s body. Dr. Rodrique hadn\u2019t done the autopsy, but he had the chart in front of him\u2014which, he informed them pointedly, looking over the spectacles that sat low on his nose, had already been sent to the police.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Knox said, \u201cbut Agent Cameron is not a policeman, he\u2019s with the FBI. And he wants to see the corpse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there she is,\u201d Rodrique said. \u201cFemale, twenty years old, five-nine, weight one-fifteen. If we hadn\u2019t had a clean identity on her, we would have discovered it. Breast implant surgery about a year ago, and the serial numbers on the implants match the ID we were given. She was in excellent health when she was killed, and no trace of drugs or alcohol was found in her system, although we\u2019re still waiting on some tests. Cause of death\u2014well, gentlemen, that\u2019s obvious. I don\u2019t believe anyone needed a medical degree to see what killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of knife was used?\u201d Sean asked.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s see...Chang writes that it must have had a sharp point\u2014but the edges of the wound are rough, as if the edge of the knife wasn\u2019t sharp, and a lot of pressure was put into the kill. Not a serrated edge, but it\u2019s as if the flesh was ripped more than slashed.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded, and looked down at Jenny Henderson. She\u2019d been a pretty girl. Her eyes were closed and she almost appeared to sleep\u2014except for the red line of the knife wound that had ended her life.</p><p>And a corpse was never truly indicative of the real person who had lived and breathed and laughed...</p><p>Talk to me, please talk to me. Help me, because even if you were using him, I know you cared about Alistair, and I know you don\u2019t want him to pay for what someone else did.</p><p>But the corpse of Jenny Henderson lay still and unmoving. Not that he\u2019d expected her to rise or to speak....</p><p>Jenny, please, I\u2019m here to help. There has to be justice, if you\u2019re to find peace, if you\u2019re to go on.</p><p>Then it seemed\u2014or in his mind\u2019s eye, at least that her eyes opened. She looked at him, and her face changed. Her features no longer seemed sunken. She gazed at him, and he heard words that were fraught with terror.</p><p>I\u2019m so scared. I\u2019m dead, I see it, I know it, and I\u2019m so scared.</p> <p>That was when Sean always felt at a loss\u2014when the dead expressed their fears. What lay beyond? He didn\u2019t know. No one knew, because once you walked from your own death and into the light that beckoned, there was no returning.</p><p>Jenny, you were a beautiful young lady, he told her silently. You don\u2019t need to be scared.</p><p>I did use Alistair! she whispered, sounding miserable. If I let go, I\u2019ll end up in hell.</p><p>I can\u2019t claim that I know God, Jenny, but hell is reserved for evil. Of that I\u2019m certain. And if you can help us find the truth, we can help you find your way.</p><p>He heard her sobbing. Life. A precious gift. It had been stolen from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he staring at?\u201d Sean heard Rodrique ask Knox.</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d Knox muttered back. \u201cWho knows what they teach at the FBI Academy these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d Rodrique said. And in his peripheral vision, Sean could see the man looking at his watch.</p><p>\u201cYou got a dinner date?\u201d Knox asked him.</p><p>Rodrique flushed. \u201cI have mounds of paperwork!\u201d he said indignantly.</p><p>Jenny! Sean whispered in his mind. Help me. Alistair didn\u2019t do this to you. Who did?</p><p>She began to cry again.</p><p>Who, Jenny?</p><p>No, no, not Alistair. Never Alistair.</p><p>Then who?</p><p>The man.</p><p>What man?</p><p>The mannequin man. The one in the robe.</p><p>It seemed that she turned her head toward him. That her eyes were open and staring beseechingly into his.</p><p>The mannequin man, she repeated. The man with no face.</p><p>Madison screamed. She spun around, ready to swing and fight.</p><p>\u201cHey! It\u2019s just me. Lord help us, it\u2019s just me, Bogie!\u201d</p><p>Madison released a shaky sigh. \u201cOh, Bogie! It\u2019s that house across the street. This is crazy, but I\u2019m seeing a face in it, and it\u2019s scaring me, and... Sorry, I feel like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>He studied her expression. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty creepy-looking, all right,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd after the day you\u2019ve had...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need sleep,\u201d Madison moaned.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll come and sit in that chair in your room. Maybe you\u2019ll sleep then?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find an I Love Lucy rerun. And,\u201d Bogie added, \u201cI\u2019ll watch that house across the street. If anything moves...I\u2019ll wake you in a flash!\u201d</p><p>Vengeance was angry.</p><p>Vengeance had waited. For hours.</p><p>Tonight...yes, tonight.</p><p>No, it couldn\u2019t be tonight. Cameron hadn\u2019t left until she\u2019d walked in and locked the door. And if Vengeance broke into her house, that would be careless, and might give everything away. Alistair was locked up, and there would be nothing clever or devious about a kill tonight; killing tonight would be against the plan.</p><p>The plan was everything...at least it had been. It still was, yes, it was. It had to be.</p><p>But...</p><p>The damned girl! There was something about her, something that made Vengeance uneasy. It was as if she had extra eyes. She kept silent, but there were times when...</p><p>Times when it seemed that she saw what others did not.</p><p>Maybe she was just crazy. Yes, that was it. Vengeance had seen her when she appeared to be talking to someone.... Someone who was no longer alive.</p><p>Like at a funeral...</p><p>And Vengeance had seen her walking in the cemetery, as if she was visiting old friends....</p><p>Vengeance had felt compelled to come tonight. Because of Madison. She shouldn\u2019t have been part of this. And Cameron was back. Vengeance didn\u2019t like it at all\u2014none of this was part of the plan.</p><p>Control, careful organization and control. And yet, angry, frustrated, Vengeance still felt power in watching.</p><p>There was nothing to see. Madison Darvil\u2019s house had gone dark except for the night-light on the porch and a pale glow within. The television. The damned television ran night and day. But maybe that would be good. Noise to cover up whatever might happen.</p><p>Now...</p><p>No, not now.</p><p>Now was the time to watch and wait. Time to devise a clever way to rid the world of Madison Darvil and her enormous blue, all-seeing eyes. Such a waste; such a talent; such a beauty.</p><p>But this was Hollywood. Hollywood could steal beauty.</p><p>And Hollywood could kill it.</p><p>Outside the plan. Too soon, too close\u2014and outside the plan! Vengeance was not a cold-blooded killer!</p><p>Vengeance was...vengeance.</p><p>6</p><p>Sean was glad that Eddie was rich. No matter how hard a city, county, state or the federal government tried, it was difficult to fund decent hospitals on public money.</p><p>Alistair Archer was free on bail but required to remain under mental health authority and wear an ankle cuff. Thanks to Eddie\u2019s hard work and resources, Alistair was at the Churchill/Dunlap Treatment and Therapy Resource Center. It was an exclusive hospital where many a Hollywood mogul had come, whether to overcome drug or alcohol abuse\u2014or await trial in a high-profile criminal case.</p><p>L.A. could be a brutal place, Sean knew. The county was home to some of the wealthiest people in the country\u2014film stars, producers, directors and those who made their money behind the scenes. It also included East L.A., gangs, violence and drugs. In the prisons, habitual criminals often ruled the roost, and men and women accused of certain crimes might not survive to come to a fair and equitable trial. People in the county tried. Not only did the richest and most famous of American royalty live here, but the place was steeped in an artistic temperament and an egalitarian ideology. However, sheer weariness could whittle away at those benevolent impulses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Technically, Alistair was out on bail, despite the stipulation for the ankle cuff and psychiatric care. But Eddie was smart to see to it that Alistair was in a respected\u2014if exclusive\u2014hospital with a wing for those who might be dangerous to themselves or others.</p><p>Had he been someone else\u2019s son, Alistair might have ended up in a hellhole.</p><p>Instead, he was in a facility where the security guards wore designer uniforms and a valet parked every car that arrived. The lobby, where Sean and Madison checked in, was marble and chrome, and even the metal detectors were high-end. Security was tight, and it took them several minutes to be allowed through and then escorted to Alistair\u2019s wing and down a long corridor to his room.</p> <p>Madison had been polite and quiet through most of the drive and Sean sensed that she was anxious. Her eyes were wide as they neared Alistair\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cLooks like a spa,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWith Uzis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not packing Uzis, but, yes, it\u2019s staggeringly expensive, and while you\u2019re awaiting trial for some terrible crime, you can have a massage,\u201d he said, a bit cynically. \u201cWe may all be equal, but it\u2019s true that money talks\u2014and very loudly, too. Eddie managed to get Alistair arraigned almost immediately and his attorney offered this solution while they wait for a trial date. He could be at home, but Eddie thought this was better and safer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Until it\u2019s proven that Alistair is innocent,\u201d she told him, bravado in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWe both agree on that.\u201d</p> <p>A guard unlocked the door for them.</p><p>The room was hardly the customary jail cell or hospital room. It was a suite. They could see the bed through an open doorway, while the main door opened into a parlor or seating area with a wide-screen TV and game station.</p><p>There was a table in the center of the room, and Alistair was seated there with his father; they both appeared calm and were engaged in a game of gin rummy.</p><p>Alistair, dressed in jeans and a rock band T-shirt, glanced up as they were ushered in. When he saw them, a look of hope and pleasure flashed across his features and he leaped to his feet. He raced over to them, throwing his arms around Madison first, holding on to her tightly, and then hugging Sean with equal enthusiasm. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it!\u201d he cried, stepping back, studying them both as if he was afraid they were a mirage. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe my friends could have faith in me\u2014I mean...I know what it looks like. Oh, God, I know what it looks like. And I\u2019m not crazy, I swear to God, I\u2019m not crazy. I didn\u2019t lose my mind and kill her. I was nuts about her\u2014 I...I don\u2019t care what they keep trying to say to me, I\u2019m not crazy and I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alistair!\u201d Madison said, hugging him again. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right. We will find out the truth.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then shook his head and burst into tears. \u201cIt can\u2019t be all right. She\u2019s dead. Jenny is dead. Nothing can ever be okay again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlistair, I didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d Madison told him, sorrow in her voice. \u201cWe do believe you, and we\u2019ll learn the truth, and we\u2019ll make sure the whole world knows you\u2019re innocent.\u201d</p><p>Sean hoped she wasn\u2019t naively giving Alistair promises they couldn\u2019t keep. It didn\u2019t look good at all. And yet...he did believe Alistair. Anyone might conclude that the young man didn\u2019t even know what he\u2019d done, that he\u2019d had a psychotic break, killed Jenny Henderson, blacked out\u2014with no recollection of anything. That was the logical explanation in a locked-room case in which the accused was so passionately and sincerely sure he was innocent.</p><p>But Sean reminded himself that he\u2019d actually communicated with the victim. And Jenny Henderson might not have known who\u2019d killed her, but she had been certain it wasn\u2019t Alistair.</p><p>It was still going to be incredibly difficult to prove what a dead eyewitness knew.</p><p>And yet, maybe not. It hadn\u2019t been a random murder. Had Jenny been targeted? Not likely. As he\u2019d already observed, Eddie and Alistair were the ones who\u2019d been targeted, and if the Krewe could delve into the situation and find a motive, they could trace a path through the maze.</p><p>Eddie had stood, as well, and watched Alistair greet Madison and Sean. He spoke up quietly. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cI can hardly be effective if I don\u2019t talk to Alistair.\u201d</p><p>Eddie smiled at Madison and let out a sigh. \u201cSit down, please.\u201d He collected the playing cards and set them, with the score pad, on a corner of the table. \u201cEveryone, sit down, and then, Alistair, you tell them what happened. And remember, think hard. Tell them every little detail that comes to mind.\u201d</p> <p>Eddie sat as he spoke; Madison took a chair across from him. Sean followed her, and Alistair sat next to his father, facing Sean and Madison.</p><p>\u201cJenny snuck in to see you, right?\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stared down at his hands. \u201cI told the police all of this. I told them everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter, Alistair. You need to tell us,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Alistair released a long breath. \u201cEverything. Okay. I went to the Black Box Cinema. I waved in the direction of the camera when I arrived, trying to let Colin Bailey know I was there. I went in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were at home before you went to the cinema?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Alistair nodded. \u201cHome, and then straight to the cinema. I went and got the reels for Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum. I love that movie. It\u2019s not as well-known as some film noir, but I love that movie\u2014and I\u2019m thrilled we\u2019re doing the special effects for the remake. I was just watching the part where Dianna Breen comes to Sam Stone\u2019s office to tell him how she couldn\u2019t possibly have killed her husband when Jenny snuck in on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d she get in?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Alistair looked troubled. \u201cShe said I left the door open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>Seconds ticked by as Alistair\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cWell, she said I did. That surprised me.\u201d He glanced at his father. \u201cI realize I\u2019m privileged. I try to be super careful to follow all my dad\u2019s rules. But...honestly, I just don\u2019t know. I thought I\u2019d locked it. Maybe I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Alistair, that\u2019s fine for now. Thanks. So, Jenny came in and startled you. And she wanted to get into the studio,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cShe...\u201d he started to say, but he paused again, turning to his father. \u201cShe really wanted one of the bit parts that still had to be cast for The Unholy. And she believed that if she could just see some of what was being done\u2014you know how the props and effects can affect the whole mood of a movie\u2014she\u2019d have a better chance of being cast. Oh, God, Dad, I\u2019m so, so sorry,\u201d Alistair said, and it looked as if he\u2019d burst into tears a second time. The moment was both ironic and poignant. Alistair was truly devastated over Jenny Henderson\u2019s death; he was also heartsick and grieving about the fact that he\u2019d betrayed his father\u2019s confidence.</p><p>He was in a bad way, Sean thought.</p><p>Madison reached out, her hand covering Alistair\u2019s. \u201cHey, come on, now. Your dad\u2019s worried about you. He\u2019s not angry.\u201d</p><p>Eddie grimaced. \u201cRight now, that\u2019s the least of our worries, son. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve never been twisted around by a woman. You\u2019re young. I understand, but don\u2019t let it happen again,\u201d he added lightly.</p><p>Alistair tried to smile.</p><p>They all knew there might not be an again.</p><p>\u201cSo, Jenny talked you into taking her through the tunnel to the studio,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Alistair nodded. \u201cAnd at first, it was fine. Oh, my God! I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve walked through that tunnel. I can describe every tableau down there with my eyes closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anything appear different about any of the tableaux?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Alistair said.</p><p>\u201cEven the Sam Stone tableau?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I remember looking at it and thinking how much I love the movie,\u201d Alistair said. \u201cAnd, of course, that was the movie I\u2019d been watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you watch that movie a lot, don\u2019t you?\u201d Madison asked. She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve talked to me about it. We discussed the special effects. Digital is fantastic\u2014but only when it\u2019s really right and when the script and everything else is just as strong. If you look back at film history, some images seem amazing because the costuming was so good\u2014and because the actors were so good. Like Lon Chaney, Jr., who could turn himself into anyone and anything. The effects that were created for the Sam Stone movie were excellent. Nothing fancy, certainly not by today\u2019s standards, and yet genuinely frightening.\u201d</p><p>Alistair nodded, staring at her, troubled again. \u201cYes, I do watch the movie a lot. Most people know it\u2019s my favorite film noir. Does that...does the movie I was watching matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything can matter, Alistair,\u201d Sean told him. \u201cIn this case? Yes, I think so. Now, you went through the tunnel, and the tableaux were just as they always were. Then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then we were at the door to the studio. And I saw that it was ajar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the door to the studio was open,\u201d Sean repeated.</p><p>A slight look of annoyance crossed Alistair\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ve told that to everyone. Over and over. Yes, the door to the studio was open. Slightly ajar. And it should\u2019ve been locked. So I walked up to it and that\u2019s when I heard Jenny scream.\u201d</p><p>His voice quavered on the last few words.</p><p>Sean leaned forward. \u201cAlistair, tell me exactly what you saw then. Try to remember every detail.\u201d</p><p>Alistair\u2019s hands were trembling. He tried to still them where they lay on the table, then gave up the effort. He swallowed hard. \u201cHe\u2014he was there. He\u2019d stepped down from the tableau. He had Jenny. And...I saw. I saw him slit her throat. I tried to stop him. I cried out. I wanted to think it was make-believe\u2014I mean, we\u2019re all about make-believe, right? I wanted it to be make-believe, my dad pulling a stunt on me to teach me a lesson. Or some jerk from the studio playing a game. But...but...it was real. Oh, God, it was real, and blood sprayed everywhere and I could see Jenny\u2019s eyes. Oh, Lord, I could see her eyes....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlistair, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d Madison held his hands hard, clutched in her own. Her eyes were locked on Alistair in searing empathy and sorrow; she\u2019d been about to say, It\u2019s all right, Alistair.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAlistair, we\u2019re here with you. We\u2019ll find the truth,\u201d she vowed softly.</p> <p>\u201cSon...\u201d Eddie said miserably.</p><p>\u201cAlistair.\u201d Sean kept his voice hard and flat. \u201cGo on. I need everything. Every last detail. You saw him slit Jenny\u2019s throat. You saw her eyes\u2014what about his eyes? What about the killer in the robes?\u201d</p><p>Alistair seemed to stare past him. For a moment, Sean feared that he\u2019d lost him, that Alistair had slipped into some blank realm in his mind.</p><p>Alistair finally spoke. \u201cHis eyes? He had no eyes. He had no face. It was\u2014the whole area where the face should have been...it was just black. He had no face at all. He had no eyes...no eyes... How... Yes, I\u2019m remembering this right! He had no eyes!\u201d</p><p>He paused, concentrating. He lowered his head, and then peered up at Sean again.</p> <p>\u201cHe had no face, and he had no eyes. But he was looking at me. I knew it. I knew he was looking at me. And...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2014I knew he was laughing. There was no sound. He was laughing, and he was evil. Triumphant. Staring at me with nothing, no eyes...just evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison?\u201d</p><p>Madison started. She hadn\u2019t been listening. She couldn\u2019t forget Alistair\u2019s face as he\u2019d spoken about the murderer.</p><p>She turned toward Sean Cameron, who was driving. California roads were insane, and if you were smart, you were defensive. But Sean knew that; he\u2019d lived here. Once upon a time, he\u2019d been employed in the very same place where she was now employed. He had done the same things she did.</p> <p>He was an expert California driver\u2014a specialty in itself\u2014and was able to glance over at her as he said her name in a questioning tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, food, lunch. I\u2019m suggesting we go to lunch before our next stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe morgue,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThe morgue?\u201d she asked, hoping she didn\u2019t sound like the coward she was.</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s eat first. Where do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, anywhere. Anyplace along the way, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded; he seemed to like the fact that she was up for whatever. And he seemed to know that while he was an FBI agent and probably accustomed to morgues, she was not. Yes, definitely, food before the morgue. She wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d be able to eat afterward....</p><p>They wound up stopping at a Buca di Beppo. Homestyle Italian food. It was en route and a national chain that was pretty damned good\u2014a plus, since neither of them cared much about what they were eating; they just needed to eat.</p><p>The menu was set up for sharing. They opted for a salad and lasagna. When their friendly waiter was gone, Madison said, \u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m grateful that you\u2019re here. I know you worked for Eddie, and I know you\u2019re FBI. I don\u2019t understand all the dynamics, but it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re here and you believe in Alistair.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cAnd I believe in Alistair. I work in special effects, so I\u2019m aware of what\u2019s possible, but...I\u2019m also aware that mannequins don\u2019t come to life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed, \u201cmannequins don\u2019t come to life. Unless they\u2019re rigged to do so. Or digitized in a movie. So, we know a mannequin didn\u2019t kill Jenny Henderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe alternative is almost as bizarre. There were security cameras. From what you\u2019ve told me, no one came in, and no one went out. You haven\u2019t seen the footage yet, have you?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sure the police have, though. And if anyone had gone in or out, the police\u2014as in Detective Knox\u2014would have told you, and that person would be questioned.\u201d</p><p>He was thoughtful, spearing a leaf of lettuce. \u201cYes. As standoffish and pedantic as Knox appears to be, I think he\u2019s a good cop. And I think he\u2019d pull me in on anything he considered out of the ordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, nothing on the tapes. We have an empty studio and an empty cinema. Except for our security guard, Colin Bailey. And while we can\u2019t rule Bailey out, he\u2019s a totally unlikely suspect\u2014not to mention that the police interviewed him immediately and looked into his background. I love Colin. He\u2019s such a reassuring presence. And he\u2019s been loyal to Eddie for twenty years and so fierce when it comes to the studio. So that leaves Jenny Henderson and Alistair\u2014and the mannequins,\u201d Madison said, feeling bleak.</p><p>\u201cJust because a studio is in lockdown doesn\u2019t mean it was locked down,\u201d Sean reminded her.</p><p>\u201cBut...you\u2019ve seen the security system. You\u2019ve worked at the studio. And we both know, we all know, that if you want to keep your job, you really don\u2019t mess around, sneaking people in during lockdown,\u201d Madison said. \u201cBut, of course, you don\u2019t commit murder if you want to keep your job, either. Not if you\u2019re...normal. But the killer isn\u2019t really normal, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never figured out \u2018normal,\u2019 to tell you the truth,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWhoever is doing this is organized. He\u2014or she\u2014has a plan and is thinking it through. And he knows something we don\u2019t, because I don\u2019t believe in a locked-room mystery. There\u2019s a crack in the door somewhere, and we have to find it. Right now, the studio contains secrets that the killer knows, and we don\u2019t. Back when I worked for Archer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d Madison asked, and then regretted it. His face changed; he\u2019d become guarded.</p><p>\u201cTexas is home,\u201d he said simply. \u201cI was needed at home.\u201d He changed the subject. \u201cTo return to the concept of normal\u2014the average employee wouldn\u2019t know enough about the studio to carry this off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think someone was in the studio. That this person was hiding out somehow, somewhere, someway, and knew that Alistair would be there, and that he\u2019d come through the tunnel,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Madison frowned. \u201cFirst, you have to get in\u2014without the security cameras picking it up. Then you have to hide. Then you have to find the right costume to become the mannequin. And, after committing the murder, you\u2019d have to get rid of the bloody garments you were wearing and get out of the tunnel and the studio without anyone seeing you and without leaving any kind of trace.\u201d She lifted her hands. \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m lost. Suppose the killer did somehow hide overnight and wait and wait\u2014how did he escape without being on the security cameras?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause a locked room with any kind of access or egress is never really a locked room,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Madison shook her head. \u201cIf Knox is the detective you seem to think he is, and if he respects the FBI, he\u2019ll make sure you know what he knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForensic materials aren\u2019t analyzed instantly,\u201d Sean said. He shrugged. \u201cAnd sometimes it\u2019s not the forensic evidence that matters most\u2014it\u2019s the logic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in, it had to be an inside job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. You have to know about Colin Bailey and the other guards\u2014and all about their schedules. You have to know about the locks and the keys and the security system\u2014actually, it\u2019s not much of a security system. Eddie is a trusting guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not so technologically inclined,\u201d Madison agreed. \u201cWe\u2019re always explaining some feature on his cell phone to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know that about Eddie because you work for him, and because he likes you and respects your work. You\u2019re close,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I wasn\u2019t sure I was all that respected and liked until I received the call yesterday morning,\u201d Madison said. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. Eddie is a great boss. He loves his artisans. I just didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d been singled out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Alistair is crazy about you, too,\u201d Sean pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI felt like a very naive kid when I started with Eddie. And now, Alistair is a naive kid. He\u2019s a lot like Eddie\u2014he has a big heart. I owe them both. And I like Alistair. He\u2019s never been\u2014well, for lack of a better term\u2014a spoiled jerk. He blends right in. The only time I ever heard Alistair say anything that made him sound like a rich kid was when he said I didn\u2019t need to hurry, that the plane would leave when I told it to. I had to tell him that in the real world, planes left on schedules, and only private planes left on the owner\u2019s schedule.\u201d</p><p>Sean laughed. \u201cYep, that sounds like Alistair. And you\u2019re right. He\u2019s never been an affected rich kid. And, through three marriages, he remains Eddie\u2019s only child. So, what would that mean to you\u2014as a sleuth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019s a rich kid...and...\u201d</p><p>Sean pushed his plate aside. \u201cWhich means that Alistair stands to inherit his father\u2019s fortune and the studio and the cinema. So, first suspect? We know that Alistair\u2019s mother died a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst suspect\u2014Eddie\u2019s wife,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we decided last night that she doesn\u2019t seem bright enough to pull off something like this. But appearances can be deceptive. Or...she might have been working with someone else,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI know we already dismissed that idea. However, I\u2019m not a hundred percent convinced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me\u2014I work about eighty hours a week. The only time I have ever seen Helena at that studio is when one of the directors, set designers, or casting agents comes through. I honestly don\u2019t think she knows enough about the studio to have done any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you agreed with me on that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI agree that she appears to be a walking billboard for hair colorists,\u201d he said. \u201cShe might also be a far better actress than we imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful.\u201d Madison shook her head.</p><p>\u201cEven so, she\u2019s the wife\u2014she\u2019s not off the hook,\u201d Sean said. \u201cFinished with your meal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Thanks. I can pay my share\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. Your tax dollars at work, Madison. If we\u2019d ordered fine wine, well, then, we\u2019d have to argue about the cost.\u201d</p><p>He stood, ready to move on. Madison got up, too. Their server saw them and quickly brought the bill, and in a matter of minutes they were on the road.</p><p>Headed to the morgue.</p><p>The morgue.</p> <p>Madison had never supposed that in all her life she\u2019d be headed to the morgue....</p><p>Back again.</p><p>No matter how such a place tried to be aesthetically decent\u2014pleasing was beyond the realm of possibility\u2014the smell of chemicals seemed to pervade even the reception areas and offices. No room freshener could alleviate that smell.</p><p>Sean was growing accustomed to everything he was going to meet along the way in the career he hadn\u2019t actually chosen, but which had found him. In Quantico recently, they\u2019d trained in arms; thankfully, as a Texas kid, he\u2019d grown up surrounded by those who expected a man to know about guns, even if he chose not to use or carry them. He\u2019d excelled at the shooting range. They\u2019d sat in on endless classes in behavioral sciences. They\u2019d learned to profile, and they\u2019d learned that profiles could be wrong, but if nothing else, they certainly helped winnow down the pool of suspects. In many cases that pool could be immense. It was necessary to start somewhere, and the best place to start was with logic.</p><p>While they were a \u201cspecial\u201d unit\u2014chosen for exceptional talents that some might consider curses\u2014they were still expected to follow all bureau procedure and to excel at all expertise needed to work as an agent.</p><p>That had included days and days at morgues and body farms across the country.</p> <p>He would never feel at ease in a morgue. But, even in training, he\u2019d never betrayed his discomfort.</p><p>Sometimes, in the busy daytime field of a morgue like this one, Sean felt as if he heard voices, dozens of them, crying out to him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t acknowledge that, but he watched Madison\u2014and it wasn\u2019t out of idle curiosity. He had to know if Eddie Archer was right, and if Madison spoke with the dead. If she saw ghosts...</p><p>She was ashen from the time they stepped into the building. He didn\u2019t need Detective Knox today; he\u2019d made himself known as lead investigator on the case. Today, he\u2019d be able to meet with the medical pathologist who had done the autopsy, Dr. Lee Chang.</p><p>\u201cI wish there was more to tell you,\u201d Chang said as they walked down the chemical-scented halls to the small room, where he\u2019d ordered the corpse of Jenny Henderson to be brought. They were alone when they came to the small viewing room. Chang had his own charts and rattled off information as he withdrew the sheet, saying, \u201cBy my best guesstimate, Jenny Henderson was taken from behind. Her attacker was right-handed, seizing her by the left hand and holding it against his\u2014or her\u2014body and then slicing her throat thus, left to right. The artery was severed. The point was to kill, but not to decapitate.\u201d</p><p>Madison went a shade grayer, staring silently at the corpse of Jenny Henderson. She inhaled on a shaky breath. He saw that the tears she was determined not to shed were crowding her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou knew her,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I knew her well.\u201d Madison\u2019s voice was low and pained. \u201cBut yes, I did know her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Chang said quietly.</p><p>Sean decided he liked Chang. The man was a professional with empathy. He didn\u2019t let emotion overrule science, but he didn\u2019t forget that his science had to do with human beings.</p><p>Madison moved closer to the corpse.</p><p>Chang cleared his throat. \u201cShe has a brother back in Rhode Island. He\u2019ll be here tomorrow, although we haven\u2019t released the body as yet.\u201d He touched Madison awkwardly on the shoulder with a gloved hand. \u201cYou may go closer. You may touch her. She was your friend. None of us knows, but maybe she\u2019ll sense that you came and you want to help her, that you care.\u201d</p><p>Chang stepped back, looking at Sean then.</p><p>It\u2019s easy for us. You and I, we never knew her in life. This girl is here to help. She needs space to breathe, to touch, to see, Chang seemed to say.</p><p>Sean nodded to him. He stepped back with the doctor.</p><p>Of course, he was using Madison. Watching to see what would happen, wondering what she might see and hear.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jenny!\u201d she said very softly.</p><p>Madison, he thought, hadn\u2019t wanted to come here. Jenny had been a casual acquaintance, someone she\u2019d met through Alistair Archer. But she had known her, had seen the place where she\u2019d been murdered; she\u2019d heard Alistair\u2019s rendition of the events that had stolen the young woman\u2019s life.</p><p>And now, she was seeing her here, naked and lifeless on the gurney, the essence that had made her vital and beautiful and human long gone.</p><p>At first, it looked like the last thing in the world Madison wanted to do was touch the corpse.</p><p>Sean waited, feeling like a jerk, but knowing he had to.</p><p>And in a moment, Madison came forward. A tear dripped down her cheek and fell on her own hand.</p><p>She reached out, and her fingers gently brushed Jenny Henderson\u2019s arm.</p><p>She closed her eyes.</p><p>She trembled suddenly, as if she\u2019d been hit by a bolt of electricity. Chang almost stepped toward her, but Sean raised a hand and stopped him.</p><p>They waited. Madison stood by the corpse as the seconds passed by. She seemed frozen, unable to move.</p><p>At last, Sean took two steps and stood behind her, placing his hands on her shoulders. He looked down himself and saw Jenny. Once again, in his mind\u2019s eye, Jenny\u2019s eyes were open. And she was staring at the two of them, staring as though pleading for the help that hadn\u2019t come to her in life.</p><p>Sean felt as if he was picking up on the end of a conversation.</p><p>Jenny was saying, Um, I don\u2019t know. I suppose... I really care about Alistair! But yes, there were a number of people who knew that he and I were friends. All right, more than friends. That I liked to tease him and sleep with him because...because I care about him and because it wasn\u2019t such a bad thing to sleep with him. We weren\u2019t destined for life but\u2014 She paused, staring at them again. But I\u2014and many others\u2014have slept with people for much worse reasons. It wasn\u2019t a secret. I was talking about it during...lunch at the old caf\u00e9 down on Sunset.... I was with a girlfriend, Molly Ives, and I told her I was going to try to seduce Alistair that night, because I was desperate for a role in The Unholy. My roommate, Kathy McCarthy, knew. I was probably stupid. I should have been more discreet. I should have...</p><p>Jenny\u2019s silent voice in Sean\u2019s head was suddenly stilled.</p><p>Chang was standing next to Madison, holding her arm. \u201cBreathe. Just breathe. I know the smell of the room isn\u2019t great, but breathe deeply, and you won\u2019t pass out.\u201d</p><p>Sean was dismayed that he hadn\u2019t seen how white she\u2019d become. He cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely right-handed killer?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOr someone totally ambidextrous,\u201d Chang said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Call me when her brother schedules his appointment to see her. I\u2019ll be here,\u201d Sean vowed.</p><p>Chang nodded, covering Jenny\u2019s corpse with the sheet. His action seemed to restore a degree of dignity to her poor abused body.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else, Agent Cameron?\u201d Chang asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, not right now. Thank you. And I will be back. I know you\u2019ve recovered what you can, but I don\u2019t want the body released yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she will not be released,\u201d Chang promised him.</p><p>Sean nodded. He set his hand at the small of Madison\u2019s back and led her out of the room, down the antiseptic hallway and out to the light of day.</p><p>In the bright sunshine, she was even more pale.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, gazing up at him. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>She had beautiful large eyes. He noted that they were perfect\u2014not too large for her face, but the kind of eyes that seemed to give her vitality as well as beauty, that seemed to radiate emotion and life.</p><p>He let out a breath and looked at his watch. His team was coming, but they weren\u2019t due for another few hours.</p><p>\u201cHow about we stop by your house?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cMy house? But where will that get us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will get us to your house,\u201d Sean said. \u201cAnd give me time to think about what I want to do next, what I want to say to my team head and what I want to ask my team to start heading up for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay,\u201d she said. She was trying to speak casually, but he suspected she was glad of the opportunity to go home.</p><p>She needed to regroup herself. She wasn\u2019t admitting it yet, but she\u2019d just carried on a conversation with a corpse.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, you\u2019re driving, and you know where I live. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>So he did.</p><p>Her little car, an old Pontiac Vibe, was sitting in the driveway.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s mine, too,\u201d she said, pointing to the space beside it.</p><p>When he pulled in next to her car and parked, Madison quickly got out and he did the same. She walked to her door and fit her key into the lock.</p><p>\u201cThis is a wonderful old bungalow,\u201d he said, standing back to admire it.</p><p>\u201cYes, all the houses in this neighborhood are.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and he stepped into her house. Instantly, he felt an intriguing sensation of being watched\u2014suspiciously.</p><p>Madison isn\u2019t the only one residing here, he thought.</p><p>\u201cCome in. Make yourself comfortable,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem to be very comfortable herself. Her next words confirmed his feeling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make a drink. Would you like one? I\u2019m not exactly a full-service bar, but I have Scotch, rum, whiskey...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She disappeared into the kitchen and then popped her head back out, continuing with \u201c...a questionable red wine and an Irish beer in bottles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a pretty good bar to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take an Irish beer.\u201d</p><p>He heard her in the kitchen, despite the fact that the television was on.</p> <p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d she called to him.</p><p>He did. The second he was seated, a ball of fur leaped up beside him and gazed at him with mammoth cat eyes. \u201cHey, it\u2019s cool, I like cats,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind Ichabod!\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cI like animals!\u201d he assured her, speaking more loudly.</p><p>But as he stroked the cat, he felt an odd presence. He turned and realized he was right.</p> <p>Madison was not residing in the bungalow by herself\u2014and it wasn\u2019t just the cat who was residing with her.</p><p>There was a man seated at the far end of the sofa, watching him gravely.</p><p>\u201cI Love Lucy,\u201d the man said. \u201cLove that show. The physical comedy is exceptional. Ah, Lucille! She had some major talent.\u201d</p><p>Sean just nodded, incredulous. \u201cBogie?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone. He hadn\u2019t merely dropped her off\u2014he was inside the house with her!</p><p>Vengeance was irritated. Sean Cameron. Everyone hero-worshipped the bastard.</p> <p>Could have been a movie star, excellent leader and team player, brilliant, artistic, talented...</p><p>FBI?</p><p>Vengeance was thoughtful; it was said that Cameron had left because a friend was dying. A woman. Although they\u2019d been apart, she\u2019d been the love of his life. So he\u2019d gone home to Texas. Texas. Cowboys and guns and ranches...</p><p>Then he\u2019d joined the FBI. But he was back.</p><p>Panic set in. No, just stick to the plan\u2014with Madison now part of the scenario. It was very film noir. She wasn\u2019t the love of Cameron\u2019s life, but...</p><p>It made vengeance all the sweeter.</p><p>Let him know....</p><p>Let him know that another woman, Madison Darvil, had died.</p> <p>A woman he\u2019d brought in on the case. Or, better still...one Eddie Archer had brought in.</p><p>Yes, she must die.</p><p>Vengeance wasn\u2019t sure that vengeance could wait.</p><p>7</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she said NO? One gigantic NO, that would\u2019ve done it. She could have explained that she didn\u2019t bring people to her house, that work was separate from her private life, even when it came to saving Alistair Archer and finding a murderer. They could have gone somewhere else.</p><p>Anywhere else! She wasn\u2019t against being with him\u2014not at all. Under other circumstances, she would\u2019ve loved to have had him in her house. Every moment she spent with Sean seemed to draw her closer to him, draw her further into the web of fascination he created for her. She liked being next to him, feeling the warmth he seemed to exude, feeling she wanted to come closer and closer....</p><p>They were just working together; she was a studio guide for him, and a guide into the lives of those around Eddie, the people she might know better than he did.</p><p>And she really didn\u2019t need him here! Not when Bogie was bound to tease her and cause trouble. It was going to be hard to behave normally, to pretend that the ghost of a classic film star wasn\u2019t sitting on her sofa or leaning nonchalantly against a wall.</p><p>But she\u2019d tried to remain casual. She\u2019d been nonchalant. Sure, what the hell, let\u2019s go to my house.</p><p>Bogie would behave. Bogie knew that a murder had taken place. This wasn\u2019t like trying to destroy an evening because she was dating someone he considered a jerk. This was different. Sure, the television was on. Lots of people left their TVs on. No big deal. It was all going to be fine.</p><p>Madison dug around in her refrigerator and produced a beer for Agent Cameron. Luckily, she was so close to the studio that she brought her coworkers home for weekend evenings fairly often\u2014and Bogie always behaved then. She was well-supplied with snack food and a decent selections of drinks\u2014alcoholic and non. Beer. Beer was easy. She had a case of Guinness her assistant had brought last Friday. Nice cold Irish beer in bottles. What about her? Hmm. Maybe she\u2019d have something a bit harder. Like Scotch or whiskey. She looked around on the counter. She had both. A whiskey and ginger ale. Yeah.</p><p>She poured whiskey into a glass with ice.</p><p>She didn\u2019t add the ginger ale. She knocked the drink back in a swallow, felt the burn and coughed. That was good. Okay, no problem. She poured herself another shot and added the ginger ale. She shook back her hair and managed to call out calmly, \u201cIt\u2019s Guinness. You want a glass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>She picked up her glass and his beer and tried to sail smoothly back into the living room. Agent Cameron was seated on the couch, left side.</p><p>Bogie was on the right side.</p><p>Bogie offered her his charming half smile. She returned it with a warning frown.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d She handed Sean the beer, and took a seat in the large upholstered chair.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSo when does your crew get in?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of my unit arrives tonight.\u201d</p><p>Why did casual conversation have to be so damned hard?</p><p>Because she\u2019d brought him to her house. After a trip to the morgue.</p><p>She was insane. Totally insane.</p><p>And it was all worse than she\u2019d imagined. He was staring at her. Just watching her. As if he knew something she didn\u2019t know...</p><p>She gave him her best effort at an expectant smile, as if she was waiting for him to tell her where they were going from here.</p><p>But, at first, he didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>And she was completely unnerved.</p><p>She looked at her glass. She didn\u2019t remember having gulped down the second drink.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cFirst trip to a morgue isn\u2019t easy,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, people don\u2019t usually drop in on the morgue,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Madison said, standing again and hurrying back to the kitchen. She really had to stop. She didn\u2019t normally slurp down three shots in ten minutes. But one more...</p><p>She made herself another drink. She would sip it, she promised herself.</p><p>Once again, she sat in the big chair diagonally across from him. Bogie was shaking his head in some kind of warning.</p><p>She ignored him, looking at Sean Cameron.</p><p>And he looked back at her.</p><p>\u201cSo, about Texas,\u201d she said. She felt as if she was awkwardly trying to speed-date. They weren\u2019t at a speed-dating event. They were working on a murder case. She was an artist. She could create wonderful special effects and work on her own designs and the designs of others; she was a fabricator, accustomed to fabric and foam and latex and other materials with which marvelous things could be fashioned. She knew nothing about morgues and murders.</p><p>\u201cTexas, yes,\u201d he said pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cNice state. Big state. Lots of horses, cowboys...all that.\u201d Oh, God, she sounded like she was doing horrendously at a very bad speed-dating event.</p><p>\u201cYes, Texas is a big state,\u201d he said. He seemed amused, even charmed, by her desperate rambling.</p><p>But before she could make some other inane remark, he asked, \u201cWhat did you get from the morgue? Really. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>Madison frowned. \u201cI got the same thing you got. Exactly what the medical examiner said. Her killer caught up with her from behind. Held her tight and slit her throat, the stroke going from left to right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he persisted.</p><p>She forced herself to meet his eyes. \u201cIf he had any other facts, I didn\u2019t hear him say so,\u201d she said primly.</p><p>He smiled, then looked at her again. \u201cI want to know what Jenny Henderson said to you. If there was something I didn\u2019t hear. She did see you, and she did speak to you. I want to know if I missed anything she said, anything at all. You never know what can help until you weigh the words of the deceased.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw must have dropped to her feet.</p><p>He actually reached over to tap it shut with his hand.</p><p>\u201cMadison!\u201d He said her name softly but firmly. \u201cMadison, this isn\u2019t the time to be shy about your abilities. We\u2019ve got to get this all out in the open, now, here\u2014and make use of everything we can throughout this case. We need whatever help there is. All the help we can get\u2014from the living...and the dead.\u201d</p><p>She was still staring at him. At least her mouth was no longer gaping. But she couldn\u2019t seem to speak.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said. \u201cEddie told me you speak with the dead. And Bogie told me he hangs around here because he loved the time he lived here\u2014and because you\u2019re the only one he\u2019s come across who sees him and responds to him. He really likes you, too. But he\u2019d haunt those he loved during his lifetime if he could.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped again. And once more, he gently tapped it shut.</p><p>She glanced at Bogie, who was watching her gravely, and then turned back to Sean Cameron with total shock.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she said harshly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, kid,\u201d Bogie said. \u201cHe sees me.\u201d</p><p>In torment, Madison looked from her ghost to Sean Cameron. He was studying her with his deep green eyes. Eyes that seemed to accept nothing but the truth. Challenging eyes, defying her to contradict him.</p><p>Madison couldn\u2019t help herself; she sat rigidly silent. She didn\u2019t want to hurt other people with what she saw, nor did she relish being ridiculed. In her entire life, she\u2019d never come across anyone else who admitted to seeing the dead.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t begin to know how lucky you are,\u201d Sean said, looking at Bogie with awe. \u201cSir, you were magic on the screen. Magic. And from everything I\u2019ve read, you were an all-right guy, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had my spats with a few folks.\u201d Bogie shrugged in that characteristic Bogie way.</p><p>\u201cWe all do,\u201d Sean said. \u201cEvery life includes some dark spots and hard times. But, sir, the totality of your life, on-screen and off...it\u2019s fantastic.\u201d He suddenly turned to Madison. \u201cReally! You can\u2019t imagine how lucky you are to be haunted by such a legend!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight, there you go, kid. You\u2019re lucky as hell,\u201d Bogie told her.</p><p>Madison stared at Sean. \u201cYou...you really see Bogie?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cClear as day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYup, he sees me,\u201d Bogie said, pleased.</p><p>Madison had no idea what to do or how to react.</p><p>Sean leaned toward her. \u201cSo, here\u2019s the thing. I know you saw our victim, as well. I know you spoke to her, and that she replied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...you heard,\u201d Madison said weakly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>She was afraid she was going to fall off the chair. In a way, her life, her private life, had remained easy. She\u2019d been able to tell herself that she was imaginative\u2014she was, thank God, which was why she had the job she did\u2014but that she wasn\u2019t really so strange. That it wasn\u2019t real, it was all in her head.</p><p>And now she was sitting here with someone who was making it real.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think she liked this reality. Actually, no, she knew she didn\u2019t. Reality was Alistair Archer accused of murder, and Jenny Henderson dead on a table in the morgue.</p><p>She realized then that Sean was looking at her with far more than speculation.</p><p>He was looking at her with hope.</p><p>She managed to speak through numb lips. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed, leaning back, his eyes still on her. \u201cYeah, same thing I got,\u201d he said wearily. \u201cExcept she was pretty honest with you, gave you more detail. We\u2019re going to have to interview her roommate and the friend she was with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were expecting something different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething more,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I hate to say it, but we\u2019re going back to the morgue tomorrow. We have to find out who else she saw that day. She says people knew she planned to drop in on Alistair. We have to know who those people are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure this young woman wants to help you.\u201d Bogie spoke quietly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure she\u2019s scared, and uncertain, and hoping to move on from...haunting a morgue. But I know she\u2019ll help you all she can. Now, just how crazy the morgue workers are going to think you are\u2014well, that I can\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>Sean turned to Madison and grimaced. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s got a point. They\u2019ll think we\u2019re crazy if we insist on trip after trip to the morgue.\u201d He looked directly at Bogie. \u201cMaybe, when the crew gets in, you could join us. Talk Jenny Henderson into...coming home with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Madison didn\u2019t mean to squeak out the question\u2014but she already lived with one ghost.</p><p>\u201cAway from the morgue, at least. She could haunt the studio or the Black Box Cinema,\u201d Sean told her.</p><p>\u201cGod, no,\u201d Bogie said. \u201cShe was killed there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere has to have been a place she loved,\u201d Sean mused. \u201cWe just have to figure out where. Then she can leave the morgue and haunt a place that made her happy. Until she\u2019s ready to move on.\u201d</p><p>Madison glanced over at Bogie.</p><p>\u201cHey, I gotta say, I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m still hanging around,\u201d Bogie said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s for the reruns. Life can\u2019t be rerun, but you can now see those old shows over and over again.\u201d He pointed a finger at Madison. \u201cOr maybe it\u2019s for you, kid.\u201d</p><p>Sean leaned toward Madison once more. \u201cMost of the time, despite forensics, when perpetrators are caught, it\u2019s because someone had a theory. Forensics can be brilliant tools, but they don\u2019t mean much unless you have a direction in which to take them. Sure, you can get DNA, and if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll find it in the system. But I\u2019m willing to bet this culprit doesn\u2019t have any kind of rap sheet. So we need a theory. The official theory now is that Alistair did it. Our theory is that someone else did, someone who has a bone to pick with Jenny, Alistair or most likely Eddie. Could Jenny have provoked that kind of hatred at her age? Probably not, but it is possible. Could the killer want Alistair out of the picture? Yes, but he\u2019ll go to prison for life, which doesn\u2019t really remove him. Does his incarceration and the stigma of murder hurt Eddie Archer? To the bone. So I think the murderer is out to make Eddie\u2019s life miserable and perhaps close down the cinema and the studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not kill Alistair, too?\u201d Madison asked.</p><p>\u201cThe living can suffer much more\u2014suffer unto death,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>She nodded slowly, then shook her head. \u201cI still can\u2019t imagine anyone close to Eddie trying to hurt him. Helena needs Eddie. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019d hurt him or Alistair, even if she had the wits to do it. You know Archer\u2019s partner, Andy Simons. There\u2019s no reason I can think of for him to do this. And you know my boss\u2014your old boss\u2014Mike Greenwood. Mike lives for the studio. He\u2019d be out of a job that he loves if the studio fell apart. Let\u2019s see...Benita. They\u2019re divorced. I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s happy about that. I actually thought she did care about him, but who knows? There were some rumors about her and other men.... But she\u2019s not that familiar with the studio, anyway. And then you\u2019ve got...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThe forty-plus people who are usually at the studio and the twenty-plus who come in on specific projects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison, we have to look at those who are closest to him. I\u2019ve explained why I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re looking beyond that list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut everyone close to Eddie loves him!\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we see on the surface,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWe have to get below that.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, Madison heard her cell phone ring. She was going to ignore it, but he said, \u201cAnswer\u2014it might be the curious.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, not sure what he meant, but she pulled out her phone. Caller ID informed her that it was her supervisor, creative head of the studios, Mike Greenwood. \u201cMy boss,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cAnswer him.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHi, Mike,\u201d she said, watching Sean as she answered.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie told me you were helping Sean Cameron. That just beats all\u2014Sean, a G-man!\u201d Mike said. \u201cAnyway, thanks for that. I wasn\u2019t sure if you knew that the studio\u2019s closed for another day. I don\u2019t know when\u2014or even if\u2014they\u2019ll let us reopen the cinema. Anyway, the police have finished with the studio, but they\u2019re holding off one more day because the FBI team comes in tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is so...so surreal right now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And we\u2019re really going to have to crank it up when we get back in. Not just to do our part for the American economy, but for Eddie. What he\u2019s going through is painful enough. He doesn\u2019t need to be worried about his studio, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, I\u2019ll crank it up. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to believe how the world can change, huh? As in overnight,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI was in there on Saturday, covering up, making sure we were ready to plow in come Monday morning. Who the hell knew when I cleared the place out on Saturday that Monday wasn\u2019t really coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it came\u2014just differently,\u201d Madison said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Mike sounded weary, defeated.</p><p>She kept her eyes on Sean, wondering if he could hear Mike. His face never gave a thing away.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Eddie is the best,\u201d she said. How many times had she insisted on that fact, one way or another, in the past two days?</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, we\u2019ll have to put on our game face and move forward, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, Mike.\u201d</p><p>He informed her that he had a few more calls to make, and rang off.</p><p>\u201cMike,\u201d she told Sean lamely. \u201cAs you\u2019ve no doubt guessed. He\u2019s a great boss. He runs a tight ship, and everyone respects him\u2014and we always hope he\u2019ll come to the work picnics and Christmas parties \u2019cause he\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>Sean shrugged, a half smile on his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t forget I worked for the guy. But either we\u2019re all lying to ourselves and Alistair is guilty\u2014which isn\u2019t true, we know that from Jenny\u2014or one of these nice, great people is guilty.\u201d</p><p>Madison was thoughtful. \u201cI\u2019m going with the new wife. I don\u2019t hate her or anything, but she\u2019s a user with a capital U.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still believe it has to do with the remake of Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what her association with the old movie could have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was someone associated with the movie, that person would have to be pretty damned old by now,\u201d Bogie pointed out.</p><p>Madison nodded. \u201cNo one old enough to have been in the movie or to have worked on it is still at the studio, in any capacity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there was that death on the set,\u201d Bogie said.</p><p>\u201cPete Krakowski?\u201d Sean glanced at Madison. \u201cI read everything I could about the movie when I was on the plane. But while there were rumors running rampant, it appears to have been an accident\u2014partially caused by the fact that Krakowski clowned around on set. His widow was compensated. Still, we should dig a lot deeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Helena\u2019s out for herself,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you said she wasn\u2019t bright enough,\u201d Sean reminded her. He stood and looked at Bogie, who\u2019d been contemplating the two of them. \u201cPlus Eddie is kind of her ticket into the movies. She needs him around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not Alistair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start sorting it all out,\u201d Sean said. He walked over to Bogie. \u201cSir, it was a pleasure to meet you. This is the kind of thing that makes it possible to live with my crazy sixth sense or whatever it is. I was, still am and will always be a huge fan.\u201d</p><p>Bogie was on his feet. Sean towered over him, but Bogie retained the essence that made him such a unique man, even larger in reality than on the screen. \u201cThank you, son. Thank you. And for whatever it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBogie. You can call me Bogie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBogie,\u201d Sean said, smiling. He reached out to shake Bogie\u2019s hand; Bogie reached out in turn. Madison had to blink. It appeared that they\u2019d actually shaken hands.</p> <p>Sean looked back at her. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m on my way to the police station to meet up with my crew. So our plan for tomorrow, if you\u2019re up for it, is to return to the morgue and then the studio.\u201d</p><p>They were both startled by a deep sigh from Bogie. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll go to the morgue with you. Maybe make things a little better for Miss Jenny Henderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sean said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just not sure how well it\u2019s going to go for your team when they put everyone who works at the studio through the wringer again,\u201d Madison said. \u201cYou\u2019re accustomed to this kind of thing. Artists usually aren\u2019t. Our blood and gore aren\u2019t real. People will get edgy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and if a killer is among them, that\u2019s a good thing. The police have talked to people, and now my team will talk to them, too. Comparing their notes with what we find will be important. And anytime there\u2019s an inconsistency, we can bring you in. Thing is, Madison, you know the studio and you know the people working there. You\u2019ll recognize who\u2019s telling the truth and who isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d Madison asked. \u201cI\u2019m an artist, not a cop or an agent!\u201d</p><p>Sean was already out the door.</p><p>She stared after him, incredulous, and then the door opened again, and he poked his head back in. \u201cOh, I guess I should say this just to be on the safe side\u2014stay away from the studio unless you\u2019re with me, and if you speak with anyone, act innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am innocent!\u201d</p><p>\u201cInnocent of knowing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cAnd neither do you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat will change,\u201d he said. And then he was gone, warning her to lock the door as he closed it.</p><p>The more he worked with Benny Knox, the more Sean felt he wasn\u2019t a bad cop or a jerk, he was just a realist. And to Knox\u2014being a realist\u2014there was no doubt that Alistair Archer was the only one who could\u2019ve killed Jenny Henderson.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure of the detective\u2019s feelings about him, but at least it wasn\u2019t stone-cold hatred, and his resentment seemed to be ebbing now that a real investigation was under way.</p><p>Knox met Sean at the police station, introduced him around and then brought him to a large room dedicated to computer forensics. There, a young cop, Officer Angelo Fontini, was working with the security images from the studio and the Black Box Cinema.</p><p>\u201cTakes the young ones to know what they\u2019re doing with this computer stuff,\u201d Knox said. \u201cHell, so much can be manipulated these days, and I gotta admit, I wouldn\u2019t see half of it.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cI was in film, video and digital special effects before I came into law enforcement. And you\u2019re right. It\u2019s an area that can definitely be manipulated.\u201d</p><p>Knox laughed. \u201cThen you and Fontini should get along great. Right, Fontini?\u201d</p><p>Fontini looked up; his name might be Italian, but he had blue eyes and curly blond hair, and with his ready grin, his appearance was even more cherubic. \u201cThese are pretty much straight security shots. The cameras at the studio are set to catch particular areas. They don\u2019t rotate. I\u2019ve tried to compare the studio film with the Black Box film. And it looks as if they both caught the same stuff. I\u2019ve been staring at this on and off for hours, and I just don\u2019t see how anyone could\u2019ve been there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s see the film from the Friday night before the murder up to the time of the murder,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s forty-eight hours of footage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. We\u2019ll speed it up, and I\u2019ll call stop when I want you to slo-mo.\u201d</p><p>Fontini hit a key and began showing the footage from the Friday before the murder. Sean watched as people streamed out of the studio on Friday night, the fast-forward making them look like harried, robotic performers. They all chatted as they headed out to their cars; most left between six and six-thirty.</p><p>He saw Madison leaving the building close to seven with a tall, lean man who seemed to be in his early twenties. She paused and waved to her immediate supervisor, Mike Greenwood, and Mike waved back.</p><p>Greenwood talked to some of the departing employees, then went back into the studio. He appeared from screen to screen as he made his way into the main workroom, stopped to look around, nodded with satisfaction and returned to the guard station. Colin Bailey was on shift, and Greenwood spoke to him before leaving.</p><p>Night turned into day. Saturday morning, guard duty changed and Winston Nash came on as Colin Bailey left. A few hours later, Mike Greenwood appeared again, and in time, five other men and one woman entered the building. They all went straight to the main work area, where they completed final construction of the scaffolding he\u2019d seen the other day. The woman made a phone call. A pizza delivery man came to the front entrance, and she hurried out to get the food. The crew ate, then finished hammering and sanding. The workers left. Once again, Mike Greenwood glanced around, checked a power saw to see that it was unplugged and headed out to speak to Nash, who was just changing places again with Bailey. Mike left.</p><p>Colin Bailey took out a Playboy magazine, placed his feet on the desk and read\u2014or looked at pictures\u2014for a while, and then seemed to snooze.</p><p>Sunday rolled around. Nash arrived; Bailey went home. Eddie Archer came in\u2014there was a clock behind the guard desk, and Sean had Fontini stop the video so he could see the time. Exactly 10:00 a.m.</p><p>Eddie went into the studio, walked around and adjusted some of the tarps that were covering works in progress. When he seemed assured that all was well at the studio, he went back to the guard station, said goodbye to Nash and departed. Time passed quickly; Nash and Bailey changed places again.</p><p>Sunday evening, Alistair arrived at the Black Box Cinema and let himself in. Then, forty-four minutes later, Jenny Henderson showed up. She approached the door in a crouch, as if she believed she could escape the eye of the camera that way. She went into the Black Box Cinema. Her body hid the door for a minute, and then she disappeared inside.</p><p>Sean had Fontini roll the footage over and over again, trying to see what he was missing. Then he got it.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cDid you see something I didn\u2019t?\u201d Fontini asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sean said. \u201cBut what I didn\u2019t see tells me a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was perfectly orchestrated. Whoever did it knows all about the security station and the security cameras. Which, once again, suggests that this person is very familiar with the studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it could be Alistair Archer,\u201d Knox said quietly. He\u2019d returned to stand behind them.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Sean shook his head. \u201cNo murder weapon anywhere. No bloody trail away from the scene. Come on, Knox! The killer escaped somehow\u2014in a manner we haven\u2019t figured out. Don\u2019t forget, the studio is missing its robe for the remake of Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum. That robe has to be somewhere\u2014and when it\u2019s found, it\u2019s going to be covered in blood. Let me see the Friday footage again, toward the end of the day.\u201d</p><p>Fontini looked over at Knox, and Knox shrugged. They rolled the footage again. This time, Sean concentrated on the dressmaker\u2019s mannequin in the costume department. At one point, Mike Greenwood moved it because it was in his way, shoving it behind the curtained area used as a change room when actors came for fittings.</p><p>A seamstress passed by and it was shoved farther back. By the end of the day, it was completely behind the curtain.</p><p>\u201cOne more time?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cThe robe was on the mannequin,\u201d Fontini said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s gone now, you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a plain brown monk\u2019s robe on the mannequin now.\u201d</p><p>Fontini started to run the tape again, showing the different rooms. \u201cStop!\u201d Sean said suddenly.</p><p>Fontini did, frowning as he studied the various screens. Then he said, \u201cGot it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot what?\u201d Knox demanded.</p><p>Fontini pointed excitedly to the screens. \u201cThere\u2019s a gap in the video that covers the entrance. Look\u2014there\u2019s the time on the security station camera. It\u2019s reading 4:48. And there\u2019s the time on the clock in the workroom\u20144:50.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe clocks could have been wrong,\u201d Knox argued.</p><p>\u201cThey could\u2019ve been. Who would normally notice a two-minute time difference?\u201d Sean said. \u201cAnd then again, there could be missing footage. And that\u2019s where I think we have a theft. The new robe for the new Amun Mopat. The one worn by the murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might still show up somewhere in the studio,\u201d Knox said.</p><p>\u201cFontini, can we tell if any footage is missing? Could someone have frozen the cameras?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible. Anything is possible,\u201d Fontini said. \u201cBut if something was done, I haven\u2019t found it yet. I\u2019ll need to go through just about every computer test known to man, and even then...\u201d He looked at Sean. \u201cBut I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Madison\u2019s assistant, Alfie, showed up at her door about forty-five minutes after Sean had left.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home! Thank God,\u201d Alfie said in his usual dramatic way.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019d called, you would have known that,\u201d Madison told him dryly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to ask him in; Alfie just walked through the door as if there was no question that he was welcome. He threw himself on the couch. Ichabod, who was fond of Alfie, immediately crawled up on his lap.</p><p>Alfie was an attractive man, tall and blond and elegant in his movements. Madison watched him with affection. He was really a big kid, one who loved the movies\u2014and loved his job. But, right now, he clearly felt anxious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you had dinner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any food?\u201d He clasped his hands as though in prayer.</p> <p>\u201cSure. I have tuna,\u201d she said. He made a face. \u201cI buy a lot of it, Alfie. It comes in cans, and lasts a long time, so it\u2019s good when we wind up working nights and I\u2019m not home to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTuna sounds great.\u201d He followed her into the kitchen, delving into the rack for one of her bottles of questionable red wine as she drew out tuna, mayonnaise, bread, lettuce and tomatoes.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d he said, opening the wine as she prepared the food.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please! There\u2019s a massive rumor mill! You\u2019re helping the cops! Or the FBI. The ghost FBI.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she insisted. She pushed him aside to get a knife out of the drawer. Act innocent, she\u2019d been told.</p><p>Alfie rested his elbows on the counter and jiggled his brows. \u201cStudly, macho FBI agent\u2014old employee of the studio\u2014arrives, and you\u2019re assigned to be with him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI showed him around the studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSo he is studly and macho,\u201d Alfie said triumphantly.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose. It\u2019s not something you really notice when you\u2019re worried because there\u2019s been a murder and a friend is accused of that murder and our livelihoods are at stake.\u201d That was a lie. Sad as it was, she\u2019d noticed everything about Sean Cameron, down to the scent of his aftershave and the single ring he wore, some kind of coat of arms. He also wore a dive watch. His hands were large, his fingers long, his fingernails neatly clipped; his were the hands of someone who was clean in appearance and habits, yet heedless of artificial enhancements. His hair was cleanly cut and simple, too. The way it fell slightly forward was entirely unaffected.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Alfie said. \u201cI mean, how could anyone but Alistair have done it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not an investigator.\u201d She took the glass of wine he held before her nose, sipped\u2014it was indeed questionable\u2014and set the glass down. \u201cAlfie, I\u2019m just a friend and an artisan and a fabricator. I showed him around the studio because I was asked to.\u201d She cut the sandwiches in halves and bent down to give Ichabod his portion of tuna. \u201cThere are chips in the cupboard,\u201d she said.</p><p>He went for the chips, poured them into a bowl, then put it and their plates on the kitchen table. He pulled out his chair, waiting for her to join him. When she\u2019d done so, he practically pounced on her. \u201cAnd you went to see Alistair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he confessed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! Alistair swears he didn\u2019t do it\u2014and I believe him.\u201d</p><p>Alfie leaned back, sipping his wine. \u201cIf Alistair didn\u2019t do it, then who did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlfie, we\u2019re talking in circles. And I told you, I have no idea. If we knew who did it, the cops wouldn\u2019t have to investigate, would they?\u201d Madison demanded. \u201cSo, you tell me. How do you know my every movement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Alfie said, frowning, \u201cI got the info from Mike Greenwood, who got it from Andy Simons, who apparently saw you with hunk-o-FBI man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find out I saw Alistair?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat one is more convoluted,\u201d Alfie said, grinning. \u201cI heard it from Vickie at the coffee shop, who heard it from her boyfriend, Victor\u2014Victor, Victoria, cute, huh?\u2014who goes to the same manicurist as Pierce, who apparently escaped the bondage of the current Mrs. Eddie Alistair long enough to get his nails done this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the fact that I went to see Alistair is no secret,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>Alfie laughed. \u201cIn our world, does anything stay secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. But it doesn\u2019t matter because I don\u2019t have any secrets to worry about,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>Alfie chewed thoughtfully for a few minutes. Then he set his sandwich down. \u201cThis is all so horrible,\u201d he groaned. \u201cI know you don\u2019t know anything. But who do you think did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlfie! I already told you. I haven\u2019t got any idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid of is that no one will ever find anything. That Alistair just snapped or something. That he doesn\u2019t realize he did it\u2014he\u2019s too good a kid\u2014but that he did do it. And then he\u2019ll go to jail, Eddie will go crazy\u2014and we\u2019ll all be in the unemployment line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Madison said stubbornly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s way too early to worry about losing your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...who could\u2019ve done it?\u201d Alfie asked.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me. Who do you think could have done it?\u201d</p><p>Alfie frowned. \u201cAh! The evil Mrs. Eddie Archer. The current one. No, no, never mind. That would mean breaking a nail or messing up her hair. Back to the drawing board. Hmm. Aha! Mike Greenwood. Yeah, that\u2019s the ticket. Mike has access. No one knows the studio better. No, no, he likes his job.\u201d Alfie looked frustrated. \u201cColin Bailey! He\u2019s the guard, right? He\u2019s in charge of security. But why? Maybe...somewhere, somehow, years and years ago, Eddie dated a girl Bailey was in love with. Yeah...no. No, can\u2019t see Bailey and Archer being involved with any of the same women, nor would Bailey risk his cushy job. God knows, he gets to make a mint and snooze and read magazines. Hey! Maybe we did create something so real it came to life and killed her. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you need to finish your sandwich and your wine, and go home. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even get you out for some boba green tea?\u201d Alfie asked, clearly disappointed by the dismissal.</p><p>\u201cI hate boba,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cPlain green tea, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlfie, I just want to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cOkay, but no holding out. I\u2019m your assistant, for God\u2019s sake! Keep me in the loop,\u201d he said, rising. \u201cHey, you want some help cleaning up? Doing the dishes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlfie, we ate on paper plates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh, yeah. Okay, fine\u2014send me out into the cold and the dark, feeling lonely and anxious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlfie, it isn\u2019t in the least cold. Go home. Or go to a club. I\u2019ve got to sleep!\u201d</p><p>She steered him to the door and nudged him out. There, she gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll keep in touch, I promise, although we\u2019re supposed to be back at work the day after tomorrow. Drive carefully...and go home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right!\u201d Grinning, he walked out to her drive where he\u2019d parked his car.</p><p>When he was gone, Madison closed and locked the door. She turned to lean against it and realized she hadn\u2019t seen Bogie, which was odd, because he loved to talk to her when she had company. He considered it amusing to see if he could push her into answering.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that late, but she really was tired. The kitchen received a lick and a promise, as her mother used to call it, she checked Ichabod\u2019s food and water bowls and then went to her room and prepared for bed. Tonight, there was no drone of voices from the television in the living room, so she turned on the smaller set in her room, found a ridiculous movie about a massive snowstorm freakishly hitting San Diego and willed herself to nod off.</p><p>Just as she was falling asleep, she was awakened by the shrill sound of an alarm.</p><p>The noise was horrendous, shattering, shocking\u2014and brought her leaping to her feet, terrified and disoriented.</p><p>She rushed into the living room and immediately saw that Bogie was back; he was at the window looking out. The sound was coming from her car. Somehow the alarm had been activated.</p><p>She rushed to find her keys, and discovered that they must have fallen out of her purse because they were on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cBogie?\u201d</p><p>He turned to her. \u201cI did it. I managed to press that little key and set off the alarm. There was someone out there, Madison. I saw movement in the shadows across the street. There was someone out there\u2014watching. Watching you. And I...I could feel the malice like a wave of hot air, the malice and the...evil. Madison, someone doesn\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing. Someone is out to kill you, too.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>Sean sat at the desk in his hotel room, studying the handwritten notes Benny Knox had given him. They were photocopies, and sometimes he had to squint to read them. They might be entering a brave new world where younger cops were working more and more with technology, but a lot of law enforcement officers still carried notebooks and wrote down their observations.</p><p>He had the crime scene photos spread before him, and from what he could tell, every single notation matched perfectly with what he saw. It could be argued that Alistair had enough knowledge of the studio to figure out someplace to stash the weapon, but Sean didn\u2019t believe that was what had happened. And Alistair had been covered in blood. There\u2019d also been trace and cast-off blood along the path he\u2019d taken to summon Bailey.</p><p>Colin Bailey had been sitting in security. He\u2019d been on the property. But Alistair had found him in his little booth, just where he always was. Bailey had not been covered in blood spatter.</p><p>He set down the photos and picked up the phone; he\u2019d wanted to talk to Pierce\u2014in privacy\u2014ever since he and Madison had visited the Archer house.</p><p>He hoped Eddie wouldn\u2019t answer, or Helena. If one of them did, he could just ask how they were doing.</p><p>He was glad when Pierce did answer, cordial and proper as ever. \u201cArcher residence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPierce, it\u2019s me\u2014Sean Cameron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean,\u201d Pierce said with evident pleasure.</p><p>Sean first thanked him for the text messages he\u2019d sent.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if I should or shouldn\u2019t, but...I mean, their marriage isn\u2019t my business, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is an investigation. You did the right thing,\u201d Sean told him. He asked Pierce how he was, and sympathized with him for a moment. Pierce was a good man, always there for Eddie\u2014no matter who he married. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have a few questions for you, Pierce. Private questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are they sleeping in separate rooms? Is the marriage on the rocks?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Eddie is still in love,\u201d Pierce said dully. \u201cMrs. Archer complains that Eddie snores, and that she can\u2019t get sleep if he\u2019s there. But they do have connecting rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith doors between them\u2014which, I assume, she closes at night, so she doesn\u2019t have to hear his snoring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else wrong with the marriage?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know how much I love Mr. Archer,\u201d Pierce began.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t repeat anything, Pierce. But I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Helena ever really loved Eddie. I think that when she went to Benita and Eddie\u2019s wedding, she saw that Benita had something she wanted much, much more than what she had herself. I think she waited for the right minute and stepped in. She\u2019s been planning on marrying him for a long time. She doesn\u2019t love Eddie, couldn\u2019t care less about Alistair and, quite frankly, I believe she could be guilty of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Pierce, I need you to answer this one to the best of your ability. What time did Helena return to the house the night Jenny Henderson was killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see the exact time, but I\u2019d say it was about half an hour after young Alistair left the house for the studio.\u201d</p><p>Sean had to acknowledge that if she\u2019d come home and stayed home, that definitely removed her from the list of possible candidates.</p><p>\u201cIs there any way she could have left after that without you seeing her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. The Archers generally use the grand stairway to the bedrooms, but there are stairs in the back\u2014the family room area\u2014too. I was up in my own room after Alistair left, and I didn\u2019t hear her car start,\u201d Pierce said.</p><p>Sean thanked him, wishing the phone call had allowed him to completely eliminate Helena LaRoux.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t bright enough to have pulled it off. That was the general consensus. But...she could be a better actress than anyone knew. And if Alistair was locked up for life\u2014or, God forbid, worse\u2014Eddie would need her. Then, she\u2019d have even greater power.</p><p>And she\u2019d stand to inherit everything, unless Eddie had a will that excluded her.</p><p>He called Eddie and felt bad when his old friend and mentor answered, his voice filled with hope since he\u2019d seen that Sean was the caller.</p><p>\u201cYou have something?\u201d Eddie asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing solid yet,\u201d Sean replied. \u201cBut\u2014and forgive me, I have to ask certain questions for the purposes of elimination\u2014do you and Helena have a prenup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Eddie\u2019s voice sounded hard.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about your will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have small bequests to various friends and workers. Alistair receives the bulk of my money and investments, and Helena is nicely cared for, as well. My family isn\u2019t out to get me, Sean. I\u2019m also leaving Benita nicely set up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if Alistair is out of the picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of the picture? How?\u201d Eddie asked, his tone cold. He didn\u2019t give Sean a chance to answer. \u201cThe killer could have killed Alistair, too. He didn\u2019t. Why would I worry about Alistair now? He\u2019s safe, isn\u2019t he? Alistair is safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere he is, yes,\u201d Sean said. \u201cListen, Eddie, I didn\u2019t mean to upset you. I\u2019m just trying to make sure I can eliminate certain people, you know?\u201d And, of course, discover what their motives might be.</p><p>He bade Eddie good-night. Then he put down the phone and pulled out the crime scene photos again. He\u2019d walked by the tableau of the scene from Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum dozens of times in the past; he hadn\u2019t paid enough attention. He\u2019d been a bigger fan of films like Laura and The Maltese Falcon.</p><p>He picked up the crime scene notes, which detailed everything the reporting officer had seen on the museum floor. There was no mention of the tableaux at all. That wasn\u2019t unusual. The responding officer would have waited for a detective to arrive on the scene, once he\u2019d assured himself that there was no help for the victim, and from the amount of blood on the floor, that must have been evident.</p><p>Knox had listed studio employees and recent visitors. Records had been checked and interviews conducted by a score of officers, but thus far, that hadn\u2019t raised any flags.</p><p>Sean was so deeply involved in what he was reading that he started when his cell phone rang. He glanced at the time and realized the Krewe had come in, a fact verified by Logan Raintree\u2019s name on his caller ID. \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cWhere? Airport, endless highway or hotel?\u201d Sean asked him.</p><p>\u201cEndless highway,\u201d Logan said. \u201cEndless highway after endless travel. We\u2019re heading over to the hotel now. I want to keep your relationship with the local police positive, so we\u2019ll use the suite rather than the station. Are we all set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there\u2019s a large dining-slash-work area between two bedrooms, and the other three are just across the hall. So we\u2019re all set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you in twenty\u2014or an hour and a half, depending on traffic,\u201d Logan told him dryly, and hung up.</p><p>Sean eased back in his chair.</p><p>He was surprised at the accommodations they\u2019d gotten\u2014and all within a decent budget. Eddie Archer had pulled strings here, too. They were staying in an old mission-turned-boutique hotel that was conveniently located. It was right off the 101, close to the police station and the highway that would bring them directly to the studio door. It was the perfect arrangement for them. The suite included a work area between the two bedrooms, which offered a refrigerator, microwave, wet bar and, most important, a huge table, a sufficient number of outlets and plenty of space. They\u2019d have a designated room at the police station, too, but his group needed privacy at times, and the Hotel Pierre provided them with everything they required.</p><p>He was glad the rest of his unit had finally arrived\u2014Logan Raintree, ex\u2013Texas Ranger, was the head of their team. Kelsey O\u2019Brien was an ex\u2013U.S. marshal\u2014and his cousin. Katya Sokolov, doctor and pathologist, had been an M.E. before joining the team and training at Quantico. Jane Everett, a talented artist, had the uncanny ability to recreate accurate images of the deceased from nothing but a skull or a description. Tyler Montague was another former Texas Ranger. Everyone had his or her specialty in dealing with the unusual, the unknown...and the unnatural. As in, he supposed, the supernatural. They\u2019d been carefully selected by Adam Harrison and Jackson Crow. Adam had been involved in mysterious searches and situations so often that the government had asked him to put together his \u201cKrewe of Hunters\u201d teams. Jackson was the only one of them chosen straight from the ranks of the FBI behavioral sciences department, and head of the original team. The six members of their particular unit complemented one another beautifully.</p><p>His cell rang again and he answered, expecting to hear Logan again, perhaps telling him that traffic on the 405 had snarled so badly that it would be midnight before they arrived. But it wasn\u2019t Logan. He was surprised to hear Madison\u2019s voice, soft and somehow sexy even at an anxious pitch.</p><p>\u201cSean, I\u2019m really sorry to disturb you, and this...it may be absolutely nothing....\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBogie managed to set off my car alarm. He was certain there was someone outside watching me and\u2014 Stop it! I am telling him what you said!\u201d she whispered, and he knew she was talking to her resident ghost. \u201cBogie\u2019s convinced that I\u2019m in danger. I admit to being a bit unnerved, but I really don\u2019t mean to bother you. You\u2019re involved with the serious law enforcement side of this situation and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay where you are. Stay in the house, doors locked. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s all right. I thought maybe you could just get a police officer to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d he repeated, cutting her off. \u201cStay inside, everything bolted and locked!\u201d</p><p>Sean cursed as he grabbed his jacket and hurried to the elevator, where he pushed the call button far too many times. He was out front, heading to one of the \u201celite\u201d parking spaces for his loaner car, when he cursed again and returned to the desk, confirming that his fellow Krewe members would be brought to their respective rooms. Then he raced back to the car.</p><p>It was late; the roads were still busy, and yet not hopeless, as they could be. He knew he was speeding, but what the hell\u2014so were half the cars on the road. He kept it to a safe level, glancing at his phone\u2014which he\u2019d set on the passenger seat\u2014now and then just to make sure he didn\u2019t miss a call.</p><p>What had they been thinking? Yes, bring in someone who knew the studio, knew the dynamics and the people. Someone close.</p><p>Too close?</p><p>Why had it never occurred to him that he could be putting her at risk?</p><p>He tried to convince himself that he hadn\u2019t blindly led an innocent young woman into danger, that Bogie was being Bogie, a little macho, a little old-fashioned.</p><p>He slammed on the brakes, not realizing how fast he\u2019d been driving, when he reached her neighborhood and swung into the space next to her car. He jumped out and hurried to the door. She\u2019d been waiting for him.</p><p>The door opened and Madison stood there. He was surprised by the hard thud of his heart and the catch in his throat. Her eyes were wide\u2014perhaps too trusting\u2014and her expression was grave. And still, she seemed as straight as an arrow and disturbed at the thought that she might have interrupted him over something that wasn\u2019t important.</p><p>They\u2019d barely met, he reminded himself, alarmed by the rise of emotion she elicited.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t matter. He had stupidly and unwittingly put her in danger.</p><p>He was overreacting. But he couldn\u2019t take the chance!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry I made you rush over like this,\u201d Madison said. \u201cAnd I really don\u2019t know what good it can do. I didn\u2019t even know Bogie was capable of pushing the alarm on my car key.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bogie was right behind her. \u201cPush an alarm on a key\u2014that I can do.

She was sleeping so deeply, she didn\u2019t feel me trying to shake her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe alarm probably scared off whoever it was,\u201d Sean told him.</p><p>\u201cBeing dead,\u201d Bogie said woefully, \u201cmakes it difficult when you want to be a hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBogie, what did you see?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>He pointed. Across the street, there were two houses, old bungalows, much like the one Madison lived in.</p><p>Between them was an old house almost obscured by the bushes in front. A For Sale sign planted just to the side of the front walk explained its slightly shabby and overgrown appearance.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what it\u2019s like when you feel hackles rising along your neck? All right, so I don\u2019t really have a neck,\u201d Bogie said, \u201cbut I still feel like I do. I caught a glimpse of movement behind those bushes, and then I saw that whoever was there was wearing something like ninja gear\u2014all black. The kind of black outfit puppeteers use so they\u2019re not seen onstage. I knew that this person was watching the house. Madison had fallen asleep, and if the intruder had gotten far enough to break in\u2014well, hell, it could have been too late. I figured if I made the alarm go off, she\u2019d be awake and aware, at least, and maybe I\u2019d scare off the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood work, Bogie. Thank you,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Bogie wagged a finger at him. \u201cYou see to her safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Sean said, turning to Madison. \u201cYou have a flashlight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She headed to her mantel, removing the large flashlight there. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take a look. I\u2019ll be right back. Lock the door when I go out.\u201d</p> <p>He heard her do so as he left the house and walked from her yard. He crossed the street, quiet and still at that time of night, and came to the abandoned house.</p><p>Standing out on the road, he studied the bushes, then carefully moved around behind them.</p><p>He found a broken branch on one of the bushes and impressions in the dry earth, but nothing that could help a forensics team. He shone the light on the house, but anyone who\u2019d broken in was long gone now. He considered calling the police, but he was sure that would be a waste of time.</p><p>Why would someone come after Madison?</p><p>Because she might know, somewhere in the back of her mind, something that could point an accusing finger in the right direction?</p><p>Perhaps one of L.A.\u2019s lost and homeless was seeking entry to a place that could offer some shelter. He made a mental note to ask Knox to see that the empty house was checked, just in case. He doubted they\u2019d find anything left behind by such an obviously clever and resourceful killer.</p><p>He returned to Madison\u2019s and knocked on the door, waiting while she looked through the peephole. Then she let him in.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNothing useful. We\u2019ll have the cops do a search when it\u2019s daylight. Can you pack up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPack up?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave Ichabod!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can leave a cat overnight. We have to figure out how to keep you out of danger until this is over.\u201d Sean stared at her at a moment; she was staring back at him, frowning and looking extremely stubborn.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just call the police, have an officer patrol the area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison! Didn\u2019t you see the blood in the tunnel\u2014not to mention Jenny Henderson\u2019s corpse?\u201d Sean demanded angrily.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d She paled. She knew he was right, and she was furious about it.</p><p>\u201cThis is my home,\u201d she murmured. But she wasn\u2019t an idiot, and she wasn\u2019t going to risk her life.</p><p>She\u2019d seen Jenny lying on the cold steel at the morgue.</p><p>\u201cIt will remain your home,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving it forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not. Where am I going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hotel.\u201d</p><p>She seemed a little shocked at that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea. I mean, I can\u2019t stay with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t suggest that,\u201d Sean snapped. \u201cWe have a suite of rooms.\u201d</p><p>She colored; she went from milk-white to rose-red, and her humiliation at misinterpreting his words seemed to draw her straighter still.</p><p>Don\u2019t look so embarrassed, he longed to say. I\u2019d give my eyeteeth to be honest and say, Hey, yeah, what a great opportunity. Come and sleep with me. I really shouldn\u2019t feel this way, but can\u2019t help thinking the sex would be really, really great.</p><p>He gritted his teeth and tried to ignore that thought.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a movie,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cCome on, Madison! You know you have to get out of here. Do you want to be the idiot girl who\u2019s convinced that she\u2019s fine\u2014and then runs into the killer in the very next scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, with dignity. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t wish to behave foolishly in any manner. And I\u2019m aware this isn\u2019t a movie. It\u2019s my life that\u2019s either being threatened or, at worst, totally disrupted. So, fine. I\u2019ll pack. While I do so, would you please make sure the cat\u2019s water bowl is filled and he has food? Bogie was wonderful at setting off the alarm, but I don\u2019t believe he can do things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put out food and water for the cat,\u201d Sean said. He felt shaky. Dismayed, and furious with himself.</p><p>This was his fault.</p><p>Hell, no. Eddie Archer was the one who\u2019d thrown her into the fray.</p><p>Still, he\u2019d brought her in, inch by inch, and now someone out there was scared of what Ms. Madison Darvil might know...or guess.</p><p>He found the cat food, which was in a ceramic jar in the shape of a cat\u2019s face. He noted other little things about the kitchen that made it specifically Madison\u2019s. Like salt and pepper shakers in the form of Frankenstein\u2019s monster and his bride. A beautiful kitchen witch dangled above the sink; gleaming copper pots and pans were hung on a rack, along with puppets, some macabre, some enchanting. Creatures everywhere...</p><p>He gritted his teeth again.</p><p>There was a killer out there. It didn\u2019t matter who\u2019d involved Madison, whether he\u2019d done it or Eddie had\u2014or even if Bogie was being an alarmist. She wasn\u2019t a cop or an agent, as she\u2019d reminded him, and she needed protection.</p><p>She was quick; she had a small bag packed and was standing at the door after he\u2019d refilled Ichabod\u2019s food and water bowls and set them down. Ichabod had eschewed both and followed him out. Even the damned cat seemed to be looking at him with accusatory eyes.</p><p>Bogie leaned against the wall, arms crossed. \u201cYou stay with him, kid. This is ugly. Hollywood can be magic, and it can be ugly as sin. You know that\u2014firsthand now. I\u2019ll keep an eye on things here,\u201d he told Madison.</p><p>Sean hesitated. \u201cWe still need you to come to the morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised I would, and I will.\u201d Bogie shrugged. \u201cI can probably get there on my own, but why don\u2019t you swing by for me when you come to feed the cat again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do that,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Madison was grim and silent when they went to his car. He took her bag and put it in the truck, and climbed into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>She turned on the radio and chose a talk station. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019d prefer classic rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019ll listen to this, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Look, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t do this to you on purpose. I didn\u2019t even know you existed,\u201d Sean muttered. \u201cYou said you\u2019d do anything for Eddie Archer and Alistair. It looks like you\u2019re getting to live up to those words.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply. She did hit the button on the radio, changing it to an oldies station.</p><p>It was still a chilly drive back to the hotel.</p><p>Madison didn\u2019t say a word as they crossed the lobby, although he saw that she carefully studied her surroundings. The old missionary style was unmistakable, as was the care expended in bringing modern comforts to the historic building.</p><p>The hotel was small; it only took a minute for the elevator to carry them to the third floor. Sean headed straight for the suite. Before he could slip the key in, the door swung open. He was greeted by his cousin, Kelsey O\u2019Brien, who gave him a massive hug.</p><p>\u201cHey, we\u2019re here\u2014as you can see,\u201d Kelsey said, tucking long red hair behind her ears.</p><p>\u201cAnd feel!\u201d he teased her. \u201cDid you learn that power-hug technique with the marshal\u2019s office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, where did you go?\u201d Logan asked him, coming up beside Kelsey, a frown knitting his brows. \u201cYou knew we were on the way. Did something happen?\u201d He sounded concerned\u2014or was he annoyed?</p><p>Logan was his height, and they were both taller than Kelsey, who was still a good five-ten. Logan, however, wasn\u2019t about to give him a welcoming hug.</p><p>\u201cYeah, more or less,\u201d Sean said. \u201cCan we come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, pulling Madison forward. \u201cThis is Madison Darvil. She\u2019s doing the job I used to have at the special-effects studio. Eddie Archer thought she\u2019d be the right person to show me around so I\u2019d know what\u2019s still the same and what\u2019s changed over the years. There\u2019s an empty house across from hers, and we have reason to believe someone was watching her from the shrubbery tonight. I couldn\u2019t completely check it out. I figured we\u2019d have the cops do it tomorrow. Whoever was there is gone. Madison, this is Kelsey O\u2019Brien, Logan Raintree and, back there\u2014behind Logan, the little blue-eyed blonde\u2014is Katya Sokolov or Kat, as we call her. Dr. Kat, if you will. The guy in the cowboy hat is Tyler Montague, ex-Ranger, and rounding out our team is Jane Everett, over by Tyler.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A chorus of \u201cHi, Madison,\u201d sounded. Madison waved a hand and said hello in greeting. She was trying to act cool and dignified; she looked like a deer caught in the headlights of a massive semi.</p><p>\u201cI see you have a suitcase,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. You shouldn\u2019t stay at your own place now,\u201d Kelsey told her.</p> <p>\u201cYes, definitely, if you were threatened in any way, you need to keep close to us, for the time being at least,\u201d Logan agreed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>Sean cleared his throat. \u201cI forgot to tell you that as well as being a special-effects wizard and a friend to Eddie and Alistair, she\u2019s a great deal like us. She speaks with ghosts. She actually has a close relationship with one in particular, who spends a lot of time with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Logan still looked severe. He tended to be mistrustful of others who claimed to be mediums or capable of \u201creaching the other side.\u201d They were all careful with whom they spoke, and careful of what they said. Despite rumors that they were the \u201cghost busters\u201d of the FBI.</p><p>Madison nodded, looking no less mistrustfully at the crowd she\u2019d just met.</p> <p>She finally answered.</p><p>\u201cYes, sometimes I can speak with the dead. Not always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that would be the same of all of us,\u201d Kelsey said, smiling. \u201cSometimes\u2014most often, really\u2014the dead are gone. And even when they stay, some don\u2019t care to talk. But...you have a ghost who visits you?\u201d</p><p>Sean flinched, not sure if the others would doubt the possibility of Bogie, or if they\u2019d be awed and envious.</p><p>It was the latter.</p><p>After a few minutes of excited questions, things seemed to settle down. They moved into the central area between the two rooms, and were soon seated around the table.</p> <p>Bogie had proven to be quite a help in many ways; here, he was an icebreaker.</p><p>And questions about him naturally segued into more serious conversation regarding the murder. Madison described the different personalities involved with the studio and Eddie Archer\u2019s life, and Sean put forth his theory that it wasn\u2019t a random murder, but one that had been carefully thought out\u2014and thought out to hurt Eddie Archer by making Alistair appear guilty.</p><p>Logan asked them gravely if they believed there was any possibility that Alistair had committed the murder.</p><p>Madison said no\u2014even the victim had told them that. And she seemed gratified when Logan accepted her words without ridicule.</p><p>Sean informed them that the clock in the security footage had lost time, while the recording itself had not. \u201cTwo minutes. Two minutes are missing from the clock,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot a lot of time,\u201d Kelsey remarked. \u201cAnd that isn\u2019t when the murder occurred. It\u2019s before the murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what does it mean? Think about it. Say you\u2019re underwater, holding your breath. Two minutes can be very long. And if you\u2019ve plotted something out, two minutes might be all that\u2019s needed,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Madison? You know the studio. What could you do with two minutes?\u201d Logan asked.</p> <p>\u201cWell...the costume was on the mannequin, and I know that Knox believes we\u2019ll find it. The evil priest, Amun Mopat\u2014who could wake the dead and make the mummy rise\u2014came down from the tableau and killed Jenny. According to Alistair. So, if someone had been dressed as the priest and was waiting somewhere in the studio, it\u2019s possible that this person\u2014dressed as Amun Mopat\u2014did it. And I suppose you\u2019d look more like Amun Mopat if you stole the robe. And if you could lose two minutes, you might have time to steal the costume you needed.... Could the video have been altered? Colin Bailey was out of the security area when he went to the Black Box with Alistair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no video of what happened in the tunnel,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s never been a camera down there, I guess because there\u2019s a camera that catches anyone going into the Black Box Cinema, and there are several security cameras in the studio,\u201d Madison explained. \u201cThe museum is more like Eddie\u2019s private place. He loves it. And it isn\u2019t open much of the time.... There are security cameras at the studio because people do try to get hold of movie images before the movies are released. Piracy is pretty lucrative. But as for the museum...it\u2019s just tableaux.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there was a security camera down there at one time, but as Madison said, it wasn\u2019t an area that anyone worried about,\u201d Sean added.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s still an old camera\u2014and if it was used\u2014it probably wouldn\u2019t have been active on a Sunday night, anyway. The cinema\u2019s closed then. The cameras we do have aren\u2019t there because we expect anyone to be murdered. They\u2019re there to protect the studio. I assume it\u2019s kind of general knowledge that the museum isn\u2019t open on Sundays, because the Black Box Cinema isn\u2019t open. And, I admit, you can\u2019t discredit the police for their assumptions. To believe that Alistair didn\u2019t do it is almost like believing the impossible. As Sean\u2019s pointed out to me, you\u2019d really have to be familiar with the studio and the cinema to carry off such a feat. Then, you\u2019d have to know Alistair. And you\u2019d have to know that Jenny was coming\u2014and if you knew that, you\u2019d realize she came to coerce Alistair into showing her the main studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is general knowledge that Alistair had a crush on Jenny, right?\u201d Jane asked. \u201cAnd that Jenny was an actress, that she could manipulate Alistair\u2014and that Alistair often went to the Black Box by himself, on Sunday nights?\u201d</p><p>Sean looked over at Jane, a slim, very pretty brunette. Of everyone on their team, he\u2019d wondered if Jane would make it. She was an artist, although it was true that she\u2019d worked with human skulls. And, of course, he\u2019d been an artist of sorts himself. Surprisingly, perhaps, they\u2019d all done well on their first assignment in Texas, considering that only three of them had come from a background in law enforcement. Jane had excelled at their courses at Quantico; she was a dead-on shot and would have made an excellent sniper.</p><p>\u201cYes, pretty general,\u201d Madison was saying. \u201cI mean, people joked about it at the studio. No one disliked Jenny that I know of,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think anyone disliked Alistair. He\u2019s a sweet kid without a chip on his shoulder at all. The jokes were the usual stuff, like how \u2018whipped\u2019 Alistair was. Some of the guys can be jaded. Jenny was amusing to them, and watching Alistair\u2019s reactions to her even more so.\u201d She turned to Sean. \u201cAnd the priest\u2019s robe is gone. I know it was there, Sean.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded, smiling at her. \u201cI watched the security footage. The mannequin gets pushed back, pretty innocently, I suspect\u2014at first. Then, there\u2019s the two-minute gap, the time discrepancy\u2014that\u2019s when you can no longer see the mannequin in the dressing room area. I have the tech man at the station, Fontini, doing whatever he can to figure it out, and I\u2019m going to talk to Bailey again. He might be the guard, but he\u2019s no tech wizard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but he was there, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d Logan asked. \u201cExcept when he left the security station to go to the Black Box Cinema with Alistair. Have I got that right?\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d Logan said decisively. \u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll see the studio, and go to the morgue. Sean, you\u2019ll try to find out how the security footage was changed...and by whom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a difficult trick, not in Hollywood. I\u2019m good, but the kid at the police station is better. Fontini is doing his best, but whoever did it knew what he\u2014or she\u2014was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just one more question I have to ask,\u201d Logan said. \u201cYou\u2019re sure\u2014really convinced\u2014that Alistair Archer didn\u2019t kill Jenny? I know you \u2018spoke\u2019 with Jenny. Could she have been mistaken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sean said. \u201cThere\u2019s no discrepancy between her story and Alistair\u2019s. Someone came down from that tableau dressed as the priest, Amun Mopat, killed Jenny and managed to disappear without a trace. What we have to figure out is the how, and if we get that far, we can begin to figure out the who.\u201d</p><p>Madison bit her lip. \u201cSean\u2019s right. Their stories were exactly the same.\u201d She hesitated only a moment, surveying those around the table as if she couldn\u2019t believe she was with an entire group who might believe her words. \u201cJenny was certain that Alistair is innocent. She said he was coming back, trying to help her, and that he shouted at the man. She doesn\u2019t know who killed her. She does know that Alistair didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s that,\u201d Logan said. He looked exhausted. \u201cIt\u2019s about four in the morning for us, coming in from Virginia. Right now we need some sleep. We\u2019ll get organized in the morning. Sean, take Katya and go to the morgue first thing. I\u2019ll head down to the police station and get the team set up there and meet with Knox. And we\u2019ll have the cops check out the vacant house across from Madison\u2019s. We\u2019ll gather at the studio around one. By late afternoon, Sean, the rest of us will go over the police notes, reinterview all the employees and scour the security logs for anyone else who\u2019s been in the studio recently. That\u2019ll leave you free to question those closest to the Archer family. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>Nods went around the table. Kelsey stood. \u201cCome on, Madison, we\u2019ll put you across the hall in 302. Tyler is in 301, and Kat and Jane will take 303. This side is 304, 305 and 306. You\u2019ll be safe here. I sincerely doubt this person is courageous enough\u2014or foolish enough\u2014to attack you between six FBI agents.\u201d</p><p>Madison rose uncertainly. \u201cI\u2019m not putting anyone out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the whole floor,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>Sean glanced at her, grateful for his team members. Jane and Kat had actually had their own rooms, but were quick to accept the new arrangements. They really were a team, a family.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, thank you,\u201d Madison said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you over,\u201d Kat told her, grabbing her bag.</p><p>As they left, Sean stood, Logan at his side.</p><p>\u201cEddie Archer is lucky he worked with you,\u201d Logan commented.</p> <p>Sean shook his head, a half smile curving his lips. \u201cEddie Archer is smart. He looked me up, looked up the team and figured he knew what he needed. He\u2019s no fool. He knew, as well, that Madison has our talent. She\u2019s a trusted employee, but he told me right away that she spoke with dead people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t put her in danger,\u201d Logan said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cIt already has,\u201d Sean muttered.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019d better solve this thing damned fast.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded, bade Logan and the others good-night and went through the connecting door to his own room. The police reports were where he\u2019d left them. He collected them and stacked them neatly; Logan would need them in the morning.</p> <p>He lay down to sleep.</p><p>Two minutes missing. Two minutes in which to hide a mannequin\u2014and steal a robe.</p><p>That was as good as two days if you knew what you were doing.</p><p>And then, as he fell asleep, he stopped thinking about the killer.</p><p>Because he was thinking about Madison.</p><p>He felt as if he\u2019d known her forever. As if she\u2019d been part of his life, part of his consciousness. But it had only been two days....</p> <p>Vengeance no longer needed to watch. There was something wrong. The girl knew she was in danger.</p><p>That damned Sean Cameron. It should have gone so smoothly. The police had seen what was there to be seen, and now\u2014</p><p>The phone rang. Luckily, Vengeance was alone.</p><p>Seeing the number on the caller ID screen of the phone, Vengeance cursed silently. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe investigation is getting serious. It was supposed to look like a locked-room mystery. Once Alistair was charged, that was supposed to be the end!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it will continue to look that way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, the FBI is all over the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if they make discoveries, they\u2019ll never know, they\u2019ll never understand, they\u2019ll never be able to trace the truth!\u201d</p><p>She kept talking; she was panicking. Talk, talk, talk. Vengeance tried to be nicer, to be more reassuring.</p><p>\u201cJust keep your story straight!\u201d Vengeance warned.</p><p>She calmed down, and Vengeance reminded her again not to call.</p><p>\u201cIf I call you\u2014that\u2019s one thing. Don\u2019t you call me.\u201d</p><p>Finally, Vengeance was able to hang up.</p><p>But Vengeance grew thoughtful.</p><p>Vengeance\u2019s partner was....</p><p>Dangerous.</p><p>Vengeance\u2019s partner might have to meet with an accident.</p><p>\u201cThe M.E. is going to think we\u2019re ghouls,\u201d Madison whispered.</p><p>She\u2019d come to the morgue again with Sean and Katya Sokolov, who\u2019d been an M.E. in San Antonio before joining the Krewe.</p><p>They\u2019d stopped at Madison\u2019s bungalow to feed Ichabod\u2014and bring Bogie with them.</p><p>While it seemed natural to Madison that the team\u2019s only pathologist would want to view the body and the autopsy report, there was no ostensible reason for a civilian to be there a second time.</p><p>\u201cMortal remains, just mortal remains,\u201d Bogie told her. He grinned at Katya. \u201cNow, while you may be the one with the experience in a morgue, you might want to stop staring at me. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re not right in the head, you know?\u201d</p><p>Kat flushed. \u201cSorry! I\u2019m still so...overwhelmed. You can\u2019t imagine what a fan I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Bogie looked at Madison. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I hang around. I need the adulation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Sean warned.</p><p>\u201cI feel like a ghoul,\u201d Madison whispered again.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you\u2019re fine. You\u2019re with me, and if anyone questions that, I\u2019m asking you questions about the young woman as you knew her in life,\u201d Kat said. \u201cNot to worry.\u201d</p><p>They were met then in reception by an attendant who escorted them back to a private autopsy room. Dr. Lee Chang was waiting there for them, standing silently behind the gurney that held the remains of the woman who had once been Jenny Henderson.</p><p>\u201cDr. Chang, thank you,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI\u2019d like you to meet Dr. Katya Sokolov, who is with our team. She\u2019d like to go over your report with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Dr. Sokolov, pleased to meet you,\u201d Chang said, shaking Kat\u2019s hand.</p><p>He offered her his clipboard. Kat came around the gurney, toward the counter where there was a sink and a huge overhead light.</p><p>Madison heard her speaking with Chang as he ushered her closer to the body. Bogie stood on the other side.</p><p>She tried not to breathe through her nose. She tried not to hear the trickle of water and smell the chemical scent that couldn\u2019t be disguised by any manner of freshener or filter.</p><p>Jenny, Madison said silently. She still found it difficult, but she touched the arm of the corpse. It astonished her that a human being could feel so absolutely stiff and cold.</p><p>Jenny\u2019s eyes opened. They became enormous as she stared not at Madison but at Bogie standing beside her.</p><p>Humphrey Bogart! Jenny said in silent awe.</p><p>In the\u2014well, not in the flesh, kid. Bogie shook his head. This is no place for a girl like you, Miss Henderson. There\u2019s got to be someplace you can go.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how, Jenny said.</p><p>Come with us. Just will yourself. Get up, and come with us, Bogie urged.</p><p>Madison wanted to scream in protest. No, living with one ghost is enough!</p><p>I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t...I don\u2019t... I\u2019m cold and I\u2019m scared...but I can\u2019t.</p><p>Thank God, Madison thought for a moment. But that was wrong.</p><p>She squeezed Jenny\u2019s arm lightly. You can. You can. Bogie did it, and if he did it, you can, too. Jenny, don\u2019t you want to help us catch your killer?</p><p>Jenny nodded solemnly. She glanced from Bogie to Madison to Sean.</p><p>You\u2019re a cop, right? she asked him. You came soon after I got here. She smiled vaguely. You know I always wanted to be in the movies, she said. I guess now...</p><p>You\u2019re famous, Bogie told her. And you\u2019ll become a legend when this is solved.</p><p>\u201cAs you can see,\u201d Dr. Chang said, drawing Kat back to the autopsy table, \u201cshe was killed with one sure cut. The intention was to kill. I told Agent Cameron earlier that the strike itself was planned. Unopposed, the killer managed what he intended with ease.\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded. \u201cDespite the fragile position of the artery, it\u2019s really not easy to aim so surely and deliver such a deadly strike. There are no hesitation wounds, and poor Jenny doesn\u2019t have a defensive wound on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole thing would have taken a matter of seconds,\u201d Dr. Chang said.</p><p>\u201cWay less than two minutes,\u201d Sean commented.</p><p>Chang frowned, looking at him. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Sean stepped up behind Kat, grabbed her and mimed a knife and the blow.</p><p>\u201cI think that was eight seconds,\u201d she said.</p><p>Sean released her. \u201cAnd the killer didn\u2019t really need the extra time when he was in the tunnel because no camera was running there, and he knew it. I believe he had to be somewhere in the studio or down in the tunnel. Or even in the Black Box Cinema.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dr. Chang,\u201d Kat said, shaking the M.E.\u2019s hand again.</p><p>Are you coming? Bogie silently asked Jenny.</p><p>I\u2019m naked and chopped to pieces, Jenny said.</p><p>No, just rise, and think about yourself in a favorite outfit. The flesh is nothing now, and the soul, the mind, are everything.</p><p>\u201cCaleb will take you out,\u201d Chang said, indicating the assistant who had led them in.</p><p>As he did, Madison walked between Kat and Sean. She knew that Bogie was behind her.</p><p>She felt a little prickle at her nape.</p><p>And she knew that Jenny had risen to join them, too.</p><p>Jenny was going to help. She was going to come with them, and relive her own murder at the scene of the crime.</p><p>9</p><p>Logan Raintree was still setting up the command center for the team in the designated room at the police station\u2014and having his own briefing with Knox. When Sean called him, he discovered that the briefing was nearly finished, and that he and the others would still join them at one.</p><p>It was just noon, but Sean wanted to get to the studio as quickly as possible. He was convinced that if they could figure out how someone besides Alistair might have gotten in\u2014how the robe had been stolen\u2014they could get on with the rest of the puzzle.</p><p>And if they failed, at the very least they\u2019d create reasonable doubt that Alistair was the killer.</p><p>But they couldn\u2019t fail. Because even with reasonable doubt, the press had branded him a killer, and he\u2019d never live a normal life.</p><p>As much as Sean needed Madison, he was afraid that after the previous night, it was no longer wise to involve her. Except that she was already involved and therefore targeted.</p><p>The other problem was that he was afraid to leave her anywhere on her own.</p><p>But nothing had really happened, he told himself. Bogie might well have been mistaken. He was very protective of his earthly charge.</p><p>But in his heart, he didn\u2019t believe that Bogie was wrong about the danger to Madison. The killer was devious, with a definite agenda, and wasn\u2019t going to let anyone stand in his or her way. Madison wasn\u2019t in law enforcement; she\u2019d probably never even handled a gun.</p><p>As they drove away from the morgue, he decided he had to try to protect her. \u201cMadison, I know this won\u2019t be easy for you, but I\u2019m going to take you to the police station. We\u2019ll have you hang around in the team\u2019s ops center while we\u2019re at the studio and try to get the word out that you have nothing to do with the investigation anymore.\u201d He glanced at her in the rearview mirror. She was seated in back, between the ghostly Bogie and Jenny Henderson.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m concerned about your safety.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Madison said. \u201cBut making me stay at the police station while you\u2019re at the studio is just...worthless. Last night, I felt pretty good\u2014surrounded by six FBI agents. I\u2019m still with FBI agents, so I\u2019m still protected. And thinking you can get the word out that I\u2019m not involved...please! Even I know that would be a useless effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, Sean,\u201d Kat said. \u201cAnd she can help us at the studio. I honestly don\u2019t think anyone will try anything with all of us around.\u201d She turned and smiled back at Madison. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind hanging with us, do you? You slept okay last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was fine, but I feel guilty, making someone give up a room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t, not really,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d Madison said, smiling ruefully.</p><p>\u201cMy cousin and Logan have been a twosome since we began as a team,\u201d Sean explained.</p><p>\u201cKelsey and Logan,\u201d Kat put in.</p><p>\u201cKelsey is your cousin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sean said simply.</p><p>\u201cDo family members usually work together?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Our teams are different, Madison. Because we\u2019re...different,\u201d Kat told her. \u201cAnyway, you really didn\u2019t put anyone out. Kelsey and Logan were in the king on one side of the suite\u2019s work area. Tyler had a room, Sean had his room on the other side of the work area, and it was no big deal for Jane and me to bunk together. We always did when we were in training.\u201d She turned to Sean. \u201cBut you never know...we may want to spend some time at Madison\u2019s bungalow. See what we can shake up.\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t reply. He still didn\u2019t like the idea that Madison was being used or could be in danger of any kind.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>As he neared the studio and the Black Box Cinema, he saw that patrol cars were still standing guard. He parked his borrowed car just outside the yellow crime scene tape. As he did, he heard soft sobbing, and remembered that the spirit of Jenny Henderson was with them.</p> <p>Then he heard Bogie reassuring her.</p><p>Dear God, the rest of the world would think they were totally insane. Officers, today we have the victim with us. Painful, yes, but she\u2019s going to reenact what happened to her. It\u2019s okay. She has a damned decent guy to hold her hand. Bogie, you know him, right? Humphrey Bogart, legend of the silver screen.</p><p>\u201cAgent Cameron!\u201d Duffy said, hailing him.</p><p>\u201cOfficer Duffy,\u201d Sean responded as he stepped out of the car. \u201cWe\u2019re going into the Black Box Cinema. The rest of the team will be along shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. We\u2019ve been expecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Detective Knox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. He\u2019s at the station, sir. I believe he\u2019ll be coming here with your people.\u201d</p><p>The others exited the car, as well.</p> <p>Duffy frowned, as if perplexed, and suddenly shivered as Bogie and Jenny passed by. He looked sheepishly at Sean. \u201cCalifornia,\u201d he said. \u201cLos Angeles. You\u2019re burning up one minute and freezing the next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Sean nodded as he walked on.</p><p>They neared the door to the Black Box Cinema.</p><p>Jenny stopped suddenly and burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cI was murdered here!\u201d she cried. \u201cMurdered...and you want me to go inside and relive what happened...and walk through pools of my own blood?\u201d</p><p>Officer Duffy was watching them, Sean knew. They couldn\u2019t appear to be a pack of lunatics; dealing with the local police was difficult enough as it was.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jenny!\u201d Madison whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe need you, kid,\u201d Bogie said. He had an arm around Jenny\u2019s shoulders, strong and supportive.</p><p>No good.</p><p>Jenny was still sobbing.</p><p>Sean could see the strained expressions on the faces of his living companions.</p><p>Madison walked up to him, took his arm and whispered, \u201cOh, God, Sean, should we be doing this to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to help the living?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t happy about what they were doing himself. He just knew they had to use any method they could to find the truth. Duffy kept staring at them; thankfully, Bogie had managed to move Jenny along.</p><p>As they approached the front door to the cinema, Jenny again tried to hang back. Her tears were coming in a geyser, despite Bogie\u2019s attempts to calm her down.</p><p>Sean waited until they were inside. To the best of his knowledge, the only camera running was the one that scanned anyone trying to enter.</p><p>Torn, he tried to touch Jenny, but of course, he couldn\u2019t. He could only feel the cold where his hand stirred the air. Lamely he said, \u201cJenny, I\u2019m so sorry. I am so, so sorry. But you did care about Alistair. Jenny, you said you felt guilty about using him. Maybe you can redeem yourself by helping us. We really need you to do that. It would be such a good thing for Alistair and Eddie and all of us\u2014and God knows, you must want to catch this bastard.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her cheeks and tried to square her shoulders. \u201cDo you think I can...make up for the bad things I did?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cWe stay around for a reason, Jenny,\u201d Bogie said. \u201cThis may be your reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I do want that bastard nailed to the wall and skinned alive!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure we can make that happen,\u201d Sean told her, trying to smile.</p><p>It worked; she smiled back through her tears.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s okay. We\u2019re with you,\u201d Madison assured her.</p><p>As they walked through the lobby, Jenny sniffed. \u201cI...I can almost smell the popcorn,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere is a nice scent of popcorn in the air,\u201d Kat agreed.</p><p>They passed the cinema, and Sean paused. \u201cJenny, was the door really open when you arrived?\u201d</p><p>Jenny shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see you opening it on the security footage,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cI was really careful. I knew there was a camera so I hid my movements with my body,\u201d Jenny admitted. \u201cI had a key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get the key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d taken Alistair\u2019s earlier in the week and had a copy made. Can you tell him that?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m sure he feels horrible. He really loves and admires his dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we will!\u201d Madison said. \u201cWhat happened to your key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know. I slid it back in my pocket, I think.\u201d</p><p>Sean made a mental note to ask Knox and the medical examiner about the key.</p><p>They walked through the office. The poster hiding the door had been moved aside, as it was whenever the museum was open to the public. They started down the stairs to the tunnel, Bogie holding on to Jenny, who clung to him as if she were going to a second execution.</p><p>She was, in a way.</p><p>They moved past the tableaux. Ahead, Sean could see the chalk marks and the blood still on the floor. He wondered if bringing Jenny here could really help.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said to her. \u201cYou said Alistair didn\u2019t do it. We believe that. In fact, we know it, thanks to you. You don\u2019t want to see him go to prison for the rest of his life, do you? Or...worse?\u201d</p><p>Jenny looked back at him. \u201cNo,\u201d she said solemnly. \u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry\u2014I\u2019m dead, and I\u2019m still being a coward. What can happen to me in this place now? No, no, you\u2019re right. I can fight back. I can help you.\u201d</p><p>She led the way.</p><p>They walked by The Maltese Falcon, Citizen Kane and The Glass Key. And then Laura, Casablanca and more.</p><p>Bogie, Sean noted, paused for a moment, a look on his face that was so poignant Sean felt his own heart skip a beat. But the horrible tinny smell of blood and death seemed to have become more intense since he\u2019d entered the tunnel, and he knew that tomorrow, they\u2019d have to bring in the hazmat clean-up crews. It was important that they get it right today, that they get whatever they could.</p><p>They reached the last tableau. Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum.</p><p>Jenny stood very still, staring at the chalk on the floor. And the blood.</p><p>Then she pointed to the tableau. \u201cIt\u2019s like it\u2019s just a touch off-kilter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so, too,\u201d Madison said. \u201cBut the cops were up there\u2014they probably didn\u2019t know how to put it back exactly right.\u201d</p><p>Jenny nodded distractedly. \u201cWe saw the tableau\u2014it\u2019s Alistair\u2019s favorite film! Then he noticed that the door leading into the studio was already ajar. It should\u2019ve been closed and locked. When he walked ahead, I heard a noise. I caught a glimpse of gold braid on a sleeve. I tried to turn, but then he had me. He came up behind me. I was so stunned and so scared...I screamed. Alistair came back\u2014but even as he did, I felt the blade....\u201d She touched her neck. \u201cI don\u2019t really remember the pain. I remember the spurt of blood and thinking, Wow, that\u2019s so much blood. I\u2019m going to die. And then...then I was cold, and the world seemed blank until...I knew I was dead. I could feel no pain, and I just wanted to sleep and pretend it wasn\u2019t real. There was the morgue\u2014so humiliating. And then...then I heard you speak to me!\u201d she said, turning to Sean.</p><p>\u201cJenny, this is important,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWas there still a priest in the tableau when there was a robed guy with a blackout on his face behind you?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t look at the tableau again. I remember falling\u2014or being flung down. And I remember seeing Alistair\u2019s face. I think he wanted to fight for me. He would have died for me. He never got the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the killer say anything, Jenny?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>She thought for a minute, then shook her head. \u201cNo. Alistair screamed at him, but he didn\u2019t say anything at all. The last thing I recall was Alistair shouting and trying to reach me. He started to rush forward...and went down in the blood. My blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d Bogie asked. His voice was low, rough and raspy. Jenny seemed to be holding her own, but Bogie was torn by the pain of it. \u201cIs it okay if we leave?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, you can take her out. Thank you, Bogie,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Bogie walked her back toward the Black Box Cinema, one arm around her. They seemed to disappear before they got to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere did this get us?\u201d Madison demanded. Her eyes were narrowed. Accusing.</p> <p>\u201cTo the world of illusion,\u201d Sean told her. He stepped over the velvet cord into the tableau and walked through the scene, studying each character.</p><p>Kat and Madison stood there quietly, observing him.</p><p>\u201cWe need to watch Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum,\u201d Sean muttered.</p><p>\u201cI know you think the movie might have something to do with the murder,\u201d Madison said, \u201cbut how? And are we talking about the original or the remake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe original. Alistair was watching the movie. The killer knew he\u2019d be watching it, and dressed up as one of the characters\u2014as the killer in the movie, to be precise.\u201d Sean went from mannequin to mannequin. They were just that. Nothing flesh and blood about them at all.</p> <p>But the killer had been flesh and blood. No question of that. So how had he gotten in and out?</p><p>Sean left the tableau, aware that Kat and Madison were studying him intently. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, we don\u2019t know how the killer got down here. But he manipulated two minutes from the security video. I think he got in here somehow and that he knew where to hide. Kat, how much blood would he have on him if he caught her from behind? Would he be covered in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. Not if the blood spurted forward and he pushed her away from him immediately. I\u2019m assuming he\u2019d have gotten some on him. From the knife, certainly. And a sleeve probably would have had to have caught some. From what we\u2019ve reconstructed of the attack, the flow of blood would\u2019ve been forward.\u201d</p><p>Madison was still watching him, frowning. She moved from the position where Jenny had been seized toward the door that led to the studio. She shook her head, looking at Sean, a baffled expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cEven if it was just a few drops...if the killer had gone this way, he\u2019d have tracked blood. I can\u2019t believe he escaped through the studio,\u201d she said. \u201cSurely, there would\u2019ve been something here, some clue.\u201d</p><p>The crime scene unit had gone over the tunnel with fine-tooth combs. But they\u2019d expected to find blood there. Spatter, spray...drops.</p> <p>Because Alistair had run back through the tunnel to reach Bailey over at the studio.</p><p>Dropping low, Sean began to inspect the area of the tableau again. And it was then that he noticed the slight smear on the skirt of the Dianna Breen mannequin.</p><p>\u201cHe came back this way,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Both of the woman looked at him in surprise. \u201cHe came back this way,\u201d he repeated, \u201cand then...\u201d</p><p>The backdrop was black. A black-painted plaster wall. Sean walked over and began to tap it. The sound was hollow.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something behind the tableau,\u201d he said.</p><p>Standing next to him, Madison tapped, as well. They heard the same hollow sound, and she turned to him with large eyes. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing back there. We\u2019re actually underground now, Sean. This is just a tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may be underground, and this may be a tunnel,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is something back there. Keep tapping, press on things\u2014there has to be a release here somewhere. I know the killer came back this way.\u201d</p> <p>They spent the next few minutes pushing, prodding, tapping the wall. They were still at it when Sean heard Logan calling out to him. The others had arrived.</p><p>\u201cLogan! We\u2019re in the tunnel.\u201d He stepped down and waited for Logan, Jane, Tyler and Kelsey to join them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done a great job getting along with Knox,\u201d Logan said. \u201cHe was receptive to us and actually helpful. We have the notes from all the employee interviews, and he gave us lists of others we might want to question. That\u2019s pretty good, considering how unusual it is that the FBI would be called in for one murder in his jurisdiction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a little annoyed at first. I guess he\u2019s resigned, maybe even glad. Whatever happens, he won\u2019t be the fall guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve found something?\u201d Kat asked. \u201cThis is quite a place. And eerie\u2014the tableaux are really excellent, and being down here is kind of creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA special-effects studio filled with monsters and surrounded by a cemetery,\u201d Tyler commented. \u201cAnd the work I\u2019ve seen here is amazing.\u201d</p><p>Madison smiled at him. \u201cIt is an amazing place,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cThe cemetery was always here,\u201d Sean said. \u201cIf I remember correctly, the property was all owned by the previous owner\u2014or his father. His father or grandfather, first. They donated the land for the cemetery in the late 1800s. The studio was built in the 1930s, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a bit later,\u201d Madison said. \u201cThe early 1940s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone had a sense of humor,\u201d Kat remarked. \u201cBuilding a special-effects studio\u2014known for fantastic zombies, mummies and vampires, among other creatures\u2014beside a cemetery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget the cemetery for now,\u201d Sean said. \u201cThere\u2019s something behind this wall, and I want to know what it is. Or I should say\u2014there isn\u2019t something. If you listen, you can tell there\u2019s no earth behind it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think there\u2019s some kind of hidden door here?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I can\u2019t find any mechanism.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the team joined them, tapping, stamping on the floor, feeling for cracks in the wall\u2019s surface.</p><p>\u201cWe could break it down,\u201d Tyler Montague suggested. \u201cWe\u2019d need to get some sledgehammers....\u201d</p><p>Sean grinned. Tyler was as muscled as a linebacker. He could break it down.</p><p>\u201cI think we have to find the trap door or whatever it is,\u201d Sean said. \u201cOr come at it from the other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we get to the other side?\u201d Madison asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember I told you that the elevator in the studio could reach the basement?\u201d Sean said. \u201cWe have to get Eddie to come over with the key that\u2019ll take it down there. The tunnel connects to the studio here. There has to be another tunnel on the opposite side. I\u2019m going to call Eddie and ask him to bring the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd instead of breaking things down while we wait,\u201d Logan said, \u201cMadison can show the rest of us the studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Madison gestured at the door. \u201cWe can go that way. I\u2019m sure the forensics teams have gotten everything they can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just waiting for us to finish in here,\u201d Logan said. \u201cMadison, if you would.\u201d</p><p>Madison glanced at Sean, almost as though she wanted his approval, and when he nodded, she led the others through the connecting door.</p><p>Sean found himself alone in the tunnel.</p><p>He stood very still for a moment. But he was truly alone. He didn\u2019t know where Bogie had taken Jenny, but he was sure she was in good company.</p><p>No...there was nothing that hinted of a world beyond in the tunnel now. There was nothing at all, except for the sickening smell of blood.</p><p>Madison felt as if she was taking a tour group through the studio. Sean\u2019s team members were careful and polite, oohing and aahing over the work they saw going on. Logan Raintree was more somber, asking her about lockdown and the current projects, particularly The Unholy.</p><p>\u201cAnticipation can be the impetus that makes a movie score big at the box office,\u201d Madison explained. \u201cSo, when we\u2019re working on comic characters or some kind of movie monster\u2014especially when there\u2019s a nice budget, and it\u2019s an important movie for a production studio\u2014we go into lockdown. And you know that we\u2019re working on the remake of Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum.\u201d She brought them over to her workstation. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m fabricating all the costumes for Sam Stone, who\u2019s being played by Oliver Marshall. He comes here for his fittings. He was due back in this week for his last one. I don\u2019t know what the schedule will be now, and I haven\u2019t heard from Mike.\u201d She paused a moment, then began to explain. \u201cIn the movie, Sam is slipped some drugs, and the priest is able to make him believe that jackals and other monsters come to life. He battles that in his mind. We work with foam and latex and all kinds of materials to create them.\u201d She lifted one of the tarps covering her work. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing typical contemporary clothing in most of the movie, but in the hallucination scenes, he has ancient Egyptian weaponry. Of course, a number of scenes are done with his stunt double. In the fight scenes, he\u2019s got a helmet on, so you don\u2019t see his face most of the time. When the stunt double\u2019s working he wears a face shield. In this case, it\u2019s easy. The helmet goes over...\u201d</p><p>Her words trailed off as she raised a piece of black cloth. The material was so sheer it could go over an actor\u2019s face and still allow him to see and breathe.</p><p>And when an actor wore a headpiece made of that material, he appeared to have no face at all. It worked extremely well for long shots when the stunt double was stepping in for the actor; sometimes, the character was too distant for the facial features to be clearly seen, and sometimes, the face could be digitized in.</p><p>She looked at Logan and swallowed.</p><p>\u201cThis...this is what the killer must have used,\u201d she said in a hushed voice. \u201cBoth Jenny and Alistair said he had no face. If you had a headpiece of this stuff on under a hood, it would look like you were...faceless.\u201d</p><p>Sean went out to meet Eddie Archer when he\u2019d arrived at the studio. He wasn\u2019t alone; he was with a woman, and to Sean\u2019s surprise, it wasn\u2019t Helena LaRoux, his present wife. Eddie had come within minutes of being called, and he was accompanied by Benita Lowe, his ex-wife.</p><p>Benita was beautiful, but then Eddie was attracted to women who were showpieces. She was about five-foot-five, with raven-dark hair, deep brown eyes and exotic features. She was smart, too, and when it seemed that she was getting nothing but supporting roles and leads in B movies, she\u2019d segued into producing and directing, performing only when she was offered a role she really wanted. Sean didn\u2019t know what had really split the two of them up; there\u2019d been rumors that she was unfaithful, according to Madison. But then, this was indeed Hollywood, and when there weren\u2019t any good rumors to go around, some storyteller would invent one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSean!\u201d Despite her solemnity, Benita said his name with warmth. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see you. I\u2019m just sorry about the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too, Benita, but it\u2019s good to see you. You\u2019re doing well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, very, thank you. I\u2019ve been wanting to see Eddie, and we got our chance today. We were at lunch. I wanted him to know that he and Alistair have my undying support.\u201d</p> <p>Eddie watched the exchange in silence. \u201cSean, you have something?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cEddie, I\u2019d like to take the elevator down to the basement in the studio.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Eddie shook his head. \u201cNo one\u2019s been down there in at least a decade. I\u2019m sure I have the only key. It could be really dangerous down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does the basement lead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, where does it lead?\u201d Eddie repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s a basement. Basements don\u2019t lead anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think this one does,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cLeave it to the master of illusion.\u201d Benita gave him a glimmer of a smile.</p><p>\u201cI just need the key. Don\u2019t worry about any danger. This is what I do now, and my team and I know how to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you. I may remember something when we\u2019re down there,\u201d Eddie said.</p><p>\u201cThe scene hasn\u2019t been cleared yet,\u201d Sean reminded him.</p><p>\u201cThe Black Box Cinema and the tunnel museum haven\u2019t been cleared yet,\u201d Eddie corrected. \u201cThe studio\u2014we\u2019re opening it for work tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Sean looked across the lot, where Duffy and other officers were still on duty. He didn\u2019t want to take a chance on someone thinking Eddie Archer might taint evidence.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cBut everyone figures we\u2019ve got a conflict of interest here to begin with, rather than realizing you\u2019re going to understand the cinema and the studio better than any other cop. I\u2019ll go with you to the studio and down to the basement. If you find anything after that, I\u2019ll keep my distance.\u201d</p><p>Eddie was grim and determined, and Sean gave in.</p><p>\u201cBenita, do you mind waiting?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I mind. I\u2019m scared of being anywhere around this place,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBenita, there are a pack of cops out here. I\u2019d say you were safe. And I\u2019d rather not have to worry about your prints being somewhere,\u201d Sean told her.</p><p>\u201cHow long do they stay on a surface? Because my prints are already all over this place. I used to be married to Eddie, remember? And I came to the studio frequently back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but they won\u2019t be in the basement, and that\u2019s the point. Please wait here,\u201d Sean said again.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Eddie echoed. \u201cDo as Sean asks.\u201d</p><p>She let out a deep sigh, and then stroked Eddie\u2019s cheek. \u201cAll right.\u201d She turned to Sean. \u201cI expect you to get this whole mess sorted out, okay?\u201d Looking back at Eddie, she said, \u201cI know you\u2019ll want to head home or to the hospital when you\u2019re done, but I\u2019ll hang around for a bit, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you, Benita,\u201d Eddie murmured.</p><p>Benita walked toward Eddie\u2019s car and slipped into the passenger seat. She had a way of walking that Sean could only describe as stylized. So did Helena, but hers was different.</p><p>\u201cI told you, Sean. I\u2019m here to provide anything you need\u2014anytime,\u201d Eddie said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. You can meet the team in a few minutes. Let\u2019s get to the studio and the elevator. I want to go to that basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure the elevator will even go there anymore. I can\u2019t remember the last time I took it down that far,\u201d Eddie muttered. \u201cA decade ago at least. Lord, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any light down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the elevator inspected, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. It\u2019s just that we never use the basement. Anything we tried to store down there deteriorated too quickly. The place was too damp, I guess. We didn\u2019t really need the space so didn\u2019t bother with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the elevator should work, and I\u2019ll get a flashlight from Bailey. I know he\u2019ll have a bunch\u2014he\u2019s prepared for the earthquake that\u2019ll rip out our electrics,\u201d Sean said. He winced at the word our. He hadn\u2019t worked here in years. He\u2019d always have a soft spot for the studio, though, and would probably always feel a part of it. He\u2019d been an adult\u2014but young, just out of college\u2014when he worked here, so the place was an influential part of his past. The people, too...</p><p>Colin Bailey was at the security station, as Sean had expected. He snapped to attention when he saw Eddie. Although Eddie was distracted, he seemed aware of Colin\u2019s attempts to reassure him and was cordial in return.</p><p>Sean procured a large lantern-size flashlight from Bailey and steered Eddie into the office side of the studio and toward the elevator. It was fairly large, a necessity when taking large props or costume pieces from one level to another or to one of the storage areas.</p><p>Eddie\u2019s fingers seemed to tremble as he fit the key into the lock that would allow the elevator to go down to the basement level. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long. So long...\u201d he whispered as they stepped inside.</p><p>The elevator didn\u2019t squeak or protest. A moment later, it came to a silent and slightly jarring halt. The door opened.</p><p>A black hole seemed to gape before them. A maw. Stygian was the word that came to Sean\u2019s mind. The basement was pitch-dark and smelled of must, earth, decay.</p><p>Sean turned on the flashlight and let it blaze around him. The basement seemed empty, and he couldn\u2019t see anything other than the concrete support beams that stood here and there.</p><p>Until he saw the arm bone jutting through the side wall, brilliant and opalescent as the light fell upon it.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s highly probable that the killer stole some of this cloth to hide himself,\u201d Logan said. \u201cDo you know how much you had? Is there a way to find out how much is missing?\u201d</p><p>Madison shook her head. \u201cNo. When it gets low, we just reorder it. It\u2019s a staple in many special-effects studios. There could\u2019ve been dozens of small snatches of it in the remnant bin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver there, beside the shelves.\u201d She pointed to what looked like massive bookshelves against the wall, surrounded by some of the rat creatures. There weren\u2019t any books on the shelves, just endless bolts of fabric\u2014bolts of metallic cloth and glossy knits in brilliant colors, the better to create the world of The Unholy. Right now, there was a lot of \u201cblackout\u201d material.</p><p>\u201cThe large green garbage can against the wall has remnants in it. We usually have remnants of this stuff because the fabric is delicate and I probably do at least ten masks for a stunt double during filming,\u201d Madison explained.</p><p>\u201cI assume,\u201d Logan said, \u201cthat anyone could have helped themselves to a few remnants and not been noticed, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d really notice anything around here?\u201d Jane asked, and laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with dozens of human skulls, sketched hundreds of crime scenes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this...this is creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work with dead bodies and I have to agree,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cWait until you see all the mannequins in the hall,\u201d Madison warned her.</p><p>\u201cI can only imagine,\u201d Jane said, staring at their fabricated victims from the Victorian murder movie\u2014Miss Mary, Parson Bridge and Myra Sue.</p><p>\u201cThings aren\u2019t half as creepy as real people,\u201d Tyler stated, and they all nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re good, but remember\u2014they\u2019re not real, they\u2019re just things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s about the emotions good props create,\u201d Jane said with a shrug. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be locked up alone in this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a little creepy when there aren\u2019t many people here, and you\u2019re not sure where your coworkers are,\u201d Madison told her, smiling. Then her smile faded. \u201cBut it never bothered me...before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison, can you give us about half a yard of that fabric?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She went to the bin and pulled out a piece.</p><p>As she did, a phone rang, and she heard Logan pick up.</p><p>\u201cRight away,\u201d he said.</p><p>Madison stared at him, as did the others.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she mouthed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re needed in the basement. Sean and Eddie will meet us at the elevator on this level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs all of us? What did he find?\u201d Madison asked.</p><p>\u201cA bone,\u201d Logan said. \u201cA human bone.\u201d</p><p>10</p><p>Despite the heavy-duty lantern, it was difficult to see much in the basement.</p><p>But the bone, Sean was certain, was real\u2014and human. He\u2019d soon know for sure; Eddie had taken his key to go back to the first floor and bring the others down to the basement. Kat Sokolov would recognize immediately what they had.</p><p>The basic structure of the basement was sound, but there were areas where the concrete that constructed the below-ground walls was worn through. The hard-packed earth beyond might have created pressure on the sides. He\u2019d found the bone stuck in the wall, and what it meant, Sean had no idea.</p><p>\u201cIt is real, and it is human. A humerus. Hard to say exactly how old,\u201d Kat said, studying the bone. \u201cAre there...more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just that one bone. It came out of the wall,\u201d Sean told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Oh, God, what else?\u201d Eddie moaned.</p><p>Madison cleared her throat. \u201cEddie, we\u2019re bordering the graveyard here.\u201d She looked at Sean. \u201cIs it possible that this arm bone belongs to someone long dead\u2014and with time, it\u2019s worked its way through? I don\u2019t know that much about funerary processes and certainly not in the 1800s, but weren\u2019t pine boxes allowed back then? We\u2019ve only recently\u2014in human history, that is\u2014learned that disease can be spread, so we started using sealed coffins.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s possible,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it would make sense.\u201d Kat seemed relieved.</p><p>Sean went to stand by the elevator entrance and surveyed the room. Yes, the basement was larger than the structure above. It stretched beneath the property border, he thought.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019ll need to get someone down here to shore up the walls, make repairs.\u201d Eddie sighed. \u201cOh, Lord, we may have to\u2014to get real structural changes made. I don\u2019t think this can be legal. Or up to code. I didn\u2019t realize how far the basement juts out. I never spent enough time down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we might have the mystery of the bone solved,\u201d Sean said. \u201cBut I still think there has to be another tunnel\u2014leading to the Black Box Cinema.\u201d</p><p>He paused for a minute, getting his bearings, and then walked in the direction of the cinema. He felt a presence right behind him and swung around; it was Madison.</p><p>She stopped. There was a smudge of dirt on her nose and he smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of the dark?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI just like to see where I\u2019m going,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you have the light.\u201d</p> <p>Actually, he saw that the whole group was behind him. He looked back at them all. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work. We need more light,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go up and see what Colin Bailey can rig up for us,\u201d Eddie announced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Jane volunteered.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m not really trusted, am I?\u201d Eddie said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s under suspicion, right?\u201d</p><p>Jane laughed. \u201cWell, that\u2019s true\u2014until we have an answer, we can\u2019t really trust anyone. But it\u2019s not that, Eddie. I just happen to prefer the light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn FBI agent who doesn\u2019t like the dark,\u201d Eddie said, managing a smile.</p> <p>\u201cHey! We\u2019re human, too. Let\u2019s go get some light,\u201d Jane encouraged him.</p><p>\u201cWe have to report the bone to the proper authorities,\u201d Kat said. \u201cEven if it is an old bone. For one thing, there are health issues at stake. Not to mention the dignity of human remains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we will report it. But not yet,\u201d Sean told her.</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet,\u201d Kat agreed. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to start meeting with the employees in another forty-five minutes, Logan,\u201d she reminded him, touching the illuminator on her watch.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll help Sean get some lighting rigged up and then we\u2019ll head out,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Sean kept feeling along the walls. The place had been built properly, but some of the concrete had been weakened. So far, he hadn\u2019t come across anything suspicious. Madison was testing the walls, too\u2014close behind him.</p><p>They heard the elevator\u2019s soft whisper as it rose again with Eddie and Jane on board. The silence in the darkened basement was eerie as the rest of them continued to walk along the walls, tapping here and there.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s divide and conquer,\u201d Sean suggested.</p> <p>They did so. Sean knew that a few of his team might think he was looking for something that didn\u2019t exist. But the rule was that if one of them had a hunch, they all cooperated in seeking the truth behind that person\u2019s suspicion or theory.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before the elevator returned to the basement, bearing Eddie and Colin Bailey. Colin had brought not just more flashlights, but cord and nails so they could rig the lights around the basement.</p><p>\u201cAgent Everett is acting as security while I\u2019m down here,\u201d Bailey told Sean earnestly. \u201cI thought that was all right, seeing as how she\u2019s an agent and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Colin,\u201d Sean said, taking the cord. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can get the angles and corners covered, and position the lights to help us see around the support beams, as well.\u201d</p><p>They set to work; when they were done with the rigging, Logan spoke to Sean. \u201cSean, we\u2019ll leave you and Madison here, working on whatever you can find. We have appointments to start interviewing employees down at the station, plus the friend Jenny talked to before going to the studio. I could put it off, I suppose, but I don\u2019t want to. If each of us takes on a few more people to question, I can have Tyler stay with you two down here. Safety in numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fair,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAnd I agree. It was arranged that we\u2019d do the interviews this afternoon. All those people will be showing up, so we need to go ahead with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if the three of you stay here, you might discover something. And remember, we\u2019re a team. If you find anything, we can all spread out tomorrow. And it\u2019s not that we won\u2019t share our information with the police, but I\u2019d rather we got first crack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Sean murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe should take the initiative,\u201d Tyler agreed.</p><p>\u201cWorks for me,\u201d Sean said, grinning at his old friend. He\u2019d known both Logan and Tyler Montague before their team was formed. They\u2019d been Rangers in Texas, and he\u2019d been on call with various law enforcement agencies in San Antonio and other areas of Texas, especially when the police were baffled by security footage. Tyler was a good man who always had his back. He glanced at Madison to see if she seemed frightened or ill at ease. She didn\u2019t; she looked as if she was anxious to continue their search.</p><p>In fact, she said a quick goodbye to the others and returned to examining the walls, running her hands over them, heedless of lichen or mold.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Sean called to Logan as he stepped into the elevator.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSet the elevator to rise and then toss me the key\u2014we\u2019ll want to get out of here at some point!\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded and did as Sean had asked. When he threw the key, Sean caught it smoothly and pocketed it. He didn\u2019t relish the idea of discovering that they were stuck in the basement, calling for help. So far, his phone service had worked down here, but he didn\u2019t have much power left.</p><p>Again, they heard the soft whir of the elevator as the others left, Colin Bailey going back with them to take over his post so Jane could accompany Logan and Kat to the police station.</p><p>Sean wondered how useful it would be to question all the employees, many of whom were relatively recent. The more he delved into the situation, the more he became convinced that the murderer was someone who knew the studio extremely well.</p><p>Except...who knew this building, especially this basement, as well as Eddie Archer?</p><p>They began again, working in silence, each on a different side, leaving only the area around the elevator unexamined. As time passed, Sean began to feel that maybe he\u2019d been mistaken. Maybe the basement was just a basement\u2014and the fact that it extended into the cemetery had been kept quiet to avoid problems and complications with property ownership, the cemetery, health codes.</p><p>Suddenly Madison let out a whoop of triumph. \u201cThere\u2019s something here\u2014it\u2019s a door!\u201d</p><p>He hurried over to her. All the basement walls seemed to be damp and covered in a thin patina of lichen. But, as Madison had done, Sean ran his fingers over that section of wall. And he felt what she\u2019d felt. There was a break, a thin line that indicated the wall wasn\u2019t solid concrete.</p><p>But the almost imperceptible groove was going in the wrong direction. It was far from the wall that should lead to the cinema, if such a wall, such a doorway, existed.</p><p>\u201cIt seems wedged,\u201d he said. He set his strength against it, and the door started to give.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tyler, come and help!\u201d he called.</p><p>Tyler stooped low to put pressure on the bottom while Sean did the same at the top.</p><p>\u201cThere must be some mechanism holding it in place,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>As Madison watched them struggle, she squinted, studying the wall. A moment later, she stepped between them and ran her hands down the opposite side, across from the slit that had shown them there was an opening. She saw what Sean hadn\u2019t. There was an actual lever. The discoloration caused by the dampness had hidden it, and made it look like part of the wall.</p><p>When she pulled the lever down, the door slid open with only a slight creaking sound. It was a narrow door, with just enough space for one person to slip through.</p><p>Sean raised his lantern as Tyler and Madison stood behind him.</p><p>For a moment, they were silent.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Madison said weakly.</p><p>\u201cWell, there is another tunnel,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>And there was. It led through what appeared to be an underground labyrinth of catacombs. They could see where the walls ahead of them broke and the light diffused, leading to other tunnels. On either side of the tunnel before them there were shelves; some had slabs, the kind found in mausoleums around the world. Some of the slabs were broken, while some had completely fallen away. A few still retained very old plaques, announcing the names of the deceased who lay within the tombs. Some remains were in shabby coffins, old wood that was deteriorating. A few of the deceased were in shrouds, and spiderwebs rather than plaster or stone were their only cover.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Madison said again.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Tyler looked at Madison. \u201cThose aren\u2019t, uh, any kind of special effects, are they?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were huge and bright in the eerie lantern light. \u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she told him. \u201cThe cemetery was actually the first thing on these grounds, so I believe that...I believe these are very old underground vaults.\u201d</p><p>Sean touched the Glock .22 he wore at almost all times, just for reassurance that it was there. He wasn\u2019t expecting trouble from the dead; he was sure someone living had recently traveled through the tunnel. But he didn\u2019t intend to be caught down there and surprised by a killer.</p><p>\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve just stepped into a Hammer film\u2014and that we\u2019ll find Vincent Price at the end of the walkway, guarding a tomb,\u201d Tyler murmured.</p><p>Sean grinned. He hadn\u2019t expected such a comment from Tyler. He was glad to see that Madison was smiling, too. She might deal in special effects, but it was truly unsettling to be down here, as if they were entombed in the dank, dark, coffinlike interior of the basement, especially now with scores of buried dead stretching before them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVincent Price was cremated,\u201d Madison said, \u201cand his ashes were scattered over Point Dume in Southern California.\u201d She flushed. \u201cI was a huge fan,\u201d she explained. \u201cAccording to his reputation, he was one of the nicest men, as well as being brilliant on film.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s upstairs\u2014a likeness of him, anyway\u2014in the tableau of a scene from Laura,\u201d Sean said absently, taking a step into the tunnel. \u201cIf he was here I\u2019m willing to bet he\u2019d give us a hand.\u201d He wished then that Bogie was still with them. He might have known more about the cemetery and the original owner of the studio and property.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Madison said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going in there now, are you?\u201d</p> <p>He stepped back, looking at her. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could get help,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want help right now, Madison,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cUntil we\u2019ve got the whole team back, I don\u2019t want to tell anyone we\u2019ve discovered the door. I\u2019d like to check out the place and see what we can find first.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cTyler can take you back up, if you want, and arrange for one of the policemen out there to get you to the station.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head vehemently. \u201cNo...Tyler\u2019s not taking me anywhere and leaving you down here alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the living can hurt me, Madison. And I\u2019m armed,\u201d he said. \u201cFBI agent, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnyone can be in danger\u2014especially alone,\u201d Madison argued stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cMadison, I\u2019m a really good shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have eyes in the back of your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Tyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go up. I\u2019m less afraid these days when I\u2019m with you and your team,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just waiting for direction,\u201d Tyler said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cMadison, you don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>Madison kept staring at Sean. She shook her head. \u201cIf you\u2019re going, so am I. In between the two of you, of course.\u201d</p><p>Sean breathed a sigh of exasperation. \u201cAll right! If I can\u2019t get rid of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get rid of me.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t proper procedure to involve a civilian to this extent. But, then again, there wasn\u2019t anything that smacked of the ordinary or \u201cproper\u201d about their team.</p><p>The three of them began the trek down the tunnel, moving slowly. Sean shifted his light, studying the wall, the crypts and the floor, searching for any sign of blood.</p><p>He nearly stepped on a femur that had fallen from one of the decayed crypts.</p><p>\u201cSome of these must have been illegal burials, even in the late 1800s,\u201d Madison whispered, her hand curling around his arm as she came up close behind him. Her voice sounded eerie in the close and fetid air beneath the ground.</p> <p>\u201cPossibly. And maybe not for a bad reason. Maybe their loved ones didn\u2019t have the money for a legitimate burial,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Tyler said. He pointed at a simple brass plaque on one of the memorials. \u201cJuan Diaz, born 1891. Beloved. Maybe some of these folks were illegal immigrants, and whoever allowed them to be buried here was doing their families a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would make sense,\u201d Madison said. \u201cI, um, I know the previous owner.\u201d She winced. \u201cHe haunts the cemetery sometimes. I think he would\u2019ve condoned something like this out of kindness.\u201d</p><p>Sean was only half listening. They\u2019d reached the first fork in the underground labyrinth and his light had picked up something on the floor.</p><p>He bent low and touched the stain, then examined it carefully. Tyler and Madison hovered over him. \u201cBlood,\u201d he said.</p><p>He threw his light to the left. There were more droplets and one larger stain.</p><p>\u201cHe came this way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe killer came this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the tunnel leads back to the northwest,\u201d Tyler added.</p><p>\u201cBack...to the Black Box Cinema?\u201d Madison asked.</p><p>Sean nodded. He started to follow the blood trail, walking faster. The tunnels must have contained several hundred burials, and there had to be an exit somewhere that led up to a mausoleum or memorial aboveground, unless it had been destroyed sometime in the past century. But he was pretty sure he knew how the killer had gotten in and out.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized how quickly he was moving until he stopped and Madison crashed hard into his back. At that moment he recognized that he liked the way she clung to him. He liked the softness of her body against his, the sweet scent of her hair and perfume that was a buffer against the scent of death. He wanted to hold her, tell her they were all right, but this wasn\u2019t the time\u2014and certainly not the place.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here\u201d was all he said.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He pointed to the wall before them. It was cleaner than the rest of the walls had been, as if someone had discovered it some time ago and taken pains to figure out how it worked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s got to be another lever to open this wall,\u201d Sean said. \u201cAnd I can guarantee you\u2014it\u2019s going to open straight into the tableau of Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum.\u201d</p><p>Tyler stepped forward as Sean held up the light. Madison remained between the two of them, but closer to Sean. He had to concentrate on what he was doing. He suddenly wished he\u2019d insisted she go to the police station. He tried to separate his physical reactions and emotions toward Madison from the work at hand. He was skilled at total concentration\u2014usually. And yet it was good to smell her hair and wash away the scent of the bodies surrounding him, if only for a few sweet breaths.</p><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d Tyler shouted.</p><p>He pulled the lever, and a small section slid back. There was a whisper of metal against metal.</p><p>They found themselves staring at the backs of the mannequins\u2014the slightly off-kilter exhibit of Sam Stone, his heroine Dianna Breen and the killer Egyptian priest, Amun Mopat.</p><p>\u201cYou were right!\u201d Madison said softly.</p><p>Sean nodded.</p><p>\u201cUm, should we go out this way?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He smiled and set his hand on her shoulder. \u201cNo, we\u2019re closing the door, and we\u2019re going back the way we came. I want to keep it quiet for now that we\u2019ve discovered the killer\u2019s mode of entry and exit. We still have to figure out exactly what he did and gather some of the forensic evidence from the tunnels. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll bring in the rest of the team\u2014and more light. We know the how. We still need to figure out the who.\u201d</p><p>She released a shaky breath. \u201cBut...Eddie and Colin Bailey know we\u2019ve been in the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll come up frustrated, pretending we made a mistake\u2014that I made a mistake. There\u2019s a lot more research we have to do before we make any of our findings known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cBut shouldn\u2019t we tell Alistair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will in time,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Tyler\u2019s deep voice was reassuring. \u201cHe\u2019ll learn soon enough. We\u2019re moving fast on this, Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so sad to think of him sitting there in a mental hospital. He wasn\u2019t crazy at all\u2014isn\u2019t crazy at all. Everything happened just as he said,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to close this up and get back now,\u201d Sean ordered.</p><p>She nodded and stiffened her shoulders. \u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d</p><p>She started back through the tunnel, taking the lead. Tyler grinned at Sean, who shook his head and passed her. \u201cStay in the middle, Madison. Remember, a killer used these tunnels. Keep an armed man in front of you and one behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan,\u201d she said. Her hand fell on his waist as she positioned herself at his back.</p><p>He groaned inwardly when she touched him, gritting his teeth. His thoughts weren\u2019t appropriate for this place.</p><p>But maybe they were. Maybe human warmth and basic human desires were important. No one was immortal. Living life to its fullest extent was what they were supposed to do while they spent their time on this...plane of existence.</p><p>She was close behind him all the way, although he didn\u2019t move as quickly now. He kept eyeing the crypts and making mental notes to himself.</p><p>The robe. The costume robe the killer had used might well be hidden here somewhere. Tomorrow they\u2019d search; they had enough people and enough time to do it properly.</p><p>They walked through the corridors of bones, shrouds, decaying coffins, and vaults where the slabs remained in place. He wondered about Claymore\u2014the elder Claymore. Had the man actually been doing a kindness to illegal immigrants and the destitute, or had he been making a small fortune on the side?</p><p>At last they emerged into the basement again. Lights still shone over the walls.</p><p>Sean frowned, hoping no one had been there after them.</p><p>The studio remained in lockdown. Colin Bailey was standing watch, and there were police cars guarding the area.</p><p>And yet, he had to wonder if there wasn\u2019t a way to the surface, steps somewhere that led to a vault aboveground in the cemetery. He shouldn\u2019t have let Logan and the others leave; someone should have stood guard. But they hadn\u2019t known that they\u2019d find what they were looking for. It had been important, as well, that they follow procedure, questioning everyone who might have been involved.</p><p>Madison glanced at him as they walked toward the elevator. She laughed suddenly, and her laugh was real, if a bit shaky.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what I look like, but you resemble one of our zombies,\u201d she said.</p><p>He noticed then that she was covered in spiderwebs and dirt. He smoothed a tangle of webbing from her hair, then inspected Tyler, who was also white and smudged.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better clean ourselves up a bit,\u201d he agreed ruefully.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, reaching over and pulling webs from him. She rubbed away a smudge on his cheek. \u201cA bit of an improvement, anyway,\u201d she said, and turned to Tyler.</p><p>\u201cWe must look like a tribe of monkeys,\u201d Tyler said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow are we all now?\u201d Sean asked after a moment.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess we look all right for people who\u2019ve been running around in a basement filled with graves,\u201d Tyler muttered.</p><p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d Madison said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd showers are in order. We\u2019ll meet the others back at the hotel,\u201d Sean decided. \u201cWhen we\u2019re out of here, I\u2019ll call Logan and tell him what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe studio\u2019s supposed to reopen tomorrow,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually a good thing.\u201d Sean told her. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to see the natives in their habitat, and that may give us more to go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re convinced it\u2019s not a casual employee,\u201d Madison reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to bet the killer will show up tomorrow. He\u2019ll want to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Sean said.</p> <p>\u201cFor now, let\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI\u2019m itchy all over. I\u2019m imagining bugs\u2014spiders, ugh\u2014crawling all over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that from a Ranger!\u201d Sean couldn\u2019t help grinning.</p><p>\u201cHey, I can deal with enemies in human form,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI\u2019m not so big on creepy crawlies. I\u2019d rather wrestle a rattler than a brown recluse or black widow any day.\u201d</p><p>They stepped into the elevator, and exited on the first floor, passing by the mannequin displays in the small circular areas that separated the offices and the elevator.</p><p>For a moment, it seemed to Sean that the years were whisked away as the three of them walked by the young werewolf, a beautiful witch, a chilling vampire and the cop robot who hadn\u2019t done so well in his fight. They passed the zombie and it didn\u2019t bother him at all. But when they passed the girl from the slasher flick, all he could think about was poor Jenny and how she\u2019d died. The one remaining blue eye in the mannequin-girl\u2019s head seemed to stare at him reproachfully.</p><p>We will find your killer, Jenny. I swear we will, he vowed silently.</p> <p>Of course, Jenny wasn\u2019t there. He didn\u2019t know where Bogie had taken her; he just knew that neither of the ghosts was with them.</p><p>Leading the way, he stopped at reception and the guard station. \u201cHey, Colin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off pretty soon, too, Sean,\u201d Colin Bailey said. \u201cNash is coming in. He and I are doing twelve-hour shifts, like we do during lockdown. Now it seems especially important that one of us is here to keep guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Colin. Just hope it doesn\u2019t wear you two out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find anything down there?\u201d Bailey asked.</p><p>\u201cA lot of dirt!\u201d Sean said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure what else you thought you\u2019d find in a basement,\u201d Bailey told him. \u201cBye for now.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, Madison said good-night and Tyler politely echoed her words. They left the studio for Sean\u2019s borrowed car.</p> <p>Tyler took the wheel while Sean made a call to Logan, and Madison sat silently in the backseat. They reached the hotel, where they hurried through the lobby and up to the third floor.</p><p>\u201cShowers. What then?\u201d Madison asked.</p><p>\u201cMovie night,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to be all work and no play,\u201d Sean said, but judging by her expression, she wasn\u2019t amused. He touched her chin, still smudged despite the repairs they\u2019d attempted. \u201cLike I said this morning, I think we should enjoy a viewing of Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, the only place I could imagine seeing that film is at the Black Box,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d Sean smiled at her. \u201cYour hair looks gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of the three of us would fit right in with those mannequins in the halls,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cSean, I\u2019m going to take a shower, go down to the police station and see if I can interview some of the people who still need to be questioned. Then I\u2019ll brief the others and meet you two at the Black Box. Call me when it\u2019s been arranged and we\u2019ll be there whatever time you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan. I\u2019m going to get on the computer and see if I can come up with any references to the original Claymore and his son, the studio and anything that might\u2019ve been going on at the time,\u201d Sean told him.</p><p>They parted and went to their own rooms.</p><p>I\u2019m not afraid of cemeteries. I\u2019m not afraid of the dead!</p><p>Madison silently chanted the words in her mind as she scrubbed her hair for the third time. Probably useless, because she\u2019d end up back in the strange catacombs beneath the studio again.</p><p>No...</p><p>Tomorrow would be a workday for her, a time to return to the world of The Unholy and the specialized costume that would be worn by Oliver Marshall\u2014and his stunt double. Of course, they\u2019d all be feeling awkward, not sure what to say to one another, and there might still be a police presence on-site. No, there would be a police presence on-site.</p><p>Finally, she rinsed her hair, poured on conditioner, rinsed again and got out of the shower.</p><p>Wrapped in one towel, with another wound around her hair, she wandered back to her room. She had the television on and was gratified to see a police spokesman on the news. He was saying that although Alistair Archer had been arraigned for the murder of Jenny Henderson, new leads were causing police and FBI to delve further into the case.</p><p>The spokesman told reporters he couldn\u2019t give them any details as that information might jeopardize the case. While still being harangued by dozens of questions, the stern middle-aged man lifted his hand and said, \u201cThat is all at this time.\u201d</p><p>Surrounded by officers, he went back into the station.</p><p>Madison was only dimly aware of the reporter as he spoke to the anchor back at his studio, reconstructing the \u201cbizarre\u201d case once again.</p><p>She glanced at the bedside clock-radio and saw that it was just after five. She felt as if she\u2019d lived a lifetime that day. They hadn\u2019t had lunch, although breakfast delivered to the room had been filling. She was getting hungry, though, and besides being hungry, she was alarmed at the way she felt so alone.</p><p>But she did feel alone. More alone than ever. Maybe because she usually spent so many hours working. Maybe because she lived with a ghost much of the time. Except it wasn\u2019t just alone that she was feeling. Because her sudden loneliness had everything to do with Sean, with missing him, although she\u2019d left him only forty minutes ago....</p><p>She got dressed, determined not to think anymore.</p><p>But when she\u2019d donned jeans and a sweater, she was still restless\u2014and alone. Sitting on the foot of her bed, she began to feel as if the hours, the fears and the discoveries, were weighing on her. She couldn\u2019t just sit there any longer.</p><p>Everything in her life had changed with Alfie\u2019s call on Monday morning. She\u2019d liked her life; it was a good one. And she was lucky\u2014incredibly lucky\u2014to have her job. But everything was based on work. Great work, with wonderful coworkers. She was proud of her associations, and outside friends were often envious because she dressed stars like Oliver Marshall and spent hours on movie sets. She\u2019d never recognized until now how much she\u2019d allowed herself to overlook in life. She\u2019d blamed Bogie for the fact that she hardly ever brought a date home, but it wasn\u2019t Bogie\u2019s fault. Well, maybe it was a little bit. But she hadn\u2019t gone out in forever, and the real reason was that she hadn\u2019t met anyone she wanted to spend time with, or even one night.</p><p>She stood; she couldn\u2019t stay where she was.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what she was doing or why, but she left her room, walked across the hall and knocked on Sean\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cJust a second!\u201d he called.</p><p>A minute later, the door opened a few inches. Sean stood behind it, looking around its edge. \u201cSorry, I was waylaid by the computer,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, not moving. The scent of his soap seemed to waft into the hallway.</p><p>He must have realized she wasn\u2019t going away. He frowned slightly, but arched a brow. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I wait with you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He was silent for a few seconds, then opened the door the rest of the way. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I\u2019m not quite decent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re decent enough for me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He still hesitated. \u201cSure, come in. It\u2019ll take me a few minutes to throw some clothes on. I\u2019m a little behind\u2014I ended up on the computer. There\u2019s soft drinks and probably something harder in the suite\u2019s work area.\u201d</p><p>She walked past him, heading toward the connecting door. It was closed and she turned back to him. He\u2019d been reaching for a neat stack of clothing to bring into the bathroom with him but he paused, his frown deepening as he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cMadison, you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He smiled suddenly, as if he understood. But she knew he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt was an interesting day. There\u2019s something eerie about those catacombs, even after being in the morgue for an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s interesting all around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must feel terrible. And I\u2019m honest-to-God sorry. I never knew we\u2019d have to worry about your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with everything that\u2019s happened,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already proven how it was done. As you said, we just need to discover who.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe who, and the why.\u201d He frowned again. \u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re looking at me like that? Are you hungry? We\u2019ll eat on the way to the Black Box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dinner will be nice, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of...spending a little time together. Not in the company of ghosts or in a crypt or a graveyard.\u201d</p><p>He offered her a slow half grin, his head angling to the side in a questioning manner. \u201cI\u2019d almost think you came here to proposition me, Madison,\u201d he said softly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She met his eyes and inhaled, and tried to appear like a woman with a sophisticated sense of reality.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>11</p> <p>The moment was ridiculously awkward. It was as if time stood still as he looked back at her\u2014and yet time was ticking away. Madison thought she could actually hear the hands on the room\u2019s old-fashioned clock-radio.</p><p>But, in an odd way, it wasn\u2019t awkward at all.</p><p>She swallowed, but she was determined to be honest, and she wasn\u2019t backing down, wasn\u2019t going to pretend she was just joking.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t to going to run off in embarrassment, either; if she did, that was how she\u2019d feel forever after in his presence. Her lips curved wistfully. She realized that although she hadn\u2019t been sure of her exact intent until she\u2019d said the words, she certainly hadn\u2019t expected rejection. It wasn\u2019t that she felt any man would instantly agree to have sex with her. It was just that she believed there\u2019d been something between them. Chemistry, if nothing else.</p><p>\u201cUh, you made rather a point about not staying in my room last night,\u201d he reminded her.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut...that was, well...I didn\u2019t want to be here because I had to be here\u2014I mean, in a room with you\u2014because I was afraid. When I\u2019m afraid, I would rather be with you, but I... I\u2019m not saying this at all well.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised when he walked over to her at last. She began to feel a trembling inside her when his hands dropped to her arms, and she was intensely aware of his height and physique, his damp bare chest and the towel about his midriff. Whatever it was that she always felt when she was with him seemed amplified, like a drumbeat in her head, or a riveting pulse in her bloodstream.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I have nothing against the idea. I\u2019d be a hell of a liar if I said it hasn\u2019t played in my mind more than once,\u201d he told her. The sound of his voice seemed to sweep around her, creating a deeper sense of longing with every throaty word, every nuance.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s not the time or place,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s a fine time and place. Tyler\u2019s gone to work with the others, I\u2019ve called Eddie and arranged for a showing of the film. We won\u2019t meet at the cinema for about two and a half hours.\u201d</p><p>His green eyes seemed to have a dazzling light as he stared down at her.</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d she said, about to step back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I didn\u2019t even think. Is there someone in your life?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to wince. \u201cNo. There\u2019s no one in my life. You?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m dressed\u2014or undressed\u2014for the occasion,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cI can be, too,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMadison, I\u2019m not really... I didn\u2019t plan on sleeping with anyone. I\u2019m not prepared. I\u2019m talking about sexual responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she told him.</p><p>His smile deepened and she added, \u201cNo, I mean, really, there\u2019s no one in my life. I guess...I\u2019ve been ever hopeful.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed softly. She lowered her head, astonished that the simple sound of a laugh could be so provocative.</p><p>He lifted her chin, then pulled her against him, and once more his eyes fell on hers. \u201cYou know we live in different worlds,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDifferent and the same.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that, and there was something amused, something tender and yet still hesitant in the way he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cI care about you, Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be better if you didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just take this for what it is\u2014and for whatever time we have?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cYes. Yes, we can.\u201d</p><p>He gazed into her eyes and seemed to struggle, and she wondered if he was worried for her, for himself, or for them both. But his thumb and forefinger were already on her chin and cheek, and he lowered his head slowly. His lips touched hers as lightly as a breath. As if he was giving her every chance to move away...</p><p>He had no idea how much she wanted to be right where she was. She wished she could hold on to time and savor this closeness forever. His skin was taut and bronzed and smooth. The easy strength in his arms seemed unique, the very feel of his lips was beyond anything she might have imagined.</p><p>But his lips grew hungrier, more impassioned, and he drew her closer, his mouth like fire on hers as the kiss deepened. She felt drunk with the luxury of his touch, aware of the hardness of his muscled form, and very aware of the rise of his erection against the thin denim of her jeans and the towel that was all he wore. He\u2019d been quite right\u2014he was dressed, or undressed, for the occasion.</p><p>His hands moved down her back. She stepped out of her sandals, and together they removed her shirt. His fingers slid beneath her waistband. She imagined that no grace was possible in the act of taking off her jeans, and yet it seemed that they shimmied effortlessly down her body. The towel slipped from him as he picked her up, his eyes on hers once again as they crossed the few feet to the bed. The clothing he\u2019d been planning to wear fell to the floor, landing on top of her hastily discarded T-shirt and jeans.</p><p>He leaned over her, stroking her face, but he didn\u2019t speak. She had to wonder what was going through his mind. But she didn\u2019t speak, either; she was afraid of breaking the enchantment that had seized her.</p><p>Then she felt his mouth on hers again, and she ceased to think or analyze and gave herself completely to the sensations that overwhelmed her. His mouth left hers, trailing over her breasts. She felt the pressure of his thighs, the ripple of muscle. He moved down the length of her, kissing her, and where his lips touched, it seemed that fire erupted and spread. She touched him with feather-light strokes at first, and then the hunger inside made her bolder, and she caressed his hair and his bronzed flesh in return. His every movement against her seemed erotic; he was a practiced and natural lover, she thought, a man who knew where to touch and when, and how to tease and elicit and give all at once. She prayed that she could do the same. Again, she ceased to think, she was so caught up in the carnal and earthly sensations that swirled through her, the eroticism of his tongue on her flesh and the movement of his hands....</p><p>She cried out softly as he brought her to a fever pitch and then rose above her, sliding into her smoothly and easily, his movements a slow and evocative thrust, then escalating...becoming more and more urgent. Her hands and fingers rested on his shoulders. His eyes gazed down into hers and, once again, beyond the physical intimacy they shared in all its heady glory, she felt something deeper. It was as if his eyes could reach where no physical movement could. And yet everything\u2014their breath, the ripple of muscle, the pure eroticism of their intimacy, the pounding of their hearts\u2014seemed so intense that nothing could be deeper.</p><p>But it was.</p><p>She closed her eyes. They\u2019d taken a step together that neither of them had planned.</p><p>Afterward, she lay there for a minute, trying not to breathe, praying they wouldn\u2019t speak, that nothing would come to shatter the moment.</p><p>Then thoughts crowded her mind again, and nagging fear took hold. For her it had been as if the entire world had glowed and sparkled, but...</p><p>For him, it might have been sex. Just sex.</p><p>Maybe he knew she didn\u2019t want words; she wanted to savor the moment. He didn\u2019t speak. He held her close, and the seconds seemed to slip away. Outside, the sun fell and shadows darkened the room.</p><p>Then he turned to her, and the whole process began again, until once more, they lay side by side, silent in the wonder of aftermath.</p><p>Then his phone rang, and the sound seemed louder than music blasting from a disco club. Madison jumped. Sean eased her back down, rolling over to find the jeans he\u2019d discarded before his shower and pulling his phone from the pocket.</p><p>\u201cCameron,\u201d he answered.</p><p>She heard Logan Raintree\u2019s voice, but couldn\u2019t really make out the words.</p><p>\u201cYes, fine, all set,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving here, and we\u2019ll grab some fast food on the way.... Sure, see you in about thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>He hit the end button on his phone and looked at Madison. She was afraid he was going to give her some kind of apology, that he\u2019d thank her jokingly, but, hey, they really needed to get going now.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything like that.</p><p>\u201cRace you to the shower!\u201d he said, and leaped out of the bed.</p><p>Stunned, she watched him for a moment. Then she bounded to her feet and rushed in. \u201cNo touching!\u201d he teased. \u201cWe\u2019ll be late if you do.\u201d</p><p>He was serious about that. They passed the soap to each other, showered quickly and dressed with equal haste.</p><p>They were out the door and in the borrowed Prius before she realized she had yet to say a word.</p><p>When she finally did, it was in answer to his question about what she\u2019d like on her burger and did she want onion rings or fries. And that was fine. Since she wasn\u2019t sure what to say...</p><p>That was incredible? Far too clich\u00e9d. Thank you? Far too sniveling.</p><p>Good thing they were going to the movies!</p><p>Guilt.</p><p>Sean told himself he should\u2019ve been experiencing a massive sense of guilt\u2014not that he\u2019d done anything for which he should feel guilty. Not really. It was just that they shouldn\u2019t be involved when there was a chance that she was in danger, when they were in the middle of a case, when\u2014</p><p>No. There was no reason to feel guilt, regret or remorse. They were consenting adults with the rights of consenting adults.</p><p>He just wished...</p><p>That they\u2019d met at another time, another place. In a bar, for God\u2019s sake. Somewhere other than here and now. Because he couldn\u2019t jeopardize her, and he couldn\u2019t jeopardize the case.</p><p>But did it really make a difference in the practical sense? He\u2019d already determined that she was in danger, and maybe being closer to him was better than not.</p><p>Eddie Archer had already begun the film.</p><p>Eddie had taken it on himself to have Helena, Mike Greenwood and Andy Simons join them. Maybe that hadn\u2019t been such a bad idea; he knew the rest of the team would be observing those closest to Eddie, watching for any indiscretion. Detective Benny Knox had decided to join them, as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean sat in the darkened theater with the group as they watched Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum. He tried to remember everything he knew or had heard about the movie.</p><p>He\u2019d seen it before\u2014in this very theater. He\u2019d seen it with Eddie and Alistair and a number of the other employees at the studio.</p><p>It certainly wasn\u2019t the most famous of film noir movies. It had done well in its day, but both of the leads\u2014John De La Torre and Audrey Grant\u2014had died soon after its release, de la Torre in the service and Audrey in a plane crash as she was flying out to entertain the troops. After that, Sam Stone had somehow slipped into the pile of the \u201cmostly forgotten.\u201d He wondered why. Probably because neither of the two performers had really had a chance to become a big name. There\u2019d been an accidental death on the set as well\u2014a bit player had been electrocuted. These days it seemed that such things would make a movie more popular; in the middle of World War II, there was already too much death. Sean remembered the first time he\u2019d seen the movie; he\u2019d thought it was excellent because there were only two suspects in the murder of Dianna Breen\u2019s husband\u2014the priest, Amun Mopat, and Dianna herself. But the writing, direction and action scenes were so effective that it wasn\u2019t until the very end that you knew the widow was innocent, and you knew because the evil priest killed her just as Sam Stone discovered the truth and killed him. There had been a scene in which the mummy was brought to life.... But as Sam Stone fought the thing to save himself, he figured out that it was mechanically run and the priest was a sham. Alistair had loved the movie so much because he\u2019d wanted to direct and produce from the time he\u2019d been a little kid. This movie had exceptional special effects for the day\u2014done at this very studio\u2014and that, too, was part of its appeal.</p> <p>\u201cSam!\u201d</p><p>They were almost at the final scene. Dianna Breen cried out in horror, and Sam rushed in, pulling the priest off Dianna, nearly insane to save the woman with whom he\u2019d fallen in love. Amun Mopat went flying into another of the museum\u2019s displays, a lifelike statue of a warrior carrying a dagger. Mopat was killed, dying dramatically, but when Sam went to help the fallen Dianna, she opened her eyes for a moment, told him she loved him\u2014and died.</p><p>The credits rolled. Eddie rose to go back to the projection booth and stop the movie. The lights came on.</p><p>Knox stood and looked at Sean.</p><p>\u201cSo. What did this do? Any good at all?\u201d</p> <p>Sean stood, too. He wasn\u2019t sure why Knox was trying to intimidate him, but he was taller than Knox, so at least he had a physical advantage.</p><p>\u201cIt did a lot of good,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Eddie was coming back from the booth. \u201cWhat? What did you see in the movie that could possibly help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Mike Greenwood murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t notice it, Mike\u2014or you, Andy\u2014because you haven\u2019t been down in the museum since the crime. And you didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, turning to his team, \u201cbecause you\u2019d never seen the tableau before and wouldn\u2019t know what had changed. Helena, I\u2019m not sure how familiar you are with the tableau\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish his explanation, Madison jumped up with a gasp.</p> <p>\u201cYou know?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Her eyes met his, brilliantly blue.</p><p>\u201cTell them,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe dagger is gone\u2014the dagger in the hands of the ancient Egyptian warrior. It\u2019s gone.\u201d She looked at Sean again. \u201cThat\u2019s why it seemed just a bit off. The mannequins were all turned slightly, not back exactly where they should\u2019ve been. The sarcophagus was at an angle, the big jackal was too close to the warrior. But the dagger, the dagger that killed the priest in the movie\u2014it\u2019s gone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a real dagger?\u201d Knox asked.</p><p>\u201cThose tableaux have been up for nearly fifty years,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cYes, it was real. Not from a tomb of course, but a replica. The sarcophagus is real, too\u2014made in Egypt by Egyptian craftsmen to the correct proportions and rules of funerary art.\u201d He walked over to Madison, taking her by the shoulders. \u201cMadison, you\u2019re sure? Is there anything else? I have to get down there myself. I\u2019m probably the only one who\u2019d know if anything else was different.\u201d</p><p>Before she could respond, Helena stood, coming over to Eddie and speaking in a low voice. \u201cEddie, the dagger is gone, but...how does that help? So now the police know that a prop was stolen from the tableau. All that does is tell us what the murder weapon was\u2014or might have been.\u201d</p><p>Eddie looked sick for a minute, but turned to Sean hopefully. \u201cIt helps, doesn\u2019t it? It helps?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything we know helps,\u201d Sean assured him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s not there\u2014somewhere?\u201d Knox asked.</p><p>\u201cDetective, you don\u2019t think your team of forensic experts would\u2019ve missed a dagger?\u201d Sean said with more than a hint of sarcasm. \u201cEven if it had been precisely where it was supposed to be, they would have taken it for testing.\u201d</p><p>Knox seemed embarrassed. \u201cWould the dagger have been sharp enough after all these years to have slashed the young woman\u2019s throat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go down there,\u201d Eddie muttered again. \u201cI need to go down to the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>Knox said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to have everyone traipsing around in that tunnel. When we release it, teams have to come in to clean. We can\u2019t allow it to become a health hazard. We\u2014\u201d</p><p>Logan broke in. \u201cBenny, why don\u2019t you and Sean take Eddie down there? With Madison. We\u2019ve already been, but Eddie Archer might see something else that\u2019s amiss.\u201d He looked at Eddie. \u201cYou definitely didn\u2019t go in when you came here the night of the murder?\u201d</p><p>Eddie shook his head. \u201cIt was a crime scene, cordoned off. I just listened in complete disbelief when Detective Knox briefed me, and then...then I was with Alistair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I can come if you need me, Eddie,\u201d Helena said.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cThank you, dear, but no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait in the lobby with Helena while you go down,\u201d Logan said, indicating the team.</p><p>Kelsey stepped forward smoothly. \u201cMrs. Archer, you\u2019re an actress in your own right, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she said smoothly. \u201cI\u2019d love to hear about the roles you\u2019ve played!\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at Sean, linked arms with Helena and started walking her toward the lobby.</p><p>\u201cMike, Andy\u2014Madison did a terrific job showing us the studio. Perhaps you two could fill me in on what goes on here, day by day. Andy, you and Eddie have been partners since the beginning, right?\u201d Logan said, leading both men out, followed by the others.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d Knox said grimly.</p><p>\u201cMadison?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come, my dear,\u201d Eddie said.</p><p>\u201cEddie, I\u2019ve been down there,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>Sean took her arm as they walked from the cinema to the office and through the door that was usually covered by the poster. They went down the steps and started passing the displays. Knox stopped suddenly in front of the Casablanca exhibit. \u201cIs that a real gun in Bogie\u2019s hand?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWorld War II\u2013issue, yes,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cBut there are no bullets in it. I swear. Check it out if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe anything around here,\u201d Knox muttered. He jumped up into the exhibit to check for himself.</p><p>Sean ignored him, and continued down the tunnel, to the scene of the crime. The smell was growing worse. He made a mental note to tell Logan that they needed to bring in the crime scene cleaners the next day. The answers they needed, he now knew, were behind the tableau, not in the tunnel.</p><p>With Madison at his side, he stared at the tableau.</p><p>\u201cYou figured it out the minute I did,\u201d he said, and they both looked at the statue of the warrior, standing at an angle, pushed back behind the jackal.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see it before,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMadison, I\u2019ve walked this tunnel as many times as you have, and I\u2019ve supposedly been trained to be observant of details, but I missed it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlistair wouldn\u2019t have missed it,\u201d she said.</p><p>Sean moved the cord aside and entered the display. He headed straight to the statue of the warrior and turned him around. The way the warrior stood, his shield held high in the other hand, it was easy to see how they\u2019d missed the obvious. They had concentrated on the mannequin of the priest and hadn\u2019t focused on the shelves and canopic jars, the sarcophagus, the cobras in their various positions on the floor\u2014slithering and rising in strike mode.</p><p>\u201cGloves!\u201d Knox called to him. He walked over, handing Sean a pair from his pocket.</p><p>Sean said, \u201cThanks,\u201d and put on the latex gloves. It wasn\u2019t going to matter. The killer had dressed in the black face and a robe\u2014and he\u2019d worn gloves when he killed Jenny Henderson. But it was procedure, and God knew, he\u2019d probably already blown enough procedure that day.</p><p>\u201cMay I have a pair?\u201d Madison asked. \u201cI can help Sean go through the tableau.\u201d</p><p>Knox grumbled that the FBI should have carried their own, but he produced a pair of gloves and gave them to her. Eddie stood just beyond the cordoned-off area, outside the chalk marks and the blood. He was ashen as he studied the tableau.</p><p>\u201cYou see anything else?\u201d Knox asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I should\u2019ve come down.\u201d Eddie shook his head. \u201cI think I would\u2019ve known. I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve seen that the dagger was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to say,\u201d Knox said kindly before turning back to Sean. \u201cI have no idea what you could possibly find. Our forensic people are good. We\u2019ve learned to be detailed and make sure the chain of evidence is solid. We\u2019ve learned the hard way.\u201d</p><p>Madison had bent down by the mummy that lay on the floor\u2014in pieces. She glanced back at the sarcophagus, frowning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sean asked her.</p><p>\u201cAll this stuff was made in Egypt\u2014exact copies of items found in real tombs,\u201d she said. \u201cThey sometimes had secret or hidden compartments. I was trying to see if I could find anything that opened, but...it looks like what we see is what there is.\u201d</p><p>Sean came over and began running his hands gently over the wood, trying to determine if there could be such a compartment. But his efforts failed.</p> <p>He turned. Eddie was still staring at the tableau; Knox was staring at Eddie. Madison had given her attention to the large canopic jars.</p><p>\u201cEmpty,\u201d she said, picking up the last of them. But then she paused. \u201cSean, this one\u2014it seems too heavy for its size!\u201d</p><p>He took the jar from her and studied it, stuck his gloved hand in it and saw that where he touched wasn\u2019t the bottom.</p><p>He kept twisting the jar, and he heard a little gasp escape Madison\u2019s lips. She was right next to him, almost on top of him. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Sean! Keep twisting. The design is changing as you twist it.... There, look, go a bit further, and you\u2019ll see that the two pieces on the design make a sun.\u201d</p><p>He gave it another twist and heard a click. The false bottom in the jar lifted. Beneath that false bottom, he saw something. He touched it.</p> <p>Then he pulled the missing dagger out of the canopic jar. It was covered in blood.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cLooks like we\u2019ve found the murder weapon.\u201d</p><p>Madison sat in the suite with the others, listening as, one by one, the team members went through their notes on the people they\u2019d interviewed. They asked her questions and she gave her impressions, but she became well aware that there was a great deal of tedium in what they did. However, repetition was essential to ensure that nothing slipped through the cracks.</p><p>They went through the construction crew. Jane, who had interviewed the men and women who\u2019d been working on the scaffolding, told them that every story matched and rang true. Logan had brought back copies of the security footage, and everything they saw verified what had been said. Kat Sokolov had interviewed the seamstresses, the designers and the fabricators, who hadn\u2019t been in since Friday. Logan had spoken at length with both Andy Simons and Mike Greenwood and he\u2019d also called in Eddie\u2019s ex-wife, Benita Lowe, who wanted to believe that his current wife, Helena LaRoux, had been involved. In fact, Benita had said, if Helena wasn\u2019t such an idiot, Benita would be absolutely positive that she was guilty.</p><p>\u201cShe told me Helena only pretended to care about Alistair,\u201d Logan told them. \u201cI believe that, but not really caring about her stepson doesn\u2019t make her a murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, true, she may be just a scheming user,\u201d Tyler agreed.</p> <p>Kelsey had spoken with Winston Nash and Colin Bailey. Bailey had been agitated, convinced that he\u2019d lost all their chances of finding the real killer\u2014because he had left the guard station to rush out when Alistair had come to him, screaming hysterically.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s background was thoroughly investigated?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cNo felons in the lot,\u201d Logan answered. \u201cThe worst we\u2019ve found on anyone at the studio was a few unpaid parking tickets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not thinking so much of criminal activity. I was wondering if anyone associated with either the family or the studio had a relative who worked on the original film.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one mentioned anything of the kind to the police or to us,\u201d Logan said. \u201cBut we can delve deeper. I guess the killer wouldn\u2019t announce that his dad had been a grip or a production assistant on the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the dead man, the guy who was killed during filming? Any connections?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cNot that we\u2019ve yet discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnybody have any theories?\u201d Logan threw out his arms.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to bet it has more to do with the movie, somehow,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cThe movie was filmed in 1942,\u201d Logan reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYes...but!\u201d Madison said, glancing around as she interjected, hoping they wouldn\u2019t think she was being disruptive and had nothing of importance to say.</p><p>They didn\u2019t. The six members of the Krewe looked at her, waiting.</p><p>\u201cThere was trouble with the movie. Not with the stars, although they both had truly sad ends. I\u2019m talking about the accident that occurred on the set\u2014the electrical accident that killed a bit player, Pete Krakowski.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of it.\u201d Sean looked at her, frowning. \u201cBut it was an accident, right? He was electrocuted.\u201d</p><p>Madison surveyed the group, taking a deep breath. \u201cBogie didn\u2019t think it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBogie\u2014was he connected to the movie?\u201d Logan asked her. \u201cWhere is he...and our victim, by the way? I would\u2019ve thought they\u2019d hang out with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tunnel was too much for Jenny, although she was very brave,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Bogie is trying to help her find the place she wants to haunt. Maybe he\u2019s showing her the ropes. Do you think ghosts sometimes serve as mentors to other ghosts?\u201d he asked, his grin lopsided.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good guy. That\u2019s probably what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Madison said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll reappear soon, since he seems willing, maybe even intrigued, to help on this. And no, he wasn\u2019t involved with the movie. He was working on Casablanca at the time. But he knew the electricians and the grips, and he said they didn\u2019t make mistakes. That could mean nothing. The movie was filmed well over fifty years ago now. But all the special effects were created at the studio, which was Claymore Illusions back then.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded gravely. \u201cWe need to look into the past. Because the past can always intrude on the present.\u201d He suddenly yawned. \u201cAll right. Knox has taken the dagger to be analyzed by the forensics department. Tomorrow, the studio reopens. That won\u2019t interfere with our investigation. Jane, I\u2019ll ask you to stay at the precinct. Do whatever research you can on the internet concerning the movie. Tyler, Kat, Kelsey\u2014you\u2019ll examine the tunnels, see what else you can find down there. We\u2019ll have to make sure no one can accidentally wander down to the basement to see what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m supposed to be at work tomorrow,\u201d Madison said hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. You go to work. It\u2019s going to be important that you do. Keep your eyes open and don\u2019t ever go anywhere alone. I\u2019ll be out there on the main floor, still talking to people. Even if you need to go to the ladies\u2019 room, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are going to ask me questions all day,\u201d Madison said. \u201cHow do I put them off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell them that all you\u2019ve done is answer questions about the studio,\u201d Sean replied.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Madison realized she was nervous about returning to work. She knew she wouldn\u2019t have made even a halfway decent actress; her feelings were far too apparent in her face and her voice. But she really didn\u2019t have anything to tell anyone, so she supposed she\u2019d do all right.</p><p>They broke up then, Jane cheerfully calling good-night as she and Kat headed out, Kelsey yawning and walking to her bedroom. Tyler offered to escort Madison across the hall and she accepted, noting that Sean and Logan were deep in conversation again, their heads bent low as they spoke.</p><p>In her own room, she lay down on her bed, exhausted, although adrenaline was racing through her system. These had been the longest days of her life.</p><p>And in a way, today had been the best.</p><p>But being in the tunnel a couple of hours ago...crawling through the mannequins...</p><p>She inhaled, cringed, sure she could still smell the blood.</p><p>Searching through canopic jars...</p><p>Those had just been props. But it didn\u2019t matter; she was convinced she could smell blood on herself and would never be able to sleep. She stripped in a sudden frenzy and hurried into the shower. When she emerged, wrapped in a towel, she heard a soft tapping. For a moment, fear washed over her. But she was in a hotel\u2014on a floor with six FBI agents. She walked to the door, and as she did, hope and anticipation replaced the fear. She looked through the peephole. It was Sean.</p><p>When she opened the door, he smiled at her, leaning against the frame for a moment. \u201cI see you\u2019re dressed for the occasion now,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She could have asked him if it was really all right for them to be together; he was obviously dedicated to his work and his team, and she\u2019d never want to jeopardize any of that.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t ask. She stepped back. He walked in. She closed the door.</p><p>\u201cA shower,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a great plan. May I? And, of course, you\u2019re welcome to join me. And it\u2019s hours and hours before daylight, so feel free to use the soap any way you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d she promised. Once she\u2019d locked the door behind him, they headed into the shower.</p><p>When they finally slept that night, it was deep and wonderful, and yet throughout the night, she knew he was beside her.</p><p>12</p><p>There was no escaping the fact that the day would begin awkwardly. Sean realized that.</p><p>Naturally, everyone at the studio looked at him, Tyler and Kelsey as they walked in. Everyone nodded, not knowing who they were, but obviously assuming they were some kind of law enforcement.</p><p>Eddie Archer was a man who tried to be as honest and sincere with his people as possible. Soon after all his full-time employees had arrived, he called a general meeting in the main work area. He raised a hand to ask for silence as people gathered around him, speaking in hushed whispers. Sean and his colleagues stood by themselves, a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cYou all know what happened here,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cJenny Henderson was killed in the tunnel, and my son, Alistair, was arraigned for her murder. Alistair claims his innocence, and the police and the FBI are investigating. Alistair doesn\u2019t want the studio to go down, and he doesn\u2019t want any of you having to look for jobs elsewhere, and since the producers of The Unholy are retaining their faith in us, we\u2019re going back to work. We\u2019re going to continue doing what we do best\u2014creating special effects. Anyone who\u2019s unhappy about being here is free to leave. But while the investigators continue doing what they do best, let\u2019s try not to get in their way or disrupt our own lives any more than necessary. So, my friends, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you\u2019ll stand by me and Alistair, and that we\u2019ll get back to it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEddie!\u201d one of the seamstresses called out. \u201cWill we have police protection through the day? I saw that we still have about four cop cars out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police are guarding us, yes,\u201d Eddie assured her.</p><p>\u201cEddie, how are you doing?\u201d another asked.</p> <p>Eddie smiled. \u201cI get my strength from God, my family and you. Thank you. But if you choose not to be involved, all you have to do is let me know. There isn\u2019t a soul working here for whom I wouldn\u2019t write a glowing letter or recommendation! And I\u2019ll be here,\u201d he said. He indicated Tyler, Kelsey and Kat. \u201cThese three agents are from the FBI. Please answer their questions and show them around if you\u2019re asked. They\u2019re here to protect us, and to investigate. Now, I\u2019ll be up in my office if you need me.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d finished, Andy Simons took his place. \u201cI could give you a long speech about how much we appreciate your talents and your loyalty. But you all know that. And you know that you\u2019re working with one of the most brilliant minds in the business.\u201d He gestured at Eddie and grinned. \u201cSo...work, people, work!\u201d he said, then headed for the hallway.</p><p>Mike had been standing behind him, ever supportive. \u201cOkay, people. We\u2019ve got a few days we have to make up for, if we\u2019re going to stick to our schedule.\u201d</p><p>The employees split up. They\u2019d be whispering among themselves all day, Sean was certain, but they were getting back to work.</p><p>\u201cI want to go down to the tunnel,\u201d he told Tyler. \u201cI have the key, but I\u2019d like to bring in a few cops to watch the elevator doors. We don\u2019t want anyone joining us down there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it,\u201d Tyler promised. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you back here in ten.\u201d He inclined his head, pointing across the room. \u201cThere\u2019s a star on the premises,\u201d he said.</p><p>Sean looked up and saw that the actor, Oliver Marshall, had appeared. People hailed him and he seemed pleased by their friendliness, responding with waves and handshakes as he walked through the work areas to reach Madison\u2019s station. She rose as he approached. She\u2019d said they got along well, but Sean studied the man\u2014it was the nature of the game. You had to be suspicious of everyone. And yet he felt his heart beating a little faster. Oliver Marshall seemed to know Madison well...and to like her. He greeted her with a kiss on the cheek and a warm hug. She offered him her beautiful smile in return and hugged him back. He could see that she was speaking to him, gesturing at the costume pieces on the table and something she was working on that had to do with foam and rubber and fabric. He realized they were referring to the knee pads Oliver needed for his costume to add a little protection during some of his stunts. Apparently he had a stunt double but was doing the less dangerous scenes himself. Madison was gathering up folds of material to hand him so he could be properly fitted in the costume with the knee pads inserted.</p><p>She seemed happy to be working again, seemed to enjoy her job.</p><p>\u201cLogan will be up here,\u201d Tyler reminded him. \u201cMadison will be safe.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. It was time for them to make their way down to the tunnel, search all the corridors, and when they\u2019d done that, he was going out to the cemetery to look for another entrance.</p><p>He kept his eye on Madison as her assistant, Alfie Longdale, a tall, platinum-blond man in his early twenties, approached her and Oliver Marshall. More greetings took place. Then Alfie picked up a measuring tape and some pins and they moved toward the curtained area that was the studio\u2019s fitting room.</p> <p>He watched the seamstresses sit down at their machines and the construction crew collect around a table while the head of the project discussed the plans.</p><p>He watched, and it looked like a busy, working studio. The murder simmered just beneath the surface, but as the minutes passed, people seemed to become more and more immersed in their jobs.</p><p>Mike Greenwood walked up to him. \u201cSad thing, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSad, but you and Eddie have the studio up and running as smoothly as could be expected,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWe have a good group of workers, and people believe in Eddie. You treat people right year after year, and in the end...\u201d Mike shrugged. \u201cToo bad his choice in women is...well, Eddie\u2019s such a nice guy. He can be kind of a sucker. Don\u2019t quote me on that, please. I\u2019ve been with him from the beginning, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t repeat conversations, Mike,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Mike pursed his lips grimly. \u201cHelena acts like she\u2019s supporting him all the way, but you ask me, she\u2019s nosy. She\u2019s trying to keep on top of every move the police make. And you people, of course. She didn\u2019t go to that movie last night because she wanted to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, what really happened between Eddie and Benita?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Mike shrugged again. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He came in one day and asked me if I knew a good divorce attorney. I suggested he might want to attend some counseling first. He hadn\u2019t been married that long. But he said, \u2018No, Mike, counseling won\u2019t help. We\u2019re amicable, but it\u2019s over. I can\u2019t live a lie.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he never said anything else?\u201d</p><p>Mike shook his head. \u201cNot a word. I know she still cares about him, and he cares about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the rumors that she was cheating on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they were just that\u2014rumors,\u201d Mike said. \u201cBut if you were to ask him yourself, he might tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>Tyler returned with two police officers to guard the elevator.</p><p>Then Sean, Kelsey and Kat went back down, armed with flashlights\u2014and their Glocks.</p><p>Vengeance was worried. The FBI agents were spending too much time in the basement. Vengeance knew because there were so many people at the studio who innocently gave information away. It was good to be trusted.</p><p>Still, even if they found the tunnels, even if...</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t know everything. They couldn\u2019t know everything.</p><p>Still...</p><p>Vengeance made a call. \u201cIt\u2019s me, and listen, listen well. Find out exactly what\u2019s happening now. We may have to do a little cleanup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me, no, no, not me!\u201d she replied. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m being watched. I know I\u2019m being watched. I can\u2019t\u2014I won\u2019t. I won\u2019t get any more involved. You\u2019re being paranoid!\u201d</p><p>Yes, Vengeance thought, because my hands are the bloody ones....</p><p>\u201cYou have to be involved. I\u2019m going to need help. Tonight. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may not be able to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to. Do you hear me? You have to.\u201d</p><p>Vengeance gave her instructions.</p><p>\u201cAfter all,\u201d Vengeance reminded her, \u201cthe whole thing was really your idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I was just talking. I never thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d Vengeance said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you wanted. Well, tonight, my friend, you\u2019re going to get your hands dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough times here, huh?\u201d Oliver Marshall said to Madison.</p><p>She nodded grimly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came in, that you weren\u2019t afraid and you didn\u2019t stay away,\u201d she said.</p><p>They were almost alone; she was standing outside the curtain while he changed. She was ready to work on the material and rubber that would go under the shield during his hallucination scene. She needed to be sure it would allow him easy and comfortable movement. Alfie had gone off for some basting thread.</p><p>He poked his head outside the curtain. \u201cTo be honest?\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m here with my agent. He thinks it\u2019s going to be a popular thing for me to have done. I wish I was brave\u2014like Sam Stone\u2014but I\u2019m not. And, of course, you know how the saying goes: If you repeat that, I\u2019ll call you a liar.\u201d</p><p>Madison grinned. She liked Oliver. He\u2019d already told her he was gay, which she kept a secret as she\u2019d promised. \u201cOh, one day, with any luck I\u2019ll be as big as the guys who can admit anything,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cI don\u2019t lie. I just don\u2019t answer. And I do love women and flirt with them all the time. But when you play action heroes and romantic leading men, a certain...discretion is best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we safe here?\u201d he asked her now. \u201cIs there any danger to life or limb?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cYou mean you don\u2019t believe what the media say? That Alistair did it?\u201d</p><p>Oliver shook his head. \u201cAlistair? Kid\u2019s a marshmallow. He\u2019d scald himself in boiling water before he\u2019d hurt anyone, especially that girl. She was kind of annoying, but I\u2019m sure I was annoying to people when I was starting out, too. This is the weirdest business. You can\u2019t get an agent or a casting director to remember your name one day, and the next you\u2019re in a movie that hits, and you can do no wrong. But...are we safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOliver, the place is crawling with cops and the FBI. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it wasn\u2019t some crazy shooter, right? It was all planned out. Man, I can\u2019t believe Jenny Henderson could\u2019ve made an enemy who hated her so much!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she did. I think someone wanted to hurt Eddie\u2014or even Alistair.\u201d</p><p>Oliver sniffed. He lowered his voice to a whisper. \u201cWell, in my opinion you wouldn\u2019t have to look a lot further than the stepmother. I mean, if Alistair\u2019s locked up for life, who gets Eddie\u2019s fortune?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about that\u2014except they must have a prenup. And Helena\u2019s more interested in using Eddie\u2019s contacts, anyway. I\u2019d say that most of us who know and love him try to keep our mouths shut about his marriage,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>Oliver was thoughtful. \u201cWell, if you have an in with the cops, I\u2019d suggest they look at her really closely. She was in here with Eddie one day when I was with the producer and director of Sam Stone. She was sidling up to everybody, trying to stay in the conversation. I saw her right next to Eddie\u2014just about fondling him in public. I\u2019m almost sure she went into his pockets and came out with something. I don\u2019t know what, but I wouldn\u2019t trust her any farther than I could throw that yapping dog of hers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOliver, you would never throw a dog,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you get my drift!\u201d</p><p>Alfie was hurrying over with the basting needle and thread. Madison leaned back, looking at Oliver, who winked and said, \u201cI think he likes me. And I think he\u2019d like your job.\u201d His voice grew even quieter. \u201cHey, he sucks up to the new Mrs. Eddie Archer whenever she\u2019s here. I say watch out for your own assistant.\u201d</p> <p>Kat stopped in the middle of the tunnel and sneezed. \u201cSean, we shouldn\u2019t have to break through anything. If any of the walls were broken through, we\u2019d have seen it. The killer couldn\u2019t possibly have had time to cover his tracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat, I didn\u2019t say try to break through, I said look through,\u201d Sean said. \u201cTo the best of your ability. The costume the killer wore is most likely stashed down here somewhere. We\u2019ve pretty much determined that he\u2014or she\u2014wore gloves, so I sincerely doubt forensics will get anything off the dagger.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey, who was behind Kat, groaned. \u201cIf I end up wearing any more mold, spiderwebs and bone dust, I won\u2019t be able to leave the studio until it clears out for the day. I\u2019ll be a walking advertisement for the fact that we know more than we\u2019re sharing at the moment.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d only covered the first tunnel so far; they hadn\u2019t even taken the turn that would lead them around to the Black Box Cinema.</p><p>He thought it somewhat odd that they hadn\u2019t encountered anyone\u2019s lost spirit, but then, he knew Jane would have all kinds of interesting information for them about the making of the film Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum, and that she\u2019d come back with research on the cemetery, as well. They just needed all the pieces of the puzzle; if they could find the pieces, they could solve the puzzle. It was a matter of logic. That had been reinforced during their training when they\u2019d met the rest of Jackson Crow\u2019s team at Quantico.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s here,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThat costume is here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019ll find it,\u201d Kelsey said, setting her hand on his arm. He smiled. She did look like hell, and his cousin was a beautiful woman. She\u2019d come close to dying during their first case, the one that had brought them all together, but even then, she\u2019d understood the risks. She\u2019d been a United States marshal; she\u2019d already signed on the dotted line.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s talking down here, right?\u201d he asked. He was referring to any ghosts who might have remained, but he didn\u2019t have to explain. They knew what he meant.</p><p>Both women looked at him and shook their heads solemnly.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing they\u2019ve all gone on. Okay, stick to this path. I\u2019m going to follow the other one for a while, see where it takes me.\u201d</p><p>He used his heavy flashlight to light the way toward the turnoff that led to the tunnel and museum. He chose not to head back in that direction, though. It seemed unlikely that someone would have retraced his or her steps to hide the robe. However, nothing was impossible. Improbable, but not impossible.</p> <p>As he moved, she saw that he was going farther beneath the cemetery. The walls here were beginning to cave in; the tunnels were old, and no one had come down in decades to shore them up. Maybe the burials here had been forgotten. Or perhaps there were memorials aboveground, and mourners set their flowers there, having no idea of the labyrinth of dead below. Casting the light around him, he saw decay, broken vaults, fabric and bone in various stages of deterioration.</p><p>The crypts were distracting. He tried to look at the floor, seeking any drops of blood. There were none at first, but then on a broken slab of marble that covered half a crypt, he saw a tiny spatter.</p><p>He paused, studied it and moved on. And then he turned back. It was a grisly task, but he dug behind the broken slab. His finger curled around fabric that didn\u2019t disintegrate at his touch. He tugged on it.</p><p>And a robe fell out before him. A robe that was identical to the one on the figure of Amun Mopat in the tableau.</p><p>It had to be the mock-up that had been on the mannequin in the studio.</p><p>He examined it carefully in the powerful beam of the flashlight. The robe wasn\u2019t finished\u2014it was basted together rather than sewn. He felt the material, which was sleek, with the characteristics of a knit, probably synthetic. The robe was a golden brown color, trimmed with gold braid.</p><p>And it was dotted with blood.</p><p>The killer had come in this direction.</p> <p>Why?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s noon. Are you allowed to take a break?\u201d Oliver asked Madison. \u201cWant to go out for lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really want to leave the studio today. Thank you, though,\u201d Madison told him. She smiled. \u201cYou know, there are a million women out there who\u2019d pass out cold at an invitation from you. So I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a good-old-boy knock on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re the woman of my dreams, Madison. But you\u2019ve never flirted with me. How come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Oliver, you are gorgeous. It\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, leaning across her worktable. \u201cBut, hmm, let me see. I\u2019m not your type. You\u2019re more into the muscle-bound fighter type. No, no...the artist. A nerd? No, I\u2019m not exactly seeing a nerd. Ah, maybe one of the cool, calm, stoic FBI types.\u201d</p><p>He suddenly started to laugh. \u201cMadison, I was teasing, but...ooh, you\u2019re going to have to tell me all about your love life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must read enough about your life in all the magazines out there!\u201d she chastised him.</p><p>\u201cHave lunch with me. Humor me. I\u2019ll get something ordered in for us. We can have a cozy costume chat in one of the conference rooms. Come on, what do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But what about Alfie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can get his own lunch...and his own date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be rude to my assistant. Alfie\u2019s a good kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see that he\u2019s kept busy,\u201d Oliver said, wiggling his eyebrows.</p><p>The young star did have power; in a matter of minutes, Mike had taken Alfie aside, and Oliver was coming back to her with a grin on his face. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re having lunch in the small conference room.\u201d</p><p>Madison glanced around. She saw that Logan Raintree was keeping watch. He managed to be in a different place every time she looked, either pretending a keen interest in the work going on or engaging a worker in conversation\u2014even pitching in when an extra hand was needed. She was certain that he\u2019d kept an eye on her all morning. What was he going to think about her having lunch with Oliver?</p><p>Oliver leaned closer. \u201cShould we ask the FBI guy to join us?\u201d He made a face at her. \u201cWrong FBI guy, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOliver, would you stop?\u201d</p><p>He straightened. \u201cSeriously, just go tell him we\u2019re having lunch, and where we\u2019re going to be. Tell him we\u2019ll keep the door open the whole time. You\u2019ll be safe, I swear it. Coward here, remember?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAll right. Let me talk to Logan.\u201d</p><p>Logan seemed to know she was coming. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the conference room having lunch,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI heard. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be nearby. And there\u2019s a cop standing guard at the end of the hallway by the elevator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not worried. I just didn\u2019t want you to be,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cMike told me Oliver really likes you\u2014says working with you is like working with a real human being. Go ahead and enjoy your lunch.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer to him. \u201cThey\u2019ve been in the basement for a while,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>She wanted to ask more questions but in the busy studio she couldn\u2019t. She rejoined Oliver, and they both spoke to friends among the other workers as they walked to the hallway, beyond reception and the guard station, and over to the conference rooms.</p><p>Oliver paused at the first display area near the conference room. He pointed to the one-eyed victim, who seemed to stand there in some kind of strange welcome. \u201cThat movie scared the crap out of me when I was a teenager,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThe werewolf did it for me,\u201d she said.</p><p>Inside the conference room he paused again, looking at the creation Sean had called Matilda. \u201cWow. And we\u2019re having sushi in here,\u201d he said.</p><p>As he spoke, Nelly Anderson, the receptionist, came in with a large bag. \u201cYou ordered this, Mr. Marshall?\u201d she asked, flushing.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did, thank you so much. It\u2019s Nelly, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes!\u201d Nelly said, clearly surprised and happy that he\u2019d remembered her name. Madison liked Nelly, but Nelly didn\u2019t seem to notice she was in the room at the moment.</p><p>\u201cHey, that was really fast. Thanks again, Nelly,\u201d Oliver said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Nelly managed to set the bag down. \u201cIf you need anything else\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call on you.\u201d</p><p>Still flushing, Nelly made her way out of the conference room.</p><p>\u201cSee? Women love you,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fake in more ways than one, but don\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d he said, sitting down beside her.</p><p>He looked around the room again, shook his head and dug into the bag. \u201cTwo green teas, dragon rolls, California rolls\u2014we are in California, after all\u2014and miso soup. That okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He distributed the food, napkins and chopsticks. \u201cYou\u2019re doing okay, Madison? I mean, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing fine. I\u2019m worried about Eddie and Alistair, of course.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, lifting a piece of sushi between expertly wielded chopsticks. \u201cI have to admit, it shook me up when I heard about it.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cIf things don\u2019t go so well for this place, I\u2019ll be really grateful that I chose a stage name for my Actor\u2019s Equity card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know your real name wasn\u2019t Oliver Marshall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Oliver Marshall. Oliver Marshall Claymore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She fumbled and dropped the piece of dragon roll she\u2019d just picked up. \u201cAre you related to the Claymores who owned the studio and the land around it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cDistantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were born in Ohio! At least, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve read.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cI was born in Ohio. All of that is true. My dad\u2019s great-great-uncle was the original owner of the property here. We don\u2019t have anything to do with it anymore, and I don\u2019t know if the family was still in contact. I do remember stories my grandfather told me about the place. That might be why I wanted to be an actor. Oh! And my name is a secret, okay? I\u2019ve kept it out of the magazines and trash-azines and I\u2019ve even managed to keep it off Wikipedia!\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t tell people what others say. You know that.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI do. You\u2019re the one totally trustworthy person I\u2019ve met out here, Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if someone does find out\u2014although I can\u2019t see why it would come up\u2014Eddie owns the studio now and Alistair is the one who\u2019s been accused. It doesn\u2019t have a thing to do with you. Anyway, it was Claymore Illusions a long time ago,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s true....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of stories did you hear?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, funny stories about actors and about the birth of special effects, and how everything\u2019s changed over the years. My grandfather used to come to Hollywood on vacations to visit and spend time here. He was an Ohio farm boy, so the studio was really exciting for him. He did become an actor himself. He was fairly successful on Broadway and did lots of tours. My dad, however, became a scientist and decided that since we were from Ohio, he\u2019d put his mind toward creating a better strain of corn.\u201d He wagged a chopstick at her. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that farmers consider him a hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d Madison said, meaning it.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cMaybe, but my family\u2019s boring as hell. Not really. I love my folks and my siblings, and I love getting home for the holidays. Of course, back in good-old-farmboy land, no one knows much about me. I\u2019m just the one who did the family proud in Hollywood.\u201d He grew sober. \u201cThat\u2019s why I feel so bad for the girl who was murdered\u2014Jenny. I know what it\u2019s like to be a hopeful. I never thought I\u2019d be this successful.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI still feel like a fake, and I\u2019m afraid it can end anytime.\u201d</p><p>A loud angry voice suddenly reached them from the reception area. A moment later, Helena LaRoux came clip-clopping along the hallway, her little dog in her arms. Today she was dressed in designer workout clothes. She came to an abrupt halt, in front of the doorway to the conference room.</p><p>Winston Nash was hot on her trail. \u201cMrs. Archer, if you\u2019ll just give me a minute, I\u2019ll call up and tell Eddie that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to announce me to my husband!\u201d Helena shouted. \u201cEddie! Eddie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know his office is upstairs?\u201d Oliver whispered to Madison.</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014I think they stopped her when she started walking toward the elevator,\u201d Madison whispered in return.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Archer!\u201d Winston Nash pleaded. \u201cThe studio is in lockdown, and we\u2019ve had a murder, and there are police all over the place. They\u2019ve asked that any visitors be announced and then escorted in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not any visitor! I\u2019m Eddie\u2019s wife!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Archer, if the president came down from Washington, he\u2019d still have to be escorted in. This is lockdown!\u201d Winston Nash insisted.</p><p>Winston Nash was Colin Bailey\u2019s physical opposite\u2014he was about thirty years old, tall as a beanpole and skinny as could be. His lean face was taut with frustration as he spoke, and maybe a hint of fear. But he\u2019d been given his orders, and he was following them.</p><p>Helena LaRoux must have heard either Oliver or Madison rustle a paper or do something that drew her attention. She looked into the room. Her brows shot up, but then she let out a long breath. \u201cThere\u2019s Madison. And Oliver Marshall. Oliver, you beautiful thing, how lovely to see you. Madison can escort me up to see Eddie. It\u2019s not right for me to be kept standing in reception when my husband owns the whole place!\u201d</p> <p>Madison rose quickly, and Oliver did the same. Oliver was polite and circumspect, walking over to Helena, giving her a kiss on the cheek and a hug, stroking her little dog\u2019s ears. \u201cHelena, this must be hard for you. We all know you love Eddie and Alistair,\u201d he said.</p><p>Madison was astonished that he\u2019d been able to say the words so sincerely\u2014but then, he was an actor, and a very talented one. He\u2019d spoken with just a hint of sarcasm that went right over Helena\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, of course, Oliver, dear. Thank you,\u201d Helena said. She had a good two decades on Oliver and she was married, but that didn\u2019t keep her from going into flirt mode. She clung to his arm. \u201cThank you for your kindness. Thank you for being here.\u201d</p><p>Madison didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever seen a better performance of a heroine cast into tragedy. Her portrait of gracious womanhood belonged on the silver screen.</p><p>\u201cHelena, come in and sit with us for a minute,\u201d Oliver encouraged her. He was either really being kind or having the time of his life. Madison wasn\u2019t sure which.</p><p>Nash stood by the doorway and peered in as Oliver led Helena to a chair. He looked at Madison in desperation. \u201cMr. Archer is with one of the policemen\u2014or one of the FBI people. I got a call that he wasn\u2019t to be disturbed. By anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not anyone!\u201d Helena snapped. \u201cI\u2019m his wife!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are, darling,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cBut give this a few minutes. Talk to me. What\u2019ve you been doing lately? You know, I saw you onstage once. I think it was the Red Box downtown. You were wonderful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was wonderful?\u201d Helena asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Oliver gushed.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you. It\u2019s true what they say\u2014film does love you, Oliver,\u201d Helena said.</p><p>This mutual admiration meeting would be going on for a while. Madison wondered if she should excuse herself and go back to work, but as she started to rise, Oliver kicked her under the table and frowned at her. She sat down again. It was turning into a long lunch.</p><p>Sean got most of the bone dust and tunnel muck and grime off before coming to Eddie\u2019s office.</p><p>As he entered, Eddie stopped drawing on his sketch board and looked up. Maybe he hadn\u2019t gotten off enough spiderwebs and bone dust, Sean thought, because Eddie stared at him as if he were seeing a ghost.</p><p>\u201cSean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie, we need to talk.\u201d He sat down in the chair across from Eddie\u2019s desk. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Eddie raised his hands. \u201cI\u2019m ready to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re aware, in a situation like this, that we scrutinize those closest to the victim. When a husband or wife is killed, the spouse is immediately in the running. In this instance, we\u2019re pretty sure you were the target. Alistair is the patsy, another victim, in fact, and you\u2019re the target.\u201d</p><p>Eddie gazed at him blankly. \u201cJenny Henderson is dead, and Alistair is going to trial accused of her murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does someone hurt you, Eddie? Through Alistair, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, why did you and Benita divorce? She still seems to care about you. And you obviously care about her.\u201d</p><p>Eddie was silent for a minute. He seemed acutely uncomfortable. Then he sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t generally discuss this, and neither does Benita, mainly because it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business. She prefers...someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she was cheating on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t see it as cheating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a woman. She likes men but prefers women,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cLook, I know Hollywood is wide open and all that, but some people feel they\u2019ll risk their chances of being seen as sexy or getting certain roles. I think Benita figured she could be loyal to me without being monogamous\u2014either that, or I\u2019d be turned on by the fact that she had sex with women. I don\u2019t give a damn about anybody\u2019s choices, but it didn\u2019t work for me on a personal level. Man or woman, to me it was cheating. Our divorce wasn\u2019t ugly, and I still love her as a dear friend. I don\u2019t explain it, as I said, because my personal life is nobody\u2019s business. And I have no intention of saying things she doesn\u2019t want said.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. He believed Eddie. It just wasn\u2019t the answer he\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know about the elevator key,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Eddie looked confused. \u201cYou have it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, besides you, has a key to that elevator?\u201d</p><p>Eddie shook his head. \u201cNo one. I went to the basement once when I bought the place, with a building inspector. The support beams were all good. The building was solid. I knew I wouldn\u2019t use the basement for storage or work. California might be damned dry, but that basement is dank. I don\u2019t go there. No one does.\u201d</p><p>Sean leaned on his desk. \u201cEddie, someone got hold of your key, copied your key and has been using your key. The basement connects to a labyrinth of tunnels\u2014crypts, like the catacombs. That\u2019s how the killer got in and out. I found the bloody robe the killer wore down there, and forensics will be testing it. You need to think long and hard. Because if you\u2019re the only one who has a key to get down to that basement, either you\u2019re guilty yourself, or someone close to you\u2014maybe someone you\u2019ve slept with at one time or another\u2014is the murderer.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>Madison was eager for the workday to come to an end. While Logan had remained nearby throughout the day, she hadn\u2019t seen Sean since he\u2019d left her room early. She had a feeling that he\u2019d found something in the tunnels. Something that would directly affect the case. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, people began to leave. She was glad to see that it hadn\u2019t taken long for everyone to get back into the spirit of a normal workday. If nothing had been discovered that could allow the state to dismiss the case against Alistair, it would still be weeks\u2014perhaps months\u2014before his trial began. In the meantime, work was necessary, and work was good. It kept everyone sane.</p><p>She stayed behind, pretending to finish stitching in the pads for Oliver\u2019s costume, as others said good-night and trailed out. She knew that Logan Raintree was near the door that led out of the work area\u2014almost like a farewell committee of one.</p><p>But by six-thirty, everyone had left the building except for Mike Greenwood, Andy Simons, Eddie, the cops and agents and Colin Bailey, who\u2019d replaced Winston Nash. Even Helena had gone; she\u2019d gotten her moment with Eddie, shown that she supported him and the studio, and taken her hand-pup home.</p> <p>Madison felt sorry for the little dog. Helena treated him more like an accessory than a pet.</p><p>She realized the agents didn\u2019t like to speak about their investigations with anyone else present, and she decided she wasn\u2019t going to report what she\u2019d learned about Oliver Marshall until they were alone again\u2014wherever and whenever that might be.</p><p>Eddie sighed as they stood in the reception area together. It seemed crowded since everyone who remained was there.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Eddie asked.</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d Sean said. \u201cOr go see Alistair. Get some rest.\u201d</p> <p>Eddie gave a weary nod.</p><p>Mike set a hand on his shoulder. \u201cIt was a good day, Eddie. Not a single employee refused to come in. They started off nervous and chatty, and ended up tired and ready to move forward. Oliver and his agent were in, and the fitting went as per usual. We\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d</p><p>Andy clasped Eddie in a hug for a minute and patted him on the back. \u201cPartners,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as Mike says, we\u2019re going to get through this fine.\u201d</p><p>At last, they all walked out together, except for Bailey. Everyone said good-night and headed to their separate cars.</p><p>\u201cSean, what did you find?\u201d Madison asked anxiously once she was in the passenger seat of the borrowed Prius. Logan and the rest of the crew were in the SUV they\u2019d rented at the airport, but Madison was sure they\u2019d be connecting soon. \u201cAre we going back to the hotel?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, arching a brow as he put the key in the ignition. \u201cI was planning to go straight to your house to take care of Ichabod.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d she gasped, stricken. \u201cIchabod!\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m betting we\u2019ll see Bogie there\u2014with Jenny Henderson. He wants to make her comfortable. Make sense to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. So, we\u2019re going to my house. That\u2019s great. But what did you find?\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at her. \u201cWe found a robe. A robe that\u2019s an exact copy of the one worn by the Egyptian priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the tunnel?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt was stuffed in a broken crypt. It\u2019s with the forensic experts at the police station now. There\u2019ll be officers on duty in the basement all night, just to make sure no one messes with the tunnel. Officers will also be posted at the entrance to the Black Box and the studio itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean they\u2019ll let Alistair go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it\u2019ll happen that fast. Alistair\u2019s lawyer has to petition the state and get the state\u2019s attorney to drop the charges. Before he does that, we need more proof. I think we\u2019ve proven that someone else might have done it, but finding the robe doesn\u2019t exonerate him with one hundred percent certainty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe feed Ichabod, get Bogie and Jenny and meet back at the suite.\u201d</p><p>They did, in that order. As Sean had assumed, Bogie had taken Jenny to Madison\u2019s place, where Jenny was learning the fine art of watching I Love Lucy reruns. But when Sean explained what had been happening, Bogie was happy to come along to help.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t there\u2014and my memory isn\u2019t much better dead than it was when I was alive\u2014but I\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Bogie said, when the six agents, Madison and the spirits sat around the suite\u2019s table. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe the accidental death that occurred on that set in 1942 wasn\u2019t an accident, that it was murder,\u201d Sean began.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t have any evidence,\u201d Bogie said. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t seem right to me when I heard about it. I wasn\u2019t there, remember\u2014I\u2019m just telling you what I thought and felt at the time. The head electrician was a man named Richard Wilson, and the key grips were two fellows who worked on lots of films. Donnie Riley and Kevin Baker. I was stunned that anyone could\u2019ve been electrocuted on their watch. There was an investigation, of course, but it turned out there was a freak power surge\u2014or that\u2019s what the police and the insurance company came back with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds reasonable,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think what\u2019s going on now could have something to do with that movie?\u201d Bogie asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cHey, strange things, really strange things, seem to be popping up,\u201d Madison put in. She looked around the table. \u201cI found out today that Oliver Marshall is really Oliver Marshall Claymore. He told me this in confidence. He dropped the Claymore when he went for his Actor\u2019s Equity card.\u201d</p><p>Silence followed her announcement.</p><p>\u201cWe should have known that,\u201d Sean said sheepishly. \u201cExcept, of course, we haven\u2019t investigated Oliver yet. He\u2019s not an employee and there was no reason to suspect he might know anything about the cemetery, the grounds or the studio. The police didn\u2019t question him and we hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet, although we would have eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Claymore who first came out here was a great-great-uncle, from what I understand. Oliver\u2019s father is a scientist,\u201d Madison said. \u201cHis great-grandfather\u2019s brother was the Hollywood Claymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s follow up on that,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll question Oliver tomorrow. Madison, is he due back in the studio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I can make something up about wanting to check the padding for his costume,\u201d she said. \u201cI did promise him I\u2019d keep this quiet,\u201d she added in a worried voice.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll respect that. No one else needs to know\u2014unless he turns out to be guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe Oliver could be a vicious killer,\u201d Madison said. \u201cAnd even if his name is Claymore, why would he be interested in hurting Eddie? It doesn\u2019t make sense. We\u2019re working on his costume for what\u2019s anticipated to be a number-one box-office hit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe human mind can be a very scary place,\u201d Sean told her.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Logan said, \u201che does have a connection to the studio, and it was the studio back then\u2014Claymore Illusions\u2014that did the effects for Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t make him a murderer,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou volunteered the information,\u201d Sean reminded her. \u201cInformation that may allow us to eliminate him. Let\u2019s find out if any of the other principals surrounding the studio have any associations with the original movie or any of the actors in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll learn,\u201d Bogie said. \u201cI just know I wasn\u2019t the only one back then who was skeptical about what they said caused that accident on the set. If it was an accident...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened after Krakowski died?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cThey were filming at the old Waterton Studios farther east on Sunset. I think the accident brought the officials in and that led to the structure being condemned. Waterton Studios was used way back in the days of the silents. Right after Krakowski\u2019s death, the studios were closed down for a few days while the investigation went on, and then the filming continued,\u201d Bogie said. \u201cWhen it was completed, Waterton was torn down\u2014there\u2019s a shopping mall there now. And Krakowski\u2019s widow was paid off\u2014some pretty big bucks for the time, I understand.\u201d</p><p>Logan motioned to Jane. \u201cFind out more about anyone associated with Waterton Studios tomorrow, please. Anything at the police station?\u201d</p><p>As Jane began to speak, Sean got up and hurried into his room, returning a moment later with his laptop. He keyed in a few words while Jane described the eliminations she\u2019d been able to make, which included most of the people working at Archer\u2019s studio. The majority of them had airtight alibis that she\u2019d been able to check out.</p><p>\u201cWhat about alibis for our key players?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cAlthough it was Sunday, Eddie Archer had meetings during the day. Mike Greenwood was at his club in the late afternoon. He was seen there by the bartender and various friends. After that, he claims he went home. He lives in a condo, and the security footage shows him arriving at 7:30 p.m. and doesn\u2019t show him going back out. Andy Simons attended a charity event that started at about eight. He was a keynote speaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone see him after the keynote?\u201d Sean questioned.</p><p>\u201cI just know that he was there at eight and that his speech lasted about twenty minutes,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI spoke to a few people who were at his table. He did eat his dinner, but then friends stopped by and pulled him away and the socializing began.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess who else has a history that relates to this whole thing?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone other than the ex\u2013Mrs. Archer, Benita Lowe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her connection?\u201d Logan stood and walked over to the bulletin board they\u2019d covered with pictures and information, thoughts and theories.</p><p>Sean looked up from his computer. \u201cBenita Lowe was actually born in Mexico\u2014the police gave us that much, and I\u2019m pretty sure I knew it already. It was her mother\u2019s country of birth. Benita\u2019s parents were Austin Lowe, an American casting agent, and Maria Juarez, a seamstress. And Maria was the daughter of Juan Juarez of Mexico City\u2014and Janet Krakowski, daughter of Pete Krakowski, killed in the making of Sam Stone and the Curious Case of the Egyptian Museum.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan had been writing as Sean spoke. \u201cI say it\u2019s time we had her brought in. I\u2019ll call Knox. We\u2019ll meet them at the station.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cLos Angeles may be a city of millions, but there\u2019s been nepotism in this industry since the beginning. We may come across more people with connections to the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a woman with a potential motive and no real alibi,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk to her. Sean, you, Kelsey and I will go. Tyler, get some sleep. If this turns into an all-nighter, you\u2019ll be with Kat and Jane at the studio tomorrow. And Madison...\u201d he said thoughtfully.</p> <p>\u201cMadison comes with us. I don\u2019t want her alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s saying women aren\u2019t tough enough,\u201d Jane told Kat.</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cI am worried, and I have perfect faith in every member of this team. But I\u2019ll feel better if Madison is with us. Besides, her take on what Benita has to say could be useful.\u201d He looked directly at Madison. Is that okay with you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded but then she remembered what else she\u2019d wanted to tell them. \u201cBenita\u2019s got the blood connection,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I was just thinking about something else Oliver said. He was talking about a day Helena came in. Apparently she had her hands all over Eddie\u2014as in, maybe dipping into his pockets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDipping into his pockets\u2014to steal a key? Have a copy made and then replace it?\u201d Sean asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it sounds to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with Benita,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t expected to get anywhere until tomorrow, so we\u2019ll be ahead of the game.\u201d He paused. \u201cCall Eddie\u2019s house. See if you can talk to his houseman and find out if Helena is there. Make sure she\u2019s not out and about and that we\u2019ll be able to speak with her tomorrow. If she is there, just lie. Say you\u2019re calling to ask how she and Eddie are doing. We won\u2019t tell her we need to speak with her again. I don\u2019t want to spook her.\u201d</p><p>Sean made the call, waiting as Pierce went to check on Mr. and Mrs. Archer. Then he hung up. \u201cPierce said that both Archers retired soon after Eddie got home. They had a quiet dinner and went to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go talk to Benita,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Benita Lowe was at the police station when they arrived; she\u2019d come in just minutes after Knox had called her.</p><p>Sean spoke with the detective before going in to question her. He\u2019d been assigned the task, since the interview would seem the friendliest and least threatening if he were to do it.</p> <p>When he sat across from her at the table, she raised her brows and a smile slowly curved her lips.</p><p>\u201cAm I a suspect now?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNot really or no more so than anyone else at the moment,\u201d he said, settling into his chair. \u201cIt\u2019s just that some interesting information has come up\u2014regarding you.\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward him. With her catlike grace, Benita could be extremely sensual and charming when she wanted, and her amusement seemed real.</p><p>\u201cWhat, exactly?\u201d she asked him. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m bisexual, or that my great-grandfather was Pete Krakowski? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve discovered that by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to say we just discovered it tonight. I\u2019m surprised more people don\u2019t know,\u201d Sean told her.</p><p>She shrugged elegantly. \u201cWhy would that be? I couldn\u2019t see how it would benefit me to advertise that I\u2019m distantly related to some minor actor who ran around all over the place, drank like a fish and wound up dead on a set, electrocuted. Frankly, it\u2019s something I\u2019d just as soon not have out there, you know? And I doubt anyone cares. I\u2019m assuming other people can hear this conversation, so...\u201d She paused, waving to whoever might be standing behind the two-way mirror that separated them from the police observers. \u201cHey, you guys! That\u2019s not for the news\u2014not until I\u2019m really rich and famous, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese conversations aren\u2019t for public consumption, Benita,\u201d Sean assured her.</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cYou know what, Sean? I really do care about Eddie. And, believe it or not, I honestly thought we\u2019d make a go of our marriage. Granted, there are certain little idiosyncrasies about me...if you choose to see it that way. Personally, I consider myself a freethinker and a freewheeler, and the world is my oyster. Leave it to Eddie! The majority of men would give their eyeteeth to be in a threesome. Not Eddie. I love him, Sean. I really love him. And I care about Alistair, which is more than I can say for Helena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you and Helena are friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were friends, once,\u201d Benita said. \u201cNow she\u2019s afraid of me, threatened by me. Look, I swear to you\u2014I wouldn\u2019t hurt Eddie, and I wouldn\u2019t hurt Alistair, and I never even met Jenny Henderson. Come on, Sean. You know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know pretty much everyone involved with the studio,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not accusing you of anything. I\u2019m asking you to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t always mean to, but they talk.\u201d She leaned close to him again, as if they were conspirators. \u201cI understand you\u2019ve been prowling around in the basement at the studio. Can you imagine me in the basement, Sean? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we least imagine that often proves to be true.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head vehemently. \u201cMe\u2014in dirty, dusty places filled with spiderwebs? Not in this lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s not characteristic of what you\u2019d do, Benita, but revenge could be a factor here,\u201d Sean said. \u201cRevenge for Pete Krakowski\u2019s death. And maybe there\u2019s more than one person involved in this\u2014one person to do the deed and another to work on cleanup or alibis or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a great theory, Sean,\u201d she broke in. \u201cExcept what I heard from my grandmother is that Pete Krakowski was a drunk who gave nothing to his family and cheated on his wife from here to eternity\u2014when he wasn\u2019t knocking the crap out of her. The best thing he ever did was die on that set and leave his wife a nice settlement. And...\u201d She drew the pad and pencil that lay on the table toward her. \u201cI\u2019m giving you two names. Two. They\u2019re both my alibi.\u201d She looked into his eyes. \u201cWe were together all night. You\u2019re welcome to verify my alibis for Sunday night\u2014just do it discreetly, huh? Some people prefer to keep their private lives private.\u201d</p><p>Sean wasn\u2019t sure if he was relieved by the conversation and Benita\u2019s easy assurance that she had an alibi, or disappointed. Relieved, he decided. He liked her, with all her brash\u2014and perhaps honest\u2014ways.</p><p>Gut instinct. He believed her. But...she was an actress.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming in, Benita, and thank you for providing these names. We\u2019ll be discreet, I promise.\u201d</p><p>She rose to leave. When she walked out, she saw Madison waiting with Logan and Kelsey.</p><p>She smiled, and glanced back at Sean. \u201cI guess you two have a lot in common,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat with the special effects and all.\u201d She paused, saying good-night to Knox, Kelsey and Logan. \u201cIf you need me, you know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d left, Knox turned to Sean, perplexed. \u201cSure as hell sounded as if she was telling the truth. So, you want the current wife brought in tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019ll just tell her it\u2019s important we speak with her, and that we\u2019re hoping she can fill in some details we need about other people. With luck, that\u2019ll get her in here without calling her lawyer and making things difficult,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d Knox yawned. \u201cI\u2019m used to putting in some serious time, but we do have other shifts. You people are dedicated, not to mention workaholics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly on a case like this,\u201d Logan said. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re the first shift, the second and the third.\u201d</p><p>As Logan drove them back to the hotel, Madison asked Sean, who sat in the back with her, \u201cDo you really think that two people were involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t understand why time was erased on the security footage, unless it was done just to throw us off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we might have one psycho ready to kill\u2014and one with another agenda,\u201d Logan said. \u201cOr is one simply using the other? I don\u2019t know. Or perhaps they both stand to gain from the killing.\u201d</p><p>Sean met Logan\u2019s eyes in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine one person close to Eddie being guilty, much less two,\u201d Madison was saying. \u201cBut suppose you\u2019re right. You mean that one person did the actual killing and someone else made it possible? Maybe someone just hired a killer.\u201d</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. It was too carefully orchestrated. The tunnel, the robe, the catacombs, the basement\u2014as we\u2019ve said all along, it had to be someone with real knowledge of the studio. And even hiring someone... That someone had to know how to get around the place and have a good alibi.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThose two missing minutes are still driving me crazy. I\u2019m convinced the killer always planned to use the tunnels, and I\u2019m beginning to believe the security footage was erased to send us in the wrong direction.\u201d</p><p>They stopped for takeout along the way; when they returned they met briefly in the center room to divide up the food. Bogie was still with Jenny Henderson, both reclining on the suite\u2019s sofa across from the TV. Jenny seemed...almost alive.</p><p>\u201cBogie\u2019s been telling me the most fantastic Hollywood tales!\u201d she told them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Jenny,\u201d Madison said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve been thinking, of course. Trying to come up with anything else that might help,\u201d Jenny said.</p><p>The television was on. They were watching a rerun of The Danny Thomas Show.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, and watching television,\u201d Bogie said.</p><p>Sean grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get anything?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think we need to look at the domestic situation further,\u201d Sean replied.</p><p>Bogie nodded. \u201cYes, closely. Very closely.\u201d</p><p>Madison walked across the hall with Logan waiting at the door, watching her enter her own room. Sean looked at him. \u201cShe\u2019s safe,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, then. We\u2019ll get organized to question Helena in the morning. I\u2019ll send Tyler and the others to the studio with Madison, and you and I can question Mr. Archer\u2019s charming wife.\u201d</p><p>Sean agreed and crossed over to Madison\u2019s room, tapping at her door. She let him in quickly, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter to her whether others noted his arrival or not. He handed her his meal, then shed his jacket, gun and holster, and placed the Glock on the side of the bed.</p><p>She set their food up on the desk, and despite the late hour, he was surprised to discover how hungry he was. They ate in comparative silence, asking common meal questions like, \u201cIs there another packet of ketchup?\u201d and \u201cHand me one of those foil things of butter, will you?\u201d</p> <p>When they\u2019d finished, Madison threw away the trash. He watched her and found himself thinking that she was extraordinary, and not just because she spoke with ghosts. She moved fluidly and everything about her was natural. With Madison, there was absolutely no pretense in a world where pretense was everything; it was even what she did for a living. He\u2019d thought her beautifully, sensually shaped when they\u2019d met, and now he knew that his every lustful thought had been right, that her skin was like satin, her hair like silk. And when she looked at a man with those blue eyes wide and exhaled on a satisfied sigh, she was as erotic as he could have dreamed.</p><p>He stood, coming up behind her, slipping his arms around her. She turned easily into his embrace, and for a moment, he cupped her chin and met her eyes, searching them to understand how her shade of blue could be more beautiful than any other.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m exhausted...and deliriously happy to be with you. But I\u2019m the kind of exhausted that makes me think I need a distraction\u2014some activity\u2014if I\u2019m ever going to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you activity!\u201d she said, laughing. Her fingers brushed his chest as she undid the buttons on his shirt. Just her touch seemed to ignite something in him. He shrugged out of the shirt as her fingers moved to his belt buckle....</p><p>Later, when they lay spent and sated in each other\u2019s arms, she spoke to him softly. \u201cSo...who was she? I don\u2019t mean to open any wounds, but...when you left here, you went back to Texas....\u201d</p> <p>He was quiet for a while as he studied her. Then he smiled. \u201cShe was the love of my life at one time, and my best friend at another,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did the mad, passionate on-and-off thing for years when we were in high school, and whenever we were home from college. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went in different directions. I wanted Hollywood. She wanted politics. We fought like wildcats after college, and then split up. I moved to California and she was a mover in Texas, giving fantastic speeches, fierce and loyal to all her causes. I watched her career from afar, and we kept up, mainly through Facebook and email.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated again, thinking about Melissa. He remembered how the illness had taken her bit by bit, and yet never stolen her passion, her heart, her soul or her courage.</p><p>By then he\u2019d realized they were friends. The best of friends. But when she died, it seemed that he\u2019d lost the love of his life. Their histories had been interwoven.</p><p>Love could change. Love between them had become something different. No longer sexual. Something different, yes, maybe even something more.</p><p>He looked at Madison and touched her face with a bittersweet smile. \u201cWe were far apart in distance and in the everyday course of our lives. I was still fairly new out here, working constantly, having that occasional wild night out or superficial fling. And then...then I heard about the cancer. Melissa didn\u2019t have family. Her dad had departed\u2014left the family, more or less disappeared\u2014when she was two, and her mom died when she was twenty-two. We\u2019d been together during that hard time, and it might have helped cement what we had, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have had many friends and been adored.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe did and she was, but no one knew her like I did. And as she was failing, she didn\u2019t want to be around others. It was pride, I guess. She didn\u2019t want a lot of people to see her as she was\u2014thin as a rail, balding, drawn. And pretense in front of people who aren\u2019t really close can be exhausting. I thought about Melissa and our situation endlessly after she died. Maybe we were never meant to be. And maybe we both believed that we\u2019d get ambition out of the way and then we\u2019d be together when we were ready. It didn\u2019t matter. When I knew how sick she was, I had to go to her, and she accepted me. I talked to her doctor.... He was a good guy. He never let her completely lose hope\u2014but didn\u2019t give her false hope, either. He told me they\u2019d try everything they could while she had breath in her body, but the prognosis wasn\u2019t positive. Melissa was an intelligent woman, and she could see that she wasn\u2019t getting any better. There were good days when I first got back. Really good days. But what I learned was that ambition didn\u2019t mean a thing.</p><p>\u201cWhen she died, I was already gaining a reputation for special effects, especially computer-generated effects, in Texas. I got established in San Antonio, and there was a lot of work going on there. I stayed, thinking I might go back to Hollywood one day, but my heart wasn\u2019t in it. I worked with the Texas Rangers and the state and local police on a few cases, and it seemed that I\u2019d found my niche.\u201d</p><p>He paused, and Madison nudged him to continue.</p><p>\u201cA while back,\u201d he resumed, \u201ca man named Adam Harrison\u2014who\u2019d been called in by both private citizens and the government in strange and unusual cases for years\u2014was approached by the FBI to put together a special unit. He formed the first Krewe of Hunters. Then he found out there was so much going on, some of it genuinely unusual, and some of it people playing at the unusual, that they figured they needed to create another team. No one really knows how Adam Harrison gets his information about people, but he has a knack for putting teams together. Five of us are from Texas and were working there. My cousin Kelsey grew up in Florida, but she\u2019d visited Texas a lot. No one has to join the team, of course. We\u2019re all allowed to make our own choices. It\u2019s been good for me. It let me really step back, see where I\u2019ve been and where I want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were approached because someone knew you could talk to the dead?\u201d Madison asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere...were you able to talk to Melissa after she died?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOnce. At her grave site. She touched my face, kissed my lips\u2014and told me to live my life. But at that point...well, I couldn\u2019t. She told me she was going on, that it was only right. We had known how to say goodbye in life. Now we needed to do it after her death.\u201d He remembered his emotions during that awful time when the cancer had become so unbearable he prayed Melissa would die, so the pain would end.</p><p>\u201cShe was a wonderful human being,\u201d Madison whispered.</p><p>He nodded, and hugged her tighter. He didn\u2019t have to say anything else. He didn\u2019t have to tell her she was wonderful, too.</p><p>He felt her gentle touch, and then the way she curled against him. He cradled her chin. \u201cAnd you?\u201d he asked, meeting her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI used to feel like a truly odd loner for a really long time\u2014and yet, I was never really unhappy, just scared and convinced I was crazy, and that I needed to keep my secret. When I was young...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was Josh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe love of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy young life. He died before we graduated. A ridiculous accident,\u201d she said, and told him what had happened to the young man so full of promise. \u201cEven at his funeral, all he wanted me to do was make sure everyone found a way to accept his death. And then after he died...I\u2019ve dated casually. But Bogie followed me home when I was still in college, so my casual dating hasn\u2019t been going that great. Maybe I\u2019ve been afraid of getting close to people. My first experience with ghosts was Billy. I was so young that when I tried to tell people he was going to a better place, my mother was appalled. She doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby!\u201d he said, and he smiled. \u201cThere are those of us who do understand. You know that now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>They curled together in a comfortable silence.</p><p>And then they were both able to sleep.</p><p>Vengeance was waiting. Vengeance didn\u2019t like to wait. But the night was dark, and a low fog was hanging over the ground, eerie and mysterious. Rather nice, Vengeance thought.</p><p>She arrived, angry, as she tiptoed through the grass. \u201cThis is totally going to ruin my shoes. And getting here was a nightmare!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damned lucky I\u2019m here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damned lucky I just don\u2019t tell them you did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019d accuse you. You\u2019re the one who did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made it possible!\u201d Vengeance reminded her.</p><p>She looked away. \u201cI\u2019m not going into the tunnels. I already went into those damned tunnels for you, and I\u2019m not doing it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go into the tunnels. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you said I have to help clean up. What the hell did you want me to do, then?\u201d she asked irritably.</p><p>\u201cDie!\u201d Vengeance said quietly. \u201cJust die.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>When she opened her mouth to scream, it was too late.</p><p>14</p><p>When Madison woke up the next morning, Sean was no longer beside her. She found a note on the pillow telling her that he\u2019d had an idea and she should join Logan Raintree and the others in the suite. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A glance at the bedside clock showed her that he must have risen extremely early, since it was just past six. But then, she was learning particulars about his personality. If he had an idea, he wasn\u2019t going to fall back asleep; he was going to explore it.</p><p>In the suite, she discovered that coffee was made and there were bagels, fruit and pitchers of juice and water on the table.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d Logan told her, \u201cand then you and I will head over to the studio with Tyler and Kelsey. I\u2019ll meet up with Sean there, and he and I will go to the police station. We\u2019ve decided that we\u2019ll bring in Helena LaRoux at ten. Kat and Jane have already gone back to the station.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Madison said. \u201cDo you know where Sean is now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at the studio, following a hunch.\u201d Logan was standing at the board, writing, drawing lines. Madison studied it. On one side, the name Pete Krakowski was written, and on the other, Eddie Archer. Names were listed beneath, along with the connections between any of those names. Separately, to the far right, he\u2019d listed theories, thoughts, hunches, questions.</p><p>Possibly more than one killer.</p><p>Benita has a family tie to Krakowski.</p><p>Oliver has a family tie to Claymore Illusions.</p> <p>Madison fixed a plate of food and sat down, watching Logan as he continued to write.</p><p>Two killers. Both with knowledge of the studio, one with greater access.</p><p>Killing not random.</p><p>Motives: Oliver Marshall\u2014related to original studio owner, Claymore.</p><p>Helena LaRoux, current wife\u2014stands to gain if Alistair convicted? How? There was a prenup, and she is taken care of in the will. So is Benita.</p><p>Alistair\u2014to inherit studios.</p> <p>Mike Greenwood\u2014knows the studio better than most.</p><p>Andy Simons\u2014Eddie\u2019s partner.</p><p>Colin Bailey\u2014on duty at the time of the murder.</p><p>Winston Nash\u2014knows the studio, knows how to work the security footage.</p><p>\u201cYou really think it\u2019s down to one of these people?\u201d Madison asked.</p><p>Logan sat down across from her. \u201cCan you suggest anyone else? Anyone we should interview again? We\u2019ll bring in Oliver Marshall, discreetly, of course. But other than Oliver?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, surprised by what she was going to say. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is important or not. My assistant, Alfie, has been acting a bit strange. He always acts a bit strange, but I mean more than usual. He\u2019s a wonderful assistant and very talented. But he was the first to call me about the murder, and he\u2019s almost eager to see what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Logan rose and added the name of Madison\u2019s assistant to the list. Tyler entered the suite, pouring himself a coffee and greeting the two of them.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are our resident ghosts?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBogie has taken it upon himself to shelter Jenny. He\u2019s trying to teach her what ghosts can and can\u2019t do. I think he\u2019s gone off to show her more of \u2018old Hollywood,\u2019\u201d Logan said. \u201cWe should get going. I\u2019ll collect Kelsey. She\u2019s been on the computer looking for any more connections to the studio or the movie.\u201d He studied Madison, and she sensed that he was perplexed, suspecting that she knew\u2014somewhere inside\u2014a piece of information that might help them.</p><p>\u201cHonestly,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what it is or when we\u2019ll get to it, but I have a gut hunch that you do know something.\u201d He smiled. \u201cNow let\u2019s get out there.\u201d</p><p>There simply weren\u2019t enough hours in the day, Sean thought ruefully, staring across the expanse of Peace Cemetery. It was aptly named; it seemed to stretch on forever, and beautiful oaks had grown up over the years to shade the winding trails, benches, gravestones and monuments. The funerary art ranged from the contemporary back to the flowery detail of the late-Victorian era. Fences separated the cemetery from the studio and the Black Box Cinema, but Sean wasn\u2019t concerned with the fences; he was still certain there had to be an entry to the underground catacombs. He just had to figure out where that entry might be.</p><p>It was a daunting task.</p><p>Benny Knox, impressed by the hours the Krewe seemed to keep, had done his part, bringing the original plan for the cemetery and the roster that noted the burials.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like any other old cemetery, or so says the current manager\u2014who was not pleased to be called at 7:00 a.m.,\u201d Knox had said. \u201cGraves have shifted over the years, and before there was greater security, vandals broke stones. Some are almost pulverized by tree roots. Things happen\u2014and the dead are forgotten.\u201d Knox sighed. \u201cI was informed that the original Claymore owned the land but donated some of it to the church. At first this place was a graveyard before it became a public cemetery. Yeah, apparently graveyards are attached to churches, and cemeteries don\u2019t have to be. In the flux of that turnover, a lot of records went missing. But there are vaults all over\u2014as you can see\u2014and lots of people were buried in pine boxes...sometimes on top of one another. There was a rumor that the poor could be buried here when they didn\u2019t have money for fancy coffins or grave sites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...Claymore worked with the church, to help the poor?\u201d Sean had asked. That would explain the catacombs attached to the studio and the Black Box.</p><p>\u201cThere are over fifty thousand known burials and entombments in the cemetery. Just going through the records is like working your way through a giant maze,\u201d Knox had told him.</p><p>Now Sean studied the paperwork and tried to get his bearings. So, it seemed Claymore, father of Lucas, had been involved, apparently for the most generous of reasons. But Sean had gone to the vault, expecting he\u2019d have to wait for one of the cemetery workers before he could enter the small family mausoleum. That hadn\u2019t been true; the vault was open, like a larger, multifamily mausoleum might be. Beautiful iron gates led to a little sanctuary with a bench. There was an altar, and a memorial plaque stated that the earthly remains of Lucas Claymore rested beneath the altar in the middle of various other Claymores, including, of course, his father, who\u2019d been such a benefactor to the church.</p><p>Sean was looking over the cemetery when his cell phone rang. He answered it to hear Eddie Archer, sounding frantic.</p><p>At first Sean couldn\u2019t understand a word he was saying.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here. She\u2019s not here,\u201d Eddie finally managed. \u201cThe police called. They wanted Helena to come in and talk to them, to help establish timelines, talk about my friends\u2014enemies. Actually, they said you and Logan wanted to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s not here! I sent Pierce to get her after I spoke to that Knox fellow. She wasn\u2019t in her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie, it\u2019s morning. She might have gone out somewhere,\u201d Sean said. But he felt uncomfortable. Maybe it was the panic in Eddie\u2019s voice. Maybe it was just that dreaded gut feeling, the premonition you felt when something really was wrong.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Knox you couldn\u2019t find Helena?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, not yet. I just said I\u2019d get her up. We need to file a missing-person report,\u201d Eddie said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon. We don\u2019t know that she\u2019s really missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Pierce\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me speak to him, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Pierce was on the phone. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell Eddie not to panic\u2014that just because she isn\u2019t here this minute doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPierce, when did you last see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe retired about an hour before Eddie yesterday evening,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWas her bed made this morning\u2014had she slept in it?\u201d</p><p>Pierce was silent; Sean could imagine Eddie staring at him, stricken.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs her car there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d</p><p>He set the phone down and came back. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not in the drive, and it\u2019s not in the garage. You think she just went somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I take it Eddie tried to call her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer cell phone goes straight to voice mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, we don\u2019t want to make Eddie worse,\u201d Sean said. \u201cYes and no answers will do. Does she ever make her own bed? Couldn\u2019t she have straightened up before she left this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Pierce said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Tell Eddie that I\u2019ll take care of calling Knox, and that we\u2019ll get an APB out on her and her car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie is extremely agitated, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to get him to calm down\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t finish his sentence because Eddie had grabbed the phone. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to calm down! I have to do something. Helena is not here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie, you saw her last night. And she obviously drove from your house, since her car is gone. She might have gone out for doughnuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never eats doughnuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she might have gone out to buy a new kind of diet granola\u2014I don\u2019t know. But calm down, please, or you\u2019ll end up having a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me everything\u2019s going to be all right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t tell you that,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI\u2019m just telling you not to panic, and that even if something is wrong, the FBI and the police are working on the case. Other than trying to think of anywhere she might have gone, there\u2019s nothing you can do. Working yourself into a frenzy isn\u2019t going to help anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right\u2014I\u2019m calm,\u201d Eddie said. He obviously wasn\u2019t, but at least he was listening. \u201cSean, first Alistair\u2014and now Helena. I\u2019m just ill. I don\u2019t understand this. Why is someone hurting everyone around me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie, we\u2019ll find out,\u201d Sean promised him. \u201cWe\u2019re getting close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelena\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t she, Sean?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that, Eddie.

They\u2019d only just discovered that she wasn\u2019t in the house.</p><p>\u201cI will work with every resource I can summon, Eddie, I promise you. I won\u2019t stop until we find her,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sean. Thank you. What do I do now?\u201d Eddie asked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cGo and see Alistair. Be with your son, Eddie. You can support each other.\u201d</p> <p>He hung up, then called Knox and explained. After that, he called Logan, put him on the alert regarding Helena. He\u2019d phone back when he was finished at the cemetery to see if Eddie had gone to see Alistair and if the two were doing all right. With an APB on Helena\u2019s car, there wasn\u2019t much reason for him to drive blindly around L.A. trying to find her himself.</p><p>He returned to his task.</p><p>Where the hell is it? Where\u2019s the entry? It\u2019s got to be here somewhere. The dead in those catacombs didn\u2019t get there by themselves.</p><p>He cursed and looked across the rows and twisting paths, over winged angels and weeping cherubs.</p><p>Neither the original blueprint nor any of the plots and ownership lists had mentioned anything at all about the underground burials.</p><p>He started to walk, remembering the cemetery plans, and trying to envision just how far the basement of the studio reached.</p> <p>\u201cHelena is missing,\u201d Logan said. They\u2019d just arrived at the studio. It was still early, barely 8:00 a.m.</p><p>Kelsey and Tyler had gone on to check with the guard and the police officers who\u2019d been on duty throughout the night.</p><p>\u201cMissing?\u201d Madison echoed.</p><p>\u201cEddie was going to tell her we wanted to speak with her, and she was gone. According to Pierce, she was seen going up to bed last night, but not since. Her bed hasn\u2019t been slept in, and her car is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you think she\u2019s another victim, or that she\u2019s somehow involved and on the run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she may blithely drive back home after having gone to the drugstore. Or that she might have skipped town. Or that she might be a victim,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the studio. \u201cCan you remember anything? Anything at all that might have to do with any of this?\u201d he asked urgently.</p><p>\u201cI swear, if I could think of anything else, Logan, I\u2019d tell you,\u201d Madison said. And then, as she approached the front door to the studio, she paused and turned back to him.</p> <p>\u201cThere is something I hadn\u2019t thought of,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas Claymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe previous owner of the studio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And his father owned the land, inherited from his father, and founded the studio. I believe the family gave the cemetery to the church for its burial ground, and then, of course, it was outgrown, and a new church was built. But once, when I was going through the cemetery, I met up with the younger Lucas Claymore. He was old, kind, very pleasant. I know that ghosts don\u2019t show up on demand, but if we walked through the cemetery, he might appear to one of us. I doubt it\u2019ll be as easy as saying, \u2018Hey, Lucas, did you happen to be around when Jenny Henderson was killed in the tunnel?\u2019 But he could tell us something that might help\u2014don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, indeed,\u201d Logan agreed. \u201cIn fact, Sean is crawling around somewhere in the cemetery right now. That was his hunch. If he could find the entry to the catacombs in the cemetery, he could follow the killer\u2019s path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cemetery gate is on the street,\u201d Madison said. \u201cUnless you want to jump the wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, let\u2019s go in properly,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI only jump walls when I absolutely have to.\u201d</p><p>She smiled; she knew that either Colin Bailey or Winston Nash was on duty at the guard stand, and that Kelsey and Tyler had gone to the studio. She wondered if any of them were watching as she and Logan turned away, and started back down to the sidewalk and the cemetery entrance.</p><p>The arched iron gate stood at a break in the high stone wall. The letters that spelled out Peace Cemetery were curlicued and ornate, late-Victorian vintage. Actually, the cemetery might have fit an old town in New England better than it did the contemporary bustle of L.A. It was a reminder that while the movie business wasn\u2019t old in the history of man, Los Angeles had been around, with hundreds of thousands seeking the American dream, even before the dawn of celluloid fever.</p><p>They entered the cemetery. Logan paused for a minute.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a hell of a big population living\u2014and dying\u2014in these parts,\u201d she said wryly.</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cWhere do we begin?\u201d</p><p>She gestured at a little rise. \u201cThat vault there\u2014it\u2019s one of the smaller individual vaults. Very pretty, all in marble. The Claymore vault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times have you seen Lucas Claymore?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cJust once. I thought he was an elderly gentleman, alive and well and breathing, the first time I saw him,\u201d Madison said. \u201cI think that\u2019s when Eddie figured I was either crazy...or communicated with ghosts. I didn\u2019t realize Lucas was dead until I understood that Eddie couldn\u2019t see him. Eddie and I were here studying gravestones and monuments. You have to make the not-real look real\u2014if you want movie magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s see if he\u2019ll come out today and talk to us.\u201d</p><p>The kept walking, heading up one of the winding paths that led toward the vault. It was a lovely day, with the sun shining brilliantly. The temperature might go as high as the mid-seventies, since spring was waning and summer was on the way. They passed new burials and memorials interspersed between old stones, other vaults and fenced-in family plots. Fresh flowers had been placed at some of the newer graves. Other stones were chipped and weatherworn, and the great oaks seemed to dip low, as if weeping sadly for those who had gone on.</p><p>They reached the Claymore vault. The iron gate was open.</p><p>Logan looked at Madison. \u201cIs this customary?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bench and an altar inside. Lucas is under the altar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t it be locked at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they worry about it too much. The walls surrounding the cemetery are high, and the gates are pretty solid. They don\u2019t have much trouble out here. In fact, we never had trouble out here\u2014until Jenny was killed.\u201d</p><p>They walked in and Madison sat on the bench. The vault was beautiful, with a circular stained-glass window above the altar, and two more on either side. Each depicted a scene from the New Testament. Above the altar and the coffin beneath, the central window showed Christ with a peaceful look, folding his hands. To one side, the window had Christ surrounded by lambs, and the third window represented the wedding at Cana.</p><p>Logan took a seat beside her. \u201cAnything?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Disappointed, she shook her head. \u201cDid you see him in here the first time you visited?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I just met him when we were looking for unusual headstones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeyond the vault, there\u2019s another little rise, and something of a potter\u2019s field. The burials were for those who died indigent, but the coffins and services were paid for by an actor\u2019s fund\u2014those who made it paying for those who didn\u2019t. There are a number of really pretty and interesting stones. Some, I suppose, because people were really kind, and some because they didn\u2019t want their good deed to go unnoticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a look,\u201d Logan suggested.</p><p>They left the Claymore crypt and started along the winding path again. \u201cSee,\u201d she said to Logan, \u201cisn\u2019t that gorgeous? Marian Hatfield had it designed for Shelby McLaughton. They were both silent-film stars.\u201d The memorial was carved to picture a feminine-looking angel with a finger to her lips, and beneath it were carved the name of the deceased and the words In Heaven All Whispers Are Heard Like the Voices of Angels in Song.</p><p>\u201cSo Claymore was right here?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWe can wait.\u201d</p><p>They found another bench and sat. Madison began to feel restless; she was sure Logan had to be feeling the same. He\u2019d listened to her, but she suspected they were on a wild-goose chase.</p><p>And then, straight and lean, white-haired and a bit fragile, Lucas Claymore appeared. He stood under the shade of an old oak, and he was watching them.</p><p>\u201cLogan,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>As he neared the cemetery chapel, Sean heard his phone ring. Caller ID informed him that Benny Knox was calling.</p><p>He answered immediately.</p><p>\u201cTwo of my patrol officers found Helena LaRoux\u2019s car,\u201d Knox told him.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it? No sign of Helena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sign of Helena. The car\u2019s on the street behind the northern end of Peace Cemetery. I\u2019d say it\u2019s about a half-mile around that back wall to the entrance of the studio. I\u2019ve called the officers there, but none of them have seen Ms. LaRoux. And the guard about to go off duty\u2014Colin Bailey\u2014swears he hasn\u2019t seen her, either.\u201d</p><p>Sean frowned. \u201cI\u2019m in the cemetery now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of tombstones,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to check out the chapel.\u201d</p><p>Knox was silent for a minute. \u201cWhat are you doing in the cemetery?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLooking for a pathway to the dead,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading down there,\u201d Knox said. \u201cWe need to get on a real search and find that woman. God knows, maybe she met up with a friend, maybe...\u201d He groaned. \u201cWhy the hell park at the cemetery? There\u2019s nothing around it for miles. This just gets worse and worse,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean studied the chapel. Once upon a time, it had been consecrated as St. Bartholomew\u2019s. But the parishioners had long outgrown the building and the area; St. Bartholomew\u2019s was closer to downtown L.A. now and the chapel here was nondenominational. Eddie allowed them to use the building rent-free, as a place for services to be held or for mourners to say their prayers.</p><p>Sean had been inside once, years before, accompanying a friend to a funeral service. It was larger than the typical funeral chapel, but then it had begun life as a real church. The main aisle led up to a raised altar, while side aisles converged at the back, where the one-time choir might gather before entering. There were monuments above the walls. The pastor who had first reigned over the old congregation had originally been buried beneath the altar but his remains had been relocated, along with the congregation.</p><p>When he entered by the main doors, Sean thought it had been and still was a beautiful place, with just the right poignancy in the decor. The pews were hardwood with dark crimson cushions for kneeling in prayer, and the walls were divided into eight panels, which held Tiffany windows of clear glass with images etched into them\u2014doves, lambs, olive branches and, closest to the altar, looking across at each other, a pair of angels.</p> <p>Sean walked down the aisle to the altar. He paused for a minute, turning to get a feel for the size and scope of the chapel, and its relationship to the studio and the Black Box Cinema. It was possible that tunnels stretched from the chapel to the other buildings.</p><p>There was nothing to be seen in the empty church so he went around to the left-side aisle and through a door. He noted that in the rear of the church\u2014where one might enter without being seen by the congregation\u2014was a door.</p><p>The staging area for the chapel was in darkness. There weren\u2019t huge cut-glass windows here to let in the sunlight. Two wall lamps were aglow, one on his side and one on the other side. The rear of the chapel was apparently used by the cemetery maintenance workers; several wheelbarrows were lined up against the back wall, a pile of sod waiting to be laid, and shelves holding vases. There were cones that advised Construction Area on the far side of the room. He walked over, trying to see what the construction might be, but nothing gave him a real indication. The place was old and well-maintained, but earthquakes, big and little, had shaken the area over the years, and old foundations always needed to be shored up.</p><p>He looked around, waiting for his eyes to get accustomed to the light.</p><p>Once they did, he saw a shelf near the pile of sod, and a number of old wooden signs piled up beside it. He dug through them. Several advertised restrooms in one way or another. Ladies, Gentlemen, Men\u2019s, Women\u2019s. He saw two doors on the right side, one with a large W and the other a large M. He opened both doors to assure himself that the rooms were indeed for the purpose advertised.</p> <p>Back at the shelf, he dug deeper. At last he found one that read Crypt.</p><p>He took a second to look around again; he saw no stairs, and nothing that indicated a crypt.</p><p>Frustrated, he returned to the rooms with the large W and the large M.</p><p>Nothing, except that when he stood outside, he realized that the depth of the rooms didn\u2019t match up with the distance between them.</p><p>\u201cThis place is full of false walls,\u201d he muttered aloud. He studied the wall, tapped on it and shook his head. The crypt stairs had been covered over long ago.</p><p>He went into the women\u2019s toilet. There was an old dressing table with a mirror behind it. He shoved aside the table and the mirror, uncovering an old pocket door. A large sign read Danger! No Entry.</p> <p>Sean slid the door open.</p><p>A set of dark stairs led downward, into the darkness of the crypt.</p><p>Madison stood and smiled at Lucas Claymore. She lifted a hand in greeting, and walked slowly toward him, afraid he would disappear.</p><p>\u201cMr. Claymore!\u201d she greeted him quietly. \u201cGood morning, sir.\u201d</p><p>Claymore didn\u2019t run. He watched her sadly as she approached, then he looked over her shoulder at Logan Raintree. \u201cYou work at my studio,\u201d he said to Madison. \u201cWhat used to be my studio, I should say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething terrible has happened,\u201d Claymore said.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Logan nodded.</p> <p>For a moment, Claymore became sheer, and almost disappeared in the breeze that moved softly around them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to discover the truth, Mr. Claymore,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the truth to give you.\u201d Claymore sounded sad, even distressed. \u201cPeople come and people go. There are lights, there are noises, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Claymore, hundreds of bodies are buried in the catacombs that stretch out from the studio and the cinema,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was long ago, so long ago,\u201d Claymore said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know everything. The property was really my father\u2019s, and he died...oh, years past. People were flocking here, you know.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAnd then the Depression came. Followed by the war. Most of the burials are very old. Back in the thirties, when there was no social security...no assistance for the poor. My father was a good man. When he could no longer help the living, he helped the dead. He wasn\u2019t alone in what he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho helped him?\u201d Madison asked Claymore.</p><p>\u201cWhy, the Reverend Parker. He was over at St. Bartholomew\u2019s. He\u2019s been dead for years, too.\u201d</p><p>Logan turned to Madison. \u201cThere\u2019s where the tunnels begin,\u201d he said. \u201cThe church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, those tunnels have been closed up forever.\u201d Lucas Claymore sighed again. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have people wandering from a film noir movie into a graveyard now, could you? And Reverend Parker lived a very long life. When he felt it coming to an end, we had the crypt closed off. No one goes down there now. Trust me, I had power in my day. I saw to it that the crypts were kept closed, and that even if the church opened them, there was no access to the studio. Everyone was careful not to let the truth be known. If people had found out, they would have come in. They would\u2019ve dragged up the dead, who might have ended up in museums, in drawers, like all the specimens they have at the Smithsonian,\u201d he said, staring at them as if trying to make sure they understood.</p><p>\u201cI think that someone who\u2019s very much alive has discovered the secret of the tunnels, Mr. Claymore.\u201d</p><p>Claymore made a strange sound that, if he\u2019d been living, would have been a disdainful sniff. \u201cThat one!\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2014who?\u201d Madison asked.</p><p>Claymore said, \u201cI saw Eddie Archer with you, young lady. I was glad. He\u2019s done the studio proud. But...that one he\u2019s married to now. She came here. She traipsed around. She lit a cigarette in my vault and crushed it out on the floor. She was always waiting for someone here. And she\u2019d be on the phone, yakking away. She was up to something, you mark my words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen her in the chapel, Mr. Claymore?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>Claymore shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t stand around here all day, young man. I don\u2019t watch people endlessly. Sometimes I come because it\u2019s beautiful and peaceful, and I love this land. I can\u2019t tell you more than that.\u201d</p><p>Logan was already tugging at her arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said. He pulled his phone from his pocket and started dialing.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Claymore!\u201d Madison called back.</p><p>\u201cThank you, yes, thank you so much!\u201d Logan said. \u201cDamn!\u201d he muttered as they hurried across the cemetery.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean isn\u2019t answering,\u201d he told her. \u201cHe\u2019s got to be out of contact. The wretched things worked in the tunnels by the studio, but...\u201d</p><p>Fear instantly wrapped icy fingers around her heart. \u201cHe\u2019s here\u2014you said he\u2019s here, in the cemetery somewhere. Why haven\u2019t we seen him, Logan? Why hasn\u2019t he answered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably in the chapel. I know he was here. Maybe he thought a chapel that was once a church might have a crypt. And that chapel\u2019s a very old building. There might be something blocking cell phone reception. But don\u2019t worry\u2014we\u2019ll find him. He\u2019s a well-trained agent, and he\u2019s going to be fine. Now, you, on the other hand, stay close to me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t intend to do anything foolish. Logan Raintree was tall and long-legged and he kept up with her easily as she ran through the cemetery. When she nearly tripped over a gravestone, he was there to catch her.</p><p>\u201cMadison, I\u2019m sure Sean\u2019s fine,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am, too.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, holding her arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk quickly\u2014but we walk, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, feeling chastised but knowing he was right.</p><p>When they got close to the chapel, she drew ahead again, calling Sean\u2019s name as they hurried in. Entering the building, she heard the echo of her voice against the old stone walls. Sean didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cCome around here,\u201d Logan said, moving past her down the aisle.</p><p>She followed him and then entered the sacristy, or staging area, for the church. \u201cWatch it! There are lights, but it\u2019s dangerous back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask Lucas where to find the crypt!\u201d Madison said.</p><p>She walked around and saw a maintenance area. Some of the flooring had been roped off.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what happened here, or what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Logan joined her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re doing anything yet. Someone who works here might have realized that the flooring is treacherous. They\u2019ve probably asked for a structural engineer to come in.</p><p>Madison walked over to the area that had been roped off. \u201cThe ground looks damp. Maybe they had a leak,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I heard it was bizarrely wet last month, lots of rain. But that\u2019s good. It\u2019ll help keep the fires down this summer.\u201d Logan was trying his phone. \u201cDoesn\u2019t work in here, either,\u201d he muttered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, but it doesn\u2019t matter.

I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>She never finished her sentence.</p><p>The floor beneath her gave way, and she pitched straight down into a dark abyss.</p><p>15</p><p>Sean went dead still, hearing the sound of the scream.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t sure how he recognized a scream, but he did.</p><p>Madison.</p><p>He\u2019d traveled no more than twenty feet into the crypts, straight to the rear of the structure, or so he believed. Here, marble slabs covered every entombment, except for those that had been dug into the ground and were covered with memorials, some in stone and some in brass. He hadn\u2019t discovered where the tunnels connected with the studio, but he knew he\u2019d eventually find what he was seeking. There was no other way for a killer to escape without leaving some clue\u2014a drop of blood, something.</p><p>The scream! It was close, and yet he didn\u2019t know where it had come from.</p><p>\u201cMadison!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cSean!\u201d she cried in return.</p><p>\u201cSean!\u201d He heard Logan\u2019s shout, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he yelled.</p> <p>\u201cI went through the floor,\u201d Madison yelled back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to get down to her,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Sean\u2019s voice echoed off the cold slabs of marble in the darkness around him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...up, I\u2019m on my feet. I\u2019m fine, no bones broken...but it\u2019s dark down here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep talking. I\u2019m trying to get to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Madison said. \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to be a bit late for work. Hey, did you find out anything about our missing Helena? Oh, wait, that would mean you answer and I quit talking. Logan was great this morning and he kept trying to make me remember if there was anything else I knew. I was sure there wasn\u2019t, but we were looking for tunnels, and information about the property, and I don\u2019t know why it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that I knew the ghost of the man who\u2019d owned the studio before Eddie\u2014Lucas Claymore. So we went to his tomb....\u201d</p><p>She paused for breath.</p><p>\u201cSo did I!\u201d Sean called. \u201cLogan, can you see Madison?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so muffled I can barely hear you!\u201d Logan shouted back. \u201cI\u2019m trying to give her some light...until you reach her. Then I\u2019ll get down there, or you can get Madison back up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison, start talking again!\u201d Sean said. So far, he\u2019d been walking in one direction, which seemed to be his only choice. Except that he was moving farther away from Madison\u2019s voice, and he needed to get closer. He retraced his steps, using his flashlight to illuminate the grave markers and the floor. Then he froze; there was blood on the ground.</p><p>Fresh blood, a trail of it.</p><p>\u201cMadison!\u201d He felt a prickle of fear. \u201cMadison, keep talking!\u201d</p><p>He followed the blood, and it seemed to lead into a wall of tombs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. Let me see, I\u2019m not sure what to say. Um. It was good to be back at work yesterday. I\u2019m looking forward to going in today. It\u2019s\u2014oh, God, Sean, it\u2019s really...dark down here.\u201d</p><p>But she kept talking. He realized that following the trail of blood had made her voice seem louder. He\u2019d taken a slight turn to the right, and might be doubling back under the center of the church sacristy.</p><p>But there was that wall....</p><p>Puzzled, he put his hand on one of the tombs. The blood trail seemed to lead to it, and then beneath it.</p><p>He pushed on the marble slab covering the tomb. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cMadison!\u201d Logan called. \u201cI\u2019m shining the light down there. Can you see anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can see the floor...I\u2019m in the crypt. There are walls of graves down here, and there seem to be more tunnels, like the ones by the studio, except that these are in better shape. Well, I can really only see where your light is shining\u2014 Oh!\u201d</p><p>Her words broke off in a horrified gasp.</p><p>\u201cMadison!\u201d Sean screamed, pushing at the stones. He could hear her clearly, she was so close.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2014there\u2019s something here...in a crypt. In a broken crypt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you see what it is?\u201d he shouted to her.</p><p>\u201cLogan!\u201d she called up. \u201cCan you twist the light around?\u201d</p><p>Logan must have done so.</p><p>Madison let out a long and terrified shriek.</p><p>\u201cMadison!\u201d He banged frantically at the slabs on the tombs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d she said, but her voice was weak.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d Sean demanded. \u201cMadison...\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d done something right; the slabs were false. There for show, but perfectly fitted, and probably first engineered when a young pastor and the owner of the property wanted to make sure the down-and-out among L.A.\u2019s dead weren\u2019t thrown into nameless pits.</p><p>The marble shifted silently, sliding open. He moved his flashlight about frantically.</p><p>He saw Madison, white-faced, as she backed away from the wall of crypts.</p><p>Sean cast the light in that direction.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve found Helena LaRoux,\u201d she said, her voice a raspy whisper.</p><p>His light fell on the body that dangled from a rope attached to a metal hook on one of the crypts. The hook had been intended to hold flower arrangements and had nearly bent with the woman\u2019s weight.</p><p>The other end of the rope was attached to the handles on a vault. The blood he\u2019d seen had apparently dripped from the slashes on her wrists. It appeared that Helena had come here, tried to slash her wrists but failed to do so deeply enough and then hanged herself instead.</p><p>But there was something really wrong with this picture, no matter how it appeared....</p><p>He walked to the body, reaching up to place two fingers against her throat, but he knew before he touched her that Helena was gone, cold as ice in the underground crypt. He moved away from her, not wanting to destroy any evidence.</p><p>She looked like a prop, like \u201cMatilda\u201d back in the conference room\u2014victim number one or any of a number of rubber, latex and wax deceased that they\u2019d made over the years at the studio. Except that she was real. She\u2019d been Helena, flesh and blood, but now, she was no more alive than a mannequin in the studio.</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d he shouted up. \u201cIt\u2019s Helena. I\u2019m going to get Madison out of here. Can you step outside and call Knox? Tell him he\u2019s going to need the M.E.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Madison was sitting at the rear of an emergency vehicle, a cup of coffee in her hand, a blanket around her shoulders. She was dirty but not hurt. It was difficult to convince them all that although she\u2019d taken a bad fall, she must have landed right. She hadn\u2019t broken anything. She hadn\u2019t even cracked anything. She\u2019d probably be sore the next day, but she was fine\u2014just anxious to leave.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t forget what she\u2019d seen. When Logan\u2019s light had first fallen on the crypts, she\u2019d noticed the shadow, more darkness in the darkness. And then the light had focused more directly on what was there in the crypt.</p><p>Helena, dangling from the rope, her eyes open, her skin white, just hanging there, the red around her wrists, blood congealing where it had dripped down the marble of the tombs behind her, and onto the marble slab she\u2019d used to jump off in order to take her own life.</p><p>Madison wondered if she\u2019d ever forget the sight of her open eyes.</p><p>Sean was in deep conversation with Knox and Logan as more and more techs arrived, suited up and looking as if they\u2019d come to contain a biohazard. The manager of the cemetery had joined them with members of his staff, and they seemed to be in shock.</p><p>Sean broke away from the group and came over to her.</p><p>\u201cDoes Eddie know yet?\u201d Madison asked.</p><p>\u201cMike Greenwood is on his way to Eddie\u2019s. He\u2019s going to give him the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she guilty, Sean?\u201d Madison whispered. \u201cIs that why she killed herself? We saw Lucas Claymore. He said she\u2019d been in the cemetery, talking on the phone, waiting\u2014as if she was going to meet someone here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan told me. And that adds to my feeling\u2014I just don\u2019t believe she killed herself. It doesn\u2019t seem like Helena. But her car is parked outside the wall, so she did drive herself here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were sure she wasn\u2019t bright enough to carry this off,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t think she was bright enough to carry any of this off,\u201d Sean remarked. \u201cBut the forensic experts will know more than I do. First, I don\u2019t see Helena crawling down into a basement tomb to kill herself. She\u2019d do it dramatically\u2014if she was going to do it at all. Secondly, I don\u2019t see her slashing her wrists or hanging herself. She would\u2019ve arranged a grand finale, beautifully decked out, and she would\u2019ve taken some kind of overdose. I don\u2019t believe this at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think her conspirator killed her?\u201d Madison asked. \u201cAnd that she was in on Jenny\u2019s murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she was in on it\u2014that\u2019s how she came to be here,\u201d Sean replied. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s the one who knew that Alistair would be here watching the movie, and that she\u2019s the one who knew Jenny was coming. I think she stole Eddie\u2019s elevator key and had a copy made. I don\u2019t think she committed the murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, she was in on Jenny\u2019s murder, but then her partner...decided she was a liability?\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cMaybe she was getting nervous because she found out we were going to question her down at the station, and she met with her partner to find out what to say. Or maybe her partner was nervous about her\u2014that\u2019s easy to believe. I don\u2019t think she was intended to be a victim at the beginning. Or maybe the killer figured he\u2019d get her, too, when he was ready. I can\u2019t help feeling she was involved. Why else do you drive to a cemetery and sneak in? But who knows\u2014we\u2019re still missing a piece of the puzzle. When this began, I suspect the intent was just to make Alistair go to prison for the rest of his life. But I think we\u2019re close to the truth now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying you know who the real killer is\u2014whoever actually carried out the murders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t know who else is involved. Obviously, with Helena dead, we won\u2019t be able to question her at the station and throw her off. But we\u2019ve found it\u2014the tunnel,\u201d Sean said grimly. \u201cI haven\u2019t taken it all the way through yet. I will once the tech people are finished down there. I\u2019m sure that tunnel goes to the studio. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s how the killer escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he leave Helena down there?\u201d Madison asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because he didn\u2019t want Helena found right away\u2014in case we didn\u2019t believe it was a suicide. But now that Helena has been found, Alistair could be released soon.\u201d He was thoughtful for a minute. \u201cI also assume the killer didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever find the tunnels. He probably figured we\u2019d go crazy trying to trace the tunnels through the studio, that it wouldn\u2019t occur to us to backtrack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you or Logan speak to the D.A. or the A.D.A. on the case? Alistair should be released now. I don\u2019t really understand the legal chain, but all they have to do is drop the charges against him, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be done before the judge,\u201d Sean said. \u201cIf they were to release Alistair\u2014or even announce that they were releasing him\u2014it could force the killer\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><p>Logan walked over to join them. \u201cKnox just told me they opened her car. She left a suicide note on the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cThere\u2019s a suicide note?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told. They\u2019ll test it forensically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to bet it was typed,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Logan nodded. \u201cForensics can try to match it to a printer\u2014and we\u2019ll start with the computers at the studio and Eddie\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see that note,\u201d Sean insisted. \u201cI need to know exactly what it said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Knox get it.\u201d</p><p>Sean turned back to Madison, as Logan hurried off. \u201cThe police will have to close the studio again, but the work can go on until the last minute. The whole place has to be closed until they really get a grip on what\u2019s going on underground.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow will they do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll bring in a score of engineers. We\u2019ve just got to find out how the killer\u2019s been using the labyrinth, get every bit of evidence from the tunnels before the engineers go down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen with the studio?\u201d Madison asked anxiously. She was worried sick about Eddie\u2014first Alistair and now his wife. But the studio meant a livelihood for so many people.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see,\u201d Sean told her. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Logan came back, bearing the letter Helena had supposedly written in a clear plastic evidence bag. Sean read it aloud.</p><p>\u201c\u2018I can no longer bear the guilt and the shame. I killed Jenny. I wanted more than you could give. Eddie, forgive me. May my death bring an end to what you are suffering, and may Alistair and God forgive me, too. Helena.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cBull,\u201d Sean said. \u201cHelena LaRoux did not write this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is dramatic,\u201d Logan murmured. \u201cAnd kind of sad. She asks Eddie, Alistair and God to forgive her\u2014but not Jenny, whom she killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because she didn\u2019t write the letter.\u201d</p><p>Knox approached the ambulance. \u201cAgent Cameron, Eddie Archer has heard what\u2019s happened. We really don\u2019t think he should come here. Mike Greenwood is with him at his house, and Eddie wants you there, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the medical examiner\u2019s taken the body and the forensics team\u2019s done, I want to get back in those tunnels. But I\u2019ll go over to Eddie\u2019s first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Madison asked.</p><p>Knox looked at her. \u201cYou should stay out of the way right now, Ms. Darvil. The teams will be busy for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Eddie want me, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Agent Cameron. You might want to go home and get some rest. Or, if you\u2019re up to it after crashing through the floor you could go to the studio,\u201d he said, \u201cMr. Simons has gone in. I still have men posted there. The employees know what happened.\u201d He gave her a white-lipped smile. \u201cFrom what I hear, it\u2019s a gossip fest. But the work\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Sean asked her.</p><p>\u201cClean up and go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll get Kelsey to take you back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>Eddie wasn\u2019t usually much of a drinker.</p><p>That day, he was. He didn\u2019t need to fight to save Alistair anymore; he couldn\u2019t save Helena.</p><p>When Pierce let Sean in, he found Eddie sitting on the sofa at the back of his beautiful house. The L.A. sun was shining brightly, casting a benign light on the pool behind the glass and the perfectly manicured lawn that surrounded it. Mike Greenwood was sitting in the chair across from the sofa, trying to lend what support he could.</p><p>Pierce, shaking his head sorrowfully at Sean, seemed anxious, worried\u2014and not at all triumphant that Helena had proven to be venomous.</p><p>Eddie looked at Sean with dazed, red-rimmed eyes. \u201cIt was Helena? You saw her? There was no mistake? It was really Helena?\u201d</p><p>Sean patted his friend\u2019s knee and sat next to Eddie. \u201cYes. I saw her. I\u2019m sorry, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe killed herself?\u201d</p><p>Sean hesitated. \u201cEddie, she was dangling from a rope. It was attached to the hook set into the crypt for flowers. She\u2019d also slashed her wrists, and she left a note.\u201d</p><p>Eddie nodded. \u201cThe police read me the note. I didn\u2019t buy it. Did you buy it, Sean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie,\u201d Mike interjected.</p><p>\u201cSean, did you believe it?\u201d Eddie demanded.</p><p>Sean inhaled on a deep breath. \u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cExcept...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What the hell are you trying to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie, it really looks like she drove herself to that cemetery. I think she was meeting someone.\u201d</p><p>Eddie gulped down his glass of whiskey. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to say that my wife is a murderer, that she killed a girl\u2014killed her!\u2014just to hurt me...to hurt Alistair. She\u2019s dead, Sean! Helena is dead.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. Anything he could come up with sounded lame. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Eddie. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Eddie rose, heading for the Scotch bottle again. \u201cBe careful what you wish for! That\u2019s what they always say. I wished desperately that my son would be freed. I did everything I could to bring in the FBI\u2014to find the truth and prove Alistair innocent. So now, supposedly, Helena wrote a suicide note claiming to have committed the crime. She cut her wrists, and when she didn\u2019t do that properly, she hanged herself. That\u2019s what the police say. And they think it\u2019s all over, that what she wrote is the truth...but it can\u2019t be. It just can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>Sean was silent.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more, isn\u2019t there?\u201d Eddie spun on him, whiskey sloshing precariously near the rim of his glass. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking a lot more than you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>Sean lifted his hands. He wasn\u2019t going to lie to Eddie. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Helena killed herself. But I do believe she was partners with whoever killed her\u2014and Jenny,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cThat\u2019s no comfort to you, I know.\u201d</p><p>Eddie let out a long shaky breath.</p><p>Sean\u2019s phone rang and he answered quickly. Logan was calling from the police station.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s something that might help Eddie,\u201d Logan said. \u201cThey\u2019re releasing Alistair. The D.A. was able to get before the judge and they\u2019re dropping the charges. The police will remove Alistair\u2019s ankle bracelet and he\u2019ll be free to go home.\u201d</p><p>He hung up. \u201cThe charges against Alistair are being dropped. You can bring him home, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>Eddie stiffened his shoulders, staring out at the yard but obviously not seeing anything. He shook his head slowly. \u201cAlistair is staying where he is. Someone\u2019s after my family. I\u2019m not letting them get to Alistair. They destroyed Helena, and they\u2019re trying to destroy me and the studio. I\u2019m not going to let them.\u201d</p><p>Mike stood. \u201cNo, Eddie, we won\u2019t let them ruin the studio,\u201d he vowed.</p><p>Eddie took a sip of his whiskey. \u201cSo, go back to work, Mike. You, too, Sean. Go get the bastard for me. Don\u2019t let the cops put it all on Helena, like they were trying to do with Alistair.\u201d</p><p>Sean glanced at Mike, and Mike looked back at him unhappily. \u201cEddie,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWe\u2019re all worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Eddie lowered his head. \u201cDon\u2019t be. Pierce is with me. I\u2019m going to go and stay with Alistair for a while. Don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019m not driving. Pierce will take me, and we\u2019ll stay together. We may be an odd family, but we are family. And I\u2019m all right. I\u2019ve got it under control. Mike, save the studio. Sean, get the bastard. Go\u2014do it, please. We\u2019re going to be fine, aren\u2019t we, Pierce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Eddie,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>There were still tears in Eddie\u2019s eyes. Because Helena was dead or because she had so bitterly betrayed him? Or both?</p><p>Sean rose to leave. Mike Greenwood followed suit. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, really,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cI\u2019ll take him to be with Alistair.\u201d</p><p>As Sean and Mike departed together, Mike whispered, \u201cPoor Eddie. Nicest damn guy in the world. And he fell for a manipulative bitch like Helena.\u201d He paused, raising his voice as they left the house. \u201cDo you think she really killed Jenny Henderson\u2014and then herself? You can be forced to write a suicide note, but no one forced her out of the house. There\u2019s an alarm. Pierce would\u2019ve protected her, not that he liked her himself, but she was Eddie\u2019s wife. Maybe she was going to the store and she was kidnapped\u2014yeah, that\u2019s possible!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think she was involved. How involved, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He stopped at the cars and looked back at Mike. \u201cYou\u2019re going to manage, keeping the studio open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as Andy and Eddie tell me to, I\u2019ll manage. Somehow. And, of course, as long as the police let me. Will they close us down again, do you suppose?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve closed the cemetery for the day, and a couple of cops\u2014as well as my team\u2014will hang around there. This particular investigation could go on for a while, so I don\u2019t expect that anyone will ask you to close, not for the next few days, anyhow. If at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going back to work,\u201d Mike said. \u201cSee you later, Sean. Thanks for becoming\u2014whatever it is you\u2019ve become in the FBI.\u201d</p><p>Sean watched him go. He remembered working for Mike Greenwood, a steady guy who never raised his voice. He was pretty sure Madison felt the same way. He waved to Mike as Mike revved his car, murmuring, \u201cI always was what I am now, Mike. I always was.\u201d</p><p>He slid back into the Prius and eased into traffic.</p><p>As he drove, a call from Jane advised him that Logan had arranged for a meeting with Oliver Marshall at the police station as soon as Oliver was finished shooting for the day. He expected to be available in about four hours.</p> <p>Sean mused that Oliver Marshall was heading into the glare of major stardom. Why would he be involved in a case like this?</p><p>But who ever really knew what drove another human being? Who could tell what perceived slights and wrongs motivated acts of vengeance or bitterness? And if Oliver wasn\u2019t involved, he still might know something they didn\u2019t.</p><p>How well had Oliver Marshall been acquainted with Helena LaRoux?</p><p>He hoped they were going to find out. But for the time being, he planned to get back down to those tunnels.</p><p>They were connected to the studio. He wanted to figure out just how and where. It was becoming evident to him that the killer had used the tunnels, certainly to make his escape.</p><p>The killer had known the studio backward and forward and had some connection to it. Helena had managed to get the basement key for the killer and she\u2019d probably been the one to reveal that Alistair would be at the Black Box Cinema\u2014and that Jenny would join him. Sean didn\u2019t just need to know who was familiar with the studio and the Black Box; now he also needed to know who\u2019d been privy to the information about Peace Cemetery.</p> <p>People were, naturally enough, tense. But whether anyone had tried to hush up the news about the discovery of Helena\u2019s body, Madison had no idea. She did notice that she wasn\u2019t included in most of the whispering among her coworkers. As they day wore on, she often caught them staring at her, and then quickly looking away.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help being aware of them as she worked on Oliver Marshall\u2019s costume with Alfie. He was holding the rubber shield in place on the shirt material while she stitched it in. Simple task, but because of the type of fabric and the need for perfect positioning so that Oliver and his stunt double could rip up his clothing and be clad as an Egyptian warrior, the work required two people.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s staring at you,\u201d Alfie told her.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think you\u2019re in the know,\u201d Alfie said, \u201cand, of course, you are. Scary. I would\u2019ve died! You found her\u2014ugh. Weird. Do you have, like, corpse radar or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlfie, I fell through bad flooring!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow weird! She left a suicide note in her car, then took herself down to some hidden crypts to kill herself. On the other hand, she never did seem really normal. No, wait, for Hollywood, she was normal, trying to play the climb-up-the-ladder game. I just don\u2019t get it, though. Can you imagine how she must have done this? Oh, but wait, she\u2019d definitely know Alistair\u2019s and Eddie\u2019s habits, what they were up to and stuff like that. She\u2019d know how to use the security equipment...maybe. I never thought of her as a technical genius. Actually, I never thought of her as a genius at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll never know now, will we, Alfie?\u201d she asked, looking up at him.</p> <p>\u201cSo, you think it\u2019s going to end? I mean, they\u2019re keeping the studio open. First, one corpse, and Alistair is arrested. Then Helena winds up dead! Of course, she was found in the cemetery, so that doesn\u2019t affect the studio, but it does affect Eddie. Wow. Who\u2019d a\u2019 thunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, it\u2019s been decided that the studio will stay open for the next few days while they explore beneath the church. After that, I\u2019m not sure. At least we\u2019re open for now, so let\u2019s get this done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And there are still cops in the studio,\u201d he said, lowering his voice. \u201cThey\u2019re guarding the elevator shaft. And Bailey\u2019s guarding the building entrance and marching around like a dictator, spying on everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re here. Makes you feel safe, right?\u201d Madison asked.</p><p>\u201cMadison, come on, give! You\u2019re sleeping with the FBI, for God\u2019s sake, you gotta know something that\u2019s going on!\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him, not really startled, but curious about how he\u2019d figured it out.</p><p>He just grinned at her, as pleased as the Cheshire cat.</p><p>\u201cAlfie, the FBI keeps a lot of things silent,\u201d she said. \u201cPersonal...relationships are irrelevant. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, and you keep easing up on the rubber and the fabric. Hold it tight, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He was quiet for a few minutes. \u201cCan we eat soon? Maybe send out for pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Alfie, we can eat soon.\u201d</p><p>By the time he returned to the cemetery, the body of Helena LaRoux had been removed and was on its way to the morgue. The crime scene techs were finishing up. No one currently with the studio was still at the site. After Kelsey had driven Madison to the hotel to change and then to work, Logan had sent her over to the hospital to stay with Eddie and Alistair. Logan himself had gone back to the cemetery. Jane remained at the police station, Kat was heading to the morgue and Tyler was at the studio keeping watch.</p><p>The cemetery director was beside himself; he\u2019d known about the crypts, but there hadn\u2019t been a burial or entombment there for fifty years. They hadn\u2019t sealed off access because the supporting structure might need to be repaired or reinforced at some point. Earthquake construction codes had been strengthened since the chapel was built. The managing offices for the cemetery weren\u2019t on the grounds but across the street. Police regularly patrolled the cemetery, which was closed to the public at dusk. They\u2019d had a few instances of vandalism but, perhaps thanks to the studio and the Black Box being where they were, they didn\u2019t even get a lot of kids breaking in to play pranks, and they\u2019d never had a case of grave-robbing.</p><p>Since the young cemetery manager was an emotional wreck, he was allowed to go back to work\u2014or home for a tranquilizer.</p><p>Logan and Sean waited, observing the crime scene techs going in and out, doing their last sweeps and bearing bags of dirt, twigs, possible footprints, fibers\u2014minute specks of anything that might lead to the truth.</p><p>As they watched, Logan asked, \u201cShe didn\u2019t speak to you, did she? Helena LaRoux, I mean. Was there any sign of her...still being here with us?\u201d</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cNothing. Doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes they don\u2019t stay.\u201d Logan shrugged. \u201cSometimes they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take a trip to the morgue later,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI really want to go into those tunnels, though. I\u2019m anxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019re getting the opportunity soon,\u201d Logan said as the lead investigator emerged.</p><p>Armed with his flashlight, Sean moved forward. Knox stood just outside the church. \u201cI\u2019ll keep two men on duty out here,\u201d he said. He offered Sean a radio. \u201cI don\u2019t think any corpses are going to rise up and attack you, but hell, these days... This radio should work anywhere in the region of the tunnels, the cemetery, the studio.\u201d</p><p>Sean accepted it. \u201cThanks, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to get in there before they bring in the engineers, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Sean said. \u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve shaken the tree, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Knox said. \u201cAnd LaRoux\u2019s note proves the kid wasn\u2019t guilty\u2014or crazy. I say go for it. But if any of those crypts cave in, it\u2019ll be on your head, not mine\u2014no pun intended.\u201d</p><p>Sean gave Knox a grim smile, and he and Logan entered the church again, hurried to the rear and down to the tunnels.</p><p>They took the stairs, pausing to study the false crypts that connected with the area where Helena had been found.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll lead. I\u2019m getting accustomed to the spiderwebs and crypt dust,\u201d Sean told Logan.</p><p>\u201cBe my guest,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re assuming that our killer entered the cinema from down here and exited the same way. So we have to find the path that goes toward the Black Box,\u201d Sean said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, but let\u2019s follow this route for a while. And keep an eye on the walls. I think we\u2019ll discover other false fronts\u2014walls of tomb \u2018shelves\u2019 that are really doors to other corridors. This was a major undertaking. What they were doing, or so I understand, was providing services for the poor and for illegal aliens. From what I\u2019ve heard, the old pastor really cared about people. I\u2019m sure he gave the family members a lot of solace.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d traveled carefully for almost an hour when Sean was startled by a voice on the radio. \u201cIt\u2019s Knox. Oliver Marshall is on his way to the station. Do you want me to interview him, or are you two coming in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of us needs to go,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cAnd no one should be alone down here. It\u2019s far scarier than any house of horrors ever devised by a master of illusion.\u201d</p><p>Sean grinned wryly. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Claymores were\u2014masters of illusion.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go back. We can spend the entire day tomorrow searching the tunnels,\u201d Logan decided. \u201cOr all of tonight, whichever you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnox, Logan and I are coming up,\u201d Sean said. \u201cYou\u2019ll keep men on guard here, right? We don\u2019t want anyone else slipping in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p> <p>There was nothing on the minds of anyone at the studio other than the discovery of Helena LaRoux\u2019s body. Speculation abounded. Some claimed they\u2019d always known that Helena was up to no good. Mostly, however, the speculation revolved around the business itself. Quite a few workers wondered if the business could possibly survive, if the producers and directors who contracted the studio to create the special effects for their projects would continue to do so.</p><p>Alfie ordered a pizza, then he and Madison had a late lunch with Mike in the conference room. While she\u2019d never been truly disturbed by any of their props before, Madison found herself studying \u201cMatilda,\u201d and feeling ill at ease. It was ridiculous, of course; she\u2019d attended meetings and eaten her lunch in the conference room dozens of times, and all she\u2019d ever felt was tremendous pride in the work the studio did.</p><p>Alfie finished his pizza and announced that he was going to the men\u2019s room, and he\u2019d meet Madison back at her station.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Eddie doing?\u201d she asked Mike when he\u2019d left.</p><p>\u201cI thought he was going to fall to pieces,\u201d Mike said. \u201cThen he suddenly pulled himself together. Eddie\u2019s going to make it. He was heartbroken when Alistair\u2019s mother died, but they were childhood sweethearts\u2014they really had a love match. I think Eddie\u2019s married for lust instead of love since she died. He\u2019ll get over Helena, especially if he finally accepts that she meant to ruin his life.\u201d He leaned over and gave Madison a hug. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to make it, kid.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Simons came in a few minutes later. He hadn\u2019t thought to order lunch and stared at the pizza longingly. \u201cThat\u2019s all leftovers,\u201d Madison said. \u201cHelp yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He joined them and wolfed down a piece, then looked at Madison and Mike. \u201cI just talked to Eddie. He\u2019s back at the hospital with Alistair. The D.A. has dropped the charges, thanks to the suicide note, but Eddie is staying with Alistair\u2014and they\u2019re both staying at the hospital. Eddie sounds like a cat with his tail caught in the door. He\u2019s suspicious of everyone. Including me,\u201d Andy added wearily. He raised his hands in a despairing gesture. \u201cI\u2019m his partner. We\u2019ve been together for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis wife is dead, Andy,\u201d Madison said. \u201cHe\u2019s in agony, and he can\u2019t accept the fact that Helena wanted to hurt him. He must be suffering humiliation, too, since he didn\u2019t have any idea of what she was doing.\u201d</p><p>Andy shrugged. \u201cYeah, I guess so. Well, I\u2019m going to take off. I want to get to the hospital to see Eddie and Alistair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive them my love, please,\u201d Madison said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d Andy promised.</p> <p>He grabbed the remaining two slices of pizza and left. \u201cBack to work,\u201d Madison said cheerfully. She glanced at her watch\u2014almost three. \u201cOliver\u2019s suit is just about completed. They can pick it up tomorrow. We already did his stunt double\u2019s version, so we\u2019re on schedule.\u201d</p><p>Mike smiled at her. \u201cThe monster is ready, too. We\u2019re supposed to go out on location soon.\u201d He seemed to brighten. \u201cWe\u2019ll hang on to The Unholy. Even if they close us down again, it\u2019ll be okay, since we\u2019re going to be on location.\u201d</p><p>Madison nodded as she gathered up the empty pizza carton and napkins and put them in the room\u2019s recycling bin.</p><p>As she headed back to work, she felt as if icy rivulets were snaking down her spine. She spun around and stared at the creatures in the circular area that separated the conference rooms from the elevator and stairs.</p><p>Something wasn\u2019t right. She studied the creatures standing there\u2014the werewolf with his golden eyes and dripping fangs, the beautiful evil witch, the victim with her one destroyed eye....</p><p>And then she saw movement.</p><p>A scream rose in her throat.</p><p>16</p> <p>\u201cYes, I am related to the Claymores\u2014and therefore the studio and the cemetery,\u201d Oliver Marshall said, sitting across from Sean in the interview room at the station. Like Benita, he seemed to realize that others were watching the interview. He waved to the mirror, as if waving to fans. \u201cSo, Helena is dead,\u201d he murmured, turning serious. \u201cSuicide? Who would\u2019ve figured?\u201d He looked at Sean, expression quizzical. \u201cDo you really think I could have had anything to do with this?\u201d he asked. \u201cI had an ancestor who owned it all, yeah, but none of it came to my family or me, and I never exploit the connection.\u201d He seemed earnest, courteous and polite.</p><p>\u201cOliver, we\u2019re checking out everything and everyone. In the stories you heard from your family, did anyone talk about the crypts underneath the church?\u201d Sean asked him.</p><p>\u201cSure. I never knew if what I heard was real or the kind of exaggeration you get when a story is told and retold over and over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I heard the underground was riddled with tunnels, but I didn\u2019t think that could be true! Someone would\u2019ve found them by now,\u201d Oliver said, grinning. \u201cThere\u2019s often a crypt under an old church, so I figured that part was true. And the original Claymore, the guy who first bought the property, was supposedly a real humanitarian. My dad said he arranged for real religious ceremonies for illegal aliens and poor people who died. Their families, if they had any, couldn\u2019t afford funerals or burials, so...\u201d</p><p>Sean changed his tactic. \u201cDid you ever work with Helena LaRoux?\u201d</p><p>Oliver frowned. \u201cYeah. Well, I never spoke to her on set. We were both in a pilot for a series called The Legal Way.\u201d He made a face. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t picked up by any of the networks. I was playing a character named Harper Mulligan. I was the brash P.I., flying beneath the radar while my partner was a by-the-book guy. Helena was a victim, killed before my character even comes on.\u201d He paused suddenly, going pale. \u201cWow, I\u2019d forgotten about that. It was several years ago. Eddie Archer was married to Benita Lowe at the time, and I actually remember there was a bit of work done at the studios. Eddie\u2019s team created some of the corpses for the show. I remember talking to Benita on set when she showed up with Eddie. I talked with her more than I did Helena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know she was related to Pete Krakowski, the bit player who was killed on the set of the original Sam Stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He nodded as he said that. \u201cWe talked about our associations with the place and the fact that while they could be discovered if you dug deep enough, we both preferred to keep them quiet. I\u2019m not sure why I did, other than that pride thing of wanting to make it on my own. And, of course, I doubted it would do anything for me. But Benita really didn\u2019t want anyone knowing about her relationship to Krakowski. She said he might be an ancestor of half the people she knew\u2014he was chronically unfaithful and a deplorable cheat. Pity. She and Helena seemed to be friends back then. But I guess Helena screwed her over, although Benita and Eddie split because of other differences. I never knew exactly what those differences were and they\u2019re none of my business. I\u2019ve never asked. But I know Benita did care about Eddie, and...\u201d He lifted his shoulders. \u201cBenita was honestly fond of Alistair, as well. I don\u2019t see her being involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, routine question, and you\u2019ve probably been asked by the cops already,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWhere were you the night Jenny Henderson was killed?\u201d</p><p>Oliver smiled. \u201cIn Las Vegas\u2014not having fun. We did some scenes on a set built out in the desert that night. We filmed until the wee hours, and that\u2019s something you can verify with dozens of people.\u201d</p><p>Sean stood and shook Oliver\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you for coming in, and thank you for all the help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can do anything... Archer\u2019s studio is great. So is Eddie. I don\u2019t want to work with anyone beside Madison\u2014she\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019ll help if I can. Just call me.\u201d</p><p>Sean joined Logan and Knox outside the interview room as Oliver left the station.</p><p>\u201cWhere do we go from here?\u201d Knox asked. \u201cYou really don\u2019t think Helena pulled the whole thing off, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Sean said firmly. \u201cThis is the second time we\u2019ve heard about Benita\u2019s feelings regarding Pete Krakowski. The guy was a cheat but what we should do is find out who he was cheating with. Trace back some family lines. I still say there has to be a reason somewhere in the past for these murders. And I think we need to uncover it quickly. We were supposed to find Helena\u2019s note\u2014but not her body. And if by some chance we did find the body, it was supposed to support the suicide theory, maybe prove that Helena knew about the catacombs. But we\u2019re still searching, so it must be obvious that we\u2019re not just saying, Wow, look at that, Helena\u2019s guilty. The killer has to be feeling a little desperate, and that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the workday is over,\u201d Knox said. \u201cThe studio will be empty except for our guys, the security guard and I\u2019m assuming you have a man there, too?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded. Sean turned to him. \u201cLogan, can you work with Jane and get on the computer, pull every resource we have, see what we can learn about Pete Krakowski? I need to know who he was having affairs with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKrakowski?\u201d Logan said. \u201cYou think it\u2019s a vengeance killing? According to Benita Lowe, his wife made a bundle. Sounds like he was no loss, and the family was happy to receive the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, his current wife, beaten and ignored and cheated on, might have been happy. But maybe he left someone in the dust. Maybe he had a mistress at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d be dead now or too old to pull this off\u2014 Oh, I see! You\u2019re thinking Krakowski had an illegitimate child?\u201d Logan asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. And that the illegitimate child had a descendent or descendents who grew up with feelings of hate and anger, believing that if Krakowski hadn\u2019t died, their lives might\u2019ve been different. That if he\u2019d lived, he would have divorced his wife, married the pregnant mistress\u2014if there was one\u2014or...whatever,\u201d Sean said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wild card, but Oliver has an airtight alibi...and Helena is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA legitimate child who didn\u2019t grow up with any kind of stigma might recognize that Krakowski was a womanizer and an alcoholic,\u201d Logan added, \u201cbut that he would never have divorced his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Benita learned that her great-grandfather was a cheat. That\u2019s what she was told, at any rate. And as you said, maybe an illegitimate child would teach his or her heirs that they would\u2019ve been legitimate and have everything\u2014if their ancestor hadn\u2019t been killed by carelessness on a set. Or murder...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you really think Krakowski was murdered?\u201d Logan asked him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a case that occurred well over half a century ago,\u201d Sean said, \u201cand it was generally accepted as an accident. We may never know\u2014but what matters isn\u2019t what really happened, it\u2019s what a certain person believes might have happened. Hey, even Bogie thought it could\u2019ve been murder. The killer seems to blame the Claymore studio, which did the special effects on the Sam Stone movie, not the Waterton film studio where the accident took place. And he doesn\u2019t care that Eddie, who had nothing to do with any of it, now owns Claymore\u2019s. At least, that\u2019s the only alternative I can see at the moment,\u201d Sean said. \u201cIt may be a long shot\u2014and it may be the right shot. But there has to be a connection. Helena was obviously an accomplice. However, she\u2019s dead, and I don\u2019t believe she killed herself. There has to be a second suspect, and he\u2014or she\u2014has an agenda. There\u2019s a good chance that agenda is connected to Krakowski.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get on the computer,\u201d Logan promised. \u201cI\u2019m pretty good at research, but finding out who a guy was sleeping with...hmm.\u201d</p><p>Sean grinned. \u201cJane will help you. She\u2019s good at reading between the lines. I\u2019m going to the studio now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do that. And when you\u2019re back at the hotel, maybe you can do some of your computer-whiz stuff and see what you can figure out, too. First, though, why don\u2019t you drive Madison home\u2014and maybe find out if Bogie knew anything about Krakowski\u2019s sleeping habits,\u201d Logan suggested.</p> <p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Sean assured Logan.</p><p>He thanked Knox and the other cops and said goodbye, leaving the station. As he did, he called Madison\u2019s cell number.</p><p>No answer. He tried Tyler\u2019s phone next; he did answer.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right there?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cThe employees are leaving. The day\u2019s ending a bit early but it seemed to go fine,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cMadison?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. Don\u2019t worry. She won\u2019t go anywhere without me. She had lunch with Andy, Mike and her assistant. All is well. Bailey is on the security desk, and the two cops are still in the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>Madison managed not to scream. The creatures in the circular hallway display weren\u2019t moving. Creatures didn\u2019t move unless they were radio-controlled or fitted with batteries and run by remote control or manipulated by a puppeteer.</p><p>It was Alfie, just standing there.</p><p>\u201cAlfie, what the hell are you doing?\u201d she demanded. For the first time, she felt acutely uncomfortable. His curiosity about her relationship with Sean had been almost salacious.</p><p>\u201cWaiting for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf the crew\u2019s gone home. I\u2019m...I\u2019m not happy out there alone,\u201d he said, wide-eyed. \u201cAre we still working?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do what you want, Alfie. I need to finish up that costume. I told Mike it\u2019ll be ready for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if he followed her or not. As she passed the guard station, she saw that Tyler Montague was there, watching the entrance, as if he was taking a tally of those who were coming and going.</p><p>She smiled at him and continued to her station.</p><p>As she neared her work area and sewing machine, she realized that Alfie was directly behind her. He shivered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Madison wasn\u2019t worried about being in the studio; Tyler Montague was on duty and there was a cop by the elevator on the first floor and another by the elevator on the second. Poor guys must be bored to tears, except that the cops switched shifts every eight hours.</p><p>Eight hours. They still had to be bored to tears.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t feel right,\u201d Alfie said. \u201cLet\u2019s go home. I\u2019ll walk you to your car. Oh, wait! You\u2019re not going home\u2014you\u2019re waiting for the studly FBI guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlfie, I\u2019m going to finish this costume,\u201d she said again.</p><p>Alfie sighed. \u201cFine. I\u2019m staying with you.\u201d</p><p>She began to work on the shirt, and Alfie moved closer, holding the material tightly. He was good at what he did, a great assistant, sensing what she needed before she needed it.</p><p>Her cell phone rang. Alfie jumped. She nearly stuck the needle in his finger.</p><p>\u201cAlfie!\u201d she said, finding her phone, which she\u2019d placed on the sewing machine. \u201cYes?\u201d She saw Tyler Montague\u2019s name on her caller ID.</p><p>\u201cMadison, it\u2019s Tyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you still in the building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out. Sean\u2019s on his way here. Colin Bailey just got a call from him, saying that something\u2019s going on in the cemetery. Bailey asked if he needed any help and apparently he wants me out there. But you\u2019re fine. Bailey is on the security desk, and there are two cops in the building. Stay inside, okay?\u201d Tyler\u2019s voice was calm and assured. Madison felt her heart leap, but she made an effort not to let Alfie see that she was in any way concerned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Alfie and I are finishing Oliver\u2019s costume,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks for checking in.\u201d</p><p>Madison hung up and looked around the studio, and noticed that Alfie was fidgeting and acting concerned. \u201cWe\u2019re the last ones here tonight, huh?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be working so late. I\u2019m losing it. I think I saw the rat moving,\u201d Alfie said.</p><p>\u201cThe rat did not move, Alfie!\u201d His unease was actually making her feel better. She laughed. \u201cHey, finding you in the middle of those mannequins by the conference room didn\u2019t do much for my blood pressure.\u201d She gestured over to the wall and smiled. \u201cOnce again, the rat didn\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Alfie asked. \u201cOn the phone, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler,\u201d she answered. \u201cHe wanted me to know that Sean\u2019s on his way back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Alfie said. \u201cWhen he gets here, can we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlfie, you can go anytime you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. When Sean gets here, I\u2019ll go,\u201d she told him, although she suspected that his concern was as much for himself as her.</p><p>He confirmed that a moment later, asking, \u201cMadison, do you think the G-man who\u2019s still here will walk me to my car?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. She wasn\u2019t sure why she hadn\u2019t told Alfie that Tyler had gone to the cemetery.</p><p>Was she afraid\u2014of Alfie? And yet he seemed genuinely fearful.</p><p>\u201cHelp me for a few more minutes. Then Sean will be here, and we\u2019ll all go.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, the studio was suddenly pitched into darkness.</p><p>Alfie let out a yelp of terror, and Madison gripped his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Alfie. Give it a second. The auxiliary lights will come on.\u201d</p><p>They did. They bathed the studio in a pale yellow that was deeply shadowed by the distorted shapes of creatures they\u2019d constructed over the years. There were no windows in this interior section of the studio. No glimmer of natural light.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Alfie whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Madison bit her lower lip, fighting fear. In her drawer was a large pair of scissors. She slipped her hand in and curled her fingers around them.</p><p>\u201cAlfie, we need to lie low somewhere,\u201d she said urgently.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>She thought quickly. Bailey should have been on the desk and there were two cops in the building somewhere. The question was\u2014who else might be in here?</p><p>\u201cGet into Oliver\u2019s Sam Stone costume and hat. Then you can look like a mannequin. Everyone knows we\u2019ve been working on this all day. Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can see us! They can see us through the cameras!\u201d Alfie wailed.</p><p>\u201cNot if we\u2019re on the floor. Drop down and crawl to the dressing area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will you be?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cRight behind you,\u201d she said. \u201cRight behind you!\u201d</p><p>Sean had loved living in L.A., but as he drove to the studio, he remembered one thing he\u2019d hated about it.</p><p>Traffic.</p><p>The rush hour in California seemed to start at 5:00 a.m. and end at...5:00 a.m.</p><p>Annoyed by the traffic, he called Tyler again, using his hands-free device.</p><p>Tyler answered, sounding equally annoyed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m doing out here, Sean,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still a pack of cops by the church. I\u2019ve gone over there, but they say nothing\u2019s changed. They\u2019ve been watching the grass grow all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cBailey sent me out here\u2014he said you wanted me at the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>Fear shuddered through Sean\u2019s heart. \u201cI didn\u2019t send you anywhere. I didn\u2019t call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell!\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI should\u2019ve known! But Bailey said you called\u2014it must\u2019ve been someone pretending to be you, someone who wanted to make sure I went out. Dammit, I should\u2019ve phoned you myself to confirm. I\u2019m heading back, Sean. Oh, shit!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe studio just went dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew traffic. I\u2019ll be there in five minutes,\u201d Sean said.</p> <p>He hit the gas pedal, moving illegally onto the shoulder. If the cops wanted to come after him, they could chase him to the studio.</p><p>Manipulating the wheel, he tried Madison\u2019s number.</p><p>There was no answer. He flattened his foot on the gas pedal. His phone rang. He answered it, praying that Madison was returning his call, that there\u2019d been a power short, that she was with one of the cops and whoever had called Bailey pretending to be him had been caught.</p><p>The call wasn\u2019t from Madison. It was Logan.</p><p>\u201cYou were right, Sean,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI found a reference in an old magazine\u2014or Jane did, I should say. Krakowski had an affair that hit the tabloids in the late 1930s. He was seeing a woman named Elissa Sinclair. And you\u2019ll never guess who she married or the name of her grandson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me!\u201d Sean screamed. \u201cAnd get the police over to the studio. Now!\u201d</p><p>Madison was on the floor, slithering over to the curtained area, when she heard her phone ring.</p><p>She\u2019d left it back on the sewing machine.</p><p>Cursing her luck\u2014and trying to tell herself that it was just a power failure\u2014she kept slithering across the floor. Someone could be watching them from any of the cameras, so she didn\u2019t dare go back for her phone.</p><p>Where was Sean?</p><p>Alfie was ahead of her. \u201cKeep going!\u201d she told him.</p> <p>He did. He was ready to do anything she said.</p><p>She froze when she heard a voice coming over the speaker system. She didn\u2019t recognize it. The sound was distorted, low-pitched and seemed to be male.</p><p>\u201cMadison, yes, it\u2019s me, and I\u2019ve been watching you, and you\u2019ve ruined everything. I haven\u2019t got much time, so don\u2019t make things any more difficult. Come out...come out...and your little friend might live.\u201d</p><p>Alfie kept going. She paused. Was he going to die because of her?</p><p>But Alfie looked back, his eyes glittering with fear\u2014and courage. \u201cCome! Come, now!\u201d he urged her.</p><p>She caught up with him. They made it behind the curtain, where she found the rest of Oliver\u2019s Sam Stone costume. If she could get Alfie dressed and standing completely still, she could distract the killer.</p><p>And then what?</p><p>Hide, get away. The person who wanted to kill her knew the studio well\u2014but she knew it just as well. And she had an advantage.</p> <p>She was desperate to save her life.</p><p>\u201cAlfie!\u201d A chuckle followed the calling of his name. \u201cCome on, Alfie! Do you want to die for her\u2014Eddie\u2019s favorite? You know, you could be the favorite. It will be all over tonight. It\u2019s Madison. She ruins everything. Don\u2019t die for her.\u201d</p><p>Behind the curtain, a terrified Alfie pinched her, and she wondered at the courage that was making him stay silent, even in the midst of his fear. \u201cYou keep quiet! He\u2019s not going to get us both!\u201d Alfie whispered. \u201cSean\u2019s on the way. Keep quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet dressed,\u201d Madison hissed. \u201cPlease, Alfie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe a word he says\u2014he\u2019s killed twice already. He\u2019ll kill me, too. You have to save yourself, Madison,\u201d Alfie said. There were tears glistening in his eyes. It was dark behind the curtain, but she could tell that he was nearly crippled by fear.</p><p>\u201cGet into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta get the jeans off,\u201d he said.</p><p>She helped him tug down his jeans while he ripped off his T-shirt. In the meantime, she dug through the costumes left piled on the floor, offcasts from various other projects. She found some kind of material, thought it might be the widow\u2019s costume from the Western they\u2019d done the scaffolding for. It was. Her fingers fumbled with the fasteners but she managed to get into it. She felt something silky\u2014a wig. She crammed it on her head as Alfie reached for a hat.</p><p>She nodded, gesturing with her chin to indicate that he should slide against the wall and freeze. He looked at her, shook his head and tried to fix her wig. It was a long black one. After a moment, he seemed satisfied.</p><p>\u201cMadison, Alfie, come out to play....\u201d</p><p>The disembodied voice wasn\u2019t coming over the loudspeaker anymore. It was in the room with them.</p><p>And it was very close.</p><p>Tires squealing, Sean drove into the parking lot, cursing that they\u2019d missed the obvious from the start.</p><p>He got out of the car and looked at the studio. The auxiliary lights had come on, making the place appear ghostly and indistinct. He hurried to the door; when he couldn\u2019t open it, he threw his shoulder against it without success.</p><p>He peered through the window at the entry, trying to figure out why he couldn\u2019t budge the door.</p><p>And then he knew.</p><p>A man lay blocking the way. A man in uniform. One of the cops.</p><p>Blood was trailing over the floor and a knife protruded from his back.</p><p>He was coming nearer and nearer. In a minute, he\u2019d find the two of them cowering behind the curtain. Madison groped on the floor for the scissors she\u2019d brought with her. She hardly dared breathe.</p><p>She heard the footsteps of their stalker approaching. He was just beyond the curtain. She rose slowly to her feet, ready to pounce, hoping to wrap the curtain around him, at least blind him with it, and then slam the scissors into his back.</p><p>Her phone started to ring a second time, and their stalker paused.</p><p>He was just standing there, listening. But then she heard him laugh. He was on the move again.</p><p>\u201cMadison, Madison...come out to play!\u201d</p><p>She wrenched at the drapery, ripping it downward and throwing it at him. She slashed with the scissors and he fell back, the drapery falling on top of him. Her scissors caught in the fabric and fell on him, too.</p><p>She started to leap forward, ready to attack. But their stalker was almost up. Alfie grabbed her, pulling her back. \u201cNo, run! Run now! He\u2019s got a knife!\u201d</p><p>She ran with Alfie. The man was still down, only his large hand, the knife clearly visible, emerging from the fabric.</p><p>\u201cOut the front, out the front!\u201d Alfie shrieked.</p><p>They ran along the hallway, headed for the front door.</p><p>Madison saw the dead cop blocking the door. \u201cNo!\u201d she cried. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to move him.\u201d</p><p>They tore down the hallway; he\u2019d be there any minute. He was still coming toward them. They could hear his harsh breath, his heavy footsteps. She shoved Alfie into the first conference room.</p><p>\u201cStand there! Just stand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison, no! Don\u2019t do it!\u201d</p><p>But she was already moving, making sure she was heard. She stopped at the second circular display, slid in between a robotic cop and a vampire. She breathed slowly and shallowly, looking behind her.</p><p>He came...walking slowly. He didn\u2019t know where they were. He paused, staring into the first conference room. Madison stood very still. If he saw Alfie...</p><p>He peered inside, and then came back into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cAh, Madison...you\u2019re here...somewhere!\u201d he said.</p><p>She saw him. Saw him in the yellow glow of the auxiliary lights, and he was more frightening that anything the mind could create. He wasn\u2019t transformed by makeup; no latex could ever change a man from a calm and friendly demeanor into such a demented monster.</p><p>It was so hard to believe.</p><p>He paused. \u201cMadison!\u201d he said. \u201cI know you\u2019re there!\u201d</p><p>He went into the second conference room.</p><p>Madison turned and ran. There was only one escape. She ran to the elevator. For a moment, she panicked; she needed the key!</p><p>But the key was in the lock. She twisted it, and the elevator brought her down to the tunnel.</p><p>Heedless of the dead, she raced through it.</p><p>Sean tried to stay calm, running to the car for a tire iron, and then back to the door, swinging as he approached it. The window shattered; he reached in and broke the lock, and shoved with all his might. As he did so, Tyler came pelting down the road. They didn\u2019t try to talk\u2014they burst through the doorway, pushing the body of the dead man out of the way.</p><p>\u201cMadison!\u201d Sean shouted her name loudly.</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the main work area,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the conference rooms.\u201d</p><p>As he sprinted down the hallway, he suddenly heard a shout. A man in costume came bursting out of one of the conference rooms. Sean reached for his Glock.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d came a screech. \u201cSean, it\u2019s me, Alfie\u2014we dressed up and went in different directions. He\u2014he walked right by me. He kept going...he tried the next room. Then he heard the elevator. Madison would\u2019ve taken the key...wouldn\u2019t she? He couldn\u2019t...he couldn\u2019t have gotten to her...he couldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has his own key!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come, I\u2019ll come...I\u2019ll help you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlfie, go wait by the entrance. Find the other guard. He must be patrolling the perimeter. Go on, find anyone! Tell the cops and everyone else where we\u2019ve gone\u2014into the tunnel. Get them down there fast!\u201d</p><p>Alfie, a comic book hero for real, dashed toward the studio\u2019s front door.</p><p>Sean tore past him, out of the entry and to the Black Box.</p><p>Madison charged through the museum to the rear of the Sam Stone exhibit. She nearly tripped over a cobra as she made her way through the mannequins. She was just about to rush down the hallway to the cinema when he burst in behind her, leaping over the jackal and landing a few feet away.</p><p>For a moment, she was frozen, staring at him in horror. He carried a knife, but he had a gun, as well.</p><p>He smiled at her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBailey, what are you doing? It\u2019s over! I don\u2019t know what kind of agreement you had with Helena, but you were stupid to kill her and rig it as a suicide.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, angry, still a few feet in front of her. All she had to do was stay alive, she told herself. Help would be coming. All she had to do was stay alive until it did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t stupid. Helena was an idiot. As long as everything went smoothly, she was fine. But in an interrogation room? She\u2019d have spilled everything, would\u2019ve lied and said it was all my idea, and she\u2019d have walked\u2014and I would\u2019ve gone to prison for the rest of my life. No, Madison. I\u2019m sorry you were so instrumental in my downfall. You\u2019re a decent kid. But I should have guessed. You know things you\u2019re not supposed to know. You...well, it\u2019s your fault. Yours and that fed\u2019s. Who the hell knew Eddie wouldn\u2019t believe the cops, that he wouldn\u2019t accept what was obvious? Involving you and the damned feds, finding the tunnels\u2014\u201d He broke off, chuckling. \u201cFinding the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Bailey. I talk to the dead,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019ll have friends to talk to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cVengeance,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cI am Vengeance! They seem to think the new Sam Stone movie, The Unholy they named it, is going to be such a brilliant piece of work! They don\u2019t care\u2014just like they didn\u2019t care back then!\u2014that a man died. Murdered. I heard the rumors. Pete Krakowski was murdered. No one sought justice. So, when you can\u2019t get justice, you\u2019ve got to get something else. Vengeance\u2014and I am Vengeance. You still don\u2019t understand? I was pretty sure your G-man was getting close to the truth. Pete Krakowski. Yeah, he was killed on the set. I knew the truth, you see. The wiring was faulty because of the effects they were using\u2014they\u2019d wired the mummy, and it came to life. But they screwed it up\u2014the wiring was loose, and the power shot through Krakowski. I call that murder!\u201d Bailey\u2019s eyes never left her. \u201cHe was in love with my grandmother. They should\u2019ve been married, and if they had been, she would\u2019ve seen that his death was avenged. This place should\u2019ve been mine. The widow got all the money\u2014and my grandmother got nothing but directions to the soup kitchen. People whispered about it being murder, and that it was Claymore\u2019s fault. They didn\u2019t let Pete live to divorce his wretched, whining wife and marry the woman who loved him, who would have avenged him. She would\u2019ve taken the studio for all it was worth. And it should\u2019ve been mine, and I shouldn\u2019t have been sitting at a guard desk all these years\u2014yes, sir, no, sir, can I help you, sir\u2014no, I shouldn\u2019t have been. Alistair needed to go to jail, because Eddie needed to know what it was to lose everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBailey, that is the most messed-up thinking I\u2019ve ever heard!\u201d Madison said. \u201cAlistair is just an honestly nice young man. Jenny didn\u2019t do anything to anyone. And Eddie was loyal to you.\u201d She stared at him, knowing that she shouldn\u2019t be making him angry. \u201cEddie isn\u2019t a Claymore\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a Claymore, no. But you know who would\u2019ve been next? When Alistair was on his way to jail? Oliver Marshall, that bastard. I would have gotten to him. And Eddie\u2019s whore of an ex-wife. Benita Lowe\u2014the bitch who badmouths her own blood.\u201d</p><p>Madison suddenly realized that he\u2019d planned more, so much more....</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you did all this. You were on duty. But you\u2014not Helena\u2014killed Jenny. Helena met you in the tunnel, right? You weren\u2019t on camera because you\u2019re the one who was trusted to watch the cameras. There was a time discrepancy on the video. Two minutes were missing from the clock in the workroom because you had to stop the camera to steal the Egyptian priest\u2019s cape. Helena had gotten you the key to the basement and she was keeping you informed of Alistair\u2019s schedule. She listened to gossip, and she knew that Jenny was coming to see him. Then she met you at the site to hide the robe. She escaped through the tunnels\u2014into the cemetery. Meanwhile, you\u2019d taken care of the murder weapon, hiding it in the canopic jar.\u201d Madison took a deep breath. \u201cYou know the system so well, you could freeze all the tapes at exactly the same time\u2014so perfectly that not even a forensic expert could tell what you\u2019d done\u2014and back them up so no one ever knew you\u2019d left your position. You did that in the video room behind the desk, then ran around to the front\u2014and there you were, Alistair\u2019s sympathetic savior when he regained consciousness and came looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was still a locked-room mystery, Madison. It should have stayed that way,\u201d Bailey said.</p><p>She was startled when she heard another voice, one she hadn\u2019t expected.</p><p>\u201cKeep him talking, kid. We\u2019re here. We\u2019ll help you when we can\u2014when we figure out how we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Bogie,\u201d she whispered. He was there; her resident ghost had made it here to help her. Jenny Henderson, as nervous-looking as a toy poodle, was standing slightly behind him. They were in the Casablanca exhibit.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bailey said.</p> <p>She\u2019d unnerved him, and she hadn\u2019t even done it intentionally. Maybe he was feeling the cold some people felt when a spirit was around...or the creeping sensation of another presence that seemed to raise the hair on a person\u2019s neck.</p><p>Bailey turned. It wasn\u2019t enough for her to make an escape, but he turned.</p><p>He stared back at her. \u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBogie is here. You know\u2014Humphrey Bogart. I told you I talk to the dead. And Jenny\u2019s here. Jenny Henderson. The girl you killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true! It\u2019s time for you to die. The cops will be here soon. I may go down, but you\u2019re going down with me.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her. She jumped back into the exhibit, standing behind the mannequin of Sam Stone. When Bailey tried to reach her, she thrust the mannequin toward him. He tripped backward, but righted himself. She looked at the sarcophagus, ready to shove that in his direction next.</p><p>But before she could do so, the mannequin of Humphrey Bogart came flying out of the Casablanca exhibit. It didn\u2019t go far, but it hit the ground, surprising Bailey. He drew his gun and shot at it. She counted the shots. She didn\u2019t know anything about guns. How many bullets did he have?</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Who\u2019s there?\u201d he demanded, searching the exhibit.</p> <p>Another mannequin came flying toward him\u2014Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund.</p><p>Bailey started shooting again.</p><p>And then he turned the gun on Madison. She screamed and leaped behind the sarcophagus, her heart thundering.</p><p>A bullet...a clean kill...better than a knife across her throat?</p><p>But then she heard a shout from the living. Sean had arrived.</p><p>\u201cBailey! Drop the weapon now!\u201d</p><p>He was racing in from the Black Box, Glock in hand, aimed at Bailey.</p><p>Bailey whirled around, gun raised.</p><p>\u201cDrop it!\u201d Sean yelled.</p><p>Bailey didn\u2019t.</p><p>Sean fired.</p><p>Bailey fell back, a spill of blood spreading on his shirt.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a coward.... But her knees were so weak.</p><p>She was barely standing by the time Sean stepped over Bailey and the fallen mannequins, pushed aside the sarcophagus and drew her into his arms.</p><p>That was when her knees failed completely. He swept her up and carried her from the tableau, and as she fell against his chest, she was exhausted and safe and...in love.</p><p>It was just like a movie.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Madison awoke feeling a sense of luxury and comfort that was wonderful.</p><p>The sheets were an incredible blend of silk and cotton, cool to the touch, sensuous against her skin. The drapes at the large lanai windows were moving with the slight breeze, and the sound of the waves and the ocean were just beyond them.</p><p>Best of all, of course, was the man beside her. Sean, naked and strong, his arms creating a haven, a sanctuary. It felt so right. In the long run, of course, she couldn\u2019t live in a Hawaiian paradise; Ichabod was at home. Alistair was taking care of him, and when she returned, she was also taking Helena\u2019s little designer lapdog\u2014mutt, as Sean called him\u2014and she loved having her pets.</p><p>But for now...</p><p>She opened her eyes, trying to see if he\u2019d awakened. He had. He was watching her with amusement, lips curved in a smile.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d She sighed luxuriously and smiled up at the ceiling fan.</p><p>Eddie Archer really was a great friend.</p><p>With the studio closed while the tunnels were cleaned out and sealed and the dead within them reinterred in peace, her work was on hold. Next week, she\u2019d be heading out to the desert on the outskirts of Las Vegas, and Sean would follow the members of his team to Chicago. Something strange was going on in Lake Michigan; people Sean had worked with in Texas had begun a documentary on shipwrecks in the Great Lakes, and in the midst of their work, a diver had mysteriously died.</p><p>She bit her lip, worried about him, and then realized it was what he did, and if she wanted them to fashion a life together, she\u2019d have to accept that, just as he understood her love for her own work.</p><p>His mind was apparently moving in the same direction. \u201cYou really think you\u2019ll be able to take a three-day weekend after the action sequences are filmed on location?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBut you\u2019re taking a few days first to meet me in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were brilliant as he looked at her and smoothed back a lock of her hair. \u201cI learned once upon a time that we all need a focus in life, but that focus has no meaning if we can\u2019t remember that life is really about people, the people who are most important to us. People we might come across only once in a lifetime. Twice if we\u2019re lucky. And when you get a second chance, you don\u2019t blow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would go anywhere for you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with me now.\u201d He smiled and kissed her, and the fan continued to whir and the breeze to wash over them. His kiss deepened and he moved against her, his body as sleek as the sheets, and the kiss naturally segued into much, much more....</p><p>Later, they went to lie on the beach. They\u2019d already spent long hours with the team and with each other, retracing every moment of the case, trying to understand how a person\u2019s mind could seize on injuries of the past, even the distant past, and become crazed by them. \u201cHatred is so often taught,\u201d Sean had said. \u201cBe it against an individual or a group.\u201d And she thought he was wise in that assessment. They\u2019d talked about the fact that when they were ready, when they had a family, they would take the greatest care to see that their children learned tolerance instead of hatred. That had been an especially nice conversation, because they were still shy with each other. They didn\u2019t bandy the word love about easily, so when he\u2019d first whispered, \u201cI love you,\u201d she knew it was real, and that it was for a lifetime. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Their Hawaiian conclave was exclusive, a really wonderful present from Eddie, and they should have been alone, completely alone, so naturally Madison was surprised when she felt the air and the sand stir. Someone was approaching them.</p><p>She glanced up. Bogie was coming along the beach; he looked as if he was ready to film the sequel to The African Queen.</p><p>Jenny walked beside him, close, but as a daughter would be close.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d Sean said, standing and dusting sand from his swim trunks. \u201cI thought you hated to travel. This is a very long way. You\u2019re welcome here, of course,\u201d he added huskily. Madison knew that Sean believed Bogie had saved her life, far more than he had himself. And he was grateful.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready to go,\u201d Bogie said.</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d Sean asked him, puzzled.</p><p>Jenny smiled, slipping an arm through Bogie\u2019s. \u201cI think Bogie\u2019s right. We stay for a reason, a purpose. No matter how long it may take for that reason to come along, or what that reason may be. We\u2019re almost sure we\u2019ve fulfilled our purpose. So we came out to be with you until the sun sets, and then...well, there\u2019s nothing like a Hawaiian sunset. We decided that might be the time to see if...if there\u2019s another light.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Madison thought Bogie would argue. But he didn\u2019t. They were spirits, visible to no one but them. Then again, they were alone on a beach, so what was real and what wasn\u2019t didn\u2019t seem important.</p> <p>Sean spread another blanket, and Bogie and Jenny joined them on the sand, and they spent the day talking about good things, Bogie laughing about incidents on set, Jenny enthralled by his tales of the past. Sean and Madison listened eagerly, as well; they\u2019d never hear these stories again.</p><p>Then the sun began to fall in the west. The sunset was striking and beautiful, shot through with what seemed like a hundred shades of gold and red and mauve.</p><p>A light seemed to burst brilliantly as the rest of the sky faded.</p><p>Bogie turned back to Madison. \u201cHere\u2019s looking at you, kid.\u201d</p><p>Tears sprang to her eyes as Bogie reached for Jenny\u2019s hand, and they walked toward the light. Then they walked through it and were gone.</p><p>Sean pulled Madison close and touched her cheek gently. \u201cAnd now,\u201d he said softly, \u201cto life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo our lives,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>They walked through the sand and the softening breeze of the night back to their cottage, and the time they could seize together before the journey that lay ahead.</p><p>Before the journey and during it. Now and forever. </p> </body></html>"]
