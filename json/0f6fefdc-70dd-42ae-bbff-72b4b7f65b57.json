That was The End, right? The hard part was over. It was smooth sailing now. I lay in bed next to my handsome, celestial Prince Charming, the tropical breeze blowing through the window screens of our little Caribbean hut, waiting for the sun to rise so I could begin my wedding day.</p><p>Funny how Happily Ever After isn\u2019t the end after all ...at least, not when Hel is trying to kill you.</p> <p>That trivial little fact was easy to ignore with the light rain tapping the tin roof, and the palm fronds brushing against our casita as the wind gently pushed its way through the trees. The first glimmers of sunlight danced along the ceiling as translucent dashes of warmth. Those shuddering, glowing dots above me were the first thing I saw when I opened my eyes. Jared Ryel was the second. He smiled, waiting for my eyes to focus.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tomorrow,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Splatters of pinks and purples had just breached the windows, and the rain had all but left us for the bigger island, reduced to droplets. The fading purple splotches on Jared\u2019s forehead, cheek and chin stood out in the early light, and they brought back a flood of memories from the days before.</p><p>He and I had already survived the impossible\u2014coming face to face with one of the most frightening beings in Hel and a few hundred of his minions, human and demon alike. Simply celebrating another day would have sufficed. That was the moment realization hit, and Jared\u2019s eyes brightened with amusement as my sleepy expression perked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s today?\u201d I said softly. I reached up to touch his skin, and the residual marks from his skirmish with Shax.</p> <p>Jared pushed himself onto his elbows, and then leaned his head closer to my stomach. \u201cGood morning, little Bean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBean?\u201d I said, one eyebrow shooting up.</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s no bigger than a bean. That\u2019s what the book says, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe book.\u201d</p><p>Jared reached to the floor, pulling up a thick book, its cover dripping in hideous pastel colors and childish writing.</p><p>\u201cI thought I should be prepared for anything that might come up.\u201d Jared flipped through the pages, and then peered up at me, waiting for approval.</p> <p>\u201cIs there a chapter on balance-disrupting angel babies?\u201d I said, grinning when Jared\u2019s eyebrows pushed together.</p><p>He tossed the book to the floor and then playful y situated himself over me, nuzzling my neck.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d I squealed, making a poor attempt to push him away. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop if you say it,\u201d he said, his voice muffled against my skin.</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d I laughed, wiggling in vain.</p><p>Jared lifted his head to look me in the eyes. \u201cBean,\u201d he said, his eyes a soft blue-gray.</p><p>I pressed my lips together, forming a hard line, but when he tickled me again, I caved. \u201cOkay!\u201d I pleaded. \u201cBean!\u201d</p><p>A wide grin spread across his face. \u201cI wish I\u2019d known how wel this tactic of persuasion works on you three years ago. Life would have been somewhat easier.\u201d</p> <p>I swatted at him, knowing he would duck. \u201cNot fair.\u201d</p><p>Jared kissed my lips, his warmth soaking into my skin. It didn\u2019t seem as warm as usual, but I attributed it to the tropical heat raising my own temperature.</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s not fair? I don\u2019t get to see you until this afternoon.\u201d He left me alone on the bed, pulling a white T-shirt over his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said, pushing up on my elbows.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get dressed, sweetheart. We\u2019re expecting company in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompany?\u201d</p><p>Jared tossed a tan summer dress to the bed, and I scrambled to put it on, knowing better than anyone that Jared wasn\u2019t mistaken about things like time. I pul ed my hair into a messy ponytail, and then stood awkwardly while Jared opened the tin door. A line of vil agers made their way to our casita, led by a frazzled-looking Beth. She held a white garment bag, and when her eyes met mine, her smile widened to its limit.</p><p>\u201cBeth!\u201d I said, rushing down the steps. Mud squished between my bare toes as I ran to her, enveloping her in my arms. Her auburn hair was damp, plastered to her forehead and cheeks. She was sweaty and red-faced, trying to catch her breath as Chad pul ed the garment bag from her fingers.</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t let anyone else carry it,\u201d he said, shaking his head. He held the bag out for Jared, but Beth quickly grabbed it back, smacking his hand away.</p><p>\u201cJared can\u2019t see it!\u201d she said. She held the long bag up, away from the mud, but behind her to protect it from Jared\u2019s hands.</p><p>Jared was amused. \u201cI won\u2019t look, Beth. I\u2019m going to take Chad to the chapel now. You two have the whole day.\u201d</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised\u2014Jared could arrange anything\u2014but I was speechless. Beth and Chad had arrived just eight hours after us.</p><p>\u201cHow did you...?\u201d I began.</p><p>Jared\u2019s smile widened. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken care of everything. I didn\u2019t want you stressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe...?\u201d I frowned, more confused.</p><p>\u201cMom is waiting for me at the chapel. See you there.\u201d He grinned from ear to ear. I\u2019d never seen him so happy. He leaned down to kiss my cheek, and then gestured for Chad to fol ow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve maneuvered a motorcycle before?\u201d</p><p>Chad paused. \u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a drive.\u201d Jared patted Chad on the shoulder, encouraging him along. Poor Chad seemed total y out of his element. Even though the men weren\u2019t that close, I had ful confidence in my husband-to-be to make Chad feel at ease. That responsibility would serve as double duty to soothe Jared\u2019s nerves.</p><p>\u201cWait \u2018til you see this dress!\u201d Beth squealed, pulling me inside. She hooked the bag onto a wooden lip above the closet, and then rubbed her sore shoulder. \u201cIt was a long, muddy walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I nodded. \u201cWould you like me to get some ice for your shoulder?\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s eyes lit up again. She pul ed down the zipper of the garment bag, turning to me.</p><p>I blinked in disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s the...um...\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s eyes were wild with excitement. \u201cThe dress from the magazine that you picked out two years ago? Yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...how is it here? How did he....\u201d</p><p>Beth couldn\u2019t wait for me to spit out the words. \u201cI have been hanging on to this thing for ever! Can you believe it? Lil ian brought it to the apartment.</p><p>She said you had picked it out, and Jared bought it, and they made me bottle this up for two years! It was awful! Why do you think I hounded you about a wedding date all those times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... why?\u201d</p><p>Beth nodded. \u201cI know, right? That\u2019s what I said. His mom said he was excited; he wanted to surprise you, blah, blah, blah. I personal y think he just wanted to torture me because it\u2019s been hell.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop staring at the flowing, silky whiteness in front of me. I remembered sitting on our couch in the loft while I healed, thumbing through magazines with Lil ian and pausing on a picture, unable to turn the page. It was just days after I was discharged from the hospital, the day Claire left to eliminate all the humans that threatened us. A dress identical to the one I showed a partisan interest in almost two years earlier dangled from a hanger just feet from me.</p><p>\u201cBeth?\u201d I said, stil staring at the dress.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to take it down a few notches. I\u2019m feeling a little overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s head bobbed quickly, and then she took a seat in the corner. After a deep breath, she began again, \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I almost asked Beth if she knew why Lil ian didn\u2019t keep the dress at her house, but it was a foolish question. Beth was safe. No one would blow up her apartment, or bust through her windows in the middle of the night\u2014and it would give Jared an extra all y in vying for a wedding date.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s bril iant,\u201d I said, in awe.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Beth gripped her knees and bit her lip, struggling with every passing second. \u201cAre you stil overwhelmed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling better.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward in her seat, quickly losing the fight to remain composed. \u201cI brought two bags overflowing with makeup, hairspray and curling irons. I think I have every size known to man. I can make big barrel curls, or little spiral curls. If you don\u2019t want curls I brought a flat iron....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take a Valium. I\u2019ll take a shower...wait. Is it ridiculous that I don\u2019t know what time my wedding starts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne o\u2019clock. We have plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, grabbing my robe and a towel. I couldn\u2019t imagine how difficult the wait must have been for her. It was endearing and disturbing at the same time.</p><p>Under the warm stream of the casita\u2019s humble shower, it wasn\u2019t difficult to let go of any anxiety. Birds sang to each other from the branches of the palm trees, and the sounds of the ocean gave away its close proximity. Feeling stressed in paradise was wonderful y impossible.</p><p>\u201cDid you want an up-do? I brought bobby pins just in case!\u201d Beth cal ed.</p><p>\u201cNot listening!\u201d I said, massaging shampoo into my hair. I wondered if she was curious about Jared\u2019s fading bruises, or if she\u2019d even noticed.</p><p>Surely Chad would. If they spent the morning together, eventual y he would see them. Jared would explain them away, but if Beth asked me about them and I told a different story, it would complicate things. It was easy to convince her that I needed a bodyguard\u2014she\u2019d witnessed my run-in with Mr. Dawson, after all . Unless it was due to training, Jared\u2019s bruises were a tel tale sign that I had been in danger. Two years of experience told me that Beth was too preoccupied with wedding details, so I put that worry to the back of the line.</p><p>Thinking of Jared\u2019s bruises made the rest of his face form in my mind, and suddenly I couldn\u2019t get out of the shower fast enough. It made me feel anxious to wait so long before I was all owed to see him again.</p><p>I rushed into the casita in my towel, my hair dripping wet, and slipped on the sleeves of my robe.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going for a walk,\u201d I said, slipping on a pair of sandals.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you\u2019re not. We have a day\u2019s worth of primping to do in just a few hours! Get your backside in this chair, young lady!\u201d Beth said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute,\u201d I said, waving her away. I swung open the door of the casita to find Bex standing in my way.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he smiled. \u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for a walk,\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have some girly things to do? You\u2019re getting married in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cAre you here to keep me captive?\u201d</p><p>Bex mirrored my expression. \u201cNo, Paranoid Schizo. Your guardian-slash-almost husband is across the island, and you and your unborn baby are two of Hel \u2019s Most Wanted. I\u2019m here to keep you safe. If you wanna leave, leave. I have to walk with you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, feeling sil y. \u201cOkay, then. I want to leave.\u201d</p><p>Beth grabbed my wrist, a hair dryer in her other hand. \u201cI jumped on a plane at a moment\u2019s notice. I rode a boat across an unknown body of water \u2014in the pouring rain. There is mud caked under my newly painted to nails, and I\u2019m pretty sure a bird crapped in my hair on the walk here. I\u2019ve endured all this to come here and help you get ready for a wedding that I\u2019ve kept a secret for two years. You can give me a few hours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay! You\u2019re right, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. I fol owed Beth back into the casita, sitting in the chair she\u2019d placed in front of a makeshift salon counter.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Bex said, sitting on the bed. \u201cGirls are crazy.\u201d</p><p>The counter was covered in wires that led to various hot irons, makeup, brushes, curlers, combs and hair products. The black wires were hooked into an orange extension cord that led outside to the solar-powered generator Jared had rigged outside. The mess of wires were an eyesore, but at least we had power without the annoying drone of a gas-powered generator. Beth brought several lamps to make up for the limited natural light filtering through the windows, and a manicure and pedicure kit. A large camera also sat among the clutter, beside two packages of fresh memory cards for her camera.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Beth,\u201d I said. The planning alone had to have been time-consuming.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what best friends do.\u201d</p><p>After hours of combing, scrubbing, powdering and polishing, I was final y ready to slip on my wedding dress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll step outside,\u201d Bex said. \u201cI need some fresh air, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d I smiled. \u201cNo tel ing what that much hairspray wil do to a young man\u2019s lungs.\u201d</p><p>Beth waited for Bex to leave, and then sighed. \u201cWe have to wait to put on your dress,\u201d she said, fidgeting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d I said. I took a step toward my dress, but Beth ran around me, holding her arms up and out, shielding the dress from my hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not! I\u2019m not joking. We\u2019re waiting.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re losing it, Beth,\u201d I said, sitting in the chair in a huff.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m used to being in the dark for the most part, but on my wedding day, I would like to be in the know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Beth said, thick with regret. \u201cIt\u2019s just that....\u201d</p><p>A smal knock at the door immediately changed Beth\u2019s demeanor. \u201cComing!\u201d she said, relieved.</p><p>Cynthia stood in the doorway. As usual, her face was devoid of emotion. \u201cWel ?\u201d she cal ed behind her. \u201cPut my things in the adjacent building.</p><p>Thank you.\u201d Her tone was opposite her words\u2014also her usual. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMother,\u201d I said, surprised.</p><p>She wore a champagne-colored sheath dress. Even after marching through a tropical rain shower and the mud in six-inch heels, her dress and matching shoes were immaculate. Her hair was pul ed back into its usual tight French bun, making her eyes even more severe when she pul ed of her sunglasses and huffed.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for my lateness, Nina dear. I had several functions to reschedule, since my presence was demanded at such late notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Beth and I said at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cWel ,\u201d she sighed. \u201cYou are my only daughter. We do what we must.\u201d I smiled, and Cynthia took the few steps to offer a cold embrace. The awkward gesture was the most she could offer; knowing that made me appreciate it more than others might have. She quickly let go, and offered a polite smile. \u201cYou look wonderful, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I was just about to step into my dress....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Wel , then, I\u2019ll just step out,\u201d Cynthia said.</p><p>I fidgeted. \u201cWould you mind helping?\u201d</p><p>Cynthia hesitated. \u201cEr...Isn\u2019t that why Beth is here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Beth smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia\u2019s eyes scanned my dress and its yards of white silk, and clouded with tears. \u201cOh, my,\u201d she whispered, pulling a tissue from her purse.</p><p>I was taken aback. Cynthia rarely cried. In fact, she\u2019d only found two occasions in my lifetime for it, and both had more to do with my father.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mother,\u201d I said, hesitating to find an appropriate place to comfort her. I settled on her shoulder, patting awkwardly a few times.</p><p>She sniffed once, lifting her chin to ward off the uninvited emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Silk Charmeuse wrinkles so easily.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>After one last dab at her eyes with the tissue, she turned. \u201cBeth best assist you, darling. Cal for me when you\u2019re dressed.\u201d She closed the door behind her, and I turned to Beth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Beth whispered. \u201cI thought...I waited for her because I thought she\u2019d like to be involved. I should have known better. Now you both just feel awkward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was worth a try. One never knows with Cynthia. She might have been insulted if I hadn\u2019t asked, so you did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYou did. Now help me get this thing on, and let\u2019s not let it wrinkle. I don\u2019t want to upset my mother.\u201d</p><p>Beth nodded, and careful y pul ed the dress from its hanger. \u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Promises</p> <p>\u201cShe was right,\u201d Beth said, tears in her eyes. \u201cIt does wrinkle easy.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, staring at my reflection in the ful -length mirror Beth had brought for the occasion. The woman staring back at me was soft and mature, draped in the muted sheen of silk and chiffon. Beth wasn\u2019t human after all ; only magic could have transformed me into the elegant, graceful creature in the mirror.</p><p>Soft, blonde curls caressed my shoulders, and just a hint of blush and pink lip gloss reminded me that I had makeup on at all . Beth had spent hours making sure that I appeared timeless and natural.</p><p>Beth clapped her hands together and held them tight to her chest, as impressed at her work as I. \u201cJared is going to crap!\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI knew eventual y Oklahoma would break free from the professional East Coast stylist role you\u2019ve played today!\u201d</p><p>Beth gathered the tools she used to transform me, rol ing wires and putting the various bags of makeup into the different tubs the vil agers had carried to the casita. I stood in place, afraid to move. The realization hit that the church was miles away, across a muddy jungle, and I was wearing white.</p><p>I blanched. \u201cOh, God. Cynthia wil stroke out if this dress is soiled before the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she can get here without a speck, I\u2019m sure she can get you to the church mud-free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d I nodded, trying to relax.</p><p>\u201cI wish Kim could be here,\u201d Beth said, shaking her head. \u201cI cal ed her, but she\u2019s out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. This was very sudden.\u201d I hated lying to Beth, especial y while she was being the poster child for a best friend, but I already knew Kim wouldn\u2019t be at my wedding. She was two hospital rooms down from Ryan, nursing wounds she\u2019d sustained when Isaac had sent her flying across the cathedral of St. Anne\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t right that she had saved my life, and instead of being at her side, I was primping in a tropical paradise.</p><p>\u201cShe did say to tel you to not worry about her. She said she\u2019s fine and she wants you to enjoy your day...why would you worry?\u201d Beth said. Her question was a second thought, as if it hadn\u2019t crossed her mind until that moment.</p><p>\u201cWhen do I not worry about her?\u201d I said, fidgeting with my dress.</p><p>Beth thought for a moment. \u201cTrue,\u201d she agreed, carrying on with tidying up the room. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to grab your mom, and then I\u2019m going to get ready. If you need anything, I\u2019m just a casita away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth?\u201d I cal ed.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said, spinning around.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I smiled. \u201cFor everything.\u201d</p><p>Beth returned my smile. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Beth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said. She was clearly impatient about getting to her casita.</p><p>\u201cThink I could sit for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Beth said, rushing to fetch me a chair. \u201cHere. This one has a back on it so you can relax. Thirsty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment. You are the best maid of honor, ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she beamed. She backed out of my room, shutting the door on her wide and excessively proud smile.</p><p>With Beth\u2019s absence the room became uncomfortably quiet, but I didn\u2019t feel alone. I looked down to my stomach. Bean was invisible, nestled under the fabric of the dress I would wear to marry her father. I placed both of my hands above my bump, and smiled. Would Bean know he or she was a guest at our wedding? The thought of a tiny body inside of me with a fancy dress or tux on made me giggle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d Cynthia said as she entered the room. \u201cCertainly not the sight of you. You\u2019re a vision.\u201d I smiled and stood so that she might get a better look. \u201cI\u2019ve arranged for a car. Wel , not so much a car as a beat-up truck, but it wil get us to the chapel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered how I would get there and keep my dress white.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia frowned. \u201cI didn\u2019t say it wouldn\u2019t be difficult. I\u2019ve considered wrapping you in plastic. It wil take all of us along with a concentrated effort, but it can be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Again, a deluge of emotion caught Cynthia off-guard, and she furiously searched through her purse for a tissue. Before the first tear could pour over her lashes, she dabbed it away. \u201cI\u2019ve never,\u201d she said, annoyed. \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t continue throughout the day.\u201d</p><p>I rested in the chair and Cynthia sat on the bed, seeming uncomfortable and out of place, yet she remained cordial and poised. She brought up appropriate subjects such as the weather, and stayed far away from anything that might induce another onslaught of tears. We shared a few polite laughs, and I silently prayed that Beth would return sooner rather than later.</p><p>\u201cDing dong!\u201d Bex said, opening the door. \u201cThe truck is less than a mile away. You ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>Beth popped in behind Bex. Her smile lit up the room. She was stunning in her French blue cocktail dress, and for the first time since I\u2019d met her, she actual y looked like the former beauty queen that she was. Her lips were stained a wine color, and her short auburn hair was wavy and soft instead of sticking out in every direction. \u201cOh, good!\u201d Beth squealed as the engine grew louder upon the truck\u2019s approach. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Bronco! It has a back seat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d I said, minding my mother\u2019s expression as I gathered my skirt.</p><p>The trip from my chair to the door was uneventful, but the preparations for me to step outside into the murky jungle were firmly coordinated by my mother. Cynthia barked orders at Bex, Beth, and the driver. Bex lifted me and held me away from his body\u2014at Cynthia\u2019s request\u2014to keep from wrinkling the dress further. Beth and Cynthia held any protruding pieces out and away as Bex made his way to the truck, and then help spread the fabric while he lowered me to the backseat. Cynthia\u2019s tactic worked. I was seated atop a clean blanket, and my dress remained untouched by the jungle.</p><p>Bex led us to the chapel on a dirt bike, while Cynthia commandeered the passenger seat. Beth squeezed against the door to my right to give the dress plenty of room.</p><p>\u201cYou are all being a little ridiculous about this dress. Once I get out of the truck, the wrinkles wil fal ,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible. What wil you do if mud is splattered on it? Have you found a dry cleaner on the island?\u201d Cynthia asked.</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Within half an hour, the truck was bouncing over familiar cobblestone streets. My heart pounded against my chest when the chapel\u2019s steeple appeared above the palm trees, and I could barely restrain myself from bursting from the truck and running inside when the fountain, and then the wooden double doors came into view. Jared was inside, and the wait had already been an awful test of my patience.</p><p>Beth lightly touched the top of my hand, and only then did I realize I was tapping her knee.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d she said, pulling at the door handle.</p><p>Bex stood on the walkway with a wide grin on his face. \u201cYou look good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, touched by his sentiment.</p><p>\u201cAl right, enough chitchat. We\u2019re not in the church, yet,\u201d Cynthia said, orchestrating another transfer. She lifted the hem of one side of my dress while directing Beth to lift the other, and together we climbed the steps.</p><p>Inside, Lil ian waited. Once recognition hit, her eyes lit up, and she clapped her hands together, quickly bringing them to her mouth. \u201cOh. Oh my goodness,\u201d she said, tears glossing her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re even more beautiful than I imagined.\u201d She looked to Cynthia. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you,\u201d she said, hugging her old friend.</p><p>\u201cAs it is you,\u201d Cynthia said with a warm but demure smile.</p><p>Lil ian blotted her eyes with a tissue and shook her head. She looked upon me with pure love and adoration. She had always regarded me with an adulation that I never quite understood, but the look in her eyes was new to me.</p><p>\u201cMay I seat you?\u201d Bex said to Cynthia, offering his arm.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d she said, walking with Bex into the church.</p><p>Lil ian watched them disappear behind the door, and then leaned into my ear. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve waited for this moment. You\u2019ve always been family, Nina. I can\u2019t explain it,\u201d she whispered. A sweet, innocent laugh escaped her throat. \u201cSome nights, after Jack and Cynthia took you home after I\u2019d make you all dinner, I would cry.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows popped up. Lil ian was always so candid about her feelings for me. Even so, her words surprised me.</p><p>\u201cGabe used to shake his head. He always thought me to be irrational when it came to you. But each time you left my home, I felt I was letting my daughter go away to live with someone else. I must sound crazy. It sounds sil y to say out loud. I...I just wanted to tel you how happy it makes me that after today...I can cal you my daughter.\u201d</p><p>I hugged her to me. The intensity of emotion in the room was overwhelming. I didn\u2019t hear crazy. Lil ian\u2019s words sounded like love.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no...,\u201d Beth said, pulling a tissue from her purse. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. Your mascara is waterproof, but it\u2019s not magic. It could smudge.\u201d She careful y dabbed under my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re only marrying the man of your dreams soon. What\u2019s to cry about?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>The music sounded. Beth handed me an exquisite bouquet of pink and white tulips, winked at me, and then slid out of the double doors to take her walk. I stood alone in the vestibule, in my dress, holding my favorite flowers\u2014the same Jared presented me on our first date. I was amazed, then, at the coincidence. Now it just made me smile. Why he was ever nervous about whether I would fal in love with him was a mystery. Not only was he the most thoughtful, most selfless and loving person I knew, he was also armed with the knowledge of all my likes and dislikes. He was more armed to win me over more than any man could any woman. The tulips were perfect. Jared had sent me this very bouquet many times over the course of our relationship. It just occurred to me that these flowers had also been sent to me before our relationship; on birthdays, my high school graduation, and I remember feeling comforted by a wreath at my father\u2019s funeral bearing the same flowers. Jared had never mentioned it before, but I knew they were from him. That thought made me smile. He had loved me for a long time, and now I was about to walk down the aisle of our chapel, on our island, to pledge my eternal love to him. Life had never felt so right.</p><p>I thought about my father, and wished he were next to me. I imagined him in a smart tuxedo with teary eyes, fawning over my dress and how beautiful and grown up I looked. As a little girl, I imagined him giving me away at my wedding, and now he would have to do it from Heaven.</p><p>\u201cI know you can see me, Daddy,\u201d I whispered, closing my eyes.</p><p>Suddenly, I was no longer alone. Someone was beside me, with an arm hooked around my elbow.</p><p>\u201cHope you don\u2019t mind a wedding crasher. Jack sent me,\u201d Eli winked and tightened his grip.</p><p>\u201cN-No,\u201d I said, shaking my head. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do this.\u201d He stretched his neck and shoulders. \u201cLooked like fun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, as the wedding march began to play in the chapel.</p><p>\u201cReady, kiddo?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, and took a deep breath. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>Both doors swept open, held by two young local boys, and our smal audience stood.</p> <p>Eli leaned into my ear. \u201cYou are breathtaking, by the way.\u201d He took a step, and I fol owed his lead. Together we walked slowly down the aisle.</p><p>The sanctuary was a bit dim, with beams of sun breaking through the windows and spotlighting the different faces of our friends and family. The dust motes slowly floated in and out of the sunshine, delicate and graceful. I saw Jared\u2019s Uncle Luke, first. I was surprised to see him, and it must have showed, because he and his wife Maryse chuckled softly at my expression. I was glad to see Chad sitting next to my mother, although it wouldn\u2019t have occurred to her to feel...wel , anything...I didn\u2019t want her to be alone. Lil ian, Luke and Maryse sat together in the first of the heavy, wooden pews, paral el to Cynthia and Chad. Luke whispered something into his sister\u2019s ear, and Lil ian nodded, taking a deep, satisfied breath.</p><p>And then, I saw him. Jared stood next to Bex at the head of the chapel, at the top of a few steps that lead to the pulpit and the rest of the stage. Eli waited before he took a step, sensing that I had stopped in my tracks. Jared was dressed in a khaki suit with a white-button-up shirt. The top button was undone, and he skipped the tie. He looked perfect, and his bright blue-gray eyes were locked on me, over a slightly nervous, beaming smile.</p><p>Without thinking, I took a step, now anxious more than ever to be next to him. Eli picked up his pace as my feet insisted on placing the rest of me next to the man I loved more than life itself. My love for Jared surpassed needing normal, enough to conquer fate and beat death. In that moment I couldn\u2019t fathom why I had waited so long, and I wanted to be nowhere else but in that chapel, making the easy promise to love him forever.</p><p>The reverend was short, swal owed by his officiant\u2019s gown. His brown skin was dul and wrinkled, but his kind smile brightened his face. He spoke in a thick accent. \u201cHel o, Nina. I\u2019m Father Julian.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, my gaze returning to Jared.</p><p>\u201cWe gather here, in the presence of God and this company, that Jared and Nina be united in holy matrimony. We here to celebrate and share in glorious act that God is about to perform\u2014the act by which He converts their love for one another into holy and sacred state of marriage.</p><p>\u201cThis relationship is honorable and sacred, established by our Creator for welfare and happiness of humanity, and approved by Apostle Paul as honorable among all men. It is designed to unite two sympathies and hopes into one; and rests upon mutual confidence and devotion of husband and wife. May it be in extreme thoughtfulness and reverence, and in dependence upon divine guidance, that you enter now into this holy relationship.\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t take his eyes from mine. Just a few feet away from him, Father Julian stepped down to meet me. He looked to Eli, and spoke with a thick accent, \u201cBeing assured that your love and your choice of each other as lifelong companions are in God's wil and that you have your families\u2019 blessings. I now ask. Who gives this woman to be married to this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Eli said with confidence. He spoke for my father, for Cynthia. He might have even spoken for Gabe, but I felt Heaven was smiling on the moment.</p><p>Eli lifted my hand to his lips and kissed my knuckles, and then took Jared\u2019s hand, placing his gently under mine. With a smal , tender squeeze, Eli left us alone at the bottom of the steps, disappearing behind the double doors he had just helped me through.</p> <p>Jared raised an eyebrow, a permanent smile etched on his face. \u201cThat was unexpected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack sent him,\u201d I said, feeling my eyes gloss over.</p><p>Jared touched my face once, and then the reverend spoke again. This time his voice blurred into the background as I watched the blues and grays of Jared\u2019s eyes shine in ways I\u2019d never seen them. His expression was relaxed and nervous; happy and concerned; every emotion he\u2019d ever felt col ided inside of him in a beautiful display of the barely noticeable shifts in the skin around his eyes and mouth. No one could have noticed it but me, and I read each one as he struggled with a lifetime of duty, and the relief of hearing me promise myself to him.</p><p>\u201cJared Ryel?\u201d Father Julian said. \u201cAre you ready to enter into this marriage with Nina Grey, believing the love you share and your faith in each other wil endure all things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Jared said simply.</p><p>\u201cNina Grey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d</p><p>Our smal audience laughed at my haste. Jared chuckled as wel .</p> <p>Father Julian regrouped, and then finished his part. \u201cAre you ready to enter into this marriage with Nina Grey, believing the love you share and your faith in each other wil endure all things?\u201d</p><p>I waited for the minister to correct his mixup, but he never did.</p><p>I nodded quickly. \u201cTo Jared Ryel. Yes. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Father Julian didn\u2019t skip a beat. \u201cNina, do you take Jared to be your wedded husband? Promise to love him, to honor and cherish him, in joy and in sorrow, in sickness and in health, and to be to him in all things a good and faithful wife as long as you both shal live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Father Julian repeated Jared\u2019s vows. The closer he came to the end, the tighter Jared\u2019s fingers were around mine. Final y, when it came time for Jared to speak, he didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>\u201cYes, and after that,\u201d Jared said. \u201cFor a thousand years, and then a thousand more...I wil love you.\u201d</p><p>A smile stretched across my face. His hands were cupped around mine a bit too tight, and his body leaned into mine eagerly. This was the moment he had waited for, and he seemed to want to take it all in and rush it at the same time so nothing could keep him from it. That moment in time was the light switch in a dark room, the doorway at the end of a scary hal way. It was anything and everything that had ever saved anyone.</p><p>Father Julian closed his eyes. \u201cFather in heaven, You ordained marriage for your children, and You gave us love. We present to You Jared and Nina, who come this day to be married. May the covenant of love they make be blessed with true devotion and spiritual commitment. We ask that You, God, wil give them the ability to keep the covenant they have made. When selfishness shows itself, grant generosity; when mistrust is a temptation, give moral strength; when there is misunderstanding, give patience and gentleness; if suffering becomes a part of their lives, give them a strong faith and an abiding love. Amen.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes to see Jared looking at me with total love and devotion, more so than I ever saw in the proud eyes of my father.</p><p>\u201cWhat token do you give to perform your vows?\u201d</p><p>Bex opened his hand, and Jared plucked a white gold band from his brother\u2019s palm.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Jared said softly. He closed his eyes, thought for a moment, and then looked into my eyes. \u201cWhat can I say to you that I haven\u2019t already said? What can I give you that I haven\u2019t already given? Is there anything of me that isn\u2019t yours already? My body, my mind, my heart, even my soul.</p><p>Everything that is me belonged to you long before this, and it shal be yours long after this. I wil fol ow you anywhere and everywhere you lead. I wil keep you and anyone created with our love safe from all harm. From this day on, I choose you, my beloved, to be my wife. To live with you and laugh with you; to stand by your side, and sleep in your arms; to bring out the best in you always, and, for you, to be the most that I can. I promise to laugh with you in good times, to struggle with you in bad; to wipe your tears with my hands; to comfort you with my words; to mirror you with my soul; and savor every moment, happy or sad, until the end of our lives and beyond.\u201d</p><p>A long pause fol owed Jared\u2019s words. No one moved; an awe-inspired silence swept the chapel as everyone took in his breathtaking promise.</p><p>He took my hand, and slipped the ring onto my finger. It glided over my skin, and rested next to my diamond engagement ring, as if it was returning home.</p><p>\u201cD-do you,\u201d Father Julian stuttered, \u201cNina, have a token to perform your vows?\u201d</p><p>I turned to Beth, whose mascara streaked her cheeks. She opened her hand to reveal Jared\u2019s simple wedding band. I took it from her, and turned to face him.</p><p>He grinned, waiting on my promise. I had thought about my vows many times after we decided to write our own. Our relationship had never been traditional, so we chose to make our promise to each other unique to us. I took a deep breath. Nothing I would say would be nearly as articulate and beautiful as what he had said, but I knew wel enough by now that he would love every syl able.</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d I whispered. I held his hand, and then placed the ring around the tip of his finger. \u201cI choose you as my best friend, and my love for life. I promise you my deepest love, my ful est devotion, my most tender care...through the pressures of the present and the uncertainties of the future, I promise to be faithful to you. It wasn\u2019t until just now that I recognize that this wasn\u2019t coincidence, or a battle. We were always meant for each other.</p><p>Our love is heaven sent, and I promise to honor that forever and always. From this day forward, you won\u2019t walk alone. My heart wil be your shelter and my arms wil be your home.\u201d</p><p>The mixed emotions scrol ing across Jared\u2019s face disappeared; the only one left was happiness. I pushed his ring over his knuckle, and he squeezed my hand.</p><p>Father Julian put his hand over ours. \"What God has joined together, let no man put asunder. Jared and Nina have consented together in holy matrimony, and witnessed the same before God and this company, have pledged their love and loyalty to each other, and have declared the same by the joining and the giving of rings. By the authority of the state, I pronounce that they are husband and wife.\" A smal sigh emanated throughout the chapel, and Jared let out a breath of relief, fol owed by a smal smile.</p><p>\u201cKiss your wife,\u201d Father Julian said with a smile.</p><p>Jared cupped my cheeks, looked into my eyes, and then pul ed me to him, touching his soft lips to mine. He kissed me gently at first, and then wrapped his arms around me, his lips forgetting everyone and everything around us. We were married. He was my husband, and I was his wife.</p><p>He pul ed away. His eyes brimmed with tears, and he looked as overwhelmed with happiness as I felt. I pul ed him to me by his shirt to kiss him one last time.</p><p>\u201cI now present to you, Mr. and Mrs. Jared Ryel,\u201d the minister said loudly.</p><p>Jared's smile faded, and he gritted his teeth.</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d he said, closing his eyes.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Trial</p><p>The inside of the chapel darkened. The sunlight coming through the windows dimmed, but it was early afternoon. The air around grew cold and stale. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. Fearing the worst, I was desperate for a mundane explanation. \u201cA storm?\u201d</p><p>Jared's eyes darkened. \u201cI'm sorry.\u201d</p><p>The sound of the tropical winds that regularly blew against the building was noticeably absent, and soon the only light was the dim flickering of a few sconces along the wal s of the church. I shot a nervous glance over my shoulder at our friends and family below. They were frozen in time.</p><p>I quickly walked down the stairs, with Jared just behind. My movement didn\u2019t faze the smal crowd, and I gasped, fal ing to my knees. \u201cLil ian?\u201d I said, reaching out.</p><p>Her hands were folded daintily in her lap, a smal smile suspended on her face. I stood and took a step to the next pew, realizing in horror that the living statues' eyes were all stil fastened to the space where Jared and I once occupied.</p><p>\u201cBeth?\u201d I whispered, reaching out to touch her cheek. Her skin was stil warm. \u201cShe\u2019s not breathing,\u201d I said, looking back to my new husband. Bex stood at Jared's side. He frowned before looking to his brother. Only the humans were affected.</p><p>\u201cHe must have claimed a grievance,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cShax?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cMichael...for murdering his son.\u201d He closed his eyes and took my hand, holding it against his chest. \u201cNo matter what happens, Nina, stay with Bex,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Where are you going?\u201d I said. He took a step toward the double doors of the chapel. With my free hand, I grabbed at the fabric of his jacket. \u201cJared,\u201d I whispered. His demeanor terrified me.</p><p>The double doors opened, and Eli stood in the entrance, his expression blank. \u201cI'm sorry, Jared. This can't wait.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded, and then tilted his head to the side, speaking under his breath. \u201cDon't speak, Nina. Let me handle this.\u201d</p><p>I agreed without words. Jared led me through the doors, to the top of the chapel steps. The sky was black, the darkness filtering down to surround our chapel. Several dark forms stood in formation at the bottom of the stairs. Jared continued. With each step closer to the unknown, my heart seemed to be punching through my chest. Final y, I was face to face with Jared\u2019s accusers, but they remained a mystery. Their faces were obscured by the hoods of black cloaks. If they were angels, they were much more frightening than any I\u2019d encountered.</p><p>Eli stood on the other side of Jared, waiting patiently for something, but I knew better than to ask. After a few moments the black forms parted, and two figures, differing dramatical y in size, walked forward. Eli made a subtle motion with his hand, and the air around the smal assemblage created its own light, leaving a muted glow. I glanced at him from the corner of my eye, and he winked at me. I was the only one unable to see clearly through the darkness. Eli lit the surroundings solely for my human eyes.</p><p>His consideration set me somewhat at ease. He won\u2019t let anything happen to us, I thought.</p><p>Any feeling of comfort offered by Eli\u2019s smal gesture didn\u2019t last long. The two forms were now recognizable, and a lump formed in my throat at Claire's nervous expression as she walked alongside Samuel.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? Where\u2019s Ryan?\u201d I asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jared squeezed my hand, and I remembered too late his rule of silence. A man at the front of the opposing group ripped away his hood, revealing his enraged eyes. \u201cYou are not all owed to speak here!\u201d he said. His body shook as he spoke.</p><p>Samuel and Claire took a defensive stance in front of Jared and me. Jared squeezed my hand again, this time in comfort. He brought my fingers to his lips and kissed them. An overwhelming urge to cry overcame me, and although I begged myself not to, my eyes fil ed with salty tears and dribbled down my cheeks.</p><p>Eli casual y pushed Samuel and Claire to the side to approach me. \u201cLook what you've done,\u201d Eli said, lifting my chin. He used his thumbs to wipe the twin lines of tears. \u201cUpsetting the bride on her wedding day.\u201d He turned to the man. \u201cApologize, Michael, and then mind your manners for the remainder of our time here.\u201d</p><p>Michael stood tal . \u201cForgive me,\u201d he said, his body rigid with subdued rage.</p> <p>I nodded once, cowering against Jared.</p><p>Samuel took a spot next to Jared, and Claire stood next to me. Eli returned to his position, but this time he stood more central between the two groups. He lowered his head and closed his eyes. The Ryel siblings, along with Samuel and the cloaked men, did the same. I fol owed suit, wondering if I looked ridiculous, or if it was expected. Jared didn\u2019t offer a suggestion either way, so the safe option was to imitate the others.</p><p>After a short time, Eli began to speak in his usual soft, matter-of-fact tone. \u201cAl praise to the Most High, as this is His court and His kingdom. I wil use the common tongue for our Nina, so that she may understand. I, Eliath, angel of the Divine Plan, wil act on the Lord Almighty\u2019s behalf. My decision is final.\u201d He glanced at both Jared and Michael. \u201cAggression wil not be tolerated.\u201d</p><p>Jared and Michael nodded.</p><p>Eli looked to me, and his eyes softened. \u201cMichael has made a claim against Jared for the death of his earthen son, Isaac.\u201d</p> <p>My first inclination was to open my mouth, but after my public reprimand from Michael, I was hesitant.</p><p>Eli sensed my fear, and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Nina. You may speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm....\u201d I looked to Jared, who\u2019d told me just the opposite just a few minutes before. Any caution was absent from his face. \u201cJared didn\u2019t kil Isaac,\u201d I said. My voice was soft, but firm. Even if I incriminated myself, I couldn\u2019t let Jared take the blame for my actions.</p><p>Eli nodded, knowingly and patiently. \u201cThe actions leading to Isaac\u2019s death are why we\u2019re here, Nina. You may enter your argument in a moment. I assure you this wil be a fair proceeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do Jared and Claire seem so nervous?\u201d I said, deliberately leaving Bex\u2019s name out. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel like a casual inquiry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not. The charges against Jared are very serious. A life was lost. Archs are not all owed to kill humans to protect their Taleh. Half- Breeds are exempt from our rules, as they are half human and all owed free wil . However, because Half-Breeds are privy to those rules, it is important that they not take advantage. Do you understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cY-yes,\u201d I said, afraid to say my next words. Eli seemed to have unending patience, but I didn\u2019t want to test it. \u201cBut...Jared didn\u2019t kill Isaac.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s body twitched, and he began to speak in a language so beautiful, I knew it was of Heaven. Eli interrupted.</p><p>\u201cEnglish, Michael. It\u2019s polite.\u201d</p><p>Michael sighed with frustration. \u201cWhy do you waste your time?\u201d he said to Eli. \u201cWe don\u2019t explain ourselves to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience,\u201d Eli said simply. He looked to me, then. \u201cAl actions leading to Isaac\u2019s death are in review. In this case, Jared revealing himself to you plays a part. Typical y, we would trace to the beginning, and hold the individual responsible. In this case, the individual would be Jared\u2019s father, Gabriel, for revealing himself to Lil ian Van Buren. That action ultimately resulted in Isaac\u2019s death. But, because Gabriel has already been judged for that action, the responsibility fal s on Jared.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, stil confused.</p><p>Eli smiled in understanding. \u201cThink of the Garden of Eden. Our Lord judges wrongs based on chain reactions. It is the way of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean he holds grudges,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eli said with a smal chuckle. \u201cNo, that is not what I mean. He considers the root of the problem when He makes a decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019The sins of the father\u2019 type of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain in human terms, Nina. The short answer is yes.\u201d</p><p>Jared had made his choices, but being blamed for being the product of his parents\u2019 love, and for me for the death of Donovan was unacceptable to me. He was my husband, after all . It was now my duty to protect him, as wel . I stood tal . \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>Jared tensed. \u201cNina,\u201d he chided.</p><p>I glanced at Jared, but didn\u2019t heed his warning. \u201cOn grounds that my father made choices that could have been the cause of everything that\u2019s happened, and the fact that I am the one who kill ed Isaac\u2019s Taleh...shouldn\u2019t I be the one on trial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Michael growled, low and frightening, through his teeth.</p><p>Eli touched my shoulder. \u201cYou are, Nina. Every choice you make. His decision for you wil be later. Jared is held to a different standard, set apart from Heaven and Earth; rules for his kind that he is aware of. Now,\u201d he smiled with kindness and maybe a bit of amusement, \u201cif you are satisfied, we wil continue.\u201d</p><p>Knowing that even if I did come to understand, I would never agree, I nodded. The expression on Eli\u2019s face told me that he was aware of my feelings, and he appreciated that I was wil ing to let him move forward.</p><p>A new level of intensity weighed on everyone\u2014everyone but Eli, who seemed impervious. Michael\u2019s chest heaved as he readied himself to make his case and avenge Isaac\u2019s death. As Michael took a step forward, his smal army lifted the cloaks from their faces. I shouldn\u2019t have been, but I was surprised. I expected them all to look like Michael: Dark eyes and hair. Instead they more closely resembled Claire. A few of them looked upon me with curiosity, others with disdain, but mostly they seemed to be there out of duty and not personal reasons. That logic went against why Claire and Samuel appeared so uneasy.</p><p>Eli spoke. \u201cMichael....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaac had no choice!\u201d he said. \u201cHe was important. He was given gifts unlike any Half-Breed. The choices of his Taleh do not justify his death!\u201d</p><p>Eli nodded. \u201cJared....\u201d</p><p>Jared showed no emotion. \u201cThe choices of our Talehs never justify our deaths, but it is the duty and curse that we must accept to be obedient.\u201d</p><p>Michael shifted his weight. \u201cWhat do you know about duty, Half-Breed?\u201d</p><p>Blood rushed to my cheeks. \u201cHow dare you,\u201d I seethed.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Jared warned.</p><p>\u201cYour son\u2014the one with such gifts\u2014was also half human. I suppose since Jared doesn\u2019t support his Taleh living a life of crime and serving a demon, he doesn\u2019t take his duty seriously?\u201d I said, my temper temporarily removing any thoughts of my own safety.</p><p>A deep line formed between Michael\u2019s brow, and his eyes glistened with anger. \u201cMy son was not as fortunate as Gabe\u2019s. He accepted his fate and made the best of it. We cannot interfere with the free wil of humans. It is against His wil .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is serving the other side,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cNina!\u201d Jared growled.</p><p>Michael jerked forward, and arms burst from the long, black sleeves of cloaks behind him as hands held him at bay. Simultaneously, Samuel angled his body toward Jared in a protective stance. He didn\u2019t crouch, as I had seen Claire do so many times before when she protected me.</p><p>Samuel would not fight his brothers, but he wouldn\u2019t all ow them to harm us.</p><p>Claire leaned against my arm, and whispered in my ear. \u201cShut up, stupid. You\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe should not speak here!\u201d Michael said, jerking away from his all ies.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Eli said, his voice calm and even. \u201cNina\u2019s fate is affected. She is all owed an argument,\u201d he said, looking to me. \u201cYour thoughts have been considered. That wil be all .\u201d</p><p>For the first time, I didn\u2019t feel Eli\u2019s bias. I nodded quickly, showing my obedience with a smal step back.</p><p>\u201cClaire....\u201d Eli said, moving the trial forward.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, Isaac and Donovan were working with Shax, and they were there to kill Nina, in effect to kill Jared,\u201d she said in her no-nonsense way.</p><p>\u201cEli, it was going to be Donovan or Nina. Isaac or Jared. If you ask me, the best man won.\u201d</p><p>Her words stung Michael, but he didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>Eli\u2019s eyes scanned the looming angels behind Michael. \u201cDo any of your supporters wish to enter opinion?\u201d</p><p>Michael shook his head. \u201cIt is my claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly is your claim?\u201d Bex asked.</p><p>Michael\u2019s eyes narrowed, staring directly at Jared\u2019s younger brother. \u201cThat he murdered my son.\u201d</p><p>Claire took a step forward. \u201cYour son murdered Nina\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>When recognition hit that Claire was speaking of my father, my knees buckled, and Jared tightened his grip to keep me on my feet.</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d I said, my voice barely a whisper.</p><p>Jared leaned into my cheek, his nose grazing my ear. \u201cDonovan shot your father. Isaac was with him.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened, focusing on Michael. \u201cYou want to blame Gabe and Jared? You come here, interrupt our wedding day, yel at me, accuse us of murder, and your son was an accessory to the cause of all of this?\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s dark eyes darted from me to Eli.</p><p>Eli shrugged. \u201cShe has a point.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cIsaac did not to deserve to die. He was a good son. He accepted the curse and honored his duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael,\u201d Samuel said in his deep, firm voice.</p><p>Michael stepped toward Eli. \u201cGabriel\u2019s son should be punished! He all owed his Taleh to kill my son! Rebecca\u2019s son!\u201d</p><p>Eli looked to the ground in thought. \u201cRebecca was unhappy with Isaac\u2019s choices, was she not?\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s eyes flickered to each of us. \u201cI demand Jared be punished for taking Isaac\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>Samuel spoke again. \u201cMichael....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared should be kill ed, and leave his Taleh to the savages,\u201d Michael said, pointing to Jared.</p><p>\u201cMichael...\u201d Samuel repeated, this time with a low growl.</p><p>\u201cAn eye for an eye, Eli! I demand it!\u201d Michael said, his fists bal ed at his sides.</p><p>\u201cMICHAEL!\u201d Samuel boomed. The earth trembled when he spoke, and my hands flew to my ears.</p><p>Eli watched the interaction between Samuel and Michael for a moment, and then spoke. \u201cOkay. all right. I\u2019ve heard enough from each side. Only one argument remains.\u201d</p><p>We all looked to one another, wondering who was left.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d a warm voice spoke. It was a voice I hadn\u2019t heard in a long time. A voice from my childhood.</p><p>Jared\u2019s hand was stil in mine, and the moment the voice could be heard, his hand went limp. \u201cDad?\u201d he said.</p><p>I turned, seeing Gabe Ryel at the top of the chapel\u2019s rock steps. He looked exactly as I remembered him: tal , his blond hair and piercing, ice-blue eyes glowing even from several feet away. A flash broke from the crowd and up the steps, and in the next moment, Claire was in her father\u2019s arms, sobbing uncontrol ably. She pressed her cheek against his chest, whispering something I couldn\u2019t understand. Gabe bowed his head, spoke something back, and then he kissed his daughter\u2019s forehead. They descended the stairs together, and approached Bex.</p><p>Gabe offered a smal smile to his youngest son, who fel against him with a clap.</p><p>My mouth fel open, and I immediately searched Jared\u2019s face for a reaction. There was none.</p><p>Gabe\u2019s expression turned remorseful. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your son, Michael. You and I are in unique positions...to know love for a child. You and I agree that if we could change the outcome, we would make it so.\u201d</p><p>Eli reached out to Gabe. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that it is in the height of adversary that we must come together. Michael, you\u2019ve lost your son. Your widow has now lost her husband and her son. It is unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>Michael bowed his head.</p><p>Gabe approached Michael, pulling him into his arms. \u201cWe need you on our side, Brother.\u201d</p><p>Michael shrugged out of his grasp.</p><p>\u201cEli?\u201d Michael pleaded.</p><p>Eli offered a smal , comforting smile. \u201cYou already know the answer.\u201d</p><p>Michael shot an accusing glare at Jared.</p><p>Jared\u2019s brows pul ed in. \u201cI didn\u2019t want Isaac to die, Michael. I swear to you, I wish it hadn\u2019t happened.</p><p>\u201cVery wel , then.\u201d He gestured to the cloaked angels, and they all disappeared into the darkness.</p><p>Eli clapped his hands together, lacing his fingers together. \u201cImpeccable timing, as always, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>Gabe nodded. His eyes paused on me for a moment before fixing on Jared. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault, Jared.\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t speak. His face tense, his dark eyes meeting the eyes of his father, he was paralyzed. The scene brought back memories of the moment I saw my father for the last time, and I ached for Jared. He would have to say goodbye a second time.</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d Gabe began, \u201cit\u2019s not your fault. You\u2019ve done everything right.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s head dipped slightly as he attempted a nod.</p><p>\u201cSon....\u201d Gabe cupped both of his hands on Jared\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Jared choked, and his body gave way, all owing him to fal against his father. I covered my mouth, unaccustomed to seeing Jared relinquish control of his emotions. They embraced, and Jared\u2019s knuckles turned white as he held Gabe in his arms. When Gabe released him, Jared used his thumb and index finger to make a quick swipe of his wet eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, Dad,\u201d Jared said with a weak smile.</p><p>Gabe beamed. \u201cYou\u2019ve done wel , Son. You\u2019ve done wel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried,\u201d Jared said, relieved at his father\u2019s words. He took my hand, then. \u201cYou remember Nina.\u201d</p><p>Gabe leaned down and kissed my hairline. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>Eli walked up the steps, watching with amusement as Claire and Bex crowded their father. \u201cGabriel....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, seeming a bit sad. \u201cOne more thing,\u201d he said. He wrapped his arms around Bex and Claire again, and then fol owed Eli through the double wooden doors, down the aisle of the chapel. Lil ian was stil frozen. The same sweet, smal smile on her face hadn\u2019t moved a centimeter.</p><p>Gabriel kneeled before her. He noticed her folded hands in her lap, and tenderly covered hers with his. \u201cShe is as beautiful as the day I first saw her,\u201d he smiled. With two fingers, he brushed her cheekbone, and then leaned in to kiss her lips. His mouth lingered on hers for a few moments, and he closed his eyes, taking in his last moment with his wife.</p><p>Claire wiped a stray tear from her cheek, but her cheeks were glistening with preceding tears. \u201cEli...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, no,\u201d Eli said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already pushing the rules all owing Nina to be animated, not to mention all owing me to be here at all ,\u201d Gabriel said. His eyes didn\u2019t stray from Lil ian\u2019s delicate face.</p><p>\u201cNot unlike hacking into dreams to get your point across....\u201d Eli said, looking away in dramatic fashion.</p><p>\u201cThe dreams,\u201d I said. The moment I spoke, I wished I hadn\u2019t. Bothering Gabe while he spent his last moments with his wife was ridiculously selfish. Regardless, Gabe touched Lil ian\u2019s lips to his once more, and then stood to face me.</p><p>\u201cYes, the dreams,\u201d Gabe sighed.</p><p>I hesitated, and then decided to ask, anyway. \u201cWhy did you come to me in the dream if there was nothing in the book to help us?\u201d</p><p>Gabe looked to the floor, and then to Jared. \u201cAt first, we were hoping you wouldn\u2019t go right along with the prophecy and get pregnant the first chance that presented itself.\u201d</p> <p>A flush of red lit my cheeks, and Jared cleared his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly how it happened, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Gabe gave a quick nod. \u201cYou have the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cNow that you have it, it\u2019s safe to say that it would behoove you to help the Pol ocks replace it. One less thing to worry about, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cBut...if it puts us in danger, why did you take it from the Pol ocks to begin with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswers. Jack knew the moment she was born she was in danger of being the woman in the prophecy. When you fel in love with her, Son, we knew it was a matter of when, not if. We were fighting time and fate...an impossible task. Stil , Jack loved his daughter, and he wanted to do everything in his power to try to keep her from that path. We knew there was a chance the book could help us find a loophole, so we took it.\u201d</p><p>In frustration, Jared shifted his weight. \u201cBut...by the time you came to Nina in the dreams, you knew there was no loophole. Why did you put her through that? Why the theatrics? Do you have any idea what she\u2019s been through? What I went through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get your attention. We were desperate to find a way to stop you from commencing the prophecy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy then it was too late,\u201d Bex inserted.</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Claire grumbled.</p><p>Gabe shook his head. \u201cNot quite. She stil had time.\u201d</p><p>I looked around the room. \u201cWhere is Samuel?\u201d</p><p>Claire shoved her hands into her jacket pockets. She wore sweats, her gathered gray pants pushed up to just below her knees, and a matching hooded jacket over a ratty white tank top. She had been summoned unexpectedly. \u201cBabysitting Ryan until I get back. Now that the trial is over, he\u2019s vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cKim goes home tomorrow. Father Francis is in stable condition, but he wil be in traction for a while.\u201d</p><p>Bex frowned. \u201cThat should have never happened. Clergy should have more protection than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather Francis\u2019 guardian is an Arch, Bex. His hands were tied when Donovan attacked him,\u201d Claire explained.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d Jared asked Gabe.</p><p>\u201cShax stil wants his book. Hel doesn\u2019t want the child to be born. Things are stacking against you, Jared,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cOne thing at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing at a time,\u201d Jared repeated, letting his father\u2019s advice sink in.</p><p>Gabe hugged his children one more time, and then made his way toward the door. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time between now and the time she delivers the baby, Jared. We\u2019ll keep an ear to the ground, but be on alert. Heaven won\u2019t step in until you give them a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean start a war,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cFigure out a reason, Son.\u201d In that instant, Gabriel was gone.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Bex puffed. \u201cWeird.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s shoulders dropped. \u201cHe\u2019s never coming back, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d Jared said with a smal , apologetic smile on his face.</p><p>Claire sat on the closest pew, beside her mother. She leaned against Lil ian\u2019s shoulder and closed her eyes, pushing the remaining tears down her face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you couldn\u2019t see him,\u201d Claire whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019l know,\u201d Bex said. \u201cShe always knows.\u201d</p><p>The windows began to brighten, and light danced down the wal s as if the sun were rising.</p><p>Eli smiled, kissing me lightly on the cheek. \u201cCongratulations, kiddo. On both counts. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s as I said before. When there is only one question left to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...what does that mean? What is the question?\u201d I asked, but I was talking to empty space. He was gone.</p><p>Claire stood, taking a deep breath. \u201cI have to get back,\u201d she said, looking behind her. Samuel stood at the door with an outstretched hand reaching in her direction. \u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d she said to me with a smal smile. In no hurry, Claire ambled down the aisle. Once her hand touched Samuel\u2019s, she was gone as wel .</p><p>Bex laughed once and shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Little Heaven</p><p>Jared took my hand and led me to our former spots at the front of the church. Bex took a position beside his brother. We watched each other as the sun grew brighter, slowly brightening the faces of our audience. From the corner of my eye, I saw movement, and Father Julian shifted his weight, signaling their awakening.</p><p>The minister smiled, gesturing for us to turn. We faced our friends and family, and Father Julian placed his hands on each of our shoulders. \u201cI present to you, Mr. and Mrs. Jared Ryel.\u201d</p><p>Every face in the room beamed, and applause fil ed the room. Even with the frightening events just moments before, joy consumed me. Jared\u2019s hand enveloped mine, and we walked the few steps to the aisle, and then made our way outside. It was surreal to return to the scene of Jared\u2019s trial, this time in the sunshine where birds sang, happily riding the bobbing branches that swayed with the breeze. The plaza at the bottom of the chapel\u2019s steps where Michael and his smal army had stood not ten minutes before now bathed in the warmth of the sun, waiting for our friends to occupy its smooth, rocked surface. The fountain gushing, the road peppered with townspeople\u2014I felt a bit sick at the sight of it.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jared said, stopping to smile as Beth took our picture.</p><p>\u201cYeah...yeah, I just feel...confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanging planes is unnatural and unsettling for humans, which is why they typical y don\u2019t all ow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains a lot,\u201d I said, stopping to pose for more pictures as Lil ian, Cynthia, Chad, and Jared\u2019s Uncle Luke and Aunt Maryse filed out of the chapel. \u201cDoes it...,\u201d I smiled again, \u201caffect the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared answered, kissing my forehead.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I said, leaning into his kiss.</p><p>He looked down to me and touched my cheek. \u201cOtherwise Eli wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, my eyes wandering until I found Lil ian. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Lil ian hugged her son, and then me. Her sweet, energetic smile lit up the island. I watched and waited, wondering if she realized she\u2019d been in Gabriel\u2019s presence just moments before.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she said, half curious, half amused.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as I,\u201d she winked.</p><p>Jared and I traded glances, wondering if she\u2019d just given us a clue.</p><p>\u201cCynthia!\u201d Beth cal ed. \u201cStand beside Nina and I\u2019ll take a picture of the couple with their mothers.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia fidgeted with her hair, and then took her place beside me, poised and proper. I hooked my arm around her waist, and she stiffened when I pul ed her closer.</p><p>\u201cSmile!\u201d Beth said, snapping a picture.</p><p>A few of the locals gathered on the street, their warm, smiling faces interlacing with the familiar faces our friends and family. They began clapping and singing, and then one of the grandmothers waved us with her hands, encouraging us to walk. Jared tugged on my hand, and we walked to the street. I laughed with surprise and excitement when I realized they were fol owing us, their hands clapping to the beat of their happy song. Our guests\u2019 white faces were littered among the brown, sun-kissed skin of the townspeople. They fol owed us to a makeshift downtown, where a smal group of men played music.</p><p>\u201cYou did this?\u201d I asked Jared.</p><p>He smiled, amazed. \u201cNo. This one I didn\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>We laughed together, amazed at the random celebration that grew around us. Jared pul ed me to the center of the street, where we danced to the strumming guitars and hand-tapped percussion. Chad and Beth joined us, as did Luke and Maryse. Bex pul ed his mother into the dirt street as wel . If I didn\u2019t know better, I would have felt badly for Cynthia, but I knew she preferred to stand away from the nonsense. Perfectly stil .</p><p>The afternoon sun was warm, and my wedding dress wasn\u2019t built to breathe in the Caribbean humidity. Jared sensed my dilemma and nodded, providing me a seat in the shade. An elderly woman brought me a fan with a smile of understanding. The band played on, and the townsfolk and our guests danced into the evening, long after the makeshift street lamps and hanging lights turned on to flicker and twinkle against the night.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Jared asked, handing me another glass of water.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I smiled, taking a sip. \u201cI feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel like dancing?\u201d he said. Jared gestured to the band, and it slowed the beat.</p><p>I eagerly let my husband take me by the hand to the middle of the celebration. I wrapped my arms around his neck and pressed my cheek against his chest. His heavenly scent took me away from trials and the war we would create to stay alive. It was then that I realized his skin wasn\u2019t the feverish temperature it usual y was.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel as hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably because you\u2019re overheating in that dress. I should have arranged for something you could change into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I smiled. \u201cQuit fussing.\u201d</p><p>Jared rested his jaw against my hair, and we moved slowly to the music. A slight breeze moved through the trees that lined the smal cobblestone street in the center of the town. I sunk into Jared\u2019s chest and let his arms total y engulf me. I had never been in more danger, and yet I had never felt so safe. The tribulations that we would face upon our return to Providence suddenly seemed so smal in comparison to that moment.</p><p>I looked up to Jared, and noticed his content smile. \u201cWas it exactly what you hoped it would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he cooed. \u201cEverything and more.\u201d</p><p>My head felt heavy, and I rested it against my husband\u2019s shoulder. My eyes swept across the landscape, seeing Beth and Chad dancing. They weren\u2019t talking, but smiling as they shared a sweet moment. It reminded me of the first time Jared and I had experienced Little Corn, and it was heartwarming to see the island make Beth and Chad feel the same way.</p><p>As the sun set, the vil agers lit the primitive lamps that bordered the sidewalk. Jared and I stood with Bex, listening to Cynthia and Lil ian discuss how beautiful the ceremony had been. I waited to hear some indication that Lil ian knew of Gabe\u2019s presence, but if she knew, she wasn\u2019t letting on.</p><p>\u201cWel , daughter,\u201d Cynthia said, dabbing her forehead with a handkerchief, \u201cI have an early appointment that Jared promised I would make. I best be off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming, Mother,\u201d I said, leaning in to hug her. Her embrace was more than the usual awkward squeeze. She held me to her, and whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cBe safe, dearest. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia turned on her heels and walked quickly to a waiting pickup truck. She didn\u2019t look back as the truck slowly faded into the dark jungle. I waited until I could no longer hear the engine, and then turned to Jared.</p><p>He offered a half smile. \u201cShe loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d I said, stunned. \u201cI mean, of course she does. She\u2019s just never...she\u2019l make her appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made sure of it,\u201d Jared said. \u201cBex is at the boat dock, now. He\u2019s going to ride with her to the mainland and get her on the plane on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Remind me to thank Bex later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Lil ian put a thin arm around me and pul ed me to her side, \u201che\u2019s happy to do it. I\u2019m going to catch a ride with Chad and Beth. She\u2019s a sweet girl.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cSee you at home. Come over for dinner soon, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise,\u201d Jared said, kissing her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI love you both!\u201d she waved, fol owing Beth and Chad to another waiting vehicle.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is our car?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI have the bike I drove over.\u201d</p><p>I looked down to my dress. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed once. \u201cNo. Not at all .\u201d He crouched and then brought up a bunched wad of my dress in his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice night. It\u2019l be fun.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and shrugged. \u201cWhy not? Cynthia\u2019s not here to freak out about it.\u201d I took the bunched tul e and silk under my arm and then took Jared\u2019s hand. He led us past the band to a smal dirt bike. We took several back roads that led us through a vil age or two\u2014it was so dark I wasn\u2019t sure if it was tin buildings passing by or just shadows cast by the trees. Before long, the trees thinned, and Jared slowed to a stop. Sounds of waves caressing the shoreline weren\u2019t far away.</p> <p>Jared took my hand, and we walked beyond the trail until I could feel wet sand breaching the borders of my sandals. The half-moon stubbornly glowed behind a thin, broken layer of clouds. We ambled to where the ocean met the sand, and walked along the beach. We didn\u2019t talk, just walked hand in hand, listening to Little Corn.</p><p>The moon final y broke free of the clouds, and its silver light danced on the water. We came upon a large rock, and Jared motioned for me to sit.</p><p>\u201cYou must be exhausted,\u201d he said, sitting next to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, but you only get one wedding day. I can feel a second wind coming on.\u201d</p><p>Jared eyes turned soft, and they lingered on my lips. \u201cI just wanted to be alone with you and the island for a little while.\u201d</p><p>His eyes seemed to glow in the silver light, and suddenly I was nervous. It was sil y to feel that way\u2014I was pregnant, after all \u2014but the pressure of our wedding night made it new again. We had no constraints; no worries about a pregnancy, or being walked in on, or nightmares. It was just us, and the knowledge that we were about to consummate our marriage. For whatever reason, that made me incredibly anxious.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>Knowing I couldn\u2019t comfortably explain my feelings without some embarrassment, I pul ed him to me and touched my lips to his.</p><p>He pul ed away, laughing once. \u201cI\u2019m a bit nervous about tonight, isn\u2019t that ridiculous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, tugging on his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m right there with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he said, relieved.</p><p>I nodded, and then looked behind us. I returned to him, biting my lip. \u201cHow far are we from the casita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s right there,\u201d he said, nodding behind me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should...I don\u2019t know, get it over with isn\u2019t the right word.\u201d</p> <p>Jared cleared his throat, and then offered an ornery smile. \u201cGet naked and get the nerves out of the way?\u201d</p><p>My mouth fel open and I laughed out loud. \u201cJared!\u201d</p><p>He laughed and lifted me into his arms, walking in the direction of the casita. \u201cI didn\u2019t say it was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>He carried me a few yards, past the trees, to the familiar surroundings of our casita. He opened the screen, and then brought me inside, softly leaning me against the mattress. The moonlight faded away, and the wind picked up. With a hand on each side of my shoulders, Jared hovered over my body. Distant thunder rol ed somewhere over the ocean. He leaned down and touched his lips to mine just as the first raindrops began to spatter against the tin roof.</p><p>Jared\u2019s lips traveled in a line down my neck, and he anchored himself with a knee as he lifted me with one hand, and unzipped the back of my wedding dress with the other. With both hands, I pushed back his jacket and slid the sleeves off of his arms, and then unbuttoned the first two buttons of his white dress shirt. Impatient, I grabbed the hem and pul ed it over his head.</p><p>Watching his bulging muscles tense and move under his smooth skin did nothing for my nerves. Determined to enjoy the comfort I usual y enjoyed when we made love, I focused on undressing him. I worked on the button of his slacks, and then ripped down the zipper.</p><p>\u201cI said it was a good idea, but I didn\u2019t promise not to take my time,\u201d Jared said, kicking off his pants. He bent his elbows, letting his body press against mine.</p><p>\u201cYou can take your time,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have all night. I think if I just get past this part I can relax,\u201d I said, pressing my fingers into his back.</p><p>He reached under the skirt of my dress, and pul ed the thin, lacy fabric of my panties down my thighs, over my knees, and then past my ankles, letting them fal to the floor.</p><p>His hand traveled back up my leg, disappearing under the layers of silk. My legs tensed, and I sucked in a quick bit of air. A few moments later, I couldn\u2019t help but close my eyes and let myself sink into the mattress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you said that,\u201d he said against my lips. \u201cI ful y intend to take all night.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>The End.</p><p>I sat on the beach, listening to the waves. The last time I had come to this island, I pretended to be Mrs. Ryel. Now it was reality. I sighed, and placed my hand on my bel y. I wished things could be different; that I was like any other new bride, enjoying the beauty surrounding me on my first day as a wife. Wishing wouldn\u2019t help, and I knew that. Another life would mean the absence of Jared. If we had never met, most of the chaos wouldn\u2019t have happened, and the worst-case scenario would have been to find out my father was a different person than I believed him to be. Apart from that disappointment, life would have continued on\u2014mundane and mediocre. I would have married Ryan, and worked at Titan. Bore a child or three. We would have lived day in and day out with a respect and love, facing day to day chal enges of ordinary life.</p><p>My nose wrinkled. A life without Jared was unimaginable. Coupled with that stipulation, I didn\u2019t want it. Chaos, a constant state of being on alert and uncertain was a respectable tradeoff for a love like his. He didn\u2019t ask for this, either, after all . The danger was what we went through to be together, and it was worth it for him. He never questioned it, and I grudgingly accepted it. It might not make sense to everyone, but then again, they could never understand. Most hadn\u2019t experienced what I had. I\u2019d been waited for, longed after for years. The safety, security, and calm I felt with Jared were unmatched; no one else on earth made me feel that way. No one was held as sacred by their husband as I was, so they couldn\u2019t fathom what one might endure to protect it. Our love, in all its imperfection, was perfect.</p><p>It was then that a moment of clarity came over me. From the moment I\u2019d learned the truth, I had fought with the feeling of loss for a normal life, but without Jared, that life wouldn\u2019t have as much meaning. Sure, I was an individual. I was a strong person. I didn\u2019t need someone else to complete me, but I was happier with Jared than without him. More than happy. Why settle to prove that I was free? I was, with and without him. Being with him was a choice\u2014a choice to love and be loved and exist in an affirmative state with someone. Even with the chaos going on around us, it was more than I could have hoped for. More than most hoped for. His love was the purest example of anything a human could feel for another. The more I weighed the options in my head, the less appealing Normal became. It was downright insulting to compare the two. Suddenly I couldn\u2019t remember why I had missed it in the first place, and scolded myself for ever letting Jared feel that I was anything but grateful for every moment he was in my life.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling, love?\u201d Jared said from behind, bringing a tal glass of ice water.</p><p>\u201cAs if you have to ask. I feel real y good. It seems like every day I feel better and better. Is that normal? Aren\u2019t I supposed to feel sick, or tired, or both?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. What is normal when you\u2019re carrying our child?\u201d Jared said, taking a seat beside me.</p><p>We watched the surf together. The storm from the night before had raged until the early hours of the morning...and there was a good reason that I knew that for a fact. Jared had kept his promise to take his time. I slept for an hour, maybe two, after the sun breached the horizon before venturing to the beach. The ocean was endless, stretching out until it met the sky. The only way to tel one from the other was the slight difference in shade. I took in a deep breath and leaned against my husband.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jared said, grazing his lips across a smal patch of skin on my forehead.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I said closing my eyes. I wanted to focus on the sounds of the waves rushing the beach, and the way the breeze blew my hair forward. If it were possible to block the frightening thoughts from my head, I would have. I wanted to pretend that the truths I had come across in recent years weren\u2019t real. But they were, and inconceivable, nightmarish things waited for us at home. Those thoughts made it difficult to relax and enjoy my honeymoon, even with Jared\u2019s tireless reassurance. I had final y accepted my life for what it was, but that didn\u2019t make it less frightening.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Jared said, nodding to a spot up the beach.</p><p>Samuel stood at least two hundred yards away, too far away for my human eyes to tel if he was watching us or the ocean.</p><p>Jared nuzzled the hair just above my ear. \u201cHe has been granted a temporary new post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo babysit us?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe must be thril ed.\u201d</p><p>Jared chuckled. \u201cSomething like that. Hybrids don\u2019t have Archs. Have I ever told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t. Our job to protect humans, that along with our knowledge and abilities makes having our own guardian angel redundant. Not to mention the curse....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you stil need protection, don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jared thought for a moment. \u201cWe are born to protect. I think He sees it as an infinite waste of resources.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s brows pul ed in and he cocked his head a bit. \u201cYou seem different today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do? What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed. \u201cNot your general wel -being, I mean you. Your behavior. You seem less on edge. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>My brows shot up, and I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m not worried, I can promise you that. I have one more year of col ege, I\u2019ll be taking over Titan soon after...and I\u2019m pregnant. The best part\u2014my personal favorite\u2014I have to be on guard for the next nine months just to stay alive long enough to deliver our baby, and hope the Creator of the Universe decides against his own rules to help us do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actual y ten months. Forty weeks is ten months.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>Jared stifled a grin. \u201cI was proud of you at the hearing.\u201d When I didn\u2019t reply, Jared explained further, \u201cWith Michael. You made a great case. It might have been what kept me out of serious trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat might have happened? If Eli had decided against you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst punishment would be death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...,\u201d I began, thinking as I spoke, \u201cyou can\u2019t die unless I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr if I\u2019m found guilty of disturbing The Balance. Heaven has zero tolerance for both of those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby supposedly disturbs The Balance,\u201d I said, touching my bel y.</p><p>Jared put his hand on mine. \u201cGod didn\u2019t create the baby, Nina, we did. Free wil and The Law are on opposite ends of the universe. I could explain it for the rest of your life, and you stil wouldn\u2019t understand. Even I don\u2019t ful y understand it all . Just know that The Law is a constant, and The Balance is a variable. In our case, it depended on Free Wil , and that makes The Balance a whole new beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head hurts,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. More water?\u201d</p><p>I looked down to my glass. It was empty. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even realized I\u2019d touched it.\u201d</p><p>Jared moved his hand up my arm, his fingers pressuring different spots. \u201cYour temperature is elevated, but I believe it\u2019s due to the pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, staring out into the ocean. \u201cWil it ever be over, Jared? Once the baby is born, wil we have to keep fighting for every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Heaven wil have to decide at some point that enough is enough. They wil either save us or let us die. Once that decision is made, we are protected.\u201d</p><p>I looked up to the sky. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t He just make it now?\u201d Jared didn\u2019t answer, and it was just as wel . I didn\u2019t expect him to. \u201cJared...,\u201d I hesitated. I didn\u2019t want to ruin our perfect morning. \u201cI think I should continue my training.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. But, can we both agree that there may come a time when I might have to defend myself...or the baby? I\u2019m not asking you to beat the crap out of me; I\u2019d just like to spend more time with the firearms, and for you to teach me some more complex moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>Jared wrapped his arms around me, resting his chin on my head. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We have to be prepared for anything. We\u2019ll start when we get back.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back, and lowered his chin so that I would meet his gaze. \u201cYou have to take it easy, though. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wil . I promise.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied, Jared took my glass and returned moments later with a fresh batch of ice floating in the water. I took a sip and sighed, trying my best to relax.</p><p>We sat in the morning sun, waiting as it crawled across the sky, hiding every so often behind the errant cloud. Jared and I were wrapped in each other\u2019s arms, enjoying a smal moment of peace. Eventual y, my stomach began to protest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked down, and then to Jared. \u201cI guess we better find something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t say anything sooner. You haven\u2019t eaten since yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised the baby didn\u2019t say something sooner,\u201d I said, extending my hand to Jared when he stood.</p><p>He tugged on my hand. \u201cI can see I\u2019m going to have to take better care of you.\u201d</p> <p>We made our way to the eating lodge, where just a few other patrons sat at a table across the room. I dove into the fresh fruit bowl on the table, and then eagerly waited for the waiter to arrive.</p><p>An hour later, empty or nearly empty plates of Grouper, Cal aloo, Conch Fritters and other Caribbean cuisine lay all over our table. For someone that didn\u2019t feel hungry, I couldn\u2019t seem to stop eating.</p><p>I mashed the leftover crumbs from the banana bread we requested for dessert with my finger and then licked them off.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always had a healthy appetite, but this is impressive.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d I smiled. We both knew finishing the ridiculous amount of food I\u2019d ordered was above and beyond anything I\u2019d accomplished meal-wise before. Our table looked like we\u2019d had a dinner party with ravenous wolves.</p><p>\u201cReady for a nap?\u201d Jared said, laying a large bil on the table.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go exploring,\u201d I smiled. \u201cOr snorkeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnorkeling? Stil not tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I feel amazing,\u201d I grinned. Jared frowned. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m not supposed to feel amazing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. To me, you feel tired. You were hungry an hour before your stomach growled. I can\u2019t decide if I\u2019m losing my senses or that your body isn\u2019t responding normal y because of Bean. If it\u2019s the latter, I don\u2019t want you overdoing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I\u2019ll take a nap. Or at least rest a while if I can\u2019t fal asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal y?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal y. Why?\u201d</p><p>Jared fidgeted. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...you\u2019re rarely this agreeable. I\u2019m beginning to wonder if I\u2019m in an alternate reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been such a pain in the ass. I thought couples are supposed to get along on their honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s brow rose. \u201cSo that\u2019s it? You\u2019re just being affable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I trust you. You know my body better than I do, and I don\u2019t want to do anything that could hurt the baby.\u201d</p> <p>Jared took a deep breath, and blew it out. \u201cIt\u2019s good to hear you say that.\u201d When I frowned, he shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. Sometimes I wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I would do something to hurt our baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jared said, hugging me and chuckling at the same time. \u201cNo, that you trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d I said against his chest. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the casita and lay down for a while.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded, and then took my hand. He strol ed down the dirt path, and we laughed and joked as we made our way to our whimsical y painted tin hut. His eyes were brighter than I\u2019d ever seen them, free of any clouds. When we reached the door, Jared lifted me in his arms and carried me to the bed, careful y lowering me onto my back.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, brushing my hair away from my face. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought you extraordinarily beautiful, but this way,\u201d he touched my rounding bel y, \u201cI can\u2019t stop looking at you. You\u2019re stunning.\u201d His fingers returned to my hairline to sweep my bangs back, and then again, his fingertips gentle and soft against my skin. It felt so good, I could have melted into the bed I was so relaxed, but I wasn\u2019t sleepy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to say that until I\u2019m big as a house and need a little encouragement to be seen in public every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see that. I\u2019ve been all over the world, but that wil be the most marvelous, beautiful thing I\u2019m ever going to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you see our child,\u201d I noted.</p><p>Jared beamed. \u201cI have a lot to look forward to.\u201d</p><p>I cupped my fingers behind his ears and pul ed him toward me, tasting his lips. \u201cSo do I.\u201d I tugged at Jared\u2019s shirt, and pul ed it over his head.</p><p>Jared pressed his warm chest against me, and I sighed. At least that part of our lives could return to normal.</p><p>\u201cYou should rest,\u201d Jared whispered against my skin.</p><p>\u201cI wil ,\u201d I promised.</p><p>Just as I had closed my eyes, they were open. The sun stil shined, and Jared sat on the edge of the bed, pulling his T-shirt over his head. He turned to me, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cYou promised to nap if we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I yawned. \u201cI slept so good. What time is it? I feel like I\u2019ve slept all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina, it hasn\u2019t even been twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cThis is disconcerting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019ve never real y been a nap-taker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but when you do, you\u2019re out for three hours.\u201d Jared leaned down, pressing his ear gently to my stomach. He stayed there for a moment, and then sighed. \u201cSomething\u2019s different. I can\u2019t put my finger on it. You\u2019re different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I told you I wasn\u2019t sleepy. Let\u2019s go snorkeling. I\u2019m bored.\u201d I stood and picked a bathing suit from the suitcase, and hurried Jared to do the same. I prodded him to the beach, eager to have some fun. We snorkeled, we swam, we splashed each other and explored the farthest corners of the island. At night, we spent time together in the outside shower, and then snuggled in bed. If I hadn\u2019t already been pregnant, by the end of our honeymoon I surely would have been. Jared was insatiable, and it seemed that with every quiet moment, I whispered suggestive things in his ear.</p><p>Just like our last visit to Little Corn, the week went by too quickly. Jared noted the familiar sadness in my eyes as I packed.</p><p>\u201cWe can come back. When you graduate, after the baby is born, we can come back and stay as long as you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a company to run, you forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wil run just fine if you decide to take a leave of absence.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, repeating the tedious cycle of stuffing my wedding dress into the garment bag and then smoothing it out. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Jared seemed to be out of sorts as wel . We didn\u2019t speak much as the hired help stacked our belongings in the truck, and then again in the boat.</p><p>Jared held me as the boat bounced across the waves to the main island, and relied on smal talk as we waited for the plane to depart from Nicaragua. It was like saying goodbye for the last time to an old friend. It felt like loss. This time, there would be no ring to cheer me up, only the ominous thoughts of what might be waiting for us at home.</p><p>The fairy tale was over.</p><p>Once we were in U.S. airspace, I immediately dialed Beth to see what the situation was at Titan. Sasha worked to make life difficult for everyone, and Grant was more than ready for me to return so he could leave for his own vacation. Just a few weeks of school left, and then summer hours would be enforced.</p><p>Ryan was stil recovering in the hospital. Beth noted that Claire never left him alone for a moment. Her comment made me think about the times I visited Ryan in the hospital after he was attacked, and I wondered if he had taught her the Logo game. I couldn\u2019t imagine Claire sitting beside his bed giggling and being sil y. She was more likely to pout in the corner, trying to ignore his vies for attention and incessant questions. I hoped that I was wrong.</p><p>The pilot announced on the overhead speaker that we would make out descent soon. Jared tightened my seat belt and kissed the tender skin in front of my ear, whispering that it would be okay. I didn\u2019t feel particularly nervous about the landing, but I assumed he meant life in Providence. With everything that had happened in Little Corn, it was easy to get lost in that other world, and pretend real life in Rhode Island was just a bad dream.</p><p>But the bad dream was real, and we were about to live it.</p><p>Descending the stairs of the jet, and then walking across the tarmac to the waiting car was eerily similar. The ground was wet from a late-spring thunderstorm; the air was so thick it seemed palpable. Samuel stood a hundred yards away, staying in the background, but all owing us to see him.</p><p>Jared already knew he was there, so I knew his presence was for me. This time, though, Jared didn\u2019t go to him. He walked with me to the car, and nodded to our driver, Robert, as he held the door.</p><p>My cel phone buzzed and I answered. Grant wasted no time updating my schedule, hinting that I should come in right away. An important meeting was scheduled during one of my classes the next day, and he wanted to go over some key points with me to compensate for my absence.</p><p>I hung up the phone and sighed. \u201cMaybe I should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already looking forward to several days of makeup work and tests, and don\u2019t forget Finals coming up soon. Grant can handle it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll meet with him this evening. He has an hour, and then I\u2019ll hit the books.\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What did I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Agreeing with me without a single argument. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll have to get used to.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips together in a hard line, trying not to smile. I must have been a true nuisance to him. I owed him a nice, long vacation from my stubbornness.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve been so awful to you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Jared took my hand in his, and turned to face me. \u201cYou have not been awful. You\u2019ve had an incredible amount to deal with, and doing things on your terms was important to you. Making choices was the only shred of control you had in this entire, crazy situation. I\u2019ve never begrudged you that.</p><p>In fact, it\u2019s one of the things I love about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless, consider it significantly toned down.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize for coping. It\u2019s been tough for everyone. It\u2019s been a lot. However, I won\u2019t lie and say I\u2019m not going to enjoy the new attitude.\u201d</p><p>I leaned in and kissed the corner of his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a lot of new from me. I don\u2019t want to be a victim, anymore. I am now an active participant in what happens to me and my family. We\u2019re going to get through this together or not at all .\u201d</p><p>Jared beamed. \u201cYou amaze me every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , if you\u2019re quite finished being amazed, I need to go into work for a bit. Robert? We\u2019ll need the Escalade.\u201d</p><p>Robert glanced at me in the rearview mirror with his wrinkled, kind eyes. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He made a turn, taking us to our home. That was one thing very different from our last trip to Little Corn. Home was no longer the loft.</p><p>The tires crunched across the gravel drive, and Robert slowed the car to a stop next to Jared\u2019s SUV. The door opened, and Robert lent me a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you back, Miss...,\u201d Robert seemed flustered for a moment before speaking again, \u201cI deeply apologize. Mrs. Ryel.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cJust for that, you get a raise, Robert.\u201d</p><p>He nodded to Jared, and then popped the trunk, pulling our bags from the back. \u201cI\u2019ll have your things laundered and returned to your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Robert,\u201d Jared said. He grabbed my hand and led me to the Escalade, pulling open the door. He lifted me into his arms and placed me gently in the passenger seat. \u201cSince I don\u2019t have time to carry you across the threshold, I suppose this wil have to do.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cIt\u2019l do,\u201d I said, placing each of my hands on his cheeks for a quick kiss.</p><p>Providence seemed different. Remnant rain dripped from the trees, the beautiful buildings stil loomed over the streets, and the traffic stil made walking across the post-storm street a chal enge for pedestrians who wished to remain dry. But it was foreign somehow. Providence would always be home, but for now it was a battleground\u2014a place to stand off with those who would harm my child. For the next months until I gave birth, I would walk the streets on guard, in constant suspicion of everyone I came across, and cautious of every dark street. Having no idea when Hel would act, or what they had in store for us, it was important now than ever to be prepared and vigilant. all things considered, I was glad it was on my own turf.</p><p>My ancestors weren\u2019t just Rhode Islanders. I was Nephilim. We survived King David, the flood, and the yel ow fever epidemic of 1797. My husband was half angel. I could stand up to whatever they could throw at me. That was what I would keep tel ing myself, anyway. No sense in worrying myself to death about it.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Jared said, referring to whatever emotion he was sensing.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cCourage, I think,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can do this. I believe in you. I believe in us.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes darkened a bit, and he reached over the console to grab my hand. The muscles under his jaws twitched, and his fingers tensed as they intertwined with mine. \u201cI definitely like the new attitude.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Answer</p><p>Titan\u2019s tal , block-and-mortar fa\u00e7ade loomed over Fleet Rink. Summer was just a few weeks away, and the rink had been transformed from its usual icy amusement to a popular hangout for local rol erbladers. Jared parked in his usual spot, kissing my lips before I stepped out onto the sidewalk and to the front entrance of the lobby.</p><p>I paused, the first few steps without Jared felt strange. Except for the few hours I spent getting ready for the wedding, Jared and I had been side by side every day for a week. An unsettling feeling came over me, as if I\u2019d forgotten my cel phone or locked my keys inside the car.</p><p>I pushed through the front door and walked across the lobby, dismissing my unease. Jared remaining in the car meant that everything was just fine. If he sensed even the slightest bit of danger, he would be next to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGet a grip, Nina,\u201d I whispered to myself. Inside the elevator, I pressed the button, and took a deep, cleansing breath as the doors slid closed.</p><p>When they opened again, the relaxing breath proved to be futile.</p><p>\u201cWel . Look what the cat dragged in,\u201d Sasha said. One hand on her hip, one hand holding a short stack of papers, her long red curls set off her sharp features. A mature person would admit that Sasha was beautiful\u2014I, however, had accepted long ago that Sasha brought out the stubborn, angry child within.</p><p>\u201cOh, my. Did you get yourself a perm while I was away? I guess the eighties are coming back.\u201d I brushed past her, deciding against shoving my shoulder into her bony arm.</p> <p>\u201cHot rol ers. Grant has made a point to mention the curls today, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Grant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his office. He waited for half an hour in yours. You\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came straight from the airport. Why are you stil here?\u201d</p><p>Sasha shrugged. \u201cI keep whatever hours Grant keeps.\u201d</p> <p>I rol ed my eyes and held out my hand. \u201cAre those for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, handing them over. \u201cI was about to make copies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary. Thanks for staying, but you should head home.\u201d I took the papers and made my way to Grant\u2019s office. His shoeless feet, in hideous tan and green argyle socks, rested on his desk.</p><p>\u201cThere she is: Mrs. Peanut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d I said, setting the documents on his desk. \u201cI told you I would be right over. Why did you send Sasha to make copies of these?\u201d</p><p>Grant covered his face with his hands. \u201cSasha\u2019s a sweet girl\u2014to me\u2014but she\u2019s an overachiever. I\u2019ve been making up things for her to do.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed once. \u201cShe wants the assistant job. That\u2019s why she\u2019s been in your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my hair, in my office, in my desk, in my face, in my way. She\u2019s incorrigible. I honestly don\u2019t have enough for her to do. She refuses to help out in the other departments and won\u2019t leave until I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant. She\u2019s an intern. She shouldn\u2019t refuse to do anything.\u201d</p><p>Grant thought about my comment for a moment and then nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true. You can give her a new assignment in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. You\u2019re not pawning this off on me. Sasha is your problem.\u201d</p><p>Grant fel back against his chair. \u201cI don\u2019t want to upset her, and you don\u2019t seem to mind. I thought you\u2019d be happy to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow has this company lasted so long with such a weenie in charge?\u201d I said, scanning the document. \u201cAre these...bul et points?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had Sasha type it out. I told her I didn\u2019t want to forget anything.\u201d I made a face, and Grant shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t see her for an hour. She had trouble perfecting the margins.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGrant, you know this account inside out. You didn\u2019t need to touch base with me. Just get the damn agreement signed and send them on their way.\u201d I stood, irritated he had wasted my time.</p><p>\u201cI plan on it. The trouble is, this deal has the potential to take Titan in a different direction than what your father had envisioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack envisioned making money. Do the deal.\u201d</p><p>Grant\u2019s shoulders fel , and his eyes lowered to his desk, despondent.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute...,\u201d I said, pointing my finger at him. Grant immediately tensed. He was caught. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to talk about the meeting at all ! You wanted me to take care of Sasha for you!\u201d</p><p>Grant reached out to me. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand! She reorganizes my desk every morning! She makes lists for my to-do lists!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not married to the woman. I can\u2019t believe you pul ed me away from my first night back from my honeymoon for this.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. \u201cHow was it, by the way? Must have been somewhere tropical. You managed a decent tan. I never thought you would run off and get married. Jack wouldn\u2019t have approved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t elope when you\u2019ve been engaged as long as we have. It was more last-minute planning. I\u2019ll cal you tomorrow between classes for updates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Grant said, staring at the information packets on his desk. Sasha had undoubtedly worked on them throughout the week. They were color-coded and alphabetized. \u201cShe...uh...thought it would personalize the packets to put their names on them. In cal igraphy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a cal igrapher?\u201d</p><p>Grant slumped in his chair. \u201cShe thought we should hire one for the task.\u201d</p><p>My face flushed. Grant was now all owing Sasha to misuse company funds for one of her ridiculous whims. \u201cI\u2019ll have a talk with Sasha tomorrow.</p><p>Beth has mentioned that the filing room needs some attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreak it to her gently.\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes. \u201cWeenie.\u201d</p><p>My office looked exactly as I\u2019d left it. Beth had de-cluttered a bit during the week, but other than that, it was untouched. I sat in my father\u2019s chair and let out a cleansing breath. Taking over the company wasn\u2019t supposed to happen until after graduation, and I wondered how I would juggle my last year at Brown with my pregnancy and the pressure of running Titan. I would be a mother before I\u2019d be a col ege graduate. Everything was happening so fast.</p><p>A familiar pair of hands gently touched the bare skin between my shirt and neck. Jared\u2019s thumb massaged into my tense muscles. My head automatical y bowed, and I sighed. Without a word, he kneeled behind me and let his lips trail from my shoulder to my neck. I tilted my head, making the passage easier for him.</p><p>\u201cYou never come in here,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cI must be real y tense.\u201d</p><p>His hand made its way down my shoulder, arm, and then traveled slowly down my side, resting on my stomach. His fingers pressed into my skin, palming my bel y like a basketbal . His firm grip took me off guard, and I felt my eyebrows move in, curious what he was up to. His lips weren\u2019t as soft as they usual y were; instead they felt dry and scratchy.</p><p>\u201cA little lip balm goes a long way, love,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cIs this unpleasant for you?\u201d A voice rasped.</p><p>I looked down. The hand cupping my stomach had pasty, abnormal y long fingers. The nails were filthy, and came to a point at the ends.</p><p>When I turned, a pale face and black eyes were just inches from my face. The creature grinned, revealing two rows of unnatural, razor-sharp teeth.</p><p>I sat up straight and blinked my eyes. The office was dark and quiet, except for the sound of my heart thumping in my ears. My breath was quick and shal ow. The frightening man was no longer behind me, but a dark figure sat in the green chair on the other side of my desk. I gasped.</p><p>Jared reached out. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, touching my fingertips to my chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad dream. I must have dozed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long week,\u201d Jared said, forcing a smal smile. \u201cMy dad wasn\u2019t there, was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, trying to calm myself. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know who it was. Someone with too many teeth.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded once. \u201cI could sense them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr it\u2019s just that I\u2019m pregnant. I\u2019ve read pregnant women notice an increase in nightmares.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. He was always one to imagine the worst. With good reason, granted, but it would be nice if he would admit for once that something perfectly normal could be the culprit. I stood, grabbed my briefcase from the floor, and then shoved my feet into my shoes. I didn\u2019t remember taking them off. I must have been exhausted.</p><p>\u201cClaire cal ed,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan\u2019s fine. They were wondering if we wanted to join them for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re bored.\u201d</p><p>I ran my fingers through my hair and wiped the mascara that had likely smudged under my eyes. \u201cI am hungry. That\u2019s the best time to eat hospital food, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we could bring some take-out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven better,\u201d I said, opening the door. \u201cI know just the place.\u201d Jared put his hand on the knob over mine, and leaned down to kiss my lips.</p><p>Instantly, I felt better. His lips were their usual soft and smooth. Not as warm, though.</p><p>I took a deep breath and smiled. No bul ets raining down, no explosions, and no men breaking into the building with automatic assault rifles. Our first day back would be without event. I dared to hope that Hel would wait until the baby came to bother with threats. Their typical pride and overconfidence would give us a little more time to plan, and to win over some key all ies on the other side.</p><p>As we drove through the streets of Providence, it suddenly seemed like the home I had known in my childhood. In that moment, it wasn\u2019t harboring threats at every corner; it didn\u2019t seem dark and sinister. It was the picturesque, bustling, traffic-heavy town I remembered. Where I was born. Where my child would be born, and where I\u2019d walked the streets with my father. Providence was the backdrop of my love story with Jared. It was stil home, and this is where we would make our stand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re curiously relaxed this evening,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I sighed. \u201cEverything just feels right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s encouraging.\u201d</p><p>We picked up dinner and then made our way to the hospital. When the elevator doors opened, Jared grabbed my hand and led me to Ryan\u2019s room. The door was open, but it was quiet inside.</p><p>Claire sat next to the head of Ryan\u2019s bed. Her head was resting on her fist, and she was smiling at him. Ryan\u2019s fingers mindlessly twisted a section of blanket next to Claire\u2019s arm. They seemed to be engaged in a sweet conversation about nothing in particular. I remembered when I was in that chair, giggling at Ryan\u2019s nonsensical humor, and I was glad to see the light back in his eyes.</p><p>The IVs and telemetry leads were no longer streaming from different parts of his body. He seemed so relaxed with Claire next to him. I reached out for Jared\u2019s hand. His knuckles brushed against mine as our fingers interlaced, and I looked up at him. He was smiling at his baby sister, pleased to see her final y content.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes wandered to the doorway where we stood. Claire slowly turned our direction and offered a smal smile.</p><p>\u201cKnock, knock,\u201d Jared said, holding up the bags of take-out. \u201cCheeseburgers. Nina said it\u2019s your favorite.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s smile turned into a cheesy grin, and he threw his head back. \u201cOh, thank God! I thought I would starve to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ryan said, chewing an oversized wad of cheeseburger. \u201cRed Stripe has the best burgers. Seriously. You shouldn\u2019t do this to me in the hospital. I might think I\u2019ve died and gone to heaven.\u201d</p><p>Claire rol ed her eyes. \u201cCould you be a little more dramatic about a cheeseburger?\u201d</p><p>Ryan stopped chewing, and wiped the bit of ketchup off the corner of his mouth with his wrist. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be jealous of a burger, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d Claire said. She pointed at Ryan. \u201cDo you see what I have to deal with? Wil one of you cal OSHA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jared said. \u201cYou looked fairly pleased when we walked in.\u201d</p><p>Ryan took another bite and then smiled. \u201cShe acts tough every time someone visits. She doesn\u2019t fool me, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else has visited?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMom. Kim. Beth. Chad. Josh...yeah. That\u2019s about it. No, wait....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did that go? With your mom?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Claire frowned, and Ryan winked at her. \u201cIt went fine. She\u2019s developed a theory. Since the last time I was in a hospital you showed up, and now Claire\u2019s here, Mom thinks I\u2019m getting myself hurt over girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d Jared said with a wry smile.</p><p>\u201cShut it, Jared,\u201d Claire warned.</p><p>I handed Ryan his cup of soda. \u201cYou know, this is becoming a habit.\u201d</p><p>His whiskers were far beyond a five o\u2019clock shadow, and his hair had grown downright shaggy. He looked so much older than the last time I\u2019d seen him in that hospital, and nothing like the Marine in the photos he'd sent with his letters. \u201cTel me about it. I thought I said two hospitalizations ago that it was your turn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took a turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so you almost bled out, big deal. I\u2019m three to your one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , I\u2019m pregnant, so I\u2019m due for a hospitalization this year,\u201d I said, processing the words as I spoke them.</p><p>Ryan laughed. \u201cWait...what?\u201d he said, his face morphing from amusement to concern.</p><p>I looked to Claire. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tel him?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, her platinum, angled tresses bouncing when she did so. \u201cIt\u2019s your business to tel . Way to dump it on him, stupid.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Ryan mirrored my expression. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said. He glanced to Jared, sent him a lightning-fast dirty look, and then returned his focus to me. He pushed up in bed, sitting tal er.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Claire watched the exchange, clearly unhappy. I wasn\u2019t sure if she was just sensing Ryan\u2019s change in mood, or if it was her own reaction to the sudden, unpleasant turn in conversation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to say anything,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cYou have my permission,\u201d Jared said. After his last word, he gestured for Ryan to continue.</p><p>Ryan rol ed his eyes and looked to Claire. \u201cIsn\u2019t this exactly what none of you wanted to happen?\u201d</p><p>Claire seemed uncomfortable answering for her brother, but she quickly shrugged it off. \u201cYes and no. Not going along with the prophecy in Shax\u2019s book would have been the safer route\u2014in theory\u2014but Hel would more than likely stil anticipate its completion. Now that it\u2019s happened, it\u2019s a means to an end. We have a better chance at getting Heaven on our side.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ryan was right to ask Claire. Jared was wel known for lengthy explanations. Claire went right to the point.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes drifted away from Claire to me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cGreat. Fantastic, actual y. I feel like I could run a marathon.\u201d</p><p>Ryan smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d He turned to Claire. \u201cThat\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p> <p>Her nose wrinkled. \u201cWhy are you asking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ryan shrugged, \u201cI thought you might know better than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Claire stood, laughing once. \u201cI\u2019m hardly the expert. It\u2019s never been an option for me, so I didn\u2019t bother asking my mother about the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be an option?\u201d</p><p>Claire rol ed her eyes. \u201cBecause I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith what?\u201d he said, dubious.</p><p>Claire placed both of her palms facedown on the bed and looked at Ryan. \u201cKeeping you alive.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s hand slid slowly across the blanket. His fingers layered hers. \u201cWel ...what if we were together? That could make it an option.\u201d</p><p>Claire straightened quickly and crossed her arms. \u201cDream on.\u201d</p><p>The corners of his mouth turned up. He enjoyed unsettling Claire far too much for his own good. \u201cAm I wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all ,\u201d she said, shifting her weight, \u201cit\u2019s never going to happen. Second, I\u2019d have a hard time protecting you when I\u2019m as round as a bowling bal .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI bet you could,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI can stay out of trouble for nine months.\u201d</p><p>Claire raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay out of trouble for one month. You\u2019ve been hospitalized, had major surgeries, and needed extensive rehabilitation three times in as many years.\u201d</p><p>His eyes turned soft. \u201cI would if I had to. I\u2019d do it for you.\u201d</p><p>She cupped her hand over his mouth. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>Jared fidgeted, feeling out of place. \u201cUh...we should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Claire said. She pul ed back her hand and wiped it on her leggings. \u201cNo, you should stay. I\u2019ll uh...I\u2019ll get more chairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Jared said. He briefly kissed my cheek before fol owing Claire into the hal .</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said, taking a seat beside the bed. \u201cYou can clear a room better than I. And that\u2019s saying something.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s tough. Tougher than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo...I mean yes, but not in the physical way. She\u2019s here every second while I heal. I know she has to watch over me, but she doesn\u2019t have to sit beside my bed and hold my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe holds your hand?\u201d</p><p>Ryan offered a half-smile. \u201cThe first morning\u2014when I woke up\u2014she was holding my hand with both of hers. The second I opened my eyes, she let go. But yes, she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but you don\u2019t have to torture her. By her actions, she must care about you. This is Claire you\u2019re dealing with. You can\u2019t force it.\u201d</p><p>Ryan turned on his side, leaning on his elbow. \u201cNina, you\u2019re pregnant. Some rough shit is going to go down. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe the day you give birth to Lil\u2019 Bitty Saint Ryel.\u201d He pointed to my stomach, \u201cBut I think we can all agree that taking time for granted is precarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecarious,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m so impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your face,\u201d Ryan grinned. \u201cI love her. I want to be with her. And not just around her. It\u2019s even worse knowing she\u2019s not here, but she\u2019s stil somewhere around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d I said. My eyes unfocused as I remembered a not-so-distant past where I struggled studying in my dorm room at Andrews Hal , knowing Jared was somewhere nearby. Talking into a microphone hanging from my wal , standing in the freezing rain. Knowing he would come.</p><p>\u201cI think she likes me, too, she just won\u2019t admit it. I just gotta crack that shel .\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s voice snapped me back to reality. \u201cGood luck,\u201d I said.</p><p>Claire and Jared returned carrying chairs in their arms.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Ryan said, looking straight at Claire. She stood, speechless.</p><p>\u201cSmooth,\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201cI...uh...,\u201d Claire said, looking around. She sat the chairs on the floor and then looked at her brother. \u201cSomeone else might visit...I better get more chairs.\u201d</p><p>When the door closed behind her, Ryan looked down and laughed once without humor. \u201cSo stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than stupid,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s head jerked up. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her do her job,\u201d Jared said, his voice flat.</p><p>\u201cComing from you? That\u2019s hysterical.\u201d</p><p>The tension between them thickened the air in the room. \u201cCome on, guys,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes were tight, and Ryan leaned forward a bit. Any civility between them had always seemed forced. It was only a matter of time before they exchanged words.</p><p>Jared shifted. \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean, exactly, Ryan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to forget why everyone is in this mess to begin with. If you\u2019d done your job by the book, none of this would have happened. So how about you let us all make our own choices without judgment?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s body was rigid; his jaw tight. I waited for him to let Ryan have it\u2014to come back with one of his undeniable and logical retorts, but he didn\u2019t. Without a word, he left the room.</p><p>\u201cFinal y...he\u2019s speechless,\u201d Ryan said, relaxing back against the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ryan frowned. \u201cWhy not? Because he\u2019s Jared? He has no problem tel ing everyone else what they\u2019ve done wrong, but he hasn\u2019t made the best choices, either. He insinuated I\u2019m keeping Claire from doing her job when he was in the same situation not too long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why defend him? Why can\u2019t you just say, \u2018Ryan, you\u2019re right. Jared\u2019s wrong.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s trying his best. Because everything he does, he tries to do what\u2019s right, and what is in everyone\u2019s best interest. He loves me, and you rubbing it in his face after the fact is just cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should keep his opinions to himself,\u201d Ryan said, crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cTrying to hold on to some control in a situation where he has none is not unreasonable. Claire is his baby sister. He\u2019s loved her far longer than you have, and he has firsthand knowledge of how hard it is to be in love with your Taleh. He\u2019s just trying to save her from what we\u2019ve experienced.</p><p>You should think about that.\u201d</p><p>Ryan raised an eyebrow. \u201cSo you regret it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou regret fal ing in love with him? Knowing everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and no! Of course not. It\u2019s just hard, that\u2019s all .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA normal relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you know about normal people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a few!\u201d I said. Ryan was attempting to subdue a smile. He enjoyed getting under my skin. Poor Claire. She wasn\u2019t the most patient person, anyway, and the most annoying, argumentative, persistent butt nugget\u2014as Bex had once cal ed him\u2014was in love with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling about?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing. Feel better,\u201d I said, waving to him before opening the door.</p><p>\u201cWait! You\u2019re going to leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re never alone,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Jared stood in the hal way with Claire. She was looking up at him, whispering words of comfort. He seemed to be a bit calmer, listening to her every word.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all yours,\u201d I smiled to Claire.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Claire said.</p><p>I took Jared\u2019s hand. \u201cHe knows the exact thing to say to throw you into a rage, and you just let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different with him. I can\u2019t explain it other than pure, unadulterated hatred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce upon a time it was me he was after, and now he\u2019s being just as annoying while pursuing your baby sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t what?\u201d he said, clueless as to where I was going with the conversation. A rush of exhilaration swept over me. Jared being on the wrong side of enlightenment was quite satisfying.</p><p>\u201cIn love with Claire. Honey,\u201d I said, standing on my tiptoes to wrap my arms around his neck, \u201cthis is a very good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you, maybe,\u201d Claire grumbled.</p><p>\u201cDid you forget what it means that he loves her? They are meant to be together; not him and me. Best of all ? You would\u2019ve had to deal with Ryan either way, but because he loves Claire, it isn\u2019t because you\u2019re watching him annoy the crap out of me\u2014it\u2019s because he\u2019s annoying Claire.\u201d I al owed a proud, wide smile to stretch across my face, even though Claire looked as if she wanted to shove her fist into the wal . Through my face.</p><p>Jared\u2019s face relaxed, and he chuckled. \u201cAl true,\u201d he said, leaning down to kiss me. \u201cIt could be worse. Much worse.\u201d He looked to Claire. \u201cSorry.</p><p>Good luck.\u201d</p><p>She glared at both of us as we departed down the hal .</p><p>\u201cEr...hey, Nina?\u201d Claire cal ed.</p><p>I turned, noticing again how tiny she was. Her skintight blue leggings and oversized, off-the-shoulder T-shirt made her seem even smal er. Her ankle-high boots scooted across the hospital floor as she approached.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She laced her fingers on top of her head, clearly exasperated. \u201cYou real y think I\u2019m just being stubborn? You think that\u2019s why he\u2019s my Taleh? Because we\u2019re meant for each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cYou care about him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she shrugged. She let one hand fal to her side; the other to her mouth. \u201cI guess so.\u201d.</p><p>I looked to Jared and gestured with my eyes to Claire. Jared frowned, but when I persistently jerked my head in Claire\u2019s direction, he spoke up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Claire. I can\u2019t say I like the guy, but I don\u2019t see another purpose for it to happen the way it did. Do you? Because if you do, I\u2019d love to hear \u2014 mmph,\u201d he puffed, jerking when I elbowed him in the ribs. I didn\u2019t hurt him, of course, but I stil enjoyed his reaction.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Claire whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t see another purpose.\u201d She walked slowly to Ryan\u2019s door, deep in thought. She turned the knob, and then shook her head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I should muddy the waters.\u201d</p><p>We fol owed her in, noticing her pulling her chair farther away from Ryan\u2019s bed. She ate her burger quietly, and Ryan watched her for a moment, and then looked down when he realized he wouldn\u2019t get the reaction he\u2019d hoped for.</p><p>I felt bad for him. I knew all too wel how awful it felt to love someone who insisted on keeping a distance. \u201cSo you\u2019re feeling better? When do you report back for duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey gave me a week off. Too bad I wasn\u2019t on duty when this happened. Could have saved me a chunk of change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the bil , Ryan,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Ryan opened his mouth to argue, but he knew it was futile. He had no way to pay for what the little insurance he had wouldn\u2019t cover. He managed a humble nod. \u201cThis is my last time. Next time it\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn. I\u2019m not playin\u2019 around. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s frown softened, the corners of her mouth turned up an infinitesimal amount. Her expression reminded me of the way Jared used to try to hide his emotions when he was fighting tooth and nail to stay away from me. Claire definitely had an uphil battle. Ryan was far more persistent than me.</p><p>We enjoyed our late-night dinner, teasing one another about our last few days together before Jared and I left for Little Corn. Ryan recounted his recovery, and Claire halfheartedly complained about being his nursemaid. Mentions of demons, Shax, and Isaac sprung in and out of our conversation. Discussing the paranormal elements of my life outside of the Ryels felt both a relief and strange. But, there we were: sitting around a room, discussing the sickening odor of the hundreds of misshapen creatures scaling the wal s of St. Ann\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard about Father Francis?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Claire nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s home. The first night was touch and go, and then he came right out of it. His doctors were amazed.\u201d</p><p>Jared touched my hand. Ryan\u2019s eyes zeroed in on the movement.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI hear you two skipped town for a while. You\u2019re...tanner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, nodding once. \u201cWe went to Little Corn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>Claire\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t leave Ryan\u2019s face. She watched warily for an expression she didn\u2019t want to see.</p><p>Jared squeezed my hand. \u201cWe decided to get married in the chapel there.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded. It was obvious an inner monologue was monopolizing his thoughts. Claire didn\u2019t move. She waited silently, but I couldn\u2019t decide what she was waiting for.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear her say that she\u2019s pregnant?\u201d Claire said with disgust.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s head jerked in her direction. \u201cYeah? So?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWe were engaged, anyway, Ryan. It didn\u2019t make sense to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re married. To Jared.\u201d Ryan\u2019s eyes were wide with shock, his eyebrows as high as he could push them. Claire\u2019s body was tense, her eyes fixed on Ryan. In the next moment, a wide grin plastered across his face.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Nigh! That\u2019s wicked awesome!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Claire\u2019s blank stare melted away, and she took a deep breath. She managed a smal smile, and then looked to me. Had I not seen the same pleading expression on Jared\u2019s face the year before, I might have missed it. She was worried that Ryan was stil in love with me.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, looking down.</p><p>Thinking back on the past year, the dynamic between the four of us couldn\u2019t have been more different. Even so, it seemed every word uttered, every decision each of us made, led us to this very moment. Ryan looked at Claire with nothing less than adoration, and Jared reached over, resting his palm on my stomach.</p><p>A knock on the door abruptly disturbed our sweet little moment.</p> <p>\u201cKim!\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>Her clothes were dirty, hair a mess. A smal brown satchel hung from her shoulder, secured under her arm. I assumed it was the book. She was forced to keep it with her at all times. Kim was the only one that could keep the Naissance de Demoniac safe from Shax and his demons.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look like herself at all . \u201cYou!\u201d She pointed to Jared. \u201cYou made me a promise, Half Breed, and you\u2019re going to keep it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Broken Promise(s)</p> <p>Kim breathed hard; her arm outstretched with a pointed finger just shy of Jared\u2019s nose. The air in the room was immediately heavy, the hairs on my neck stood on end. The Others were fol owing her more closely, now, just waiting for her to make a mistake. Shax was back in Hel where he belonged, but his failure only made him more determined to have his property returned to him before Kim and Jared hand it over to the safety of the Holy Sepulchre Church in Jerusalem.</p><p>The constant presence of the enemy had taken a tol on Kim. The skin under her eyes was a deep shade of purple. Kim\u2019s typical y flippant and impervious nature had slowly slipped away over the last two years. Her possession as a teenager had left her with the ability to take power from demons that Hel didn\u2019t understand, making her the perfect guardian of the book\u2014until it could be returned to the one place Shax couldn\u2019t reach.</p><p>She was just as desperate to free her family from the Naissance de Demoniac as Shax was to take it from them.</p><p>A nurse walked in, momentarily taking notice of Kim\u2019s curious body language, but quickly dismissed it when she began taking Ryan\u2019s vitals.</p><p>Pul ing the stethoscope from her ears, the nurse seemed satisfied. \u201cDoc said you can be discharged, but because it\u2019s late, he wants to keep you one more night and let you go first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Kim lowered her hand, letting it fal to her thigh.</p> <p>\u201cAgh....\u201d Ryan huffed. His expression screwed into disgust.</p><p>Claire rol ed her eyes. \u201cOne more night is nothing. Quit whining.\u201d</p><p>One side of Ryan\u2019s mouth pul ed up. \u201cWhen I get home, you can come into the apartment, you know. You don\u2019t have to sit outside in the Lotus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I can\u2019t do my job properly and listen to you flap your jaws all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk,\u201d Ryan grinned.</p><p>Jared stood. \u201cOn that note We\u2019ll be leaving,\u201d he looked to me, \u201cpreferably before I vomit cheeseburger in Ryan\u2019s lap for insinuating anything remotely intimate about my baby sister.\u201d</p><p>Claire was speechless, and I frowned. \u201cRyan. Real y?\u201d</p><p>Ryan laughed hysterical y.</p> <p>Jared promptly led me to the elevator by the hand. He couldn\u2019t get away from Ryan fast enough. Kim fol owed us into the hal way. Jared pushed the button, and then waited for Kim to speak.</p><p>She crossed her arms, already saying what she had come to say. She watched Jared expectantly.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI need more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised. What are you waiting for, anyway? Nina is pregnant. The prophecy has begun. It can only go one of two ways now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to take it back to Woonsocket and spend a couple of days with Father Francis. We could find a weakness. We could find a way to avoid a confrontation all together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s reaching, even for you,\u201d Kim said. Her pale cheeks were turning a soft shade of red. Kim being upset was so foreign to me that I almost couldn\u2019t process it.</p><p>\u201cYou and Nina just have a few weeks before summer break. Nina can\u2019t miss any more classes, and I can\u2019t go without her.\u201d</p><p>Kim narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou think I care about classes? This is serious, Jared. You promised that if I helped you get the book back, you would help me return it to Jerusalem. You promised.\u201d</p><p>Jared rubbed the back of his neck, clearly frustrated. The elevator door opened, and he pul ed both Kim and I inside. An elderly couple walked toward the door. The older gentleman held up his hand, signaling for us to hold the elevator, but Jared quickly pushed the button for the doors to close.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d I said, appal ed. \u201cRemind me why we can\u2019t just let Shax have the damn thing?\u201d</p><p>Kim shot a sharp look in my direction. \u201cBecause it gives him tremendous power, power that someone from the days of Jesus was so afraid for him to have, they risked taking it from him. Now that your fathers have pissed him off, if we hand over his bible, the first person he\u2019l annihilate with that power is you.\u201d</p><p>Jared squared his shoulders and lowered his chin. \u201cI understand that you want to return the book and why. Trust me, I do. But when we...once we do this, Kim...it can\u2019t be undone. I wil never get this chance again.\u201d</p><p>Kim matched his glare. \u201cThen get it done.\u201d</p><p>The elevator door slid open, and Kim walked into the main lobby of the hospital. She didn\u2019t say another word, and she didn\u2019t acknowledge me at al .</p><p>Jared and I walked to the Escalade in silence. Both of their arguments made sense. Who could disagree with either side when they both wanted to protect someone they love? My first inclination was to insist Jared hold up his end of their bargain, but protecting me meant protecting our child.</p><p>Bean was my first priority.</p><p>Jared seemed even more conflicted than I. He was a good man, and going against his word clearly bothered him. He was right; we needed to search every clue\u2014every figurative and literal meaning of every paragraph of the prophecy. Forcing Heaven and Hel into a war was a last resort, and we couldn\u2019t be sure unless we explored every option.</p><p>I slept fitful y that night, dreaming about wars and demons and of Bean. My brain ran incessantly, stuck in a pattern of scaring myself awake, and then fal ing back asleep, only to imagine a new frightening scenario. In the hospital, in St. Ann\u2019s, in the Loft, we fought the demons over and over, but every dream ended the same: Bean would be in my arms one moment, gone the next. Panic would take over my every thought, but we all knew it was too late, and nothing more could be done. Desperation would plague me as I insisted Jared figure out a way to find and save our baby, and then unbearable sorrow when I realized it was over...and then my eyes would open.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Jared whispered, fol owing my name with smooth, short phrases in French. For whatever reason, French always seemed to comfort me, and Jared could sense that. His fingers combed through my hair, and his lips grazed the edge of my ear.</p><p>The sun cast shadows on every wal of my bedroom. I blinked, trying both to clear my vision and remember what day it was, reminding myself that what seemed like a lifetime of heartbreak was only a dream.</p><p>Jared kissed my cheek, and I turned to face him. \u201cThat was a rough night,\u201d I said. A tear fel from the outside corner of my eye, down my temple.</p><p>Jared used his sleeve to wipe the wet line away. \u201cI noticed.\u201d</p><p>I looked out the window. \u201cYou know what wil make me feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraining.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded. \u201cI thought you might say that. When do you want to start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight, after I put some time in at Titan. Is Bex busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ll ask him, but he\u2019s always up for some sparring with you.\u201d</p><p>I forced a sleepy grin. \u201cYou should cut in once in a while. I\u2019m sure I bore him to death.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I\u2019m going to whip up some blueberry pancakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to whip up a lather in the shower. Do we have salsa?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s head jerked back a bit. \u201cI think we have some left, yeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to dip my pancakes in it.\u201d</p><p>Jared wrinkled his nose and stuck out his tongue. \u201cSo hold the maple syrup, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want the syrup, too,\u201d I said, ambling to the bathroom. I didn\u2019t look behind me to see what revolted expression was on Jared\u2019s face, but he didn\u2019t move from the bed until I turned on the shower.</p><p>He was probably beyond disgusted, but it did sound good. What wasn\u2019t appetizing about fresh, spicy tomatoes, cilantro, onion, blueberries and pancake batter soaked in maple syrup? My stomach growled. I was suddenly ravenous.</p><p>I rushed through my morning routine, and yanked on a Brown University pul over hoody and a pair of jeans. The button was being stubborn, so I sucked in. When I stil couldn\u2019t get it buttoned, I lay on the bed. Coupled with sucking in, I final y got it fastened. I made my way down the stairs, uncomfortable and stiff.</p><p>\u201cWe need to do some shopping tonight instead of sparring,\u201d Jared said, joining me.</p><p>\u201cWe can do both,\u201d I said. \u201cJust don\u2019t take me to a maternity store. I\u2019m not ready for that yet.\u201d</p><p>Jared shrugged. \u201cFair enough. I just want to make sure you\u2019re both comfortable.\u201d</p><p>I made a show of looking around the room. \u201cDid you eat my salsa pancakes?\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed once. \u201cAbsolutely not. Cynthia beat me to the cupboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s making pancakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and she\u2019s not serving salsa, either.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI sort of had my heart set.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia\u2019s high heels clicked against the tile as she brought in a tray and set it on the table. She placed an empty plate in front of me, and then sat a tal glass of an indiscriminate frozen cocktail on the plate. She added a bowl of fresh fruit, a bran muffin, and a slice of tomato.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the glass?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cFresh fruit, yogurt and peanut butter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds awful,\u201d I groaned.</p><p>\u201cBut salsa pancakes are appetizing?\u201d Jared said. I shot him an annoyed glare.</p><p>Cynthia nodded to my breakfast. \u201cIt\u2019s quite good, I assure you. I can\u2019t do this every morning. I happened to have a cancel ation, but I do expect you to eat wel .\u201d</p><p>Al expression left my face. \u201cYou know, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Cynthia offered a smal smile. \u201cI know everything, Nina, dear. Now, feed my grandchild. I\u2019ll see you at dinner.\u201d</p><p>She untied the strings of her apron and hung it over a chair, clicking her heels to the foyer.</p><p>I stared at the concoction in the glass. \u201cI official y believe that I wil never know what to expect from my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d</p><p>I drank the PB and Fruit smoothie\u2014which was actual y quite tasty\u2014and gathered my things for class. Jared walked me to the Escalade, but I put my hand on his arm before we left the drive. \u201cI almost forgot. I have to stop by Titan and speak to Sasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. To banish her to the file room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer ridiculous crush is costing me money,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cShe hired a cal igrapher to write names on the new client packets!\u201d</p><p>Jared made a strange face, unsure how to react, and then turned the wheel toward Titan. I practiced what I might say to Sasha during the drive.</p><p>Part of me wanted to smash all of her hopes and dreams like she deserved; the other insisted on breaking it to her gently. By the time Jared pul ed up to the curb, I had given up on my dastardly plan of revenge, instead settling on a gentler speech. That decision put me in a less than amiable mood.</p><p>\u201cSee you soon,\u201d Jared said, kissing my cheek.It took some doing to find Sasha, but after looking everywhere else, I headed to the file room in the basement. The room was missing several lights; the only one ful y lit was blinking. I stepped in, the concrete echoing under my feet.</p><p>\u201cSasha?\u201d</p><p>I slowly walked down the aisle, looking to each side of me.</p><p>A smal , muffled noise came from a dark corner of the room. The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I was alone, but something was inside that room with me.</p><p>I took a breath, and then walked as quietly as I could to the end of the aisle, turning toward the noise. A dark, huddled figure was slumped with its back turned to me. In the failing light I could see it shivering.</p><p>\u201cH...hel o?\u201d</p><p>The figure froze. Adrenaline seared through my veins. Immediately every move, every act of defense I had learned replayed in my mind. My hands bal ed into fists, and I braced myself for a fight.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d Sasha hissed. She gasped, and her body shivered again.</p><p>Every taut muscle in my body released, and anger served as an outlet for the adrenaline. \u201cWhat the hel are you doing down here?\u201d</p><p>Sasha turned, wiping her eyes. \u201cPeter said Grant was out for the day, and that I needed to straighten up down here until you came in. Does he think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d She stood. \u201cWhy would I want to work for someone that doesn\u2019t appreciate me, anyway? I wouldn\u2019t. I am far too talented to be sentenced to the file room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSasha. You misused company resources.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was approved!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an intern. Interns don\u2019t hire cal igraphers or order cappuccino machines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant loves cappuccinos!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he can buy one for his office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the CEO!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I breathed. \u201cHe\u2019s not. Report to Peter when you\u2019re finished with the file room so he can give you a list of new duties. You wil work in Peter\u2019s department, now, so he is your immediate supervisor, and he wil handle your evaluation. If you need anything, Peter wil be happy to address your concerns.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNina!\u201d</p><p>I walked out of the basement and took a deep breath. It was the first time my lungs felt like they were getting air. I noticed another, newer, male intern walking down the hal , and cal ed him over.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mrs. Ryel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lights in the file room need attention. Cal maintenance and have the bulbs replaced or repaired immediately, and please help Sasha with whatever she needs. You\u2019l find her at the end of the third aisle. And do not, under any circumstances, leave her alone.\u201d</p> <p>The intern frowned with confusion. \u201cY-yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He stood there for a moment, every thought scrol ing across his face.</p><p>\u201cWel ? Go.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, hastily making his way down the hal to the file room, and I paused, disturbed by the distinct Cynthia-like tone in my voice just then.</p><p>I rushed up the stairs, squinting from the bright sunlight bursting through the windows of the lobby. When I made it to the Escalade, Jared watched me warily.</p><p>\u201cWas there a problem?\u201d he said.</p> <p>I took his hand. \u201cThey were in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey, Jared,\u201d I sighed. I put my elbow on the console and covered my eyes with my fingers. \u201cI could feel them.\u201d Jared was quiet, so I peeked up at him. He seemed confused. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t feel them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think they were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was creeped out, for one. I\u2019ve been around them enough to know what it feels like when they\u2019re around. Sasha was down there crying; negative energy in the air; it was cold.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s mouth pul ed to one side. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that\u2014,\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust,\u201d I sighed, irritated, \u201cthis one time, trust me. I\u2019m not a Hybrid, but they were in there. Not many, but I could feel them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... I couldn\u2019t feel them. It doesn\u2019t make sense that you could and I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it.\u201d I thought for a moment. \u201cCould you sense me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You were just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not just fine. I genuinely believed something was about to attack me. You didn\u2019t sense that?\u201d</p><p>Jared shifted to face me, his face darkened with concern. \u201cYou were afraid.\u201d His tone was more of a statement than a question.</p><p>\u201cMy adrenaline was about to shoot through my eyes! I thought your senses were heightened?\u201d</p><p>Jared eyes bounced around the cab of the Escalade as his mind tried to work out the details of this new development. He was clearly not taking it wel . He faced forward, and shoved the gear in drive.</p> <p>\u201cJared,\u201d I said, my voice low and soothing. It didn\u2019t work.</p><p>He slammed the gear back into park, and his hand flew to his head. He hit the steering wheel. \u201cJust when I think I\u2019m ahead ... something else gets thrown at me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, We\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d I reached to touch his arm.</p><p>He gripped the steering wheel. \u201cHow can I keep you safe from Hel without being your shadow if I can\u2019t trust my senses? If I don\u2019t have any to trust?\u201d His eyes were desperate.</p><p>\u201cSo be my shadow.\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed once, and then shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t go to class with you. I can\u2019t fol ow you around Titan, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be within earshot. You said it yourself. You can hear me through the crowd at the Superbowl.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded, putting the gear into drive once more, but he was beyond listening to reason. He negotiated the one-way streets of downtown Providence without effort, and then pul ed next to the curb behind Andrews Hal . He opened my door, and gestured for me to cross the street.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m walking you to class. You\u2019ve only got a few weeks left. I\u2019ll wait for you in the hal way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you real y think that\u2019s necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fast, but so are they. They are capable of a lot of damage in the few seconds it would take me to get to you from here. Without being able to sense when something\u2019s wrong, I would feel better being closer than not.\u201d</p><p>I thought a moment, and then nodded. Anything that was safer for Bean had to be the right answer.</p><p>The last few weeks of school came and went without incident. Jared stood in the hal way during my classes, and joined me, Beth and Chad for lunch. Without Ryan around, Josh found another table, and Kim was too angry with Jared to tolerate him.</p><p>The crisp air was just a memory by the time my junior year at Brown ended. The Main Green bustled with students who made their way to the Van Winkle Gates to see the graduating class make their last march through.</p><p>Before the last stragglers made their way through the gate, Beth, Chad, Jared and I walked to Col ege Hil to beat the rush. Beth prattled on about her family begging her and Chad to visit over the summer. She barely noticed the congested traffic. She had become a true East Coast woman.</p><p>Even her accent had diminished. She sounded more like Ryan than her family.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s for lunch?\u201d I asked, tapping Beth\u2019s arm.</p><p>Jared squeezed my hand. \u201cI thought we would revisit the place of our first date.\u201d</p><p>Beth slipped me a box, a bit larger than her hand, and without warning, I tossed it to Jared. I loved throwing things at him, because he always caught them. It had become our little inside joke.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour birthday present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the ninth, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I said with a mischievous grin. \u201cI wanted to surprise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess it is,\u201d he said. He kissed my cheek, and then pul ed on the ribbon. \u201cA book?\u201d He thumbed through the pages. \u201cA blank book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA journal. You were down to the pages of yours, and I thought it would be a good time to start a new one.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes turned soft, and he took me into his arms. \u201cIt is the perfect time.\u201d</p><p>Chad rol ed his eyes, and Beth sighed. \u201cI remember that,\u201d she said, her thoughts lost in the sweet, mysterious first days of my relationship with Jared.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ryel. You\u2019re making me look bad.\u201d</p><p>We walked across campus, taking in the atmosphere. Electricity seemed to be in the air, along with the smel s of summer. The chatter was louder than was normal; the young faces of students more animated. They would all embark on vacations, travel home, or spend their summer break on the beach or by the pool. I would most likely fil my summer trying to land punches on brother-in-law, or watching Jared read over the Naissance de Demoniac. The beach sounded much better.</p><p>Jared stopped in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Beth breathed, looking up at the building that was once Blaze.</p><p>I glanced at her, and then fol owed her gaze. \u201cShanghai? I thought you said you wanted to go to Blaze?\u201d</p><p>Clearly disturbed, Jared let go of my hand. \u201cDid you know about this?\u201d Jared asked Chad.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chad said, shaking his head. \u201cBut I\u2019d never eaten at Blaze, either.\u201d</p><p>I looked around, and realized we were standing in front of what used to be Blaze. The location of our first date was gone, replaced by sushi takeout. My jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I said to no one in particular.</p><p>Beth\u2019s mouth pul ed to one side. \u201cI was looking forward to their sweet potato fries.\u201d</p><p>I felt my eyes bulge. \u201cJared!\u201d</p><p>Chad huffed. \u201cThey stil have one on the east side. On Hope Street, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this. I just can\u2019t believe they....\u201d My voice trailed off, too upset to finish.</p><p>Beth rubbed my shoulder. \u201cThat has to be upsetting. I\u2019m sorry, honey.\u201d</p><p>Chad grabbed Beth\u2019s hand and stomped up the stairs. \u201cThis is not a tragedy. It spoils the sentimentality, yes, but it\u2019s stil the same building. Make new memories. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>Jared pul ed me to his side. \u201cIt\u2019s bothersome, but Chad\u2019s right. We can\u2019t do anything about it. If we are in the mood for sweet potato fries, we can go to the east side.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThey have them at Cuban Revolution downtown, too.\u201d Jared nodded, and then led me up the stairs. I trudged behind him, unwil ing to let go of my disappointment.</p><p>We stood in line with Beth and Chad. Jared reminded me that because I was pregnant, I should skip the sushi, so I grudgingly looked for something else. Double disappointment for the day. I silently hoped Bex wouldn\u2019t be busy later. I had a sudden urge to take a swing at someone.</p><p>We went to Shanghai. It stil overlooked Thayer Street just as I remembered, and it stil had some leftover lighting from Blaze. Beth giggled at Chad\u2019s overzealous appetite. Jared smiled at them, and reached under the table to touch my knee. Life seemed so ridiculously laid back that the only issue I had to complain about was the closing of our favorite restaurant. That thought caused the corners of my mouth to turn up, and I continued shoveling my chicken and shrimp Pad Thai. As much as I wanted to hate their food out of spite, it was good. So good, in fact, that my plate was empty before Chad\u2019s.</p><p>Beth stared at me. \u201cYou should have mentioned earlier that you were hungry, Nigh. We wouldn\u2019t have waited until you were starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was starving,\u201d I said, leaning back in my chair. I looked down, noticing that my stomach had already started to pooch out.</p><p>Beth rol ed her eyes. \u201cOh, please. If you even think about saying you\u2019re fat....\u201d Her words fel away as she noticed my protruding bel y as wel .</p><p>\u201cFood baby?\u201d</p><p>I looked to Jared, and nodded. \u201cReal baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Beth wailed.</p><p>\u201cThat was a productive honeymoon,\u201d Chad said.</p><p>\u201cWhen were you going to tel me? I\u2019m your best friend, and I had to find out because you started showing? How long have you known?\u201d Beth was obviously upset, but her high-pitched whines had garnered the attention of everyone in the restaurant.</p><p>Jared leaned in and kept his voice low. \u201cJust a few weeks, Beth. You\u2019re one of the first to know, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>Beth frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s already showing and you\u2019ve only known for a few weeks? I don\u2019t believe it. You\u2019re only going to have a real, live baby. Why would I need to know something so trivial? It\u2019s not like I need to prepare at work or anything.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. Beth was grumbling to herself at that point. \u201cI should have told you earlier, Beth. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>A grin exploded across her face, and she rested her chin on her fist. \u201cYou\u2019re forgiven. When can we go shopping? Do you know if it\u2019s a boy or a girl?\u201d I didn\u2019t mirror her fervor, instead sensing the same overwhelming nausea I felt when Lil ian bombarded me with wedding magazines two years earlier.</p><p>Jared took a breath. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. It\u2019s stil new and overwhelming to Nina, so perhaps giving her a break from the reality of it would help the most for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. You\u2019re right. We can talk about all that later,\u201d she said, waving her hand dismissively.</p><p>We finished eating and left. A minute later, we waited at the light\u2014the same light Jared had honked at me nearly scaring me to death right after we first met. Beth had resorted to not talking at all , instead of risking saying something she wasn\u2019t supposed to. Chad tried distracting her with other questions, but she only offered nods or head shakes.</p><p>Just as the light turned green, an arm reached across me, grabbing Jared\u2019s elbow.</p><p>\u201cLong time no see,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>Beth smiled, but Kim was obviously not in an amiable mood.</p><p>\u201cI said I would cal you,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Kim raised an eyebrow. \u201cI know you did. Three days ago. I\u2019m not waiting any longer, Jared.\u201d</p><p>If I didn\u2019t know of her struggle with exhaustion, I would have thought she\u2019d broken her nose. The purplish skin under her eyes looked like twin bruises. The whites of her eyes were bloodshot, and her shoulders sagged. I knew that look all too wel , and I understood her desperation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re just going to have to.\u201d</p><p>Kim took a step toward him. \u201cI don\u2019t think you heard me. I\u2019m. Not. Waiting. Any longer.\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed, but he didn\u2019t flinch from her glare. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we have. A lot.\u201d</p><p>A nervous giggle emanated from Beth\u2019s throat, and she shifted uncomfortably. \u201cWaiting for what?\u201d</p><p>Jared and Kim looked at Beth, and Kim shot an amused glare back at Jared. \u201cTel her.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re being unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we waiting for? Again?\u201d Beth said, her voice stil unsure.</p><p>Kim crossed her arms. \u201cMy ancestors are Crusade Knights, and I inherited the duty of watching over a book my great-great-times-a-thousand grandfather took from a church in Jerusalem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it worth a lot of money?\u201d Chad asked.</p><p>Beth jabbed her elbow in his ribs.</p><p>\u201cKim,\u201d I warned.</p><p>\u201cSo Jerry over here is half-angel, and he\u2019s the only one strong enough to help me get it back without getting myself kill ed. Only he\u2019s being selfish, and even though I helped him save Nina\u2019s life, he\u2019s not going to help me take it back, now, because he got what he wanted and isn\u2019t going to hold up his end of the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim!\u201d I yel ed.</p><p>Beth began laughing hysterical y. \u201cOh, wow! That\u2019s a whopper!\u201d Her Oklahoma accent came back with a vengeance. \u201cWhere do you get this stuff, Kim?\u201d</p><p>Kim looked to Jared, desperation in her voice and tears in her eyes. \u201cYou need me on your side. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d She walked away, leaving Beth and the rest of us quiet and unnerved.</p><p>Jared watched her trudge back to the Sentra. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of time.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Breakthrough</p><p>The oak tree loomed over us, casting a large shadow from the afternoon sun. The sweet summer breeze wafted along the uncut grass, making the delicate petals of the flowering dogwood dance with the violets. Heaven never felt quite as close as when I was on a blanket with Jared by our oak tree, with our names scrawled elegantly in the bark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bean had grown for weeks without threat, but Jared and I weren\u2019t fooled into thinking we would live the entire summer without event. We enjoyed the peaceful moments while we stil had them, and that afternoon was no different.</p><p>Jared was studying Shax\u2019s book. He hunched over the ugly pages, knees up. One hand held the ancient leather apart while the other rested on my stomach. The book seemed out of place in our quiet, beautiful afternoon.</p><p>Jared\u2019s phone buzzed. He barely glanced in its direction and continued reading. He did that often when Kim cal ed, resorting to ignoring her instead of repeating his reasons for holding onto the book. I could relate to her misery. Even so, it was easier to look the other way while Jared searched for answers while he could. To admit that to myself made me feel horrible, but it was a necessary evil. The choice to be a better mother than a friend wasn\u2019t real y a choice at all .</p><p>A motor hummed in the distance. \u201cYou should probably get your sneakers on,\u201d Jared said. \u201cBex is here.\u201d</p> <p>Bex was bringing firearms today. We would add target practice to our daily sparring session. His motorcycle came to a stop at the edge of my blanket.</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cThat blanket is worth more than your bike.\u201d</p><p>Bex took off his helmet and snorted. \u201cNegative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSentimental value,\u201d Jared said, keeping his eyes on the book.</p><p>Now fourteen, Bex\u2019s body had fil ed out. He was an inch tal er than Jared, and could have been mistaken for a man in his early twenties. Except for the childlike sweetness that remained in his eyes and his occasional displays of inexperience, I would never believe that he was the same person as the eleven-year-old I had met a few years before. It was disturbing.</p> <p>I must have looked ridiculous in my black leggings and white t-shirt with Bean bal ed noticeably in front, crouching and ready in front of what looked like a ful -grown man. Bex could have wadded me up like a piece of paper on my best day, and I knew if anyone had witnessed a pregnant woman trading punches with someone twice her size, they would have cal ed the police.</p><p>\u201cBex,\u201d Jared warned without looking up.</p><p>Bex\u2019s nose wrinkled, irritated at Jared\u2019s instruction. \u201cI know. The subtle distention of her middle section is a constant reminder not overdo it. I won\u2019t hurt your messianic spawn, Nina.\u201d</p><p>I shoved the heel of my hand into Bex\u2019s stomach. He barely paused, but it was stil thril ing to me that I landed it. \u201cSomeone\u2019s been reading the List of Big Words, again.\u201d</p><p>Bex glanced to Jared, and then grabbed me. He twisted me around, more forceful than usual, pulling me into his chest. My neck fit snugly in the crook of his arm. \u201cOkay. Now what?\u201d</p><p>I stepped on his foot, jabbed my elbow into his ribs, and then threw my head back. Bex dodged, but had he been human I would have cracked his nose.</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, nodding.</p><p>We went over the same old moves dozens of times, and then Bex showed me a few more. They were more offensive than defensive. Bex seemed to enjoy teaching those more, and I certainly enjoyed learning to attack more than I liked repeatedly attempting to free myself from an assailant.</p><p>After an hour, Jared brought the bag of firearms over, and then handed me shooting earmuffs and safety glasses. We walked over to a smal hil , where Bex set up several targets. He was as excited as I was, but it didn\u2019t occur to me to ask why.</p><p>I practiced with a handgun, a rifle, and a shotgun. When Jared and Bex were satisfied with my aim, Bex tied a rope to a branch of the oak tree and hung a large log from it. He unrol ed a paper target, and then taped it to the middle of the log. He gave it a shove, and it swayed in a large arc back and forth.</p><p>Jared handed me his sidearm. \u201cLess than one percent of your targets wil be stationary. You need to learn to hit a moving target.</p><p>I lifted the Glock in both of my hand and looked down the sights.</p><p>\u201cAnticipation is key,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>I watched the log for a moment, and then squeezed the trigger. Bex leapt back with a yowl.</p> <p>I dropped the gun and covered my mouth. \u201cOh, God! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>Jared picked up the gun and tried not to smile. Bex, however, was rol ing on the ground, laughing hysterical y.</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cNot funny, you little worm! I could have given birth right here in the grass!\u201d</p><p>Bex immediately sobered, looking to his older brother for confirmation.</p><p>Jared laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s exaggerating just a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d I said, holding the gun in front of me once more. After six tries, I sighed with irritation and pul ed off the earmuffs, letting them fal to the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much,\u201d Bex said. He pul ed his gun from the waistline of his jeans and pul ed the trigger, never looking away from me. The target had a rip in the center where the bul et made contact.</p><p>I blew my bangs from my face. \u201cYou can\u2019t anticipate something without thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>Bex lifted his gun and pointed it at me, and I mirrored his action. We were at an immediate stand off.</p><p>Bex smiled. \u201cYes, you can.\u201d</p><p>Jared palmed my arm and lowered it slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s cal ed instinct. It\u2019s in your blood, Nina. You just need to give in to it.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the log. \u201cGive in to it,\u201d I repeated, raising my weapon.</p><p>Bex shoved the log again.</p><p>I shut out everything: the breeze; the birds; the strands of hair that kept sticking to my lip gloss. Everything was frozen, even my inner thoughts. My mind focused on the target, and I was in tune with everything. I could feel the movement of the log, the resistance of the rope as it rubbed against the tree branch, and even the wind speed and how it would affect the path of the bul et. I took in a deep breath and pul ed the trigger. Bex grabbed the log and it instantly stopped.</p><p>\u201cNice!\u201d Bex said.</p><p>The bul et had landed just a couple of inches above Bex\u2019s. I smiled, and Jared pul ed me to his side, kissing my hair.</p><p>After that, Bex took the spare tire from under the rear of the Escalade and fastened a target to the center. He walked to the top of a smal hil , and I stood halfway down. He let the tire go, and I took several shots as it rol ed down the grass to the bottom, fal ing on its side.</p><p>Bex sprinted to the tire and rol ed it over, offering a thumbs-up and a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou did real y wel today,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Jared leaned down and touched each side of my stomach with his hands. \u201cMommy did good today, didn\u2019t she Bean?\u201d He waited a moment, and then stood. \u201cEverything seems to be okay. Your pulse, Bean\u2019s pulse, blood pressure and breathing are all normal. I don\u2019t think Bean noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we can keep going?\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded.</p><p>I gestured to the book under his arm. \u201cDid you find anything?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s smal smile faded. \u201cFeel like a trip to Woonsocket?\u201d</p><p>Bex helped us load the Escalade with our belongings, and then waved goodbye, peeling out on his motorcycle to head home to Lil ian.</p><p>Jared was quiet during the twenty-minute drive north. His eyes were locked forward, missing the incredible summer foliage on each side of the highway. I all owed it to distract me while Jared silently prepared questions for Father Francis. Poring over the same words over and over, not knowing what to look for, had to be frustrating. I reached my hand across the console, and almost instinctual y, Jared covered my hand with his.</p><p>Stil beautiful, he wore the stress and worry of the years since we\u2019d met only in his eyes. He seemed tired, and desperate, but determined.</p><p>He squeezed my hand, brought it to his lips, then reached over to rest his hand on my stomach. He seemed to relax, then.</p><p>\u201cMaybe...maybe you\u2019re going about this all wrong,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re reading the wrong book? It\u2019s too late to stop the prophecy. What you\u2019re looking for is a way to get Heaven on our side, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to find answers about Heaven in a book about Hel .\u201d</p><p>Jared eyes flitted about for a moment, considering my idea. He didn\u2019t answer, but he acknowledged my words with a nod. I covered his hand with mine, and let him return to his thoughts.</p><p>We passed the rocky wal that welcomed us to Woonsocket, and then made our way to St. Ann\u2019s. Yel ow tape surrounded the church. The glass from the once exquisitely stained windows had been removed, and the holes that remained were covered with boards and plastic tarp.</p><p>Jared parked, and we climbed the steps. He tugged on one set of doors, but they were locked. He tried two others, but they were locked as wel .</p><p>The tarp blew in the summer breeze, flapping against the building. The town seemed otherwise quiet.</p><p>Jared turned and noticed a passerby. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said. \u201cIs the church closed?\u201d</p><p>The man shrugged. \u201cFather Francis has kept it locked. He hadn\u2019t been actin\u2019 right since the explosion.\u201d He walked away.</p><p>An explosion. Shax and his minions all but tore the church to shreds during our most recent showdown, and it left St. Ann\u2019s looking like a war zone. Some construction had taken place, but Woonsocket was no longer the booming industrial hub it used to be. The community that had once pul ed together to fund the extravagant adornments of their social center with paintings and stained glass was now preoccupied with a recession and modern priorities.</p><p>We walked to a side door, and Jared gave it a light tug. It caught again. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave without speaking to him, and I don\u2019t want to break in,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCal him.\u201d</p><p>Just as we stepped away, we heard a familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Father Francis cal ed, walking briskly from the back of the church. \u201cI\u2019m here, lad!\u201d He slowed to a stop, trying to control his labored breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was in the back building, praying. It used to be the school, you know.\u201d His face dropped. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed to say I feel safer there, now.\u201d</p><p>Jared cupped the priest\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI understand, Father. Some things you can\u2019t un-see.\u201d</p><p>Father Francis nodded, and then gestured for us to fol ow him inside. We walked behind him, waiting patiently for him to climb the steps into the side door of St. Ann\u2019s.</p><p>It was cold and drafty. The wooden pews and marble statues were covered with linens. An eerie feeling dwel ed within the wal s, and I could see why the priest didn\u2019t want to be alone there.</p><p>The faces of the angels and saints in the paintings looked down on us. I couldn\u2019t help but think they seemed sad, waiting for someone to restore their home to its former glory. \u201cFather,\u201d I began, pulling my pocketbook from my purse. \u201cI brought this hardship on you. Let me help.\u201d I scribbled six figures onto a check.</p><p>Father Francis\u2019 eyes softened as he took the paper into his hands. \u201cThank you, my child. We need this more than you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather,\u201d Jared said, pulling Shax\u2019s book from under his arm.</p><p>The priest\u2019s eyes widened and he immediately looked away, shaking his head. \u201cOh, no! No, no, no. You mustn\u2019t bring that here!\u201d</p><p>A soft ringing in my ears grew infinitesimal y louder, sounding more like panicked whispers. I looked around the room, but we were alone. Just us and the hundreds of people in the paintings on the wal s and ceilings.</p><p>I looked up. In a scene in which God had cast out the rebel ious angels, the artist had drawn them in such a way that the angels seemed to be fal ing out of the painting\u2014out of the ceiling. I looked at another mural at the back of the church, featuring Navy sailors drifting helplessly in a stormy sea, reaching out to St. Mary. In a moment of what had to be confusion, I could hear their panicked cries. I could hear them all , shrieking and wailing at the sight of the book that brought their home down around them.</p><p>I squeezed my eyes tight, and gripped my ears. Their cries became so loud I couldn\u2019t hear individual voices, only their frenzied, col ective panic.</p><p>Jared\u2019s fingers touched my arm. \u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>At once, it all stopped. I opened my eyes and looked around. Insanity was the first thing that popped into my mind.</p><p>Father Francis nodded in understanding, however. \u201cIt gets too loud for me sometimes, too.\u201d</p><p>I peered around to the different faces in the paintings, unsettled.</p><p>The priest looked to the book, and then to Jared. \u201cYou can\u2019t have that, here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stil need your help, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given all I can give.\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t accept that, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Father Francis left for the back of the church. Jared pul ed me to fol ow. We kept a quick pace all the way to his quarters, where he immediately made himself a drink. He threw it back, and then made himself another. His hands were shaking, causing the mouth of the decanter to clink against the rim of his glass.</p><p>The priest closed his eyes and lifted his chin, taking in another gulp of the amber liquid with one movement. The glass dropped from his hands, crashing into the floor. Some of the bigger shards made their way to my feet, and I stared at them for a moment.</p><p>\u201cFather,\u201d I said, looking up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s almost over. I know you\u2019re scared, but we\u2019re taking the book back soon.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed. \u201cTo the Sepulchre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, reaching out to him. I touched his arm, and he placed a hand on mine.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t make it,\u201d he said sadly.</p><p>Jared shifted in frustration. \u201cLet\u2019s deal with the issue at hand, shal we? I just ask that you sit down with me one last time to try to find another way.</p><p>Surely our only option isn\u2019t to just wait until the baby is born and hope Heaven steps in.\u201d</p><p>The priest shook his head dismissively. \u201cWe\u2019ve searched every line. There\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one more time. Please,\u201d Jared said. \u201cBefore I take my wife and unborn child to Jerusalem, I have to know I had no other choice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Father Francis glanced at the leather-bound pages and sighed. \u201cVery wel .\u201d He adjusted his round spectacles, and glanced above him. \u201cThen you must leave, and never bring that thing to the house of the Lord again.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded. \u201cYou have my word.\u201d</p><p>The priest brought in an extra chair, and he and Jared opened the book. Immediately the room turned cold, and I wrapped my arms around my middle. The others knew we were here, and that we had the book. The element of surprise long gone, Jared didn\u2019t hesitate discussing different passages. When Father Francis would get an idea, the pages would be flipped to one prophecy, prompting Jared to think about something else.</p><p>The pages would flip the other way. They argued and agreed; each idea led them only to more frustration.</p> <p>Minutes turned to hours; stil they went over each point of the prophecy until it sounded more like chanting than discussion. A strange glow lit up the edges of the windows, and I realized it was the morning sun. We\u2019d spent all night in Woonsocket, and my eyes didn\u2019t even feel heavy.</p><p>For the first time, Jared looked up from the book to see me fidgeting in my chair. \u201cHungry?\u201d He said it as if he\u2019d just remembered I was there.</p><p>\u201cGetting there,\u201d I said, resting my chin on my fist.</p><p>He threw the book across the room. It hit the wal with great force and hit the ground with a thud. Despite its age, not a page loosened.</p><p>I stood and walked to the smal kitchen, found a glass and turned on the tap. My body was just starting to feel the beginnings of fatigue, and the tension in the room made me emotional y tired as wel . A copy of the King James Bible sat on the counter. The spine was worn to nearly nothing, and the pages hung at an angle; the book so spent it could no longer hold itself square. I flipped open the cover, and then pushed several pages with my fingertips.</p> <p>\u201cWe should get you something to eat,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>I turned to the priest. \u201cWhat does your Bible say about this?\u201d</p><p>Father Francis thought for a moment. \u201cWel , it does have its own version of the end days. It talks about the woman with child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve mentioned to Jared that we\u2019re looking in the wrong place. If you can\u2019t find the answers in the Bible of Hel , shouldn\u2019t you look in Heaven\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>The priest shrugged. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d He walked over to the counter and picked up the book. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a try. A third of the Bible is prophecy.\u201d</p><p>I offered Jared my glass, and he took a sip. When he handed it back to me, he kissed my cheek. The two men returned to their chairs, this time opening Heaven\u2019s Bible.</p> <p>Father Francis flipped the pages. \u201cLet\u2019s start with anything that discusses women with child in the end days.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded, and waited for the priest to find the first passage. They discussed trumpets, and something about seals\u2014I imagined angels opening wax-sealed envelopes the way celebrities do at award shows\u2014and a dragon and a woman with child. I tried to tune that part out, because the sound of it terrified me. But I didn\u2019t have the luxury of putting frightening prophecy to the back of my mind. Because of what I had seen the last two years, I knew prophecies were very real possibilities. My only defense against the instinct to run screaming was simply not to hear. The priest discussed literal and symbolic interpretations, among other things that made my head spin. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was exhaustion, the fact that I was purposely trying not to pay attention, or that their discussion real y was simply over my head. At any rate, I was pregnant, tired, and irritable.</p><p>\u201cIt would be nice if you two wouldn\u2019t talk about me like I\u2019m not here,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes turned soft, and he reached for me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart. We\u2019re trying to hurry, but we need to be thorough. This is our last chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cKim needs to return the book to Jerusalem. I\u2019ve made her wait long enough.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Traveling to Jerusalem had crossed my mind many times. Shax and the rest of his minions would not make it easy for us to return his book to the one place he can\u2019t go. The Sepulchre was above the tomb of Jesus; the creatures of Hel were forbidden. Even infinite, divine patience refused to tolerate desecration of the Sepulchre. The war could start the moment the plane lands, or they could try to keep us from even getting on the plane. We had no idea what would happen. That was the worst part.</p><p>Father Francis looked up from the pages. His eyes were unfocused as he slipped deeper into thought. \u201cThere is an ancient Jewish apocryphal text cal ed the Fourth Esdras. The archangel Uriel describes many things about the end of days.\u201d</p> <p>Jared frowned. \u201cI know what you\u2019re about to say, and I know Uriel. Gabriel is the loudest adversary of Hybrids. Uriel is the second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, his prophecy has some merit. He says\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jared cut him off. \u201cFather....\u201d</p><p>My curiosity and sense of self-preservation outweighed everything else. \u201cTel me, Father. I want to know.\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed, and the priest continued, \u201cHe specifical y mentions pregnant women in the Fourth Esdras. He says \u2018Pregnant women wil give birth to monsters.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Jared rol ed his eyes. \u201cUriel thinks I\u2019m a monster.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cWhat...what kind of monsters?\u201d</p><p>The priest glanced at Jared, and then back at me. \u201cHe makes many prophecies similar to Revelations. He refers to this as \u2018The Beginning of Sorrows\u2019. Jesus also states, \u2018Woe to those who are pregnant or nursing babies in those days.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cYou need to listen,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re unable to figure this out because you refuse to hear the truth. Maybe this is out of our hands.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s brows pul ed in. \u201cThose prophecies state an abundance of Hybrid births. If something like that were happening, we would hear about it.</p><p>Besides, Bean isn\u2019t a Hybrid.\u201d</p><p>Father Francis pushed up his glasses, clearly intrigued. \u201cYou know this for a fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The only child capable of this kind of reaction from Hel , a child capable of disturbing the Balance, wil be more than a Hybrid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour child isn\u2019t human?\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arms around my stomach, cradling Bean protectively. \u201cYou make the baby sound like an abomination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Father Francis said.</p><p>Jared stood. \u201cNo. It\u2019s a child. Our child.\u201d He took my hand and I stood with him.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d Father Francis said. He stood before us. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend you. We are in strange times\u2014frightening times. I let panic get in the way of my thoughts. I just don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina is a descendant of the Nephilim,\u201d Jared said, matter-of-factly.</p><p>The priest was confused. \u201cBut, this is what you are. Nephilim are children of angels, born of human women.\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cI am the son of an Arch. The Nephilim bred the likes of Goliath. Giants not meant to blend in. These angels roamed the earth. They had...rebel ed.\u201d</p><p>The priest\u2019s eyes grew wide, and I felt mine mirror his. I gripped Jared\u2019s shirt. \u201cWhat are you saying? That I\u2019m a descendant of demons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said. We\u2019re talking thousands of years ago, Nina. Many things were different back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebel ious angels were cast out, Jared.\u201d</p><p>Jared cupped my arms. \u201cMy mother is a descendant of Celts. They were savages, Nina. They drank the blood of their dead. I don\u2019t personalize it.</p><p>That\u2019s not what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you leave that part out?\u201d I covered my face with my hands, ashamed to even look at Jared. He was half angel, and I was carrying around the genes of Hel . No wonder our child was so rare. \u201cDid you know that before?\u201d I asked, my eyes fil ing with tears.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks felt as if they had caught fire. I was hesitant to ask the question that had come to my mind, but I would anyway. I always did, no matter how horrible I thought the answer would be. \u201cDoes it change the way you feel about me?\u201d</p><p>Jared took my jaws gently into his hands, and he looked straight into my eyes. \u201cNina, of course not. How could you even think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know how I feel about me, now.\u201d</p><p>Jared put his lips on mine, and then he pul ed me to him. It was my father\u2019s last secret, the last thing Jared had tried to keep from hurting me. But, now that it was in the open, everything made perfect sense. I could never quite fit the pieces together until now.</p><p>Stil , I felt...the only way to describe it was that I felt dirty. After all of that, we were no closer to an answer than when we\u2019d arrived. \u201cIs that what Uriel meant when he said \u2018monsters\u2019? What wil the baby be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur baby. Bean wil be our baby, nothing more. You know what you need?\u201d he said with a smal smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I said, wiping the delicate skin under my eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe comfort of experience.\u201d Jared tugged on my hand. \u201cLet\u2019s invite Lil ian to dinner.\u201d</p><p>Father Francis held out his hand. \u201cWe\u2019re not finished, are we?\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cThe answers aren\u2019t in those books. I don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answer is always in this book,\u201d Father Francis said, holding his Bible in his hands. He held it to his chest. \u201cWe\u2019ve just missed something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t missed anything. I had hoped He would lead you to the answer, Father, but He hasn\u2019t so much as whispered in your ear.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s words sent my mind spinning. Had we missed something? Had the answer been in front of us all along? I clicked through each idea and passage of scripture I\u2019d heard them discuss like channels in my mind. I kept coming back to Shax\u2019s book, and returning it to Jerusalem.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not in my ear he\u2019s whispering?\u201d The priest said.</p><p>Jared waved him away. \u201cNina\u2019s exhausted and hungry. It\u2019s clouding my thoughts. all I can think about is that damn book and returning it so Shax can\u2019t get to it and we can concentrate on keeping Nina safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d I said, stunned.</p><p>\u201cI have the Jerusalem trip on my mind. I can\u2019t focus on anything else. It\u2019s maddening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s whispering,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Father Francis nodded, and hobbled to where we stood. \u201cShe\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>I gripped Jared\u2019s shirt. \u201cThe Sepulchre. The only place they aren\u2019t all owed to desecrate. The one place the book is safe from Hel \u2019s hands.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes lit up like twin fires. \u201cWe can keep you safe there.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Due</p><p>Bex finished the last place setting, and then returned to the kitchen. Lil ian sat happily at one end of my mother\u2019s long, imported table, Cynthia not so happily at the other. I waited anxiously with them, shifting uncomfortably in my seat. Almost to a beat, Cynthia would shoot me glances of disapproval. She hated it when I fidgeted, but now that I was married, she felt it impolite to mother me. Bex and Jared worked furiously in the kitchen, their laughter and conversation filtering to the formal dining room along with the delicious smel s of savory herbs.</p><p>Bex appeared again with a basket of hot dinner rol s and a butter dish. His eyes darted to the empty doorway, and then back to the table. \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened, and then I heard Claire grumbling under her breath. She and Ryan made their way to the table like summer and winter\u2014 Ryan was all smiles, and Claire sported her usual scowl.</p><p>Bex brought in a pot of steamed vegetables in one hand, and a bowl of rice in the other. Ryan pul ed out Claire\u2019s chair and then clapped his hands, rubbing them together.</p><p>\u201cI can help,\u201d he said.</p><p>Bex nodded once toward the kitchen. \u201cJust pick something and bring it out to the table.\u201d He pul ed off his apron and took a seat next to his mother.</p><p>\u201cI think you should leave it on,\u201d Claire said. \u201cPink pinstripes look good on you.\u201d</p><p>Bex stuck his tongue out at his sister and then placed his napkin in his lap. Lil ian shot a look at Claire and then smiled at Bex. \u201cIt looks wonderful, as always, son.\u201d</p><p>Ryan returned with a casserole dish of scal oped potatoes, and Jared brought in a huge ham. They were laughing about something, and I couldn\u2019t help but attempt to sneak a peek at Claire\u2019s reaction. She all owed a half smile, but it quickly vanished when Ryan took a seat next to her.</p><p>Jared sat next to me, and we began passing around the different dishes, fil ing our plates. As stressful and dark as the situation seemed, the banter was jovial, and Jared\u2019s mood was nearly cheerful. The weight of an answer had final y been lifted, and he felt hopeful again.</p><p>Cynthia barely finished her meal when she looked at her watch. \u201cJared. Bex. Thank you so much for dinner. I do apologize. I have an engagement.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded. \u201cOf course, Cynthia. Thank you for joining us.\u201d</p><p>She paused behind my chair and cupped my shoulders, kissing my cheek. \u201cIt was good to see you, Nina dear.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and her heels clicked to the front door.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s brows jumped. \u201cShe\u2019s not one for family functions, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot real y, no,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cCynthia shows her humanity by way of charities. She\u2019s very busy, but she\u2019s helped so many people.\u201d Lil ian said.</p><p>\u201cThat she has,\u201d I said. \u201cIs there pie?\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed, and Bex popped up. \u201cNo, but there is cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel food?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, leaving for the kitchen.</p><p>Ryan pul ed his fork from his mouth, clearly ready for dessert. \u201cSo what\u2019s the real occasion?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bex returned with the cake, setting it right in front of me. \u201cTrying to keep the pregnant woman fed. It takes a vil age, ya know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d I said, but I couldn\u2019t help from cutting a huge piece. Pregnancy was the perfect excuse for gluttony.</p><p>\u201cRyan has a good point,\u201d Lil ian smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re in a very good mood for a change.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cI took the book to Father Francis.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Claire said, surprised.</p><p>I swal owed the delicious, spongy bite in my mouth. \u201cWe were there all night.\u201d</p><p>Ryan cut his own piece of cake, but handed it to Claire. \u201cSo you found something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a damn thing,\u201d Jared said, smiling.</p><p>Ryan cut another piece for himself, causing a wider smile from Lil ian. Claire just rol ed her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>Jared used his fork to attempt to cut a piece of cake from my slice, but I stuck out my elbow to defend my plate. Everyone laughed, including Jared.</p><p>Jared final y gave in and cut his own slice. \u201cNina and I were distracted. all we could think about was getting Shax\u2019s book back to Jerusalem for Kim.\u201d</p><p>Ryan pointed at me with his fork. \u201cShe cal ed me today. She\u2019s past impatient. She was yel ing. I\u2019ve never heard her yel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her lucky day, then,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, why\u2019s that?\u201d Ryan said, chewing.</p> <p>Jared put his elbows on the table and folded his arms. \u201cBecause we\u2019re leaving for Jerusalem next week.\u201d</p><p>Claire shrugged. \u201cWel , that\u2019s smart. Ryan and I are both starting Brown in the fal , and it\u2019s Nina\u2019s senior year. It\u2019s good to get it out of the way.\u201d</p><p>Lil ian paused. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Brown?\u201d</p><p>Claire shrugged. \u201cRyan wants to start back...I just thought....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m thril ed!\u201d Lil ian said, beaming.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not coming back until Bean is born,\u201d Jared said. The entire table was silent. No one moved, and all eyes were on Jared. \u201cThe answer has been right in front of us all along. The Sepulchre is the one place I know she\u2019l be safe until she can deliver.\u201d</p><p>Claire frowned. \u201cYou want to live in Jerusalem for nine months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot an entire nine months,\u201d Lil ian said. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure, but she probably only has a couple of months left.\u201d</p> <p>Jared\u2019s face blanched. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Lil ian fiddled with her napkin. \u201cI should have said something, son, I\u2019m so sorry. Nina\u2019s situation is obviously different, but a ful term Hybrid pregnancy is six to seven months. I assume it\u2019s the same, maybe less for Bean.\u201d</p><p>Bex smiled. \u201cNow you\u2019re saying it. That poor kid is never going to get a real name.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my stomach. Because of our situation, we had refrained from prenatal care, but I\u2019d just assumed my pregnancy would be a normal gestation. I was measuring a bit larger than normal, but nothing out of the ordinary. Jared assumed it was because of my smal frame.</p><p>\u201cSo...July? August?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d Lil ian answered.</p><p>Jared nodded. \u201cThen it\u2019s settled. The closer it gets, the more danger she\u2019s in. We should leave now.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI have things at Titan I need to wrap up.\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed, but agreed. \u201cOkay. We\u2019ll all take the week to prepare. We leave on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet!\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d Claire said. \u201cYou have to stay with Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bex wailed.</p><p>Jared glared at him. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave her alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have to go. You know I do!\u201d</p><p>Lil ian frowned. \u201cJared, that\u2019s ridiculous. You need everyone with you to get her there safe. The second you land, you\u2019l be bombarded. They wil do everything they can to keep her from somewhere they can\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>I swal owed. It was so close. I\u2019d always felt like we had plenty of time before the pandemonium started.</p><p>Claire sighed. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave you unprotected, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Grant?\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cBex!\u201d Jared yel ed. His voice boomed throughout the house. Bex\u2019s face turned red, and his eyes immediately fel .</p><p>\u201cGrant?\u201d I said, confused. \u201cGrant Bristol?\u201d No one said a word. all eyes were on the table but mine, which danced in every direction. \u201cTitan\u2019s Grant? Is a...Hybrid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lil ian said, cupping Bex\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s an Arch.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my fork, and it clanged against my plate. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Lil ian attempted to soften Jared with one of her sweetest smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>I turned to him, thwarting Lil ian\u2019s effort. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something you thought I needed to know? Are you kidding me?\u201d I wailed.</p><p>Jared\u2019s expression turned desperate. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to tel you about every angel or demon that passes by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work with him, Jared. I...I\u2019m just baffled why you chose to keep it from me! This makes twice today!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else haven\u2019t you told her?\u201d Ryan asked, enjoying the show.</p><p>Jared shot a death glare in Ryan\u2019s direction. \u201cIt was his secret to tel , Nina, and it\u2019s real y not paramount that you know. In the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s real y minute. You\u2019re being unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinute.\u201d I stood up from my seat. \u201cI don\u2019t think asking for a little trust, or having the expectation to not be treated like an outsider in my own company or family, is unreasonable. I don\u2019t think being upset to be the last to know that I\u2019m pregnant is unreasonable. I am tired of you choosing what is and is not acceptable for me to know, only for me to find out by chance sometime later like a slap in the face!\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes drifted to the floor. I threw my napkin to the table, stomping up the stairs to the bedroom in Oscar-worthy fashion. I sat on the bed, stil fuming. A smal knock at the door only amplified my anger.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you, either.\u201d</p><p>Claire, being Claire, walked in anyway. She sat on the bed next to me, crossing her arms. She sat silent for the longest time, and final y took a breath.</p><p>\u201cI get it, you know. They don\u2019t tel me nonessential information, either. It\u2019s crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s demeaning is what it is.\u201d I frowned in her general direction. \u201cI\u2019m his wife. I understand I\u2019ve been the token human that doesn\u2019t understand the rules of the universe, but for the love of all things holy. I know enough by now. He should trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t trust you. He tries to keep your life as normal as possible. He knows how important that is to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a moot point these days, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would, but I don\u2019t love you like he does.\u201d</p><p>My mouth pul ed to the side. She was fighting dirty. Jared loved me, and at times let that fact cloud his judgment. It was impossible to stay angry at him for it. Jared keeping Grant a secret from me defied logic. It simply didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>\u201cHe should have a good reason for keeping things from me, and he doesn\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very human reason, actual y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnlighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant\u2019s been in love with you for ages. Why do you think Jack was constantly pushing him in your direction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense, either. Jack didn\u2019t want me with Jared because of the prophecy. He definitely wouldn\u2019t want me with an Arch.\u201d</p><p>Claire raised an eyebrow, and the same side of her mouth turned up. \u201cWhat do teenage girls do when their parents tel them not to do something?\u201d Claire said. \u201cIf Jack told you to stay away from Grant, you would have run straight for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIck,\u201d I said. \u201cNo one\u2019s that stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Jack use the same logic with Jared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to. He forced Jared to stay out of sight. That solved the problem. Grant didn\u2019t take orders from Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, he did. I saw it on many occasions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw what they wanted you to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStil doesn\u2019t explain why he kept it from me,\u201d I huffed.</p><p>\u201cJared might seem divinely perfect, but he\u2019s human, too, Nina. He can make decisions based on the fear of losing you to someone else just like any other insecure boyfriend. It hasn\u2019t been the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce he waited to tel you, it was something he\u2019d kept from you. It was already too late, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d Claire said, pulling me to my feet. She slapped my backside. \u201cNow go kiss and make up with your husband who is more than likely kicking himself right now.\u201d</p><p>I walked to the door, hesitated, and then final y pul ed it open. Jared stood in the hal way, his hands in his pockets.</p><p>I crossed my arms. \u201cYou look like you lost your best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d he asked, miserable.</p><p>My shoulders fel .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI swear that\u2019s everything. You know everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve heard that before,\u201d I said, walking to him until I was just inches away.</p><p>Jared touched each side of my stomach and looked down, his eyes dark with worry and guilt. I wrapped my arms around his neck and touched my cheek to his. We stood silently for a long while in that embrace. Holding him felt just as good if not better than the first time. The electricity was stil there, and I had the same desperate need to be closer to him. He smel ed just as amazing, and his skin was stil as soft. Too many months had passed since we took a moment to ourselves just to hold each other. I tried to be present in that moment and be aware of everything possible. We would leave in eight days, facing the fight of our lives. I didn\u2019t know when this moment would happen again.</p><p>His hand slipped to my lower back, and he pul ed me closer. I lifted my chin, and his lips touched mine. I dug my fingers into the skin of his arms, and then deeper into the muscle. His tongue slipped into my mouth, but then he pul ed away.</p><p>\u201cAhem,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>I turned to see the source of the interruption standing next to Claire at the top of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cFigures,\u201d Jared grumbled.</p><p>We returned downstairs together, joining Bex and Lil ian in the foyer. I hugged my mother-in-law goodbye, smiling when her enthusiastic hug became a bit too tight.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, kissing my hair. She looked to Jared. \u201cBe good to each other.\u201d Jared nodded, and she waved goodbye.</p><p>I walked into the dining room, and Jared, Claire, and Ryan fol owed.</p><p>Ryan and Claire began clearing the table. Ryan smiled and elbowed her. \u201cYour mom loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves everyone,\u201d Claire sneered. \u201cYou\u2019re not special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love everyone. I\u2019d say that makes me pretty special...since you do.\u201d</p><p>Claire glanced at Jared and me, clearly embarrassed. \u201cYou wish!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say it,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cStop tel ing me what to do,\u201d Claire snapped back.</p><p>He crossed his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m human, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cSeriously? It is possible that I just don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Ryan said, pointing to his chest. \u201cNah,\u201d he said, dismissing her suggestion. \u201cYou\u2019re a strong woman. I get it. Not many can handle it that their girl could kick their ass. Even fewer soldiers, and even fewer Special Forces guys. But I get it, and I can keep up with you more than anyone else could. I\u2019ve had training...and we\u2019ve pretty much been told by the Creator of the Universe that we have to spend all of our time together. How much proof do you need?\u201d</p><p>Claire turned and swiped her leg under Ryan\u2019s feet, throwing him to the ground, flat on his back. \u201cFirst of all , you can\u2019t keep up with me. Second of all \u2014\u201d</p><p>Ryan kicked forward, and then leapt to his feet. Claire crouched in a defensive position. Ryan smiled at her reaction. \u201cI can keep up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me. If I can\u2019t, I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>Claire looked at Ryan from under her brow. Her ice-blue eyes turned murderous, but under them was a mischievous smile.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cThis is a terrible idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late now,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>She bent her knee and shoved her boot into Ryan\u2019s stomach. He flew across the room and flattened against the wal , fal ing to the ground. He stumbled to his feet and sucked in a few times, the air knocked out of him.</p><p>I cringed. \u201cAt least she\u2019s not wearing stilettos.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shot an annoyed look my way, and then coughed a few times. He stood on wobbly knees and lifted his hands, palm-out to Claire. \u201cYou should know by now that I don\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>Claire grinned with devilish intent. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as me,\u201d Jared said. I glared at him, and he shrugged. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Claire attacked, and Ryan turned. With a different adversary, he would have turned at the precise time to avoid a landed punch, but Claire was faster than the supernatural y fast\u2014and she preferred kicking.</p><p>Claire spun around, her heel making contact with Ryan\u2019s backside. He was shoved forward a few steps, and then turned and punched. His hand met the drywal , and it cracked in several pieces around his fist.</p><p>\u201cHe better know how to fix that,\u201d I grumbled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Claire leaned forward and elbowed the back of his head. Ryan spun around, wrapping his arms around her waist at the same time. He charged forward, and they both crashed into the table.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d I yel ed, seeing my mother\u2019s imported English dining table in pieces.</p><p>Immediately on her feet, Claire grabbed two fistfuls of Ryan\u2019s shirt and tossed him into the foyer.</p><p>\u201cI love it when you play rough!\u201d Ryan yel ed from the other room.</p> <p>Claire wiped her bloodied lip and licked the crimson liquid from her fingers. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen rough yet.\u201d She disappeared through the doorway, and I winced when Ryan cried out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fighting dirty!\u201d he yel ed, crying out again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better get in there and supervise,\u201d Jared said, pulling me into the next room.</p><p>Claire held Ryan upside down by his ankle, feigning sympathy as he swiped at her to no avail. He scanned the room and then arched his back, lifting a solid wood statue from the floor, hammering Claire\u2019s knee just after getting his hands on it.</p><p>She was knocked to the ground, and Ryan fel on his head with a crack. When he stood, a thin line of red streamed from his hairline. \u201cIt was worth it,\u201d he said, running at Claire.</p> <p>She flipped backward, and then drew her side arm.</p><p>\u201cNot funny,\u201d Jared warned.</p><p>The gun fired, and Ryan jerked, covering his head with one hand, his crotch with the other. The bul et lodged into the wal \u2014right through the center of Cynthia\u2019s prized original Renoir.</p><p>\u201cI think...I think I\u2019m going to pass out,\u201d I said, feeling woozy. Jared obliged when I hooked my arm around his.</p><p>\u201cShould I stop them?\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t stop until they\u2019re finished being CHILDISH!\u201d I said. \u201cTake it outside!\u201d</p> <p>Ryan pointed at Claire. \u201cYou...you just shot at me!\u201d</p><p>Claire rol ed her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re such a baby. That wasn\u2019t even close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bul et blew air by my eyeball!\u201d he said, dramatical y pointing to his eye.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said in a huff. \u201cI\u2019ll put it away so you don\u2019t pee your pants, big Special Forces man.\u201d</p><p>Ryan relaxed and stood up straight, and then charged her again. Claire rol ed her eyes and grabbed him by the throat, stopping him in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cAl you do is run at me. I\u2019m bored.\u201d</p><p>Ryan took a swipe at her, making strange hacking noises.</p><p>I walked over to them, glaring at Ryan, and then at Claire. \u201cHe\u2019s turning blue.\u201d</p> <p>Claire raised her other fist like she was going to punch him, but then turned it over, casual y picking at her nails.</p><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d Jared growled.</p><p>She looked at Ryan and narrowed her eyes. \u201cTap out.\u201d</p><p>Ryan struggled to make a noise. \u201cNo,\u201d he choked. His eyes fluttered as he lost consciousness.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough. Jared, please make her stop.\u201d</p><p>Jared took a step, and Claire pointed at him. \u201cJared Gabriel, don\u2019t you dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2014\u201d he began, but she held her hand palm-out to her brother.</p><p>I glanced at Ryan and then back at her. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda funny.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed Claire\u2019s wrist with one hand and wrapped my arm around Ryan with the other. It was futile, but I hoped Claire would snap out of her rage and realize what she was doing. As if it were nothing, they separated.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, helping Ryan to the floor. \u201cRy,\u201d I said, patting his cheek. \u201cDeep breaths.\u201d I looked up at Claire to send her a look of disapproval, but her expression took me off guard. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t let go,\u201d she said, stunned.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes darted between the three of us. \u201cWhat do you mean you didn\u2019t let go?\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cShe pul ed me off him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time for jokes,\u201d I said. \u201cYou went too far.\u201d</p><p>Claire shook her head. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d</p><p>She was serious. I had pul ed Ryan from her grip without effort. I had barely tensed, thinking Claire had simply decided to let go. \u201cI...I don\u2019t... know,\u201d I said. I waited for Jared to offer an answer, but he stood speechless.</p><p>Ryan stirred. \u201cDid I win?\u201d</p><p>Claire frowned. \u201cOf course not, stupid. \u2018Did I win\u2019,\u201d she said, mocking Ryan\u2019s deep voice. She rol ed her eyes, and then her face brightened.</p><p>\u201cStand up, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it.\u201d</p><p>I stood, and Claire took a defensive crouch. In the next moment, Jared was between us. \u201cYou have lost your mind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one time!\u201d Claire begged. \u201cI bet it won\u2019t even hurt her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we talking about, here?\u201d I said, my eyes dancing between the two of them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d I asked. Jared led me to the center of the room, standing directly in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d Ryan asked Claire.</p><p>\u201cSssh. Pass out again,\u201d she said, impatiently waiting for something to happen.</p><p>My eyebrows pul ed in. \u201cWhat do you plan to do?\u201d</p><p>Jared steadied himself and squared his shoulders. His eyes darkened, and then he lowered his chin. In the next moment his body relaxed, and he threw his head back. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he sighed, looking at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat a wuss!\u201d Claire laughed.</p><p>The front door opened, and I closed my eyes, waiting for the painful shrieking of my mother. It never came.</p><p>\u201cUh...what happened here?\u201d Bex said. I opened my eyes, seeing Bex stood frozen in place in the doorway, a half-eaten apple in one hand.</p><p>\u201cNina pul ed me off Ryan,\u201d Claire said, her voice trembling with excitement.</p><p>\u201cOkay. So what are you doing, Jared?\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Jared replied, clearly embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to test the theory,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>Jared shook his head quickly. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms. \u201cAnd how were you going to do that, exactly?\u201d</p><p>Jared rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI was just going to throw it. I wasn\u2019t going to....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPunch her?\u201d Bex said.</p><p>Jared frowned at Bex, and then looked at me apologetical y.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I wailed.</p><p>Jared held out his hands. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to land it! Just to see if you would catch it.\u201d</p><p>Claire puffed, unimpressed. \u201cI was going to punch her,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>My mouth fel open.</p><p>Bex walked casual y across the room, stopping a couple of feet from me. Jared reclaimed my attention when he reached for me again. \u201cCome on, Nina. You don\u2019t think I would punch my pregnant wi\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before Jared could finish his sentence, Bex\u2019s fist hurled toward me with lightning speed. My body reacted, and suddenly his fist was in my hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not holding back,\u201d Bex grunted, stil pushing his fist toward my face.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes widened. He tried to talk, but the only result was his jaw flapping about.</p><p>Bex relaxed and lowered his hand, and then bent down to kiss my forehead. \u201cShe\u2019s been like that for months. You couldn\u2019t tel ?\u201d he asked Jared.</p><p>\u201cI uh...I could tel something was different. I assumed it was the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is the baby,\u201d Bex smiled. \u201cBean is sharing angel juice with Nina. I haven\u2019t taken it easy sparring with her for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared repeated.</p><p>Bex rol ed his eyes. \u201cRemember that time she threw me on my back?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes dashed to mine. \u201cShe real y did that?\u201d</p><p>Bex frowned. \u201cIt hurt, too. I just didn\u2019t say anything because I assumed you knew, and this was one of those things you didn\u2019t want to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is so like that.\u201d Claire said.</p><p>Jared was instantly angry. \u201cYou were sparring with her on your level? She\u2019s pregnant, Bex. Are you insane? What if you hurt the baby?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my protruding bel y and gingerly rubbed it with my fingers. \u201cBean is giving me abilities?\u201d</p><p>Bex shrugged. \u201cBean\u2019s ful -on angel, Nina. You\u2019ve got more power than we do, I bet. That\u2019s why you could hover during your dreams and climb the wal s and stuff. You were pregnant then, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Ryan laughed once. \u201cWhat? She\u2019s Spider-Man, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said!\u201d Bex beamed. \u201cLove Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cYou should have said something.\u201d</p><p>Bex laughed once without humor. \u201cShe\u2019s your Taleh...not to mention your wife. I thought you knew!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d mention it if I had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! That doesn\u2019t sound like you at all !\u201d Bex snapped.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Claire said. \u201cBeing forthcoming isn\u2019t your strong suit.\u201d</p><p>Jared turned on his heels, crossing his arms. His biceps bulged over his hands. \u201cI guess you knew, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not!\u201d Claire said. \u201cIt was my idea to punch her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , let\u2019s brag about it,\u201d I said flatly.</p><p>Silence overcame the room while the new knowledge set in. Jared\u2019s eyes bounced around different points on the floor while his brain processed a mil ion thoughts a second.</p><p>A loud bang sounded from across the room, fol owed by a vibration in the floor. Claire was lying on her back, looking up at Ryan with a shocked expression.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI told you I wouldn\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>Her face flashed red, and I waited for her to send Ryan flying across the room again. But the flush of her cheeks returned to a warm tone, and her eyes softened. A slow, smal smile turned up the corners of her mouth. Ryan, without caution, kneeled beside her. His eyes left hers, and then transfixed onto her lips. He leaned in closer. I waited for Claire to grab him by the throat, or kick him in his nether region, but she slowly closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hel happened in here?\u201d Cynthia shrieked, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>My mother\u2019s surprise entrance took my attention away for only a moment, and when I looked back, I could see a familiar frustration in Ryan\u2019s eyes.</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>\u201cSomeone had better answer me,\u201d Cynthia said.</p><p>Realization fluttered in Claire\u2019s eyes, and she glanced in my direction.</p><p>\u201cKarma,\u201d I said with a knowing grin. She had made a hobby of interrupting Jared and I when we were fal ing in love. It was refreshing to see her reaction when the same happened to her.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d she said, pushing herself to her feet. She grabbed Ryan\u2019s hand and helped him to stand. \u201cI apologize, Mrs. Grey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did this,\u201d Cynthia said. Her words were more an accusation than a question. \u201cI expect everything to be in order by tomorrow morning.\u201d With that, she left for her bedroom.</p><p>Claire surveyed the destruction. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>Claire left for the kitchen, and returned holding a large garbage can. She carried it in one hand, picking up the splinters of wood that covered the floor with the other.</p><p>\u201cHave fun with that,\u201d Jared smiled, taking my hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll be at the oak tree at first light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I said with a smile.</p><p>Jared glanced at his little brother. \u201cYou\u2019re coming, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d Bex said.</p><p>A wary frown touched Bex\u2019s face as his eyes darted between Jared and me. I could tel that he was hesitant to be excited. \u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t that, like, your breeding ground?\u201d</p><p>Jared rol ed his eyes. \u201cI want to see what Nina is capable of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet!\u201d Bex said, clapping his hands together once. \u201cYou ready to spar, Sis?\u201d His hands rubbed together.</p><p>A broad smile widened my face. \u201cOh. It\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Matches</p><p>Jared and I walked upstairs. I went through the motions of my nightly routine in a daze, trying to concede to this new reality. Knowing I had a lot to prove in the morning, it was difficult to sleep. Final y I forced my mind to slow down, and managed to close my eyes for a few hours before the sun breeched the horizon.</p><p>Once my eyes fluttered, there would be no fal ing back asleep; no sleeping in. I was wide awake, and my body screamed to get out of bed and get to the oak tree. I didn\u2019t bother with a shower, knowing I would be sweaty and covered in dust and dirt within the hour. An oversized t-shirt of Jared\u2019s barely stretched over my bel y, but it would suffice. I was real y showing now, and the thought crossed my mind at how ridiculous I would look, swol en and awkward, while Bex attacked me with gorgeous precision from every angle.</p><p>Jared and I met downstairs, where the others were stil cleaning. The only person not smiling and joking about the night before was Ryan.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared said, smug. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Nina can take Bex?\u201d</p><p>Ryan pointed at me, but looked at Jared. \u201cShe\u2019s stil pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Bex laughed once. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Bean\u2019s tougher than I am.\u201d</p><p>Claire thought I should start with Ryan, however. Ryan held out his hands. \u201cWhat the hel is this? Beat The Shit Out Of Ryan Week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d mind, since you\u2019re always insisting upon getting yourself hospitalized,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s face screwed into disgust. \u201cThat was uncal ed for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth hurts, baby.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to talk to me like that, you can insult me all day long.\u201d</p><p>Claire pul ed her car keys from her pocket, and then pul ed on Ryan\u2019s hand. \u201cI meant that you\u2019re a baby. It wasn\u2019t a term of endearment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>Jared squeezed my hand. \u201cThe oak tree it is. Are you sure you\u2019re okay with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I would like to see what you can do, though, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>I thought for a moment. I had always admired the abilities of the Ryels, but having my own never occurred to me. My damsel in distress days could be over, and I liked that.</p><p>\u201cDo I get a shot at you if I beat Claire?\u201d</p><p>Jared shrugged. \u201cSure, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen yes.\u201d</p><p>Jared pretended to be offended. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t very nice, honey. Not nice at all .\u201d</p> <p>I hooked my arm around his and nuzzled against him as we walked to the Escalade. \u201cA little exploratory domestic violence doesn\u2019t mean I love you any less.\u201d</p><p>The Escalade jostled with the uneven ground of the trail that led to our oak tree. Bex and Claire would be careful not to land a direct hit to my stomach, but my motherly instincts were kicking in, and so were my nerves. I kept tel ing myself I had already done this: Bex and I had sparred many times, and I got the best of him several times. At the time I thought he was taking it down a thousand notches so that I knew I was improving, but now I knew differently.</p><p>Ryan, sporting a standard-issue police T-shirt and a PPD bal cap, took position across from me.</p><p>\u201cUntil I figure out what I can do,\u201d I told him, \u201ctry very, very hard not to go anywhere near Bean.\u201d</p><p>Ryan frowned. \u201cFor the record, I feel like I\u2019m having an out-of-body experience, and the rational me is screaming to kidnap you away from this craziness before you get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just start slow, and see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan winced. \u201cI\u2019m about to fight a pregnant woman. This is wrong on so many levels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon you weenies!\u201d Claire yel ed. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got all day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a weenie,\u201d Ryan said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou are if you\u2019re afraid of a girl!\u201d</p><p>Ryan glanced at her with annoyance, and I smiled. \u201cYou\u2019l learn whispering doesn\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s do this before my girlfriend thinks worse of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStil not your girlfriend!\u201d Claire yel ed.</p><p>I bit my lip. \u201cLet\u2019s try this,\u201d I said, shoving Ryan. I used enough strength to push him a few feet away, but instead he flew back, twisted in the air, and then fel , rol ing across the ground.</p> <p>He looked up at me in surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s cheating!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI barely touched you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal y?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal y.\u201d</p><p>Ryan pushed himself to his feet, and then jogged back to me, a bit shaken. \u201cI can\u2019t let two girls kick my ass in one twelve-hour period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it,\u201d I said, crouched and ready.</p><p>Ryan swung and missed a dozen times before I tried punching him. My fist caught him in the gut, and he landed nearly in the same place as before. He stood up, but then doubled over, trying to catch his breath. He took a step, and then bent down again, holding up one finger.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d I cal ed.</p><p>\u201cMy turn!\u201d Bex said. He wasted no time, and I could see in his eyes that playtime was over.</p><p>He lunged, and I moved. Blocking each of his punches, I used Claire\u2019s leg sweep, knocking him to his feet. He jumped up, missing the first punch, and then landing the next. It stung, but it felt like I had accidental y walked into a door instead of the ful power of a Hybrid pounding into my jaw.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Jared yel ed. His hands were on his head, his fingers intertwined. He hated this. He had spent his life protecting me, and now that we were married and I was pregnant with his child, he was all owing me to be a guinea-pig-slash-punching-bag.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Bex said, breathing hard.</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I\u2019m sorry, did I hurt you?\u201d Bex said, lifting my chin to see the damage.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d I said, squatting defensively.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jared yel ed. \u201cNo, we\u2019ve seen what she\u2019s capable of. That\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m fighting a thirteen-year-old, Jared,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying that hard.\u201d</p><p>Bex crouched. \u201cThat\u2019s insulting.\u201d</p><p>He lunged again, and although our movements would have blurred to the human eye, I had no trouble keeping up. Each move Bex attempted seemed nearly in slow motion. Within seconds, Bex was in the air, and then flat on his back.</p><p>\u201cMy turn!\u201d Claire said, pulling on fingerless leather gloves.</p><p>I steadied myself. Claire had always frightened me. Bex, I had sparred with before; I was familiar with his moves. But it had been months since Claire and I had practiced together, and I was unfamiliar with her strategy. Stil , I didn\u2019t want to make Jared worry, so I planned to step up my game a notch. I couldn\u2019t let Claire punch me. Jared would feel guilty enough. Not to mention that even though she loved me now, Claire been waiting for this moment a long time.</p><p>She glared at me from under her brow as she always did to intimidate an enemy. That part I was familiar with. She would not hold back, and she wasn\u2019t afraid to hurt me.</p><p>This was going to suck.</p><p>Bex helped Ryan to Jared\u2019s side, and Ryan fel onto his knees, sore and demoralized.</p><p>\u201cGet her, Nigh!\u201d Ryan yel ed.</p><p>\u201cHey! Whose side are you on?\u201d Claire said.</p><p>I focused. Claire Ryel was the best of the best. Demons feared her. She was Earth\u2019s deadliest weapon, undefeated by anyone she\u2019d ever come up against, and I was about to deck her. Once Claire returned her attention to me, I swung. Claire took the punch, and it almost knocked her off her feet. She looked at Jared, rubbed her cheek, and smiled with bloody teeth. \u201cShe hurt me!\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t let my guard drop for a second, knowing Claire was too competitive to quit. Her ice-blue eyes sharpened and her vicious glare targeted me. \u201cI love you, and I\u2019m sorry for the ass-kicking that\u2019s about to commence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I was just being polite.\u201d</p><p>Knowing that she had watched me wait to be attacked with my last two opponents, I took the first shot. She dodged, but in the next moment, my foot connected with her chest, and I sent her flying forty feet into the one muddy section of the entire field. She emerged, wet, dirty and pissed off.</p><p>She flung her hands outward, letting the excess mud spatter to the ground. \u201cYou real y went there, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>She sprinted toward me and grabbed my shirt. I was soon in the air, but landed on my feet\u2014just short of the mud.</p><p>\u201cNice try,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Claire was unhappy. She tried repeatedly to push, shove, throw, and punch me into the mud, but I either blocked her or put her there instead.</p><p>After half an hour, her platinum hair was tangled and brown, and we were both filthy and panting. She more than I, but coming into contact with someone covered in muck made it impossible to emerge unsoiled, and Claire was definitely a ful -contact adversary.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Jared said, walking out to meet us. He wiped a chunk of mud from Claire\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...not...finished with...her yet,\u201d Claire breathed.</p><p>Bex had been laughing uncontrol ably since the first time Claire found herself in the mud, but with one glare from his sister, the laughter silenced.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, breathing hard. \u201cNow you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cChicken!\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen what we need to see, and I don\u2019t want you to get overly tired. You may have angel blood running through your veins, but you\u2019re stil human. Until we know for sure how your body wil handle the stress, I don\u2019t want to push it too far.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I can throw punches at you anytime.\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed, and then put his arm around me as we walked to the Escalade. He was thoroughly enjoying my new Yes, Dear attitude. The truth was I couldn\u2019t live with myself if something happened to our baby.</p><p>Ryan took off his coat and draped it around Claire\u2019s shoulders, and then used his hand to scrape the rest of the mud from her face. She was never happy to lose a fight, but the excitement we all felt for this new development was evident in her eyes. \u201cI want a rematch after Bean is born!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d I cal ed back. I looked to Jared. \u201cShe\u2019s not serious?\u201d</p><p>Jared tried to subdue a smile. \u201cOf course not.\u201d His attention was diverted from the path to the road. Kim\u2019s Sentra barreled toward us.</p><p>The Sentra stopped abruptly, and Kim emerged, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>Jared raised his hands. \u201cI know you\u2019re impatient, Kim. We\u2019re leaving next week, okay?\u201d</p><p>When she was close enough, I gasped. Her clothes were covered in blood. \u201cWel , that\u2019s just great, Jared. Unfortunately for my uncle, it\u2019s too little, too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jared said, equal y alarmed. Bex, Claire and Ryan gathered around.</p><p>Ryan grabbed Kim\u2019s arm, but she pul ed away. \u201cOh my God, Kim. Are you okay?\u201d he said.</p><p>Kim didn\u2019t look away from Jared. Her eyes glossed over. \u201cI told you. I told you we needed to get it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Kim,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cSorry won\u2019t bring him back. I helped you, and when it was my turn, you dragged your feet until someone I loved was kill ed.\u201d She turned and walked toward her car.</p><p>\u201cSunday, Kim,\u201d Jared said, cal ing after her. \u201cWe leave Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s arm shot into the air and her middle finger pointed toward the heavens. A moment later, she was gone.</p><p>\u201cPoor Kim,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d</p><p>Claire crossed her arms, watching the Sentra disappear into the distance. \u201cThey\u2019re sending a message. If it were demons in true form they wouldn\u2019t have been able to get to him. They must be shel ing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShel ing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re taking human form,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Ryan nodded. \u201cLike possession.\u201d</p><p>Claire frowned. \u201cNo, like shel ing. They take over the body for a short amount of time to achieve a purpose. It doesn\u2019t leave the body weakened, and the human has no recol ection or aftershock.\u201d</p><p>Jared rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s starting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure as hel is,\u201d Claire said, heading quickly toward her Lotus.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I was quitting to go back to school, anyway,\u201d Ryan said, fol owing Claire. \u201cIf I would have asked for more time off to go to Jerusalem, they would have fired me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Claire put a hand on Ryan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThey were going to fire you anyway.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s head jerked in her direction. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you suck.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shrugged off her hand, and then used all of his might to shove her. She didn\u2019t budge, only turning long enough to offer a smal , amused smile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suck. You suck,\u201d Ryan grumbled, climbing into her car.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Last Minute Forgiveness</p><p>So much to do. So much, so much. Repetitive grumbling hissed from my lips as I rushed around the house. A week wasn\u2019t long enough to get my life in order. I scrambled around the house, up and down the stairs, trying to maneuver around my growing stomach. It became rounder and ful er every day. As I packed, Agatha worked overtime trying to finish the laundry, and Jared was constantly up and down the stairs, fetching clothes and medical supplies. It wasn\u2019t until he phoned in a favor to a friend for bags of saline, IV tubing and needles, and anticoagulant that I realized I wouldn\u2019t have my baby in a hospital\u2014not even at home. Bean would be born in a dark, timeworn cavern under the city of Jerusalem, away from modern medicine, but just beyond the reach of Hel .</p><p>Seven days didn\u2019t seem like enough time, but knowing that demons were shel ing, it was also too long. Anyone we happened upon could try to kil us. Any human was a threat. Beth, Chad, even Ryan or my mother. The thought of my mother as a demon made my blood run cold. She was already frightening enough as a human.</p><p>Grant needed to be informed of my upcoming absence, but something kept me from dialing the numbers. Knowing he was an Arch\u2014a fal en one, at that\u2014made me feel uneasy. I had been rude to him, even insulted him at times. Being kept in the dark seemed to be the theme of my life, and yet this time it felt like a violation of my trust by everyone. Not to mention the unspoken competition I felt between us was forever ended. He had won.</p><p>Every jab at my expense, every flirtation was only him goading me, and I played into his hand every time. Knowing that made future conversations with him difficult. The urge to admit defeat might come, and that would be the ultimate humiliation. Nope. Absolutely not. Wasn\u2019t going to do it. Jared was his celestial BFF. He could talk to Grant.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart?\u201d Jared cal ed from the hal .</p><p>I shoved more clothes into my suitcase and then zipped the lid shut. \u201cIn here.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI know. Bex cal ed. Grant wil keep an eye on Mom. He said he needs to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk to him. You know the details of the trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the details of Titan. He wants you to go in tonight. I\u2019m going to let Bex fol ow you in while I run to a friend\u2019s clinic to get the rest of the supplies, and then I\u2019ll be by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pul ed me to his side, his arms surrounding me. It just occurred to me why the temperature of his skin didn\u2019t feel as warm as usual. I was running the hybrid fever as wel . That was one thing I would be glad to have back once Bean was born: Jared\u2019s warmth had always been so comforting. Now that it was gone, I mourned its loss a bit.</p><p>Bex burst through the front door and sprinted up the stairs, stopping just short of us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jared tensed. \u201cWhat? Is it Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy else would you barge in and run ful speed up the stairs like that?\u201d</p><p>Bex shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just felt like running. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe big deal is that at any moment someone we care about could die. Don\u2019t do that to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Bex said, taken aback. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Jared stomped down the stairs and slammed the door behind him. Bex looked at me. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand on his shoulder and squeezed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Bex. He forgets you\u2019re just a kid, I think. You\u2019re doing great.\u201d</p><p>Bex\u2019s half-wounded, half-appreciative smile offered little persuasion that my pep talk did him any good. He waited for me to dress for the office, and then I all owed him to drive the Beemer to Kennedy Plaza.</p> <p>\u201cYou are so much like your brother,\u201d I told him as he opened my car door.</p><p>\u201cI wish he\u2019d see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the door. With them shel ing, we can\u2019t be too careful.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Although I felt bad that Bex had to babysit me once again, I was glad he was so close. The sidewalk was an obstacle course, and as usual I didn\u2019t choose the correct shoes. My high heels landed unbalanced on broken cement more than once, and my pregnant body wasn\u2019t in its most graceful state\u2014angel-blood-amped or not. If Bex\u2019s newly thick and bulging arms hadn\u2019t been there to grab me, I would have rol ed both of my ankles at the very least.</p><p>\u201cOkay. You made it. I\u2019ll wait in your car for Jared.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cSounds like a plan, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you could stop cal ing me that? I\u2019ll be fourteen in a few weeks, and it\u2019s awkward when people hear you. I look older than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cMy apologies, Mr. Ryel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex wil do.\u201d</p> <p>I pushed through the glass door, frowning. I wasn\u2019t sure when Bex had grown up, but it was unsettling. My boot heels clicked across the tile floor, muffling when I reached the elevator. The building was quiet, making me even more nervous to meet with Grant.</p><p>The elevator opened, and I stepped into a dark hal way. \u201cGrant?\u201d I cal ed. Everything was quiet. The sounds of the copy machine, the phones, the clicking of keyboards, and conversation were notably absent. The nervousness I\u2019d felt about speaking with Grant was overshadowed by something else. My body was on alert. Something was off.</p><p>A faint glint of blue light trickled from under my office door. I blew out the breath I\u2019d been holding. Get a grip, Nina. You bested Claire today.</p><p>Whatever is behind that door, you can handle.</p><p>I gripped the knob and turned, trying to keep the fear at a manageable level. When I realized who was at my desk, I was instantly angry.</p><p>Sasha, leaned back in my chair with her ankles crossed and on top of my desk, held the phone to her ear with one hand, and curled a strand of her ginger hair around a finger of the other. \u201cOh stop,\u201d she laughed, slightly swaying back in forth in my custom-made Aero chair.</p><p>I swung the door open, hoping to surprise Sasha so much that she fel onto the floor. Instead, she glanced at me and then continued talking without pause. \u201cUgh, and did you see the shoes she wore? I thought about giving her a mercy-nudge into that mud puddle just to cover them up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSasha,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice calm. \u201cHang up the phone, please. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Sasha rol ed her eyes. \u201cI need to go, Mom. Someone needs her office for the first time this week\u2014coincidental y when I\u2019m on the phone. Okay.</p><p>Bye,\u201d she said, returning the phone to its cradle. \u201cYou have the last cord phone in this entire building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my father\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>My first reaction was to run at her ful speed and tackle her bony ass to the floor. Then she wouldn\u2019t be in my chair complaining that it wasn\u2019t fit to her standards.</p><p>I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and began again. \u201cI\u2019m not changing anything in this office. I like it the way it is...because it is, in fact, my office. Which begs the question: What are you doing here at ten o\u2019clock at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question, Sasha,\u201d I replied, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cI was working,\u201d she snapped. She pul ed a file off the desk and held it against her chest as she approached me. \u201cTrust me, your office was happy for the change.\u201d</p><p>I started to cross my arms, but forced them to stay at my sides. \u201cWhat exactly do you hope to accomplish here by insulting the CEO of the company? How far do you expect to get here, Sasha?\u201d I hated how arrogant that sounded, but I was genuinely curious.</p><p>\u201cGrant is the CEO as far as we are all concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you should be concerned about is the company you\u2019l be applying to after you graduate. Who do you think wil sign your recommendation letter? Who do you think wil have the final say on your reference report?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows popped up. \u201cYou\u2019ve made an enemy of me from day one. You can\u2019t expect me to feel sorry for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant has plenty of positive things to say about my time here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant likes your short skirts and that you have coffee waiting for him every morning. Even if he did somehow notice the insignificant tasks you do complete, he would also see how many mistakes you make. You are not the asset to this company you believe you are, and you\u2019re a bi\u2014\u201d I stopped, catching myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a what?\u201d she goaded.</p><p>\u201cA bit rough around the edges.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cI know you\u2019re the princess of Titan. That doesn\u2019t mean you get everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you talking about?\u201d I said, wrinkling my nose.</p><p>Sasha stuck her hands on her hips. \u201cOh, enough already with the oblivious routine. You may have some people fooled, but I\u2019m not one of them,\u201d</p><p>she said, poking her chest with the last few words.</p><p>Frustrated, I closed my eyes, shook my head and sighed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t wish to resolve this, fine. But stay out of my office unless you have my verbal permission.\u201d I opened the door, gesturing for her to leave.</p><p>Sasha\u2019s arms crossed tighter, and she lifted her chin in defiance. \u201cTruth hurts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just threatened my career. Make time,\u201d she said, pushing the door shut.</p><p>\u201cWhat career?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than a fake one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? You\u2019re bitter because I\u2019m taking my father\u2019s place in the company? As if you wouldn\u2019t, had you the opportunity! What father doesn\u2019t want their child to take over the family business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never even here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it that you want, Sasha? My job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous that you have this huge office right beside Grant that you\u2019re never in! What a waste of company resources! Grant keeps this company running while you\u2019re off doing God knows what with your husband-slash-stalker...it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d she said, her face screwing so tight, the skin around the creases in her face turned white.</p><p>\u201cDisgusting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! When you do decide to show up, you\u2019re so busy flirting with Grant that you still don\u2019t get anything done. What wil happen to this company if Grant decides to leave? It\u2019s doomed!\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s words turned a light on inside my head, and I stood there in shock. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with him,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d Sasha said. \u201cYou must be losing sleep again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in love with Grant.\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s mouth fel open. \u201cAm not!\u201d</p><p>I pointed at her. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with him, and you\u2019ve been pissed at me this entire time because he flirts with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m jealous of you? That\u2019s just the most ridiculous...,\u201d she trailed off, laughing to herself. Her face turned red, and the she took a step forward. \u201cI don\u2019t see what anyone sees in you. You\u2019re not talented...at anything...you\u2019re not that smart, definitely not that attractive, you have no fashion sense, and you have the personality of a rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTel me how you real y feel,\u201d I said, incensed. \u201cI don\u2019t care what Grant sees. I\u2019m married to the most perfect, amazing, handsome man in the universe.\u201d Although it was the truth, I inwardly cringed at how sophomoric it sounded.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care? Then why did you stick me in the bowels of the file room? I know you wanted me out of the way!\u201d</p><p>I wanted to tel her that Grant was the one that cast her away, but that was more cruel than I was capable. \u201cYou can have Grant. I never wanted him,\u201d I said. Even the thought of Grant, of me and Grant...ew.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not yours to give away!\u201d Sasha howled. \u201cYou want to know what I can\u2019t stand about you? That! That right there! That snooty, presumptuous, overconfident tone you have when you have zero redeeming qualities! Your father thought you hung the moon, Grant thinks you can do no wrong, your best-friend-slash-assistant treats you like a queen, and your husband should have never given you the time of day. Now, you\u2019re pregnant and gloriously happy. I\u2019m not jealous, Nina, I\u2019m revolted! You don\u2019t deserve anything you have!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sasha said softly, clearly caught off guard.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any redeeming qualities to speak of. I don\u2019t know why Grant has that ridiculous crush on me\u2014if that\u2019s even what it is\u2014and I am the first person to admit that I don\u2019t deserve Jared. He probably just fel in love with me because it\u2019s his job to be around me twenty-four-seven, and he didn\u2019t have time to date. He disagrees, but I\u2019ve always thought....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel ,\u201d she cleared her throat, \u201cyou\u2019re not...you\u2019re not that bad. I mean, you\u2019re not funny at all but sometimes you make Grant laugh. And I\u2019ve seen you be sort-of kind to Beth. Once. No, you don\u2019t have any redeeming qualities, but since when does anyone need to be extraordinary to be loved?</p><p>Most people are average. Not me, of course, but it\u2019s perfectly fine that you are.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cI can see why you\u2019re upset with me. I haven\u2019t handled our situation in the best way. I should have talked to you. I didn\u2019t realize...I mean, looking back, I knew about Grant. But I thought it was the position you wanted, not necessarily him. Now that I know, I get it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s all that attractive, but I see why others do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very cute,\u201d Sasha sulked. \u201cHe real y does care about this company and the employees, and he\u2019s so smart\u2014and sweet. When he\u2019s not trying to figure out how to keep Titan on top, he\u2019s talking about you. It\u2019s infuriating. You are never kind to him.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not. I wil try to work on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI just meant that...don\u2019t go out of your way on my account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I would like us to get along better,\u201d I said. Now that I knew the source of her disdain, it was easier to understand the motives behind her hateful remarks. \u201cYou stil can\u2019t put your feet on my desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Total y out of line. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to say next. We had never been civil to each other, and now that we had come to an understanding, all that was left was an awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cI was, er...I was just about to get some coffee. I\u2019m going to be here all night reorganizing the file room. It\u2019s atrocious. So...do you want some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sasha said, trying a smile.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I said, pulling a twenty dol ar bil from my pocket. \u201cI can\u2019t drink coffee, especial y not the sludge in the break room. I\u2019ll grab me an apple cider and you a coffee at that place on Spruce. It\u2019s my favorite.\u201d</p><p>Sasha snatched the bil from my fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll get it. I need a break, anyway. I just need a flashlight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to park four blocks down in that parking garage because of the construction, and the lighting is nonexistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take my....\u201d I had to stop myself and think. Jared was surely back by now, but he couldn\u2019t take her in the Escalade, for many reasons. My car was parked at the curb just outside. The only people I had all owed to drive it were Jared and Bex, and that was only because they had supernatural powers of precision and lightning reflexes. It was too late, now. I\u2019d opened my mouth, and a retraction would shake our already fragile cease-fire. I would have to let Sasha drive the car my father had given me.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take the Beemer?\u201d I said, nearly choking on my words.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, holding out the keys. \u201cJust be careful, please.\u201d</p><p>Sasha smiled. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a large hot apple cider with caramel. Oh, and a slice of their Lemon Velvet cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s summer, but I can get you an iced coffee if you\u2019d prefer.\u201d I shook my head, and Sasha\u2019s expression changed quickly from confusion to understanding. \u201cOh, right. The baby. Okay, I\u2019ll be back in twenty.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>My keys jingled in Sasha\u2019s hand as she disappeared behind the elevator. I leaned against the wal , wondering if I had just made the biggest mistake of my life. How could I trust Sasha with my most precious possession? She hated me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I bit on my thumbnail, and paced back and forth a few times. I thought about the different items in my car. Would she go through it? Was anything incriminating inside that might hint at the truth about Jared? My cel phone rang in my pocket. I quickly fished it out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThen why is your blood pressure going through the roof?\u201d Jared said. His voice alone slowed my heart rate. \u201cI can stop her if you don\u2019t want her to take your car.\u201d</p><p>I walked through my office to the large window, looking down to the street below. \u201cYes, because that won\u2019t look suspicious at all .\u201d The lights of Fleet Rink were bright enough to il uminate the entire block, and I watched as Sasha fol owed the sidewalk, her red hair bouncing against her silk olive blouse. The headlamps of the Beemer blinked, and a short blip sounded when the alarm was deactivated.</p> <p>\u201cHer car seems in good shape,\u201d Jared said, trying to comfort me. He was in the Escalade across the street, pressing the cel phone against his ear as he smiled up at me.</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m worried. It\u2019s only a mile awa\u2014\u201d I began, but the words were cut off by a loud boom. In the same moment, the space where my car once sat turned into a bil owing firebal . The glass vibrated, but it didn\u2019t break. The windows of the Escalade didn\u2019t fare so wel . I could see Jared\u2019s shocked expression as he sat in the driver\u2019s seat. Flaming debris shot into the sky and fel into the street.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Help her, Jared! Help her!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>\u201cStay inside!\u201d Jared yel ed over the noise. He jumped from the Escalade and ran to the roaring flames. He covered his face with his arm, testing different sides of the car. I could see from three stories up that he couldn\u2019t breach the flames. Even if he had, Sasha was gone.</p><p>Jared watched the fire in horror, grabbing each side of his blonde hair with his fists. He shook his head, and then grabbed his knees, leaning over. After a few moments, he ran back to his Escalade and took off at ful speed. The wheels squealed against the pavement.</p> <p>I ran to my desk and grabbed at the phone with trembling hands. I tried to dial 911, but my fingers shook so much that I kept hitting the wrong keys. After the third try, Jared was beside me.</p><p>I col apsed into him, tears final y wel ing up in my eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I cried. \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted them to think I panicked and drove off. It was a bomb, Nina. They wired your car with a bomb.\u201d</p><p>I paused, my eyes widening. \u201cI kill ed her. I gave her the keys to my car and sent her to her death! Oh my God, Jared, she\u2019s dead! She\u2019s only twenty-two years old! She just got off the phone with her mother not half an hour ago!\u201d My voice grew shril er with every fact.</p><p>Jared hugged me to him, unable to find words of comfort. \u201cI should have sensed it. I should have smel ed it\u2014something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d I said, looking up at him with wet eyes.</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cNot a damn thing. The baby and how it affects your body saturates my senses. They must have wired it after you arrived at work. I don\u2019t understand. I wasn\u2019t half a block away. I should have seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to cal the police,\u201d I whimpered.</p><p>\u201cLet someone else do it. If whoever placed the bomb somehow mistook her for you, it may buy us some time. That\u2019s why I made such a show in the street. They\u2019re probably watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Must have been a shel . There\u2019s no way to tel how many are around.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and Jared pul ed my hand, leading me to the stairwel . He held his finger to his mouth, and then opened the door. We descended four flights of stairs into the basement level, and then sneaked out an access door to the all ey.</p><p>My shoes tapped against the wet pavement and sloshed through puddles. The moonlight glistened on the wet pavement we walked upon. Jared led us through labyrinthine all eyways cluttered with green trash bins and litter until we final y reached the Escalade.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>\u201cThen whose fault is it?\u201d I sobbed, hitting the door with my fist. \u201cI want to know! I want them to be held accountable for taking an innocent person\u2019s life! She was mean and spiteful, but she had her whole life ahead of her! It\u2019s not fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s sloppy. They\u2019ve never made a mistake like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it was a mistake?\u201d I sniffed.</p><p>\u201cOne way or another.\u201d</p><p>My face fel again. \u201cShe was in love. With Grant, and she never told him.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for Sasha. I\u2019m sorry for her family when they learn of her death, but we have a bigger problem here. We\u2019re leaving in one week, and you won\u2019t be all owed to leave the country if you\u2019re involved in an investigation. We have to explain why she was in your car, and why your car was there and you weren\u2019t. That\u2019s after they declare it wasn\u2019t you in the car. That could be a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to go away. Write a note to Beth explaining that we went on a short getaway and that you left your car keys on the desk in case she needs it, and I\u2019ll have Bex put it on the floor under your desk in your office so that it looks like it fel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go away for a few days. Figure out our next move.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed my eyes tight. \u201cJust stop it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Jared grabbed each side of my face and looked into my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. You\u2019re not going to give up.\u201d One hand left my cheek and touched my stomach. \u201cWe have a reason to fight more now than ever.\u201d</p><p>His cel phone buzzed in his jacket pocket. \u201cRyel. She\u2019s fine, but it was her car. No, her car exploded. They wired explosives to it. I\u2019m not sure, yet.</p><p>She let Sasha take it for coffee. No,\u201d Jared said, his voice low. \u201cWe\u2019re going to leave town for a few days; buy us some time. Send Bex. I need him to run a note to Nina\u2019s office. Bye.\u201d</p><p>Sirens sounded in the distance. Jared put his phone away and cupped his hands over my shoulders. \u201cYou with me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI need paper and a pen.\u201d</p><p>Jared patted his jacket and pul ed out a pen, and then he blurred out of sight. A few moments later he returned with a pink memo pad. I scribbled a few lines to Beth explaining my impromptu vacation and the location of my keys in case she needed to move my car, and then signed it. Five minutes later, a motorcycle pul ed into the all ey.</p><p>Bex planted his feet on the ground and pushed the visor of his helmet up. \u201cWhatcha got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut this in Nina\u2019s office, under her desk as if it fel . We need to explain this away.\u201d</p><p>Bex pul ed off his helmet and grabbed the paper. \u201cYou guys staying here or...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re leaving town for a few days. I\u2019ll cal you when we get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, yet,\u201d Jared said. \u201cStay out of sight, and go straight home to Mom.\u201d</p><p>Bex nodded once, and then sprinted down the all ey toward Titan. The sirens grew closer. Jared squeezed my hand and kissed my cheek. He opened the passenger door, and brushed the broken glass from the seat, and then repeated the process on his side. We drove south, stopping just outside of town. Claire and Ryan were waiting in Ryan\u2019s Tundra truck.</p><p>\u201cI figured you would need a vehicle with windows for your road trip,\u201d Ryan smiled, tossing Jared the keys.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Claire pointed to the bed of the truck. \u201cWe brought your luggage. Good thing you were going on a trip, anyway.\u201d I nodded, feeling a little lost.</p><p>Claire offered a sympathetic expression and a hug. \u201cSorry about Sasha. You\u2019l be soaking up the sun on vacation, and I\u2019ll be here finding out who tried to kill you. Whether they\u2019re human or not, they won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, and then tears pushed over my eyes and fel down my cheeks. I squeezed her tight.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, making a point to look into my eyes. \u201cThis wil all be over soon.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Road Trip</p><p>South on Interstate 95. With my head rested against the passenger side window, I kept the beat in my head with the white lines as they zoomed past and out of sight. My body felt empty and numb; I didn\u2019t know if I was awake or asleep. Traumatic events should have been second nature to me. Maybe that was why I wasn\u2019t a crying, shaking mess. I wasn\u2019t coping\u2014or maybe I was. Maybe I was simply feeling acceptance, but it was hard to know without feeling anything.</p><p>Jared moved a piece of hair from my face. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry,\u201d Jared said, rubbing my arm. It was just a comforting gesture; we both knew I wasn\u2019t cold. Bean coming sooner rather than later suddenly seemed a relief. Summer was unbearable for any pregnant woman, but considering my heightened temperature, it could mean trouble. Jared\u2019s hand left my arm and rested on my stomach.</p><p>My eyes final y shut sometime soon after entering the Bronx, and didn\u2019t open again until we were just south of Philadelphia\u2019s City limits. It was stil dark when I awoke, my hair plastered against my cheek, warm and moist between my face and the console. Jared had made the distance in half the time it should have taken.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before I processed where we were and why, and then the tears came. \u201cOh,\u201d I said, wiping my cheek. Being unsettled and upset was a strange relief. I was normal, after all .</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, sweetheart,\u201d Jared said, leaning over to kiss my hair.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from anyone?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cClaire shot me a text. They put out the fire and found the body. They think it\u2019s you. Everyone wil probably find out in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother....\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire already informed her. She wil play dumb and devastated to the police. She knows the routine.\u201d</p><p>I let a puff of air escape my lips. \u201cAt least she won\u2019t think I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be Monday morning before anyone notices Sasha is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, picking at my fingernails. \u201cShe was on the phone in my office talking to her mother. They seemed close. Her family could file a missing persons report today or tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded, deep in thought.</p><p>It didn\u2019t feel right letting Sasha\u2019s death go unannounced. If she typical y spoke with her mother daily, she could be waiting for her cal , her worry turning into panic. My hand drifted to my midsection, resting over the bump that protected our child. Sasha was someone\u2019s daughter. Her mother had brought her home from the hospital, taught her to crawl, walk, and raised her to the young woman she is; was. That woman, who loved Sasha more than anything else in the world, was sleeping peaceful y for the last time. The moment Sasha crossed her mind\u2014the moment it occurred to this woman to cal her daughter\u2014would be the first moment of thousands that she would feel a horrible sick feeling in the pit of her stomach. More guilt washed over me.</p><p>\u201cStop, Nina. It\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose we can tel Beth?\u201d I asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>Jared only offered an apologetic expression.</p><p>We pul ed into a gas station for the second time. Anyone else would have thought twice about stopping at such a nefarious-looking place in the wee hours of the morning. Bars guarded the windows, and several unscrupulous characters loitered next to the front door. Jared, however, stepped out and walked past them as if he were at the mal .</p><p>I waited in the truck hoping none of the people staring back at me would become curious enough to wander over. Jared was only inside for a moment, and then he emerged, holding a bottle of water and something deep-fried and stuffed with cheese and chicken.</p><p>He frowned as he handed them over. \u201cIt\u2019s not the healthiest thing, but I thought it would tide you over until we could find a decent restaurant.\u201d</p><p>I took a bite. It was disgustingly wonderful.</p><p>Just as Jared pul ed back onto the highway, my cel phone buzzed. The display lit up, and I instantly tensed. \u201cIt\u2019s Beth,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cYou have to let it ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is probably sick with worry. I can\u2019t just let her think I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p><p>Jared took the phone from my hand. \u201cI sympathize, I real y do. Beth doesn\u2019t deserve that, but we don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and looked out the window. Jared was right: Beth didn\u2019t deserve a friend like me. She had only been patient, honest, kind, loyal, and protective. I couldn\u2019t imagine the despair I would feel if I answered a cal that Beth\u2019s car had exploded with a charred body inside. My heart ached for her, and if I wasn\u2019t riddled with guilt before, now I was so ashamed I could barely stand to be in my skin. Tears wel ed up in my eyes and fel down my cheeks. If Beth ever found out that I knowingly all owed her to suffer over my death, she would never forgive me\u2014and I would never expect it from her.</p><p>The phone stopped ringing, and the voicemail chimed, letting me know she\u2019d left a message. I held out my hand to Jared, but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDo you real y want to hear the worry in her voice? You feel bad enough.\u201d</p><p>I covered my face with my hand and shook my head. \u201cThis is awful, Jared. This is so wrong.\u201d</p><p>Jared leaned over and kissed my temple. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Nina. I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at him and could see he was just as upset as I. If he could find another way he would, but once someone knew about our life there was no going back. I didn\u2019t want that for Beth, either.</p><p>We continued south, and by daybreak reached Maryland. The morning sun glistened on a sign that read Eden Pop.793. Trees lined the median on one side of the road; railroad tracks on the other. Other than a few bil boards and a patch of land used for tractor sales, I couldn\u2019t see much of Eden. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting name,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt fits, too,\u201d Jared said straight-faced. \u201cThe town is just as hard to find as the garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, ha,\u201d I teased, unimpressed with his joke. \u201cSo do we have an actual destination?\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cWe do, now. When I saw we were on Ocean Highway, I thought of the perfect place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is....?\u201d I trailed off.</p><p>\u201cVirginia Beach.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve never been there.\u201d</p><p>He met my eyes, matching my expression. \u201cI thought it would be a relaxing place for you to wait while the investigators figure out what happened, and then when they contact us\u2014and they wil \u2014we wil return in a few days, upset and flustered.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Jared\u2019s plan wouldn\u2019t work. If anything, once the Providence PD fol owed the breadcrumbs we left for them, we would look more suspicious. Jared\u2019s loft had already been declared an act of arson, and they had assumed it was him. Unable to prove anything, no charges were filed. But now that my car had also been targeted, he would be under investigation again. If they found out we were there at the time of the explosion, they could charge and hold us for a number of things. With every thought, my concerns compounded.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve had to explain myself to the police. I promise there is no need to worry. We\u2019ll explain our version and leave for Jerusalem as planned. If I can kill a dozen or so dirty cops in one night and keep our names out of it....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut her family. Don\u2019t you think the police stopped looking back then because they dug deep enough to see what was going on? Sasha\u2019s family wil want answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan and Claire wil take care of it. The family wil have answers. They\u2019l just have ones that don\u2019t imply either of us. You have a bodyguard that everyone knows about, Nina. Now everyone wil know why. You\u2019re a target, and Sasha was col ateral damage. It\u2019s not far from the truth, actual y. The only difference is that we won\u2019t have to explain why we fled the scene.\u201d</p><p>Jared took my hand and kissed my fingers, and then pressed my knuckles into his chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Sasha. She didn\u2019t deserve to die, but you can\u2019t blame yourself for her death. If it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault, it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened. \u201cHow can you say that? You couldn\u2019t have known\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have known. That very easily could have been you.\u201d He frowned at the thought. \u201cI\u2019m glad it was her and not you. I know you\u2019re wal owing in guilt about what her family wil feel when they get the cal , but I want you to think about the moment that car exploded. If it wasn\u2019t her? Honey, I would have watched my wife and child\u2019s death in the same moment. You can\u2019t wish that for me.\u201d He released my hand and wiped his eyes with his thumb and index finger, and then sighed. \u201cI\u2019m just glad it wasn\u2019t you.\u201d</p> <p>I wanted to tel him that it shouldn\u2019t have happened at all , but I was afraid it would only make him feel worse. \u201cFirst the loft, now the car,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t have anything before long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to take out whoever the hel knows anything about explosives, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d He laughed once, sounding exhausted. \u201cThis being so in tune with you and Bean that I\u2019m missing important things like a bomb on your car is also a negative.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt was ignition-based, so it couldn\u2019t have been there before you left for Titan. It had to been set up between the time you got there and when it blew. Bex would have sensed it.</p><p>The only time they would have had a window is after I arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible? You were in the Escalade a few feet away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he said, his expression unsettled. \u201cIt was difficult to focus before....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore what?\u201d I asked, knowing better. Jared had become skil ed at leaving me out of the loop. It wasn\u2019t like him to slip.</p><p>He replied with only a sigh, but he was visibly upset. It was then that I made a decision. I no longer wanted to be in the dark. I was a mother now.</p> <p>With so many important things at stake, it was time I took an active role in the effort to save our lives.</p><p>\u201cTel me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAfter we...I\u2019ve been more in-tuned to you for a while. I had just become used to wading through the mess to get to the basics of what I used to feel when you...when we....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis would be a good time to forget your usual hour-long explanation and just get down to the naked truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby. I sense it, too. It\u2019s amazing, but it\u2019s also distracting. Very distracting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sense the baby?\u201d I smiled. \u201cSo is Bean your Taleh, too?\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cThis whole situation is unprecedented. That would mean the baby is human, and that\u2019s obviously not the case. Maybe it\u2019s because the baby is a part of you. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>From that point on, Jared remained silent except for the few times we made pit stops. As the sun began to set, we had just breached the outskirts of Myrtle Beach. I couldn\u2019t help but think about the fact that Sasha\u2019s mother hadn\u2019t heard from her for a ful day, and at any minute they would go to her home, and the panic would begin. Sasha would be reported missing any moment. The guilt began to close down around me once again, so much so that it was hard to take in the beauty ahead.</p><p>While we were eating a late lunch, Jared had cal ed ahead and reserved a condo at Myrtle Beach\u2019s most Northern Point, the Grande Dunes Oceanfront. As we pul ed up to the resort, I gasped at its extravagance. It worsened my sense of guilt.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jared said. I could see the hope in his eyes. He wanted this to be an escape, but I couldn\u2019t stomach maternity massages and facials knowing my friends and Sasha\u2019s family were going through hel .</p><p>\u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do. I real y do. But this is not a real vacation. We\u2019re hiding out while most of the people I know think I\u2019m dead, and Sasha\u2019s family frantical y search for her.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded and squeezed my hand. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea, but I\u2019m not pitching a tent on the beach for my pregnant wife. You deserve a little comfort while you\u2019re busy stressing out for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019A little comfort\u2019 would be the Super 8 down the road, Jared. This is a resort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beachfront, and the ocean wil clear your head. C\u2019mon.\u201d</p><p>Jared checked in while I tried to seem completely normal about the fact that we brought two large ful suitcases for a quick getaway. The staff was too pleasant, almost eager that we had arrived. I thought that strange for two reasons: One, Jared cal ed for reservations just a few hours before; and Two, we weren\u2019t celebrities. Their behavior quickly had me convinced that they were shel s, and they would attack us at any moment.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart?\u201d Jared cal ed over his shoulder.</p><p>I glared at the girl behind the desk. Her blonde spiral curls bounced against her ful , pink cheeks. Her warm brown eyes were glazed over with the absolute captivation she felt standing before Jared. I remembered that feeling. Jared was ridiculously beautiful, and his looks and confidence alone must have made them think he was famous in some way. Okay, maybe they weren\u2019t demons with skin, but that girl was stil looking at my husband as if she wanted to eat him.</p><p>\u201cJust fine,\u201d I said with my best fake smile. Other than watching a col eague I\u2019d known for three years turn into toast before my eyes, I wasn\u2019t sure why I was in such a foul mood. Girls like that behaving in a completely understandable way hadn\u2019t affected me in years. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d rol ed my eyes at waitresses or coeds nearly slobbering over Jared. It could be several things, but I was sure my rounding form was the culprit.</p><p>Jared returned to me and the luggage. Inside the room, Jared placed our luggage on the mattress, and looked around. The room was spacious and light, not unlike any other hotel room I\u2019d spent time in.</p><p>\u201cThis is nice,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cHave I ever told you that you suck at smal talk?\u201d I smiled. I walked the few steps to reach him, and then pressed my forehead against his chest.</p><p>Jared laughed and kissed my cheek. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I went tot he bathroom and splashed water on my face. The puffy towels smel ed sterile and flowery, a quick giveaway that we weren\u2019t at home. I groaned and stretched. A bel y nearly in ful bloom and a long road trip didn\u2019t mesh wel together. I felt stiff and groggy.</p><p>\u201cNap or beach?\u201d Jared said. He pul ed off his boots and slipped his bare feet into a pair of leather sandals.</p><p>\u201cBoth sound equal y appealing, but a walk on the beach after being stuck in the car is the better option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d he said, holding his hand out to me.</p><p>We lazily walked to the near-private beach of the Grande Dunes, letting the new summer wind whip around us. The scene looked like a postcard; everything I imagine the perfect beach to be. Jared picked a spot and unfolded a blanket. He sat with his elbows resting on his knees as he looked out toward the ocean.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like being back in Little Corn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost.\u201d</p><p>Jared peered up at me. \u201cSit with me.\u201d</p><p>I fidgeted, knowing I was about to play into my childish insecurities. \u201cThey were attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girls behind the desk.\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed once, and then crawled onto his knees. He leaned toward me and placed his hands on each side of my bel y. \u201cNina, there has always been something about you that I couldn\u2019t shake. Even when I didn\u2019t want to love you, I was drawn to you. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else. Now you\u2019re my wife, and you are carrying our child. There is nothing more beautiful than that. When you\u2019re sweaty and exhausted holding Bean, then that wil be the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen. When I see tears fal from your eyes when we send Bean off to the first day of kindergarten... that wil the most be the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen. When you comfort me each time we send our kids to training; on every one of our anniversaries; and when you\u2019re hair turns gray. Every one of those moments wil be the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled his nose into my bel y, and then wrapped his arms around my middle. \u201cYou always say the right thing,\u201d I whispered, touching his ears.</p><p>He looked up at me. \u201cIf the impossible happened, and something more beautiful existed, I wouldn\u2019t notice. You have my constant, undivided attention. You always have.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cOnly because I pay you.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s white, wide grin was a contrast against the tan tone of his face. \u201cNot any more. When you marry your boss, you can pay yourself.\u201d</p><p>I playful y nudged him in the ribs, stil he hugged me to him. Resting on the blanket, we watched the sun slowly melt into oranges and purples until it sizzled against the ocean. I wondered if the sky looked the same on the other side of the world. If once we arrived in Jerusalem, if we would see the sun again until the baby was born.</p><p>I relaxed back against the blanket, looking up at the sky. The stars were visible on the eastern half of the sky, but they were stil burned out by the sun in the West. Jared grabbed my arm, and I froze.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled and pul ed out his Glock. \u201cYou almost laid on my sidearm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought your gun? Worried the grains of sand would shel ?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhen the others start shel ing, it\u2019s impossible to know who\u2019s a threat and who\u2019s not. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t get to the Sepulchre fast enough as far as I\u2019m concerned. I almost wonder if they didn\u2019t blow the Beemer on purpose. If they knew our plan\u2014and I\u2019m sure they did\u2014if they didn\u2019t kill you in the process, they thought it would keep us from leaving. Bex has a harder time sensing them, so I know with my...distraction, it could be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that with everything else we\u2019re dealing with, your senses are overwhelmed, too.\u201d I frowned. \u201cNow that I think about it, none of this is very fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering the circumstances, I think it\u2019s clear we have some fans up there. We have Eli and Samuel vying for us. That\u2019s a huge advantage in and of itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like it,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>My cel phone rang. It was Beth again. I closed my eyes tight while Jared took the phone and pushed the silence button. He buried it into the tote I had carried with me to the beach and then pul ed me against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou can tel her goodbye before we leave. She\u2019l only feel this way for a few days and then you can comfort her. She\u2019l probably tackle you and forget all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jared took in a deep breath and wrapped his arms tighter around me. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know you are. It\u2019s just that I feel I\u2019m hurting her intentional y. It\u2019s not fair that she is the only close friend that isn\u2019t in the loop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you real y want to expose her to all of this? More importantly, do you think she can handle it?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. I know you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t want to tel her, I just feel like a jerk. \u2018Jerk\u2019 doesn\u2019t even cover it. I\u2019m a bad friend\u2014a bad person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019l be able to close her eyes every night not wondering what\u2019s with her in the dark, Nina. I\u2019d say you\u2019re being kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Can you imagine her reaction when she finds out we\u2019re leaving for Israel in a few days? She\u2019s going to freak out. I don\u2019t even know how to explain it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t. It\u2019s not a necessity to tel her we\u2019re going to Jerusalem. Just say the West Coast or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pressed my lips together in a hard line. \u201cI\u2019m tired of lying to her, Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The stars had crowded out the last colors left behind by the setting sun, and the ocean was as black as the sky above. I might have been chil y at night by the water a few months before, but being wrapped in Jared\u2019s arms coupled with my own elevated temperature, the sun might as wel have been bearing down on my skin.</p><p>The wind rol ing off the water blew my hair into Jared\u2019s face, and he turned his head, blowing the strands from his mouth.</p> <p>I smiled, but my amusement quickly faded. \u201cSpeaking of Jerusalem....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they know we\u2019re going, won\u2019t they try to stop us? If it gets worse than a car bomb we\u2019re going to be busy. What if they wire the plane?\u201d I laughed once without humor. \u201cWhat if they shoot us down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a possibility. But we\u2019re prepared.\u201d</p><p>Dread settled over me. We were vulnerable on the plane, and it was a ten-hour flight.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll land, get you and the book to the Sepulchre, and wait it out underground until you deliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound simple, but you forget demons wil do everything they can to stop us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just have to get you there. It\u2019s smooth sailing after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hope.\u201d</p><p>The skin around Jared\u2019s eyes tightened. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop by the warehouse before we leave. Talk to Eli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he said to come to him when we only had one question to ask?\u201d</p> <p>Jared kept his eyes on the ocean. \u201cI don\u2019t think the question is ours to ask.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>The Road Home</p><p>We revisited that spot on the beach many times over the next two days. Jared sat with me and watched the waves rol onto the sand, and the water carry distant ship slowly across the horizon. We discussed our upcoming trip to Jerusalem, but Jared kept most of the details to himself. He didn\u2019t want to worry me with the truth of what he saw coming. Although I was much stronger than I used to be, that didn\u2019t change the fact that I was carrying our child.</p><p>The only sound was the wind and the intermittent waves sizzling against the sand, but my mind was crowded and loud. Sometimes I would close my eyes tight and try to push out the hundreds of frightening thoughts in my head, but then I would see Sasha. No matter how tight Jared wrapped his eyes around me, or how hard I tried to pretend we were in Little Corn, thoughts of demons, and Sasha, and bombs plagued me.</p><p>My cel phone rang several times. Beth\u2019s phone number dominated the cal log, and my voicemail, with her frantic pleas. Sasha hadn\u2019t come to work, and it was clear she was also missing. Before long, other people began to cal . Even Cynthia, although I assumed it was just to keep up pretenses for the police. As far as they knew, she was afraid I was dead or missing.</p><p>By the evening of the second day, Jared\u2019s phone buzzed. \u201cRyel.\u201d Jared listened for a moment, gave a quick affirmation, and then hung up. \u201cThe investigators expect the results of the dental records any minute. It won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , that\u2019s good news, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>Sasha\u2019s family learning that it was her remains the police had found inside of my vehicle wasn\u2019t a good thing, but it was a means to an end. It al was. The true good news was that I could final y cal Beth.</p><p>Claire was right, within the hour, she texted a confirmation. When Jared gave me the go ahead, I dialed Beth\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cWhere in the hel have you been?\u201d she wailed. \u201cI thought you were dead!\u201d Her breathing quickened until sobs developed in her throat, fol owed by a pause in the form of muffled noises before Chad came on the line.</p><p>\u201cUh...hel o?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI left a note. I thought everyone knew I was gone. Jared and I needed some time away, so I turned off my phone. I feel awful.\u201d</p><p>The last bit was true. I could hear Beth sobbing in the background; hearing Chad try to comfort her only made me feel worse. Between consoling her, he tried to fil me in on what had happened. He described the scene at Titan, the police tape, the lines of employees waiting to be questioned, and the blackened asphalt where my BMW burned into the night.</p><p>Before long Beth took the phone back and put it to her ear. \u201cMy life has been miserable. Everyone at Titan either spread rumors, or spontaneously burst into tears, or alternating between irritated and hateful. Did you know Sasha is missing, too? It\u2019s insane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissing?\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice steady. The guilt weighed on me with every lie I told.</p><p>\u201cOh my...oh my God, Nina. The last person to speak to Sasha was her mother. She said Sasha was working late at Titan the night she went missing. Do you think it was her in your car? I mean...if it wasn\u2019t you, then who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know. Maybe you should say something to the investigators.\u201d</p><p>Beth began to cry again. \u201cThat poor girl. You should cal your mother, and then cal Providence PD and tel them you\u2019re okay. You\u2019l probably have to come back right away.\u201d She sniffed again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry in advance if I smack you upside your head for scaring the beejeezus outta me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed once. \u201cYou\u2019re forgiven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay. As much as I loathed that woman, I hope it wasn\u2019t Sasha, either. That\u2019s an awful way to die...Nina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone put a bomb on your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt certainly appears that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...doesn\u2019t that...doesn\u2019t that bother you?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, resolved to tel her at least some of the truth. \u201cI\u2019m used to it, Beth. Why do you think my father hired Jared?\u201d</p><p>Beth didn\u2019t speak for a long while, and then final y managed a whisper. \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t think about it. I\u2019m sorry. I remember Mr. Dawson, but I...I didn\u2019t know things were so frightening for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the beach, Beth, and I\u2019m married to my bodyguard. Don\u2019t worry for me, okay? We\u2019ll talk when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Beth blew a deep breath of relief into the phone. \u201cPlease hurry. I need to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared is already packing.\u201d</p><p>I sat in the truck, dreading the long car ride home while Jared checked out at the front desk. He jogged to the Tundra, and slid into the driver\u2019s seat, leaning in to kiss me. \u201cI know it was stressful, but I cherished these last three days with you. When we go away, it\u2019s easy to forget about the rest of the world.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his hand, holding it tight. He knew as wel as I did that our return would stir a hornet\u2019s nest. We had just enjoyed our last few days of peace, and now we would be fighting for our lives. I touched my stomach, and Jared reached over to touch the same spot with his free hand.</p><p>His blue-gray eyes darkened, and his brows pul ed in. I nodded, knowing exactly what was on his mind. He leaned in for a kiss, soft and slow. His lips pul ed at mine the way they did when we first met, as if it could be the last time. He pul ed away, and then pressed his forehead against mine.</p><p>We sat there in silence, in our emotional embrace. Neither one having the courage to cry or speak, just in case it became overwhelming.</p><p>Jared put one hand back and wheel and shoved the gear in drive. \u201cOkay,\u201d he sighed. \u201cBack to Providence.\u201d</p><p>The drive home seemed to take less time. Jared made me repeat the story we would tel the police over and over. I had recited the words dozens of times when the twinge hit.</p><p>Jared immediately looked down to my stomach, and then his eyes met mine. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cMaybe we could pul over for a moment. I should walk, I think.\u201d</p><p>The Tundra made a gentle turn to the left, pulling into the gas station we had stopped at on the way to Virginia Beach. A familiar group of transients idled in the parking lot. Jared opened my door, and kept close as we made our way into the store. To escape the eyes of the quiet group as we walked past, I kept my eyes on the asphalt, noting the grease spots and wads of old gum. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was their presence, but something seemed off, and I could tel that Jared felt it, too.</p><p>Jared held the door open for me, and even though I let out the breath I\u2019d been holding, the heavy feeling only became worse. Apart from the cashier, we were the only ones in the store, but I stil couldn\u2019t Meandering in the aisles with no real goal, I stretched my back and neck, picking up a package of something and then setting it back onto the shelf. A roach crawled from behind bags of crackers and then disappeared. I lurched back my hand, and glanced around. I didn\u2019t recal the store being quite so filthy the last time we were in, but my memory consisted of a quick trip to the bathroom.</p><p>One of the fluorescent lights blinked and buzzed overhead. From my peripheral vision, I could see that the man behind the counter was staring at me. He was of smal build, and dark-complexioned. His lack of expression made me instantly nervous. I\u2019d seen that look before.</p><p>I heard the cooler doors shut, and then Jared rounded the corner with two large bottles of water and a forced smile. He held out his hand, pul ing in his fingers twice to signal me to come to him. The air around us felt stale, and my heart began to thump loudly against my chest.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have long,\u201d the man behind the counter said, glancing to my protruding bel y.</p><p>I instinctively touched my stomach with my free hand.</p><p>Jared cautiously approached the cash register, keeping me a safe distance behind him. He took another step and paused. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>The man was panting, his body swaying in a rhythmic movement. Sweat glistened across his face and neck, and dampened his white polo shirt.</p><p>The darkened circles under his eyes made his sunken eyes seem even more alarming.</p><p>When offered no response, Jared took a step back and threw a ten-dol ar bil onto the counter. \u201cThat should cover it.\u201d</p><p>The man looked down at the folded bil before him, and then closed his eyes. He pressed his fingertips onto the counter, and then his body vibrated for a few moments before he snapped straight. He peered up at Jared. His eyes had changed; now obsidian orbs bulging from their sockets.</p><p>Jared put his hand on my chest and nudged me toward the door. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>I stumbled back, reaching blindly for the glass door behind me. The smal man jumped into the air and landed in a crouch on the counter. \u201cI\u2019m going to gut her like a fish.\u201d The sound of his voice was terrifying; a combination of a smal child and the hiss of a snake.</p><p>I pushed open the door and ran head first into one of the large men that belonged to the group of bikers in the parking lot. He had a long, gray beard, and wore riding leathers. Forgetting my new strength, I plowed over him, knocking him to the ground. The man looked up at me with shock and confusion. Within seconds, all expression left his face, and the blackness of his pupils spil ed into his irises, and then to the whites of his eyes.</p><p>I scrambled away from him, and then Jared grabbed my arm, pulling me to the Tundra at ful speed. The passenger door slammed in my face, and then Jared was next to me.</p><p>\u201cSeatbelt!\u201d he commanded.</p><p>I grabbed for the clasp, trying in vain to remain calm. The smal , dark man gal oped toward us on all fours. Jared stomped on the gas pedal. The nozzle was stil tucked in the Tundra\u2019s gas tank, and after a quick yank, the line came free of the pump, dragging behind us as Jared fish tailed onto the highway.</p><p>I rol ed down the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Jared yel ed.</p><p>\u201cYour gun!\u201d I said, my heart pounding against my rib cage.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d</p><p>He pul ed his Glock out from behind him, and placed it on the seat between us. I grabbed it, and then leaned out the window. Jared grabbed a fistful of my dress to keep me from tumbling to the road below. The smal man stood in the parking lot, chin down, watching us flee with his unnatural black eyes. I stretched out my arms in front of me, and pointed the gun at him, aiming at his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Jared yanked on my skirt, pulling me into the cab of the truck. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hel not? He was going to kill us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce the demon leaves, the Shel is human again. He\u2019s an innocent, Nina.\u201d Jared pressed a button on his door, and my window rol ed up, cutting off the wind that had blown my blonde hair into a wild mess.</p><p>I turned to keep an eye on the Shel s. There was no tel ing how many had turned. The fuel line swaying against the asphalt distracted my attention.</p><p>The nozzle final y broke free of the Tundra, and rol ed into the ditch. A loud boom vibrated the truck, and a bal of smoke and fire rol ed into the sky.</p><p>The smal man stil stood in the street, glaring at us, just in front of the roaring flames.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d I cried.</p><p>\u201cSo much for that,\u201d Jared said, frowning. He peered into the rearview mirror to assess the damage. A column of fire shot up from fuel pumps. It would be a miracle if any of the people we\u2019d left behind survived.</p><p>\u201cThose people,\u201d I moaned, touching the palm of my hand to my forehead. My eyes fil ed with tears, and I turned to face the front.</p><p>A few miles later, two large fire trucks, a pumper truck, and an ambulance raced toward us. all four vehicles ran hot, ful lights and sirens screaming, fading away as they passed. The ambulance trailed behind, but the second its back bumper was in line with ours, it flipped around.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see it,\u201d Jared said, grabbing his side arm from the seat. He reached over, pulling my seat belt tight, and then without slowing down, jerked the Tundra to the right, turning one hundred and eighty degrees until we were face to face with the black-eyed ambulance drivers. Jared held his Glock outside of the window and aimed, shooting at their tires. The ambulance fishtailed, and then Jared jerked the truck again until we were once again facing north, with the ambulance behind us.</p><p>The ambulance skidded, and then tumbled forward, final y cartwheeling across the road and into the field on the opposite side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I watched it seemed to happen in slow motion, but within seconds of seeing the emergency vehicles, Jared had taken out the ambulance\u2019s front tires and righted the truck so we could go about our journey. My mind hadn\u2019t quite caught up with the events, but my heart was ripping through my chest.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said not to kill them!\u201d</p><p>Jared put the gun back in the seat and peered into the rearview mirror. \u201cI hope they\u2019re not dead.\u201d</p><p>He picked up his phone and held it to his ear. \u201cClaire. They\u2019re shel ing. I need backup.\u201d He snapped the phone shut, and then pushed the phone under his thigh.</p> <p>\u201cIs she coming?\u201d</p><p>He nodded once. \u201cThey all are. We just have to get to them.\u201d The Tundra surged forward when Jared stomped on the gas. The speedometer climbed from seventy-five, to eighty-five, then ninety-five. The engine screamed a deafening soprano as Jared desperately tried to get us closer to his sister.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we lost them,\u201d I said, more to comfort myself than to convince my husband.</p><p>Jared reached his hand across the console and gripped it around mine. We were vulnerable, and he knew it. Any human we came across was a threat. Jared\u2019s hand squeezed tighter, and all color left his face.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t decide if I should turn off the highway to a road that\u2019s less traveled, or stay and cut down on time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis particular stretch didn\u2019t seem busy when we came through. Maybe We\u2019ll get lucky. It\u2019s the cities I\u2019m worried about.\u201d</p><p>We passed only a car or two over the next ten minutes. Every time I saw something in the distance, I tensed and waited. Each time the car would pass without so much as a wave, and the adrenaline would absorb back into my system. I was beginning to feel sick and dizzy after an hour, but I knew we couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re up to something,\u201d Jared said. He was squinting, trying to focus as far out as he could to see any impending danger.</p><p>\u201cHow long before we meet Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know when they left. I\u2019m assuming right away. Considering the time of the cal and how fast Claire drives, I would say less than an hour.</p><p>Maybe half that.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded quickly, trying to make myself feel better. \u201cThirty minutes. We can hold on for thirty minutes. What could they possible throw at us that we couldn\u2019t handle for that long?\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t speak for a solid minute while he studied the road ahead. When he final y focused on a tiny dot in the distance, his face fel , and his breath caught. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d</p><p>I knew my human eyes wouldn\u2019t have been able to make out the dark blur several miles ahead, but Bean gave me focus I might not otherwise have had. The long, dark blots on the road, dancing against the heat off the asphalt, barreled toward us.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until I tried to form a sentence that I realized my mouth was gaping open. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>Jared released my hand and reached under the seat. He offered me an extra handgun, and then put both hands on the wheel.</p><p>A caravan of Army vehicles, a Humvee, three Jeeps, and a large supply truck moved toward us at ful speed. The back of the truck reminded me of a covered wagon, only one covered with camouflaged tarp.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding,\u201d I said, breathless.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably on their way to Fort Story,\u201d Jared said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care where they\u2019re going. This is why things have been so quiet, Jared. Hel knew about that caravan and planned to shel them the second they crossed our path. You have to leave the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019l just fol ow.\u201d</p><p>I sighed in frustration, and then looked down at my watch. \u201cMaybe they aren\u2019t armed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat FMTV transport has an armored cab. It could obliterate the Tundra if I let it get close enough.\u201d</p><p>I turned to him and tried a nervous smile. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jared returned my smile, and then nodded, gripping the wheel. He pressed on the gas. I wasn\u2019t sure what he had decided, but he had a plan. It was possible that the drivers of those trucks wouldn\u2019t shel at all . We could pass them without a problem like we had the previous ten or so vehicles.</p><p>That, of course, was just empty hope. I could feel a strange burning deep inside my bones. Every one of those soldiers had already turned.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The Most Important Thing</p><p>The jeep passed first, and then the Humvees. I was just about to all ow myself hope when the transport truck jerked into our lane. Jared didn\u2019t twitch; he just drove faster. The needle on the speedometer vibrated at one hundred miles per hour. I gripped the door handle so tight that my knuckles turned white under the pressure. I trusted that Jared had a plan, but at the same time, soaring down the road to meet an armored truck in a head on col ision didn\u2019t sound like a good idea to me.</p><p>\u201cHang on, sweetheart,\u201d Jared said, his voice low. \u201cWhen I get out, take the wheel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you get out?\u201d I said, instantly panicked.</p><p>In a move that was so smooth it seemed choreographed, Jared swerved to the right and jerked the wheel again in a nearly perfect half-circle around the Army truck. As the Tundra spun off the road, Jared opened the door and stepped out, shooting directly at the Army truck\u2019s tires. I heard several popping noises, but I was focused on grabbing the wheel and getting my foot on the break. Although I was terrified, the move was effortless, and before I had time to be afraid, the Tundra had come to a stop on the shoulder.</p><p>I peeked over the steering wheel to see the truck skidded to a stop, all of its tires blown. Jared held one of the soldiers in the crook of his arm.</p><p>The soldier went limp, and Jared lowered him gently to the ground. I counted eleven men on the ground, all of them unconscious.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes met mine, and then he looked behind him, noticing the other vehicles circling around. He took off in a sprint, pointing behind me. I turned to see two shiny dots in the distance. I squinted, focusing in on the objects, and made out a motorcycle and a black sports car. It was Claire\u2019s Exige, traveling at a speed manageable only to Earth\u2019s most badass Hybrid.</p><p>I turned the wheel and stomped on the gas, picking Jared up along the way. My foot was flush against the floorboard as we raced toward our family.</p><p>Jared had barely broken a sweat.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. The shel s don\u2019t have the strength of demons because they don\u2019t have the same hold on them that they do when they take the time to possess. I didn\u2019t want to kill them, so I incapacitated them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWil they come after us after they wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Jared said, turning around. \u201cFaster, honey.\u201d</p><p>The jeeps and Humvees were gaining ground, and with a quick calculation, I figured if we were lucky we would reach Claire when the Army vehicles caught up to us.</p><p>Jared leaned out the window and aimed at the tires of the first Jeep. His gun clicked, and he popped out the clip. He leaned into the back seat and pul ed out a bag, dropping it to the passenger floorboard. It was ful of ammo and handguns.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hel did that come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire helped me pack.\u201d He shoved another clip into his gun and flung his top half out the window.</p><p>He got off only a few more shots before ducking back inside. The Exige swerved to one side of the road, and Bex\u2019s motorcycle went to the other, creating a clear path for us. I looked to my right, and everything went from hypersonic, to a snail\u2019s pace. Claire came into view, and half of her mouth was pul ed up into a smile. She winked. Ryan was in the passenger seat, showing me his fist. His index finger and pinky was up, and his mouth was open, his tongue hanging out.</p><p>When they passed, I pul ed off to the side of the road and made a wide turn. One of the soldiers manned the Tourette of one of the jeeps, aiming in Bex\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p><p>Jared reached over and turned off the ignition. \u201cWe wait.\u201d</p><p>Claire drove until she was behind the caravan, and then flipped around, pulling alongside one of the Jeeps. Her tiny arm appeared outside her window, gun in hand. She pul ed the trigger once, shooting out the front tire. The Jeep swerved out of control, and then cartwheeled toward the Tundra.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>My husband held my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>The Jeep continued to rol at us, end over end..</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d</p><p>I pul ed the keys from his hand and shoved the keys in the ignition, and then paused as I watched the Jeep skid on its side and come to a halt inches away from our bumper. My heart started beating again and a puff of air escaped my lungs.</p><p>Gunfire drew my attention down the road. The Exige fel behind what was left of the caravan, driving strangely straight and at a decent speed for a moment before Claire popped out of the passenger side, In the next moment, Bex was next to her on his Ducati. As if they\u2019d practiced the move a mil ion times, Claire jumped onto the back of Bex\u2019s bike\u2014backward\u2014with two guns.</p><p>Bex pumped his wrist, and the motorcycle took off like a rocket. Claire\u2019s platinum hair whipped into her face while she took out another Jeep\u2019s tires, but the soldier on the next Jeep began firing on them.</p><p>Bex maneuvered close to the Jeep and then he jumped off his bike high in the air, flipped, and landed sure-footed behind the soldier. After a short scuffle, the soldier flew off the Jeep and rol ed onto the shoulder. Claire flipped around and drove the bike next to a Humvee, punching through the class and pulling the driver from his seat and into the road. The Humvee fishtailed and then rol ed six times, final y slamming into a tree.</p><p>Claire skidded the bike to a stop, and then hopped off of it, pulling the remaining soldiers out of the Humvee. She checked each for a pulse, then picked the Ducati off the ground and pushed it to the Tundra. Ryan slowed the Exige to a stop just a few feet away, and then got out.</p><p>\u201cGlad this is fun for you,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes immediately fel to my stomach. \u201cWhoa, Nigh, how long were you gone? You look ready to pop.\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes, and then my eyes drifted behind Ryan, to the Jeep approaching slowly. The Jeep parked, and then Bex stepped out, frowning at Claire. \u201cDid you scratch it?\u201d</p><p>Claire shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019l buff out.\u201d</p><p>The scene behind them looked like the aftermath of war.</p><p>\u201cShould we cal an ambulance?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI already did,\u201d Ryan said, crossing his arms across his chest.</p><p>Claire fiddled with her hair, knotting it into a bun. \u201cThey won\u2019t remember anything, so we should move out before any of them come to.\u201d She handed Jared a set of keys. \u201cThe Escalade is good to go. You can pick it up at Mom\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Jared wrapped his arm around Claire\u2019s head, trapping her in the crook of his arm, and then gave her a quick kiss on the head. \u201cThanks, kid.\u201d</p><p>Claire pul ed away with a smile, waving him away dismissively. \u201cWe were bored, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Jared punched Bex in the arm. \u201cNice moves, little brother.\u201d</p><p>Bex lifted his chin and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m a beast. Wait \u2018til we get to Jerusalem.\u201d</p><p>Jared and I returned to the Tundra, with him back in the driver\u2019s seat. In a caravan of our own, we returned to Providence. The Exige behind us, the Ducati in front, we raced home. Sandwiched between my brother and sister, I felt at ease, completely different from an hour before. I leaned back and took a deep, relaxing breath. Jared smiled and reached his hand across the console. We intertwined our fingers, and I watched the different terrain pass by my window, unfazed by what might be ahead. I knew I was safe, and in that moment, that meant everything.</p><p>Just after sunset, we pul ed into Lil ian\u2019s drive. Bex pul ed into the yard, and held the door open for me. Claire was next, and she and Ryan walked together up the sidewalk. They were elbowing each other and smiling, stil happy and excited. Ryan didn\u2019t seem affected in the least, and it was at that moment that I knew they were truly meant for each other.</p><p>Jared patted Bex on the shoulder as he walked by, and then took my hand, guiding me into the dining room. Lil ian was expecting us, and the table was already set. She brought out a large plate of brisket, and placed it in the middle of the table. Claire disappeared into the kitchen, and Bex fol owed.</p><p>Lil ian pul ed the oven mitts from her hands, and then wrapped her arms around my neck. \u201cLook at you! Darling, you look wonderful! How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig,\u201d I said, only half-kidding.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take long,\u201d she said. Her smile was as warm and bright as the sun.</p><p>Lil ian had always made me feel so loved and welcome. I was sad that she wouldn\u2019t be there for Bean\u2019s birth.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, touching my cheek. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving soon.\u201d</p><p>She offered a comforting smile. \u201cI know. But the next time I see you, you won\u2019t just be my favorite daughter-in-law, anymore. You\u2019l be the mother of my grandbaby.\u201d</p><p>I leaned into the crook of her shoulder, and she hugged me tighter. \u201cYou probably haven\u2019t had a home-cooked meal in a few days. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>At the table, Claire and Bex were chattering excitedly about the encounter with the Army trucks, and Ryan was busy stuffing food in his mouth.</p><p>Lil ian cut her food into smal , bite-size pieces, smiling as she listened to her children talk about their day.</p><p>Jared smiled, amused at how Claire and Bex took turns with each sentence of the story. He held a fork in one hand, and touched my knee with the other. I noticed the end of the table had an extra, empty place setting.</p><p>I leaned into Jared\u2019s ear. \u201cIs Lil ian expecting someone else?\u201d</p><p>Jared looked down to the plate, and then shrugged. \u201cEr...Mom? Is someone else coming to dinner?\u201d</p><p>Lil ian\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cYes. I didn\u2019t have much notice, so I extended the invitation a bit late.\u201d</p><p>The doorbel rang, and everyone at the table traded glances. Lil ian patted her mouth quickly with the napkin and then pushed her chair away from the table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The familiar sound of clicking heels echoed through the entry, down the hal , and into the dining room.</p><p>\u201cOh, Nina, dear!\u201d Cynthia said, her arms outstretched.</p><p>I stood, a bit startled when she took me into her arms. \u201cHel o, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia relaxed her grip and held me at arm\u2019s length. \u201cI heard what happened. I trust you\u2019re all right?\u201d I nodded and she continued, \u201cAnd the baby?\u201d I nodded again, and she pul ed me against her once more. \u201cThat\u2019s very good news. Good news, indeed.\u201d</p> <p>It felt a bit strange to have her at our dinner table, listening to the chaos and wreckage Claire and Bex described. She didn\u2019t seem affected, however.</p><p>After Bex served dessert, I realized it would be our last time for several months to see Lil ian, and Cynthia, and that we were all trying very hard to pretend it wasn\u2019t. The Ryels were a practiced family at this sort of thing, but I struggled to keep the sadness away. I caught Cynthia more than once glancing in my direction. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was my bel y that held her curiosity or the fact that she wanted to memorize my face in case we never saw each other again.</p><p>After a proper amount of post-dinner socializing, Cynthia excused herself, citing a previous engagement. I walked her outside, and watched with a smile as Robert got out of the car and opened the back door for Cynthia.</p><p>Cynthia looked down at her expensive shoes, and then laughed once. \u201cI could\u2019ve been a better mother, Nina, dear.\u201d</p><p>Her words caught me off guard. I wasn\u2019t sure how to reply, but even if I had been, she didn\u2019t give me the chance.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been hard for me. I was never what one might cal a natural-born mother. These instincts that people talk about...wel , I never had them. Your father was always so good at hugs and kisses. I suppose I envied him for that.\u201d She dabbed her nose with a tissue, and then looked up at me. \u201cI do love you. If you\u2019ve ever questioned that, please accept my sincerest apology.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed her hand and offered a smile. I could feel my eyes threatening to tear. \u201cI love you, too. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia took me in her arms, and beyond her thin shoulder and the porch light, I saw Robert\u2019s shocked expression. She let me go, and without looking back, she left, her heels clicking against the pavement until she disappeared into the car.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t ready to meet the curious stares of the others. I walked around to the back of the house, and leaned against a beam of the back porch.</p><p>Murmuring caught my attention, and I saw Ryan and Claire sitting on the porch swing, looking up at the sky.</p><p>She was giggling, and he nonchalantly rested his arm on the back of the swing behind her. She didn\u2019t lean away, and I smiled at the scene.</p> <p>\u201cI had fun today,\u201d Ryan said, watching for Claire\u2019s reaction.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t tel .\u201d She rol ed her eyes, but couldn\u2019t hide her smile.</p><p>\u201cMy favorite part was when we traded places in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet it was.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged stories about the battle with the shel s, and laughed as they teased each other. Every time Claire was in Ryan\u2019s line of sight, his eyes lit up, and his grin was so innocent and animated, it was infectious.</p><p>Ryan pushed back against the swing, and again they sat quietly, with just a few residual giggles interrupting the stil night. Claire held her feet out in front, her tan legs a perfect accessory to her cut off jean shorts and casual pink tank top. The black combat boots just made her outfit more \u2018Claire\u2019.</p><p>Ryan rubbed the back of his head, trying to seem casual. \u201cI gotta tel ya. I\u2019m a little nervous about the trip.\u201d</p><p>Claire turned to him, squaring her shoulders. \u201cAre you scared, little girl?\u201d</p> <p>Ryan huffed, playing off her taunt. \u201cScared. Psh. I can handle it. I\u2019m nervous about how it\u2019s going to turn out. What if something bad happens?\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s playful smile melted, and she faced forward. \u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, what if it does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll fix it. I always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if something happens and you can\u2019t fix it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s only happened once.\u201d</p><p>Ryan squared his shoulders, facing her completely. \u201cYou mean your dad?\u201d</p><p>She only nodded.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been up against something like this?\u201d</p><p>Claire paused for a long time. I wished that I could see her expression. I wasn\u2019t sure if she was annoyed at his line of questioning, or she was afraid of the answer.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Ryan said. When Claire ignored him, he tapped her shoulder. \u201cHey.\u201d She looked at him, then. \u201cI\u2019ll be right behind you. And I don\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t take care of yourself, because we all know you can. I just mean if something happens, I\u2019m not going anywhere. Whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>Claire took a breath. \u201cI just assumed you already knew, but now I realize you don\u2019t. Jared is the last line of defense, so if we lose them, we won\u2019t know it. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>After a pause, Ryan nodded.</p><p>Claire continued, \u201cThe baby she is carrying is the most important thing. We have to protect it until we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby is important,\u201d Ryan agreed. \u201cBut you are the most important thing to me.\u201d</p><p>Claire watched him, and then her eyes fel to his lips. Ryan\u2019s eyes turned soft, and then he leaned in.</p><p>Watching them suddenly felt wrong. I turned, trying to find the best way to escape. The way I came seemed to be the best exit, and I took a step back.</p><p>Claire smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve watched this long, you might as wel stay and watch it play out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. My face instantly flushed.</p><p>Jared appeared at the back door, holding it wide open. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>Ryan laughed and shook his head. \u201cIt was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jared said with an awkward look. He and I traded glances, and then he retreated into the house.</p><p>Claire giggled, and then punched Ryan in the thigh.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait up!\u201d she said, fol owing me to the front yard. She was at my side in less than a second, and hooked her elbow around mine. \u201cI meant what I said you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d</p><p>Claire stopped, her face fel , and she lowered her chin so I could see directly into her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know how all this wil play out. Knowing Jared, he has a plan B, C, and D, but if something goes wrong, We\u2019ll just figure something else out. The only other option isn\u2019t an option.\u201d I shook my head, and Claire pul ed me into her chest with a tight squeeze. \u201cPiece of cake.\u201d</p><p>Jared stood at the Escalade with keys in hand. \u201cWe should get going. We stil have to stop by the warehouse.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and then waved to Claire. Ryan walked up behind her, putting his hands on her shoulders. It was so natural to see them standing next to each other, I couldn\u2019t remember what it was like when Ryan didn\u2019t know the Ryel secret, and he and Claire didn\u2019t spend every waking moment together.</p><p>\u201cSee you on the plane,\u201d Ryan said with a contrived smile.</p><p>I paused. \u201cI\u2019d understand if you didn\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m a marine, Nigh. I live for this shit.\u201d</p><p>Jared tugged on my hand. When we reached the Escalade, he sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, starting the engine. \u201cI\u2019m worried for us, and what We\u2019ll have to put up with when they don\u2019t have an impending war to keep them entertained.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Questioned</p><p>Jared drove across town, and then took the highway that would lead us to the warehouse. Once we exited the highway and hit a dirt road, I knew we were close. The night sky was clear, and every star in the universe seemed to be present to watch over us. No wind, not even the sound of crickets or cicadas played for us as we parked and walked down the gravel drive. Jared unlocked the large, rusted lock of the gate, and then I fol owed him to the side door. Jared pushed the button, and then waited.</p><p>Accustomed to waiting ten or twenty minutes, I settled in, but the door immediately clicked, and Jared pul ed me inside.</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s service,\u201d I said, smiling.</p><p>Jared smiled back. \u201cHe\u2019s expecting us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he always?\u201d</p><p>The ful moon let in the only light, casting large shadows across the vast cement floor. My sandals scraped against the dirt, and echoed throughout the building. Jared walked across the room, stopping in the middle.</p><p>This time was different from the visits we\u2019d made before. This time, I could feel Eli. I could almost smel him. It seemed like he was closing in; that he was in the next room and making sounds to signal he was heading our way, but there was no sound. I could only feel it.</p><p>His energy grew stronger, and then he was standing in front of us. The same ensemble as usual, I smiled at his casual sandals. I withstood the urge to hug him. He had saved our hides the last time I\u2019d seen him, but I didn\u2019t know where we stood now.</p><p>Eli\u2019s smile was immediate and sincere. \u201cHel o, Nina. You look positively radiant! Doesn\u2019t she look radiant, Jared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cTime is so inconsistent between planes. It seems like I\u2019ve been waiting ages for you two. I trust the family is doing wel ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far,\u201d I said.</p><p>Eli held one arm across his middle, and touched the other hand to his mouth as he feigned being lost in thought. \u201cHmmm...you\u2019re going on a trip, soon? Leaving this weekend?\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded.</p><p>Eli\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI heard. You real y aren\u2019t going to make this easy for the dark side, are you?\u201d</p><p>Jared took a breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem concerned.\u201d</p><p>Eli laughed once. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be concerned when nothing is a surprise. Just once I\u2019d like to say, \u2018Ohemgee!\u2019 you know?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, and Eli nodded, glad for my reaction.</p><p>Jared released my hand, and then rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cThis is no road trip. We need protection in the air.\u201d</p><p>Eli pul ed his mouth to the side. \u201cHe\u2019l remain neutral.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cHow can I protect her if the plane goes down? This opens us up to any amount of obstacles. Power failure, engine failure...if we end up in the water, we could wind up in a storm with fifty-foot waves. That\u2019s not balanced.\u201d</p><p>Eli nodded. \u201cTrue. I\u2019ll put Samuel on it. Make sure things stay fair. Deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d Jared nodded. \u201cOne more thing....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re ready, are you?\u201d Eli said, his eyebrows shooting up.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cThat looks awful y close to surprise to me.\u201d</p><p>Eli grinned from one ear to the other. \u201cIt feels like it, too. I should probably say, \u2018Ohemgee\u2019 to make it official, right? Ohemgee! You\u2019re ready?\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled and then looked down, nodding. \u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Eli\u2019s expression softened. \u201cThe last question. The child is special, Jared. The first angel born to earth. As you already know, this child is capable of much, and has powers beyond your comprehension, but your wife is your only responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned, trying to understand what Eli was trying to tel him.</p><p>I gripped Jared\u2019s arm. \u201cBut I thought once the baby is born, it\u2019s protected. Isn\u2019t that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Eli said. \u201cBut Jared is not its protector. He is yours.\u201d</p><p>Jared put his hand on mine. \u201cAsk your question, Eli. Ask the only question left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you trust her?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d Jared said. He looked at me, confused.</p><p>I could see Eli staring at us. His words were soft and slow. \u201cA mother\u2019s love is everything, Jared. It is what brings a child into this world. It is what molds their entire being. When a mother sees her child in danger, she is literal y capable of anything. Mothers have lifted cars off of their children, and destroyed entire dynasties. A mother\u2019s love is the strongest energy known to man. You must trust that love, and its power. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>Jared never took his eyes from mine. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Eli nodded. \u201cThen have confidence to carry out your plans.\u201d</p><p>I looked to Eli to tel him goodbye, but he had vanished. I took a deep breath, and threw my arms around my husband. \u201cDo you feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I think you incapable, but I\u2019m not practiced in the art of spectating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just told us we could go to Jerusalem and be safe! He just said everything wil be all right! Didn\u2019t you hear him?\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cI heard him tel me to hand you total control.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cAnd I heard you say you would.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded, clearly frustrated. \u201cI know. I wil .\u201d He took my hand and led me to the Escalade. I shot him a warning glare, and he winced. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he means that I should lead the operation. My love for our child wil keep it safe. I take that as a good thing, and it sounds very simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo simple. I don\u2019t want you thinking we\u2019re going to land and take a taxi to the Sepulchre and everything work out as planned. It\u2019s going to get messy, very fast.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his hand. \u201cWe can do it. We have to.\u201d</p><p>Jared took my face in his hands and pressed his lips against mine. I grabbed his blue T-shirt in each of my fists and pul ed him closer. My stomach kept us farther apart than usual, but I was as close as I could get for the moment.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Jared said, backing away.</p><p>I grabbed my stomach and laughed. \u201cYou felt that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. Think Bean\u2019s trying to tel us something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we\u2019re grossing him out?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jared opened my door and helped me in. \u201cOh, now it\u2019s him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m playing around with both.\u201d</p><p>Jared shut the door and in the next moment, slid into his seat. He shoved the shift into gear and then pul ed away, a residual smile on his face.</p><p>I leaned over and hugged his arm, leaning my head on his shoulder. For the first time in a long time, tomorrow didn\u2019t seem so ominous. Eli gave us all a bit of hope.</p> <p>My cel phone rang, and I fished it from my purse, reading the display. \u201cHi, Beth,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few hours. I know I said I would come over. We had to see Lil ian and Cynthia, first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I get that, but you could have at least cal ed!\u201d</p><p>I frowned. I was failing right and left at friendship. \u201cOkay. Let me make it up to you. I\u2019ll meet you at the pub in twenty minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe pub? Real y?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sure you need a drink. I\u2019ll cal Ryan and Claire. They can meet us there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like old times!\u201d Beth squealed. \u201cI\u2019ll tel Chad!\u201d</p><p>I dropped the phone into my purse and smiled. \u201cShe hung up on me.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s wise to meet in a public place after the day we just had?\u201d</p><p>I looked out the window. \u201cThis is my town. I dare them.\u201d</p> <p>Jared chuckled, and then took my hand, kissing my fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re very attractive when you\u2019re feisty.\u201d</p><p>I grinned over his compliment, and watched Providence pass by as we made our way to the pub. Once in a while I would sneak glances at him.</p><p>Jared hadn\u2019t changed much since we met. He was stil the tal , blond, movie-star-handsome man that sat next to me on the bench almost three years before. His chest and arm muscles stil caught my eye when they moved and flexed under his shirt; his blue-gray eyes stil made me pause.</p><p>Life couldn\u2019t have spiraled out of control anymore than it had, but I wouldn\u2019t trade it. A different life didn\u2019t even appeal to me at that point. Despite that we were about to run for our lives, I had everything I\u2019d ever wanted, with a man I loved desperately. Was the danger, stress, and fear worth it? Damn right it was.</p><p>The neighborhood around the pub had deteriorated since my freshman year. The streets seemed darker, and instead of col ege students congregating outside the front door, those loitering were much older, wearing sad stories on their faces. Jared pul ed into the parking lot across the street. Nearly hopscotching my way around the puddles in the road, I ignored the stares of those standing outside, and led Jared into the pub. Tozzi was no longer behind the bar. In his place was a large woman with long, yel ow hair. She didn\u2019t greet us when we came in.</p><p>\u201cNew management, I\u2019m guessing,\u201d Jared said as we found a table. \u201cI guess Beth hasn\u2019t been here lately, either, or she would have said something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame. Some of my favorite Brown memories are of this place.\u201d</p><p>Jared put his elbows on the table and settled in, smiling. \u201cYou mean the first night we danced?\u201d</p> <p>I rested my cheek on the palm of my hand, shooting a flirtatious smile across the table. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I was referring to, yes.\u201d</p><p>The music was loud, so I resorted to texting Beth to see if she wanted to meet elsewhere. I felt safe anywhere if I was with Jared. Although Chad was no pipsqueak, I couldn\u2019t imagine she would be comfortable here.</p><p>Seconds after I sent the text, Beth and Chad pushed through the door. Beth\u2019s eyes were wide as she looked around, and only slightly relieved when she recognized Jared and me. She waved at us, and then pul ed Chad hastily across the room to our little corner.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hel happened to this place?\u201d she said.</p><p>I leaned into the table. \u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Chad said, puffing up his chest. \u201cI\u2019m ready for a beer.\u201d</p><p>We ordered, then Claire appeared, with Ryan right behind her.</p><p>One of the men whistled, and then slapped Claire\u2019s backside. She jerked to a stop, and with her stiletto boots, kicked the leg of the chair the man was in. It splintered, sending him tumbling to the ground. Neither Claire nor Ryan glanced behind them. They simply continued to our table as if nothing had happened.</p><p>One of the misfits at the man\u2019s table stood, and then Jared pushed himself away from the table, rising until his six feet, two inches towered over his chal enger. Even from across the room he was intimidating. When the friend promptly took his seat, Jared did the same.</p><p>\u201cYou always have to make an entrance,\u201d Jared grumbled to his sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never get his greasy fingerprints out of this fabric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for wearing pleather,\u201d Ryan joked.</p><p>\u201cThis is not pleather,\u201d Claire seethed. She jerked her head, shaking her bangs from her eyes. Her ice blue irises glowed against her nearly white hair, and I silently hoped that Bean looked just like her. A little nicer, of course, but physical y, Claire was the perfect female specimen.</p><p>Beth fil ed us in on the magnitude of emotions at Titan, the rumors, and how wel Grant was handling it all . The longer Beth talked, the hotter the pub became, as more grungy bikers and seedy individuals flowed through the door. Hearing Beth over the noise became more difficult for Chad, but Jared and I only pretended to struggle. To me, Beth sounded like she was talking directly into my ear.</p><p>A fight broke out, and Jared stood. He was on high alert, waiting for the crowd around us to shel . I watched the scuffle until they were thrown outside, and then I breathed. Jared was right. I was too confident. Even with the added security of Claire and Ryan, Chad and Beth could easily be hurt if the rowdy crowd inside shel ed and we had to fight our way out.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should find somewhere else,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Beth jumped in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the tab,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Claire rol ed her eyes. \u201cYou guys are babies.\u201d</p><p>Beth and I left Claire and Ryan sitting at the table, walking together toward the door. Just a few feet away, we waited for Chad and Jared to pay the bil . Chad was laughing at something Jared had said. I smiled. There was something so satisfying about Jared socializing with someone other than our inner circle. It made him more...human.</p><p>Spending time with people who didn\u2019t know our secrets was relaxing for me, and it seemed to be that way for Jared, too. In that moment, I accepted my choice to keep the truth from Beth. Not only was it for her own safety, but I could rationalize that it was for my own sanity as wel .</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve real y popped!\u201d Beth said, gesturing to my stomach.</p><p>Instinctively I put my hand on my rounded bel y. \u201cCrazy, isn\u2019t it? It seems like it happened overnight.\u201d</p><p>Just then another fight broke out. People were punching and shoving, their bodies bouncing against each other like pinbal s. I desperately tried to find Jared in the chaos, but when a line of sight final y opened up, he was no longer beside the bar.</p><p>Knowing the safest place for us was outside, I hurriedly opened the door and pushed Beth into the night air. The fighting spil ed out onto the sidewalk, forcing Beth and me farther away. I tried to keep her out of harm\u2019s way, tugging on her until we found ourselves in the all ey.</p><p>\u201cOddly enough, I feel safer in the dark,\u201d Beth whispered.</p><p>Yel ing and breaking glass sounded just around the corner, and I decided to stay put. We waited for Jared and Chad, but the minutes passed, and I fought away feeling of panic. I imagined they were fighting their way out of the pub in that moment, and at any second they would come around the corner.</p><p>The smal space between the two buildings didn\u2019t all ow for much light. I felt a chil down my spine, and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. From each end of the all eyway, whispers floated from the shadows.</p><p>I squeezed Beth\u2019s hand. \u201cWe should see what\u2019s taking so long.\u201d</p><p>Beth nodded. We took a step, and then froze. A large man that I recognized from the pub stood in the way, his eyes bulging black spheres. His mouth moved, but he spoke in a different language. Something I\u2019d never heard before.</p><p>Beth let out a smal gasp, and she took a step back, pulling me with her. A dark, metal side door opened, and the bartender stepped out. Her expressionless face and dark eyes signaled that she had shel ed as wel .</p><p>\u201cOooooooh sh\u2014\u201d Beth began, but I pushed her against the brick wal , right beside a dumpster.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Jared and Chad wil be here any minute,\u201d I said. I turned, holding up my hands in a defensive pose.</p><p>The two shel s approached me, the woman with a frightening smile, and knife in her hands.</p><p>\u201cChad!\u201d Beth yel ed. \u201cWe\u2019re in the all ey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d I cal ed. I could stil hear yel ing from the sidewalk fight. It would be difficult for anyone to hear; not that any of them would come to our aid. I deduced that Jared was dealing with Shel s of his own, or he would already have reached us. The Shel s came closer, and I braced myself.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d I said.</p><p>The woman lunged at me, and I dodged. I kicked, buckling her knee. Her head hit the brick cement wal just a few feet from Beth\u2019s feet. Beth covered her mouth and let out a yelp. The bartender regained her feet, blood dripping from her hairline, and took a step toward Beth. I picked up a branch beside the dumpster and swung with both hands. The woman fel to the ground. The knife clanged against the asphalt.</p><p>Beth leaned over, picked up the knife, and held it in front of her, shaking. \u201cDon\u2019t go near her!\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant!\u201d</p><p>The man smiled, and spoke something inaudible once again. He ran at me, and I jumped over him, letting him careen at ful speed into the brick wal . He stumbled back, and I attacked. My hands bal ed into fists, and I punched his face over and over, and then grabbed his leather jacket with both hands and threw him to the ground. He grabbed my ankle and yanked, knocking me off my feet, but within seconds, I was standing, my hands out and ready.</p><p>My senses were heightened again, signaling that more additional danger was coming, but it was too late. Someone burst out of the shadows and hooked an arm around my neck.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone!\u201d Beth said, running at us with the knife.</p><p>I held out my hand, palm out. \u201cStay against the wal , Beth!\u201d</p><p>She stopped mid-step, confused, and then I jerked my head back, hitting my assailant in the nose with my skul . I turned to see another man, this one skinnier and lanky, on the ground. Blood was spattered on his cheeks and forehead.</p><p>The larger man came at me with the branch. I used my forearm to hit it out of his hand, and then shoved the heel of my hand into his throat. In Claire-like fashion, I spun around, kicking him in the head. He fel to his knees. I reared back my hand and punched him with my fist in the jaw, knocking him out cold.</p><p>The skinny man kicked my back, and I fel to the ground, but caught myself before I fel flat.</p><p>\u201cNo! Nina!\u201d Beth screamed.</p><p>I turned around, and threw every one of my limbs at him, kicking and punching. We were half way down the all ey before he final y swung and punched me in the face. Half-surprised that he had landed a punch, half-amazed that it didn\u2019t hurt, I paused. Taking advantage, the skinny man lunged at my middle. My motherly instincts kicked in, and rage wel ed up inside of me. I moved to the side, and his fist landed against the brick.</p><p>Seeing that he\u2019d left his side open attack, I reacted, shoving my elbow into his throat, and then with one hand, I picked him up, and with all of my strength, I cried out, simultaneously throwing him against the opposite wal .</p><p>He rol ed to the ground, and didn\u2019t get up again.</p><p>Beth ran to my side and threw her arms around me. I could hear her heart thumping against her chest, and she could barely catch her breath.</p><p>Jared and Chad rounded the corner, both disheveled. Jared\u2019s terrified expression melted into relief, and his shoulders fel .</p><p>Chad\u2019s eyes were wide, his breath labored. \u201cBeth!\u201d he cried, jumping over the bodies in his way.</p><p>Beth released me and ran into Chad\u2019s arms, immediately breaking into loud sobs. It was then that Chad noticed the limp bodies on the ground, and his eyes met mine. \u201cWhat the hel happened?\u201d</p><p>Beth held up her hand, palm out. \u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d she said, sniffing. She wiped her nose and took a step toward me. \u201cI love you, but please don\u2019t tel me how you did all of that. I honestly don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , I do,\u201d Chad said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better that you don\u2019t,\u201d Jared said, shouldering past Chad. He reached for me, and I fel into him. \u201cEvery last one of them shel ed. It took forever to get out the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame, but we\u2019re not going to that pub again,\u201d Chad said, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s been taken over by misfits and criminals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Claire and Ryan?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Chad rol ed his eyes. \u201cCleaning up. I think they\u2019re enjoying themselves.\u201d</p><p>We walked around the corner to find Claire standing alone, her arms crossed. Ryan grabbed a man twice his size and head-butted him.</p><p>\u201cThe PD wil be here any minute,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Claire said. \u201cBut I find him strangely attractive right now.\u201d</p><p>Jared rol ed his eyes and led me to the street, and Beth and Chad fol owed. When we reached the parking lot, Chad took a deep breath. His hands were trembling, as were Beth\u2019s. I felt so sorry for them. They didn\u2019t deserve to be dragged into our mess.</p><p>\u201cBeth,\u201d I said. I licked the blood from my bottom lip. \u201cWe\u2019re going away.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shot up. \u201cAgain? But, you just got back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to cover for me at Titan. Work under Grant. We\u2019ll be gone for the summer.\u201d</p><p>Beth left Chad and wrapped her arms around my neck, squeezing me tight. \u201cI just need to know one thing: Are you going to be okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, taking a deep, cleansing breath, and straightened her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you wil .\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p> <p>Direct Flight to Hell</p><p>My hands shook. The seat belt clanged as I tried to buckle it for the forth time. Claire was two feet away, stuffing her carry on in the overhead bin.</p><p>Jared was outside, directing baggage and making doubly sure the preflight check had been carried out at least three times. Bex\u2019s deep voice hummed from the back as he joked with Ryan. His nervous energy was evident in his tone, and even though he was trying to play it off, it was there.</p><p>The sun had set, and because of an earlier light summer rain, the tarmac glistened. Jared was pointing in every direction, answering questions, his expression severe. I was glad that he was able to burn off some of his anxiety by choreographing our departure.</p><p>\u201cOh, for Pete\u2019s sake, Nina. Here,\u201d Claire said, snapping my seat belt closed.</p> <p>I sighed, and nodded in thanks, and she left me for Bex and Ryan. I rested my head against the seat and took a deep breath. My nerves seemed to take a back seat when I watched Jared work outside, so I tried to keep my concentration on the window.</p><p>A dark figure approached Jared. Kim. She was unhappy, and when I realized she would ride with us for the duration of the trip to Jerusalem, my anxiety level doubled. We had all abandoned her. She was left to fight alone, even after she was promised for some relief. She had helped us, and we turned a blind eye while she lost sleep and her uncle. I was afraid of what she would have to say to me. And she had plenty of time to either let me squirm, or cal me out.</p><p>She held out her hand. With the abilities Bean had given me, I could hear her dry voice.</p><p>\u201cThe book.\u201d</p><p>Jared put the Naissance de Demoniac in her grasp. \u201cI know you don\u2019t believe me, but I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d Her voice was tired. Any sign of the Kim we once knew was as nonexistent as our former life. She took the book and held it to her chest, and then pul ed a cel phone from her pocket. As she walked to the steps of the plane, I heard her sigh.</p> <p>\u201cDad. I have it. We depart in ten minutes.\u201d She clicked the phone shut.</p><p>I wiped my moist brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your deal?\u201d Bex said, tapping my shoulder. \u201cYou sick? You look sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel wel .\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows turned in, deepening the same line that gave away Jared. Bex sat in Jared\u2019s seat, and patted my hand. \u201cYou have Kim, the human demon repel ant, three hybrids, and a cop/ex-special forces guy on this plane. Not to mention you\u2019re kind of a badass yourself these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex,\u201d I warned.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Don\u2019t tel Mom.\u201d</p><p>Kim boarded the plane. Her clothes were stained and wrinkled, hanging from her gaunt body. The dark circles under her once-soft brown eyes appeared like purple bruises on her ashen skin. She only carried the book in her hand, and the phone in her pocket. No luggage, no carry-on. She had one mission, and one mission only. Nothing else mattered.</p> <p>Her eyes met mine, and she froze. Ryan passed my seat, and approached her. They traded glances, but no words were spoken. Ryan kissed her bony cheek, and she let her body weight lean against him. He supported her weight for a moment, and then squeezed her tight before letting go.</p><p>She used the seats to support her weight as she approached me.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>My eyes fil ed with tears. Nothing I would say would be adequate. I didn\u2019t deserve to talk to her.</p><p>Bex stood, and then helped Kim into the seat he occupied. She turned to face me, and her chin lowered. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips together in a hard line. An apology seemed insulting; I could barely look her in the eye.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I just wanted you to know that, you know...in case we crash and burn in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her in disbelief, and then the corners of her mouth turned up, and she winked and left.</p><p>Settling back into my seat, I took a deep, not-so-relaxing breath. The smal crowd loading the plane had dissipated, and Jared made one last sweep of the plane before boarding.</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d Jared said to us all . \u201cFrom the moment we depart until we land, it\u2019s out of our hands.\u201d</p><p>I reached out to him, and he grabbed my hand, sitting in the seat beside me. He kissed my fingers, and closed his eyes. I waited for several moments, but he stayed stil and silent. I turned to see Bex and Claire, eyes closed. Bex\u2019s lips moved in prayer.</p><p>Guilt washed over me. They didn\u2019t need to be on the plane. Bex didn\u2019t, either. If Hel pul ed a fast one and the plane went down, we were helpless to stop it. I knew they didn\u2019t question their presence, though, but that only made me feel worse. It was all of us, or none of us, and the display of the lengths our mismatched family would go to for each other brought tears to my eyes.</p><p>Jared wiped the tear that raced down my cheek. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, forcing a smile. \u201cI was born for this, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all were.\u201d</p><p>The engines whined, and the plane wheels began to rol . The wing lights blinked against the fuselage, casting a red glare at half the time of my heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cTry to relax,\u201d Jared whispered. His voice held no conviction. He knew they were just words.</p><p>We all waited for our impending death, knowing our chances plummeted the second the plane was in the air. The flight to Jerusalem was long\u2014 too long to cope with constant fear that every jostle or noise would signal our fal from the sky.</p><p>I turned to look at my family. Claire and Ryan were in deep, quiet conversation. Bex sat next to Kim, chewing his pinky nail, and Kim stared blankly ahead. The engines whined as the wheels rol ed forward. The pilot taxied on the runway, and after a short pause, the plane surged forward.</p><p>The sudden acceleration of the aircraft pressed my back into the seat. I closed my eyes, trying not to feel every flaw in the runway, or the wind resistance against the wings. My new abilities were exciting, and at times had saved my life, but for the first time, I wished for the aptitude to turn them off.</p><p>As we raced faster and farther down the runway, I imagine the tiny wheels, and how on earth at that speed the plane didn\u2019t veer off into the grass, or a building. At that point, everything that could possibly go wrong before we even got off the ground flashed through my mind, and my heart pounded so hard against my chest wal that I thought I would die of a heart attack before we left Providence.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Jared said in smooth tone. He leaned into my ear, and his lips brushed against my skin. He pul ed my arm across him, and kissed my neck. I gripped his shirt, my knuckles white. I was relieved to be in the arms of my husband, but for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d I said, stuttering.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He gently held my jaw with both of his hands, and lowered his chin. His dark blue eyes met mine. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make it. I won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start making promises you can\u2019t keep, now.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me, hard and purposeful. Once, I could have become lost in a kiss like that, but the wheels were leaving the ground, and we were now a large and easy target.</p><p>\u201cNina, you have to have faith.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows pul ed together. \u201cSomeone is going to have to give me a reason. I\u2019m all out of faith.\u201d The plane dipped a bit before making a sharp turn.</p><p>\u201cLook at how far we\u2019ve come,\u201d he said, smiling. He meant to be comforting, but I could see the fear behind his eyes.</p><p>I buried my face in the crook of his neck, and squeezed him to me. My eyes shut tight, trying to push away the overwhelming feeling that we had been deceived, corral ed into this deathtrap \u2014the one place Jared couldn\u2019t control.</p><p>The plane righted itself, and then climbed effortlessly into the night sky. The lights below appeared to shrink, until they seemed like glowing clusters of fireflies. Everything else on the ground was black and ominous.</p><p>Jared was unfolding a map of the old city, sprawling it across his lap. He used his finger to trace different routes to the Sepulchre, then sighed. \u201cI wish we\u2019d had enough time to send someone ahead. To shape the battle space.\u201d</p><p>I touched his free hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means, but We\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cI apologize for the military jargon. I\u2019m just in that mode at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d I said. The stress he suffered was nearly visible. The pressure was crushing him.</p><p>His eyes slowly fel on where my fingers touched his skin, and then closed. He took a deep, faltering breath, and exhaled. \u201cI am terrified of losing you. The routes, the possibility of last minute change of plan, everything that could possibly go wrong has ran through my mind so many times, I doubt I\u2019ll ever forget. I love you so much, Nina. I love our child. The fear of failing you weighs so heavy on my mind, I feel like I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d</p><p>I turned in my seat to face him. My eyes bore into his, fil ing with tears fueled by every emotion. \u201cIf I\u2019ve ever believed in you, Jared, it\u2019s now.</p><p>Whatever happens, whatever crosses our path, I know you\u2019l make the right choice.\u201d I pul ed his hand to my round bel y. \u201cWe both believe in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire has spent quite a bit of time there.\u201d He turned and gestured at her to join them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re setting down in Ben-Gurion airport,\u201d he said, pointing to the map.</p><p>Claire nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s about forty-one kilometers from the center of Jerusalem. We head west here, toward Nesher, and then take this right, here, to Route Forty-five-oh-three.\u201d</p><p>With his finger, Jared fol owed the road, and shook his head. \u201cBut this is a main road. Shouldn\u2019t we try some back roads?\u201d</p><p>Claire shrugged. \u201cI say get there, Jared. We\u2019re going to get the shit kicked out of us on any road we take.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me feel better.\u201d</p><p>Claire raised her brows. \u201cNina, you should prepare yourself. Think of every war movie you\u2019ve ever seen on TV. Loud noises, yel ing, guns, and things blowing up around us. We\u2019re going to be shot at, chased, and running for our lives the second we touch the tarmac. You\u2019re going to have to listen, stay focused, and fol ow orders, or we\u2019re not going to make it. Get it?\u201d</p><p>My head bobbled, trying to process the war zone she described.</p><p>Her eyes left mine to return to the map. \u201cThat tunnel could be a problem. We could detour here,\u201d she pointed, \u201cand skip across to rejoin the main road here, skipping the tol .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we can just get into the Old City, We\u2019ll be home free. The Sepulchre is just there,\u201d Jared said. He pushed his lips back and forth with his fingers, a mil ion decisions flipping through his mind.</p><p>They pored over the map, discussing different roads, buildings, and blind spots. Even though they were kind enough to speak in English this time, as much as half of their discussion was lost on me with phrases like Black Swan, Belay, and Schwerpunkt.</p><p>Claire shook her head. \u201cI brought the new rifle. Ryan and I could stay behind. I could cover you.\u201d</p><p>Jared thought for a moment, but shook his head. \u201cToo risky. What if you get trapped?\u201d</p><p>Claire frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s insulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just you, Claire. You have two of you to watch out for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, but he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s shoulders dropped in resignation.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not leaving anyone behind. We stay together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopy that.\u201d</p><p>They spent another hour coming up with Plan Bs, and Cs, and Zs. If something went wrong at this corner, we would take that all ey; duck into that building; cut across that roof. Areas of concentrated population were to be avoided at all costs, but the Sepulchre was in the center of the Old City, and a popular pilgrimage. Our fight wouldn\u2019t end until we were safe inside the tomb.</p><p>I shivered. How anyone could feel safe in a tomb was beyond me, but it was the one place Hel wouldn\u2019t go. The book was proof. I turned to see Kim staring at the book in her hands.</p><p>She sensed me looking at her, and her eyes jumped up. I was immediately embarrassed, but she showed a glimpse of my friend, letting the corners of her mouth turn up. The action seemed unnatural for her, and it only lasted a moment before she was blank-faced and once again staring at the book.</p><p>Claire stood and crossed her arms. \u201cSix hours \u2018til arrival. I\u2019m going to ready the weapons.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get halfway down the aisle before the plane trembled, and then shook. Jared looked at me, and then behind him. Claire held onto the tops of two seats on each side of her.</p><p>\u201cProbably just some choppy air,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>In that moment the plane bounced violently, sending objects from the overhead bins the floor. The lights flickered, and I held my bel y with one hand, and gripped Jared\u2019s arm with the other. Claire\u2019s outline flashed by as she made her way to the cockpit.</p><p>\u201cIs it turbulence?\u201d I shouted. The engines whined in a way I\u2019d never hear before, and I could feel the plane descending rapidly. The plane took another dive, and then leveled out slightly. \u201cJared?\u201d I cried.</p><p>\u201cClaire wil handle it,\u201d he said, covering my hand with his.</p><p>The cabin went dark, and red emergency lights cast frightening shadows. After another dip, the emergency oxygen masks fel from above.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean we\u2019ve lost pressure?\u201d I said in a panic.</p><p>Jared leaned over to look out the window, and I did the same. Blackness covered the ground below. No glowing fireflies, no tiny lines of traffic.</p><p>We were over ocean, with no hope of making an emergency landing.</p><p>The plane leaned to the left, pushing me against the window. It was then that I saw it: Moonlight flickering against the waves below. We were just a few thousand feet from crashing into the water.</p><p>\u201cNina!\u201d Jared said, unbuckling my seat belt. \u201cCome with me. I\u2019m going to open the emergency exit door, and when I tel you, we\u2019re going to jump.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said. \u201cJump from the plane? Are you crazy?\u201d I could see real fear in his eyes, and for the first time, I knew Jared had made a decision out of desperation.</p><p>Claire burst out of the cockpit and looked Jared, shaking her head.</p><p>Jared gripped my hand and pul ed me to my feet. Before I could speak, we were at the emergency exit. Jared grabbed the lever with both hands, but I stopped him.</p><p>\u201cWe need to do this now!\u201d he yel ed.</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can!\u201d</p><p>I looked around me to the frightened faces of Bex, Kim, and Ryan, and then Claire.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you just sitting there?\u201d she cried, \u201cHelp us, dammit!\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s arms tensed against my strength, but I refused to let him pul the handle.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, trying to block out the noise. \u201cHelp us,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWe need your help.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Departure</p><p>The plane trembled like an earthquake. The engines whined, and the emergency oxygen masks leaned forward as the plane plummeted toward black water.</p><p>Claire shrieked. I was afraid to opened my eyes, hesitant to see what unimaginable horror had caused her to scream. I popped one eye open, and then the other. Even in the dim red light, I could easily make out Claire\u2019s tiny arms wrapped around a large, dark figure. The lights returned to normal, and the shaking immediately stopped. The plane leveled out as the high-pitched cry of the engines quieted to a smooth, low hum.</p><p>Jared stopped trying to open the door, and he stood, moving slightly when every muscle in his body relaxed at once.</p> <p>Bex hopped to his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s about freakin\u2019 time!\u201d he said, slapping the top of the seat in front of him. After col ecting himself, he turned to Kim.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s expression remained blank. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She winked at me, and an uncontrol able grin stretched across my face. I was beginning to see traces of my friend again.</p><p>Samuel stood at the front of the aisle, a large, white smile a contrast against his black face. \u201cI apologize. The best way to describe it is that I had to wade through some red tape.\u201d</p><p>Claire released Samuel and playful y punched his arm.</p><p>Jared raced up the aisle and then paused. Samuel opened his arms wide, and Jared fel into his chest, hugging him as wel . Samuel laughed, his voice bel owing, fil ing every space in the cabin. I didn\u2019t realize that I was stil tense until Ryan spoke into my ear, causing me to jump.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t on the plane before, was he?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head, smiling. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>A loud popping noise echoed when Samuel patted Jared on his back. \u201cI can only go as far as the outskirts of Jerusalem, but I\u2019m going to join you, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed once. \u201cNot at all .\u201d I joined him at the front of the aisle, wrapping my arms tightly around him. I sighed. \u201cI admit it. I was scared to death.\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cI was ready to jump from a crashing airplane with my pregnant wife. I think I win this one.\u201d</p><p>I agreed without pause. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Samuel walked back and forth along the aisle for a while. We all watched him quietly, but the fear and apprehension was gone. When Samuel would pass our seats, Jared would squeeze my hand. I kept trying to use my new and crude sensitivities to recognize a dark presence, but I either wasn\u2019t doing it right, or Samuel had given them a severe enough warning.</p><p>Before long, Jared\u2019s breathing evened out, and then his fingers relaxed around mine.</p><p>I fel asleep soon after. A tiny baby boy in my arms, swaddled the softest blue cotton, smiling and content in the shade under our oak tree, saturated my dreams. He smiled, his bright blue-gray eyes glimmering in the summer sun. His pinky finger was no longer than my pinky nail, and I kept kissing his hands over and over, unable to feel his skin against my lips enough times.</p><p>Time passed quickly there. Before the end of the day, he was a toddler, and then grade-school age. He didn\u2019t appear older than he was, like Bex always had. He was perfectly human, and yet flawlessly beautiful like his father. By the time the shadow under the oak had faded, my son was a man, as tal and distinguished as Jared. I watched all of this in awe, but a little sad at the same time. It had gone by too fast. I wanted more time with him. I wanted to start over. A strange mixture of pride and sadness surged through me, and I remembered how just a few hours ago I was pregnant with him.</p><p>The shade now a shadow, my son walked over to me and held out his hand. He looked so much like his father. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he said with a smal smile. My smile.</p><p>\u201cTime for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe end.\u201d</p><p>My eyes popped open. Jared had left his seat, and I could hear him conversing with Bex and Kim somewhere in the back of the plane. I rubbed my eyes, and turned to my right. Samuel sat across from me, his massive frame nearly too large for the seat.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep wel ?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI did, actual y.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI know. I was just being polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d I maneuvered my body out of my seat, stretching.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes met mine, and he stood, moving to the side.</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Bex teased.</p><p>\u201cYes, Bex. I\u2019m pregnant. When you have a ful -grown infant doing a handstand on your bladder, I\u2019ll keep track of how many bathroom breaks you take, mmk?\u201d I waddled down the aisle, passing Ryan and Claire, who didn\u2019t seem to notice my presence. I noticed that Ryan\u2019s pinky was overlapping Claire\u2019s however, and she wasn\u2019t beating him to a bloody pulp for it. I smiled, and made my way to the lavatory.</p><p>I opened the door and frowned. I felt like Winnie the Pooh trying to squeeze into the honey tree. I looked down the aisle, meeting the inquisitive eyes of my husband. \u201cI always feel I\u2019m going to get stuck in there.\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed. \u201cIf you do, I\u2019ll get you out.\u201d</p><p>Bex held up a white bottle. \u201cI have lotion. That should help.\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes and made my first attempt to navigate the smal space.</p><p>Without event\u2014or lotion\u2014I returned to my seat, but not without the irritating snickering of Kim and Bex.</p><p>\u201cShut it,\u201d I grumbled, glaringly aware that my penguin walk only made their laughter more boisterous.</p><p>. I turned my attention back to Jared. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve thought about the little things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathrooms? Sleeping arrangements? Privacy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAl luxuries that won\u2019t be readily accessible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d I said, my eyebrows shooting up two inches. \u201cI\u2019m heavily pregnant, and there\u2019s no bathroom?\u201d</p><p>Jared shifted nervously. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I sighed with relief, and looked to the ceiling. \u201cOh, thank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...not like the facilities you\u2019re used to.\u201d</p><p>I peered over at him.</p><p>He shifted again. \u201cIt\u2019s more like a...a...hole. In the ground. But there is running water below so it\u2019s not as bad as it sounds.\u201d</p><p>My face screwed into disgust. \u201cYou expect me to balance this,\u201d I said, pointing to my bel y, \u201cover a hole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have Claire and Kim to help.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms and faced the wal . \u201cNot funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>I relaxed, and covered my face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I sound like a brat. It\u2019s just...\u201d Tears burned my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not the way you imagine your pregnancy, you know. Not that I ever real y imagined it, but living the last few weeks of my pregnancy in a moist, dark hole, with medieval accommodations and the birth,\u201d I said with a faltering breath. \u201cI\u2019m scared to death. It\u2019s going to be painful, and I trust you, but...not being in a hospital, or even have a midwife there. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to do it.\u201d</p><p>Jared wrapped his arms around me tight. \u201cIt is. But, Claire and I have researched it to death, talked to every medical professional we know, and brought every supply We\u2019ll need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stil scared,\u201d I said. A tear fel down my cheek.</p><p>Jared rested his cheek on my hair, and his fingers pressed into my skin. \u201cI\u2019m going to love you through it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and pressed my face into his chest.</p><p>Claire tapped Jared on the shoulder. \u201cWe need to ready the weapons and check the supplies.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded and released me. Everyone looked to him, and he gestured to everyone. \u201cWe have a lot of gear to hike through the city. The most important packages are weapons, med supplies, and rations. These wil be carried by myself, Claire and Bex. Ryan, you\u2019l be extra eyes on the book, but stay close to Claire.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded.</p><p>Jared continued, \u201cKim, stay close to Bex. If any one gets separated, hold your position and We\u2019ll double back. Under no circumstances is anyone to go off alone. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re in a panic, or you see a better way to go. Fracturing the group puts us all at risk, so we stay together. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Everyone agreed.</p><p>The pilot announced the beginning of our descent. Claire and Bex had already brought the supplies and weapons packs to the front, and we were prepared to scramble to the waiting vehicle.</p><p>Jared was clearly anxious, but Samuel didn\u2019t seem fazed.</p><p>I nudged my husband. \u201cSamuel said he would ride with us to the old city. Does that mean things wil be calm until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We should be prepared for anything.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and wiped my sweaty hands on my pants.</p><p>Claire and Ryan both had AK-47s slung around their shoulders, pistols in the pockets of their cargo pants, and communication devices in their ears. Claire passed two more to Bex and Jared, and they spoke quietly to each other, testing the clarity and to see if they worked correctly.</p><p>The more they rushed around to prepare to land, the more nervous I became.</p><p>Claire handed me a vest, and Jared encouraged me to put it on. I watched Claire hand the same vest to Kim, Bex, and Ryan, and I realized they were bul etproof. Mine was surprisingly light.</p><p>Jared bent down to ensure my laces were tied and secure.</p><p>\u201cReal y?\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not a toddler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just covering all the bases, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Kim and Samuel sat back, barely noticing the activity around them.</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d Claire barked. \u201cHand me the fifty-cal. The launcher is in pack two.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded, and rifled through one of the larger duffels. He handed her what looked like a heavy backpack.</p><p>As the wheels touched the runway, Claire and Ryan put on their own dark sunglasses and stood by the door, assault rifles in hand. I unfastened my seat belt, and Jared took my hand. Kim and Nina in the middle, Bex bring up the rear. Claire and Ryan on point.</p><p>At the door, Samuel closed his eyes and whispered something both beautiful and menacing, and then opened the door. He walked out, and stood, his arms crossed, on one side of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite safe, I assure you,\u201d he said, his deep voice echoing. The tarmac was empty except for our waiting Humvee. It was borrowed, light tan, and gauging by the bul et holes, had already seen action in its lifetime.</p><p>Claire took off her sunglasses and looked up at Samuel in awe. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like this until we get to the old city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf not, I\u2019ll take care of it, but it would be a waste for them to attack any earlier.\u201d</p><p>Claire elbowed him in the stomach, but he didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cYou let me get all dressed up for nothing.\u201d</p><p>Samuel smiled. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be happy. The Humvee matches your clothes.\u201d</p><p>Claire looked down at her olive green tank top and light tan cargo pants, and then feigned irritation. \u201cNot good enough.\u201d</p><p>Samuel\u2019s hand swal owed Claire\u2019s smal shoulder. \u201cOnce you reach Jerusalem, I promise you\u2019l use your fancy vest more than you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Claire and Jared traded glances.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a party,\u201d Ryan said with a grin.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Sepulchre</p><p>Loading the Humvee only took a few minutes, and then we were barreling down the highway, weaving in and out of traffic. Bex drove, Claire sat in the passenger seat, and the rest of us piled in the back. Jared barked directions at Bex, securing packs and loading weapons at the same time.</p><p>Knowing he was in protector mode until we were all safely tucked under the Sepulchre made me miss him, but I had to let him focus. The more miles Bex put behind us, the more my fear threatened to take over.</p><p>Kim scooted closer to me and grabbed my hand.</p><p>I looked over at her sheepishly. \u201cAre you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to piss my pants.\u201d</p><p>I nodded quickly, glad that I wasn\u2019t the only one not looking forward to a battle.</p><p>Ryan was humming along to a song inside his head, tapping his fingers to the beat against his assault rifle.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding\u201d I said.</p><p>He looked up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the party.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWhat can I say? I miss it.\u201d</p><p>Kim laughed once, incredulous. I couldn\u2019t even manage a reaction.</p><p>\u201cOh c\u2019mon,\u201d he said. He gestured to us, \u201cYou two get to see me in action for the first time. Who can say they\u2019re friend has gone off to war and then they get to watch them work? No civilians, I guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to get bad,\u201d I said.</p><p>He shook his head and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m counting on it.\u201d</p><p>As usual, Ryan\u2019s casual demeanor made my anger boil just below the surface. \u201cWhat if something happens to you? Do you know what that means for Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t my first rodeo, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Kim leaned forward. \u201cIt\u2019s not your moment to impress her, either. This is serious. Quit screwing around and focus before you get us all kill ed.\u201d</p><p>While Ryan and Kim bickered, I leaned up to look out the window. The scenery didn\u2019t look so different. Retail stores, traffic, and pedestrians. The only thing that seemed foreign was the sun and palm trees. We could have been in California. I settled back against my seat. For reasons I couldn\u2019t explain, the familiar surroundings made me feel better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Humvee took a sharp turn, shoving me against Kim.</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d Jared cal ed.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re shel ing, but they\u2019re keeping their distance. I\u2019m just trying not to get boxed in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience,\u201d Samuel said.</p> <p>Jared nodded, and then fastened an extra ammo belt around him. I crawled to the closest mirror, and watch as civilian cars and pickup trucks crowded the sides and behind our Humvee.</p><p>Bex swerved to the right, nudging one of the cars off the road. Claire readied her weapon.</p><p>\u201cJust wait,\u201d Samuel said. His voice was even, creating a strange calming effect.</p><p>I watched him for a moment. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you stay with us until the Sepulchre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that you may rise above your struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because that was the agreement. I wil keep you safe throughout the flight and trip to Jerusalem. Then you must rise above your struggle. Only then wil you appreciate your plight.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt is the way of the humans. It has always been the way.\u201d</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t exactly sure where he was getting at, but I didn\u2019t want to question him more. He wasn\u2019t as practiced as Eli at human relations, and I had a feeling that no matter how in depth he explained it, I would only be more confused.</p><p>Kim leaned into my ear. \u201cHe means he can\u2019t just give us a Get Out Of Jail Free card, because it behooves our character to struggle before success. God is all about being fair and not interfering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Hel is the opposite,\u201d I groused.</p><p>Another swerve threw me into Kim. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d I said, righting myself.</p><p>One side of her mouth turned up. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlan B,\u201d Bex said. \u201cI\u2019m taking the next exit!\u201d</p> <p>Samuel held up his hand. \u201cStay the course. Think of them as an escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the good kind.\u201d</p><p>As we approached the city, the cars and trucks around us became more uniform, and it was evident that everyone around us had shel ed. I peeked out of the window to see the sedan running alongside us. It contained a woman in her mid- to late twenties. An empty car seat was in the back.</p><p>I closed my eyes. When Samuel left us, they would attack, and we would have to kill them.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he said, albeit distracted.</p><p>\u201cThat woman over there,\u201d I said, nodding in her direction. \u201cShe has a baby.\u201d</p><p>Jared barely glanced at her. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>The woman looked at me, her eyes bulging and black.</p><p>Jared drew my attention away from her, gently turning my jaw to face him. \u201cShe can\u2019t kill you, either. We\u2019re going to make plenty of tough decisions between now and then. Let\u2019s not dwel on the shel s. We can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but Ryan glanced at the woman in the car, and was visibly unsettled.</p><p>Jared grabbed the barrel of Ryan\u2019s weapon and jerked it. \u201cEveryone can shel . Everyone is a threat. The demons are counting on you to see the human and hesitate. Hesitation wil get you kill ed. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive minutes!\u201d Claire cal ed.</p><p>Everyone tensed. Bex flew through traffic, trying to leave the shel s building up around us behind, but every time he gained ground, the drivers of the cars ahead shel ed. The stores and houses seemed to be almost on top of each other, covering the gentle hil s. Many of the buildings\u2014 especial y the older ones\u2014were made of rectangular rocks and castle-like in shape. Trees peppered the landscape, unlike the vast desert I had expected.</p><p>The sun was blindingly bright, glaring off the road and buildings. Kim squeezed my hand when we passed two statues of knights on horses, flying flags and proclaiming victory over the land. It was dizzying to think of how many how many empires had tried to own this land, and how much blood had been shed for a claim to it. We were going to be the numberless battle in that holy city. Not to own it, but survive it.</p><p>Jared looked at me. \u201cStay close. Never leave my side, for any reason. Keep your eyes and ears open.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He managed a smal smile and shook his head. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said, pulling me to him. He planted a quick kiss on my lips, and then the Humvee stopped.</p><p>\u201cDamascus Gate less than one klick!\u201d Claire yel ed.</p><p>Jared looked to Samuel for explanation, but he was gone.</p><p>Bex turned, his face intense. \u201cShel s coming over the hil !\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! We\u2019re on our own!\u201d Jared yel ed. He took the safety off his pistol, and grabbed a fistful of my vest.</p><p>Claire and Ryan left the Humvee first, and Jared and I fol owed. The bul ets were already flying, landing in the sand at my feet. We hunkered down in a smal all ey just inside a stone corridor until Kim and Bex joined us, and then Jared silently ordered us to move.</p><p>Claire pointed further inside the corridor. \u201cDamascus Gate. Markets and pedestrians. No good.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded once, and then we moved out. Claire took to the street with cover fire, running at ful speed to the next all ey. People walking in the street would run, and then suddenly stop to fol ow. Jared pul ed me across the street, and a large man with military fatigues ran at us. Claire put a bul et in his head in less than a second. Jared didn\u2019t bother to slow down. We jumped over the corpse and caught up.</p><p>Duck and cover seemed to be the plan of action for the next two streets. The Old City was a series of narrow rock roads and corridors lined with trinkets and rugs for sale. We reached the end of one road to find ourselves at the beginning of a marketplace. Claire froze, and we stopped abruptly behind her. A hundred or so people stopped, slowly turning around. They eyes of men, women, and children were black as night and bulging from their sockets.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d Claire said, waving us back.</p><p>Jared turned on his heels, leading us to the next building and up a set of stairs. We climbed to the roof, with the mob just behind Bex and Kim.</p><p>Jared took a few wide strides and then we leapt from that roof to the next. He wanted to continue, but I refused, waiting for Kim. Once they breeched the top of the stairs, I saw hands clamoring over bodies, the shel s trampling each other to get at us. Bex was focused, but Kim\u2019s eyes bulged.</p><p>\u201cJust hang on to him!\u201d Claire cal ed.</p><p>Bex, stil running, hugged Kim to him, and when his feet left the roof, he cradled her to his side like a footbal . His landing was smooth, but Kim had to take a moment we didn\u2019t have to get her bearings. The mob stil came at us, most of them fal ing to the all ey below when they tried to make the jump.</p><p>My hands flew to my mouth. Children were among those fal ing to their deaths.</p><p>We made the jump four times, and then descended a set of stairs that lead us to another series of corridors.</p><p>Jared hunkered down, letting Kim catch her breath. \u201cWe\u2019re in the Christian Quarter. The Sepulchre is two klicks away. We\u2019re going to take the west bypass, and make a path. It\u2019s a high traffic area for tourists, with high rock wal s on each side, so we\u2019re going to have to mow a path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopy that,\u201d Ryan said, cocking his rifle.</p><p>Jared began to speak again, but a smal group of young men shot at us from above. We ran again, dodging shel s and bul ets. Bex fol owed up the rear, turning and shooting as he ran. Ryan and Claire were at the front, their rifles against their faces, pointing the barrels in every direction they looked. As many times as I had tried to imagine it, we real y were in the middle of a war. The sounds of the AK-47s trading shots and the bul ets ricocheting off the wal s and roads just made me run faster.</p><p>Already exhausted, Kim had trouble keeping up, and Bex kept encouraging her to keep moving. We took cover behind dumpsters and parked cars every few seconds, and the noises around us paused ever so often when we hunkered down, and began sounding like a familiar beat.</p><p>Claire and Ryan would reload at nearly the same time, and then we\u2019d start again. Jared would drop a clip and reload as we ran, and Bex did the same. At one point, he pul ed a second pistol, turning to lay down more cover fire until Jared yel ed for him to keep up. He was next to Kim in less than a second.</p><p>Shel s that were unarmed simply tried to grab us, but the demons were stil human on the outside, and Ryan quickly learned how to incapacitate them. He would use his elbow or the butt of his gun, and shooting the ones he didn\u2019t have time for. I noticed most of his bul ets landing in their kneecaps or shoulders, hoping to give them a chance once the demons let them go.</p><p>In the court of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a large crowd obstructed the two giant wooden doors that led inside. They stood like statues, their arms calmly at their sides, their black eyes and ashen skin confirming control by the demonic. Some of them were civilian, but most were in fatigues, holding AK-47s. The building itself was massive, much larger than I had imagined, made of stone. I suddenly felt much better about being holed up in there for the next sixty days or so, but the high rock wal s made it impossible to do anything but initiate a head-on invasion.</p><p>\u201cShould we wait until dark?\u201d Bex asked.</p><p>I grabbed his bloodied shoulder, pressing my palm against it. \u201cYou\u2019re hit.\u201d</p><p>He winked. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad. So...should we wait?\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cWe just need to get in there.\u201d</p><p>Kim sighed. \u201cBut how? There are hundreds of people out there.\u201d</p><p>Claire pul ed a pin from a grenade. \u201cLike this.\u201d She rol ed it into the crowd, and in seconds a large explosion blew people and body parts in different directions. A huge brown cloud of smoke fil ed the area and Claire and Ryan ran ful speed into it.</p><p>Jared grabbed my sleeve and we fol owed. We didn\u2019t get five steps before a hail of bul ets rained down on us. Jared was hit several times and faltered. A bul et ripped through my arm. At first it didn\u2019t hurt, but the closer we got to the Sepulchre, the more the burning surged through my veins.</p><p>The memory of the pain in my leg at the Japanese restaurant in Providence immediately came to the forefront of my mind. Jared flipped around, and emptied his pistol into the dissipating cloud. He pushed me forward, and Claire and Ryan took me into the church.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hit!\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>They had already cleared the main room. Ryan tied a piece of cloth around my arm while Claire took out the shel s in the rest of the church and secured the entrances. Jared, Bex, and Kim came into the doors as one unit, with Kim sliding in on her knees. Bex slammed the door closed behind them, and immediately covered the window.</p><p>After a few minutes and sporadic gunfire, Claire returned. \u201cWe only have a few minutes before they reorganize. The barricades won\u2019t hold for long. We need to get underground.\u201d</p><p>I winced as Jared tightened Ryan\u2019s tourniquet. \u201cI thought they couldn\u2019t come in here.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned at the dark red saturating the cloth on my arm. \u201cIt\u2019s the tomb they can\u2019t violate. The church and basilisk itself are fair game.\u201d</p><p>Bex glanced back from the window. \u201cWhatever we\u2019re doing, let\u2019s do it fast.\u201d</p><p>The cloud from the grenade had cleared, revealing dozens of mutilated corpses on the ground. More shel s were crowding the Sepulchre, and were now climbing its wal s and beating on the doors.</p><p>Jared lifted Kim off the floor. \u201cYou have the book?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to do what you came here to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and it\u2019s about damn time, Ryel,\u201d she said, tightening her grip on the pack.</p><p>We retreated into the church, passing extravagant garnishing of gold, marble and artwork. Candles lined altars, and pictures of the crucifixion of Christ. We passed a set of stairs that made Claire pause before advancing into the Sepulchre of Jesus.</p><p>\u201cWhere do they lead?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jared glanced at the stairs only briefly. \u201cThat would be the stairway to Calvary. Christ climbed those steps on his way to be crucified.\u201d</p><p>We continued through a large room to another room that held a smal er room within it. You could walk around this room, but Claire advanced inside.</p><p>\u201cIs this it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jared squeezed my hand. \u201cThe Holy Sepulchre.\u201d</p><p>We filed in, and everyone dropped their packs. I was confused. The adornments around the room signaled a holy place, but all this time, my mind pictured an underground cavern.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be it. How can we protect ourselves in here?\u201d</p><p>Claire sighed. \u201cNot in here.\u201d She pushed the altar to the side, revealing an ancient steep staircase. \u201cThe true tomb is hidden below. It\u2019s hidden from the public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having my baby in a hole,\u201d I said, more of a statement than a question.</p><p>Bex laughed once. \u201cUh...is there room in the inn?\u201d</p><p>My stomach lurched, and I grabbed Jared\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d he said, immediately worried.</p><p>I grabbed my bel y with both hands and groaned. \u201cGive me a minute,\u201d I said, panting.</p><p>Claire took a few steps down. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get her downstairs,\u201d Bex said, checking outside the room. \u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>Claire clicked a flashlight onto her rifle and ducked down the staircase. Ryan fol owed, and then Jared, me and Kim went down next, with Bex closing the opening behind us. The stairway opened up into a stone hal way that led to a massive cavern. Damp, dark, and drippy. Just as I had imagined.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d Jared asked, touching my protruding stomach.</p><p>I nodded, stil looking around the room. The flashlights il uminated giant stone arches lining the vast space, accessing lateral hal s.</p><p>\u201cWhere do they lead?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cTunnels. Two hundred yards either way isn\u2019t protected. They won\u2019t come down here, but don\u2019t wander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Kim pul ed the Naissance de Demoniac from her satchel, and pointed her flashlight around the room, settling on what looked like a formerly adorned altar. She walked over to it slowly. Even in the dim light, I could see her body shaking uncontrol ably. Ryan and I walked behind, watching her hold the book in front of her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI did it,\u201d she said, staring at the book in awe. \u201cWe\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>Ryan put his hand on Kim\u2019s shoulder as she placed the book on the altar. She fel to her knees, and we fel with her. In the next moment, the ground began to shake, and smal bits of rock fel to the floor. A piercing roar echoed through the tomb, causing us all to cover our ears. It was one voice, but also many, wailing, yel ing, cursing utter foulness...and then it was over. Silence.</p><p>Kim looked back at Jared, and he offered a knowing smile. She had completed her mission, and freed her family of the duty of protecting the Naissance de Demoniac from a constant, powerful enemy.</p><p>\u201cI guess I can go home now?\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Bex said. \u201cBut you\u2019re on your own, and this place is crawling with shel s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could use you here,\u201d Jared said, \u201cto help with the birth.\u201d</p><p>Kim smiled at him. It was a relief to final y see the two come to terms. The air was immediately lighter between them.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if you stil have your superpower?\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>Kim punched him in the gut, and he doubled over. \u201cIt would appear so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I meant,\u201d he coughed.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Trapped</p><p>It\u2019s hard to keep one\u2019s days and nights straight when underground. If it weren\u2019t for the family ful of Hybrids, I would have been alone while keeping my strange hours. Whether it was the baby, or the less-than-comfortable blow up mattress we slept on, or the constant dripping in the background, it was impossible to sleep. Regardless, I took naps at one to three hours at a time, around the clock.</p><p>Ryan and Kim didn\u2019t seem to have the same problem. Even though his mattress was noticeably close to Claire\u2019s, she made a point of keeping her distance now that we were all safe. As the days wore on, Ryan grew less happy about her cold demeanor, and the grumbling turned into ful - blown arguments.</p><p>It was difficult\u2014after we\u2019d spent so much time dodging and preparing\u2014to sit and wait. As much time that went into planning our escape into this tomb, no one, it seemed, had planned for the suffocating time spent underground.</p> <p>Jared and I tried to make the best of it: talking to my bel y, spending quality time together, discussing the birth. I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about Jared delivering our baby, but of all the people trapped in the tomb with us, Jared was my top pick.</p><p>After thirty days of darkness, tasteless rations, and the same close company, life in the tomb began to wear on all of us. Even Bex\u2019s bright and cheery demeanor began to show signs of waning. Poker and gin rummy only entertained for so long, and radio reception was hopeless in the deep of Israeli rock. Stories in the evenings were something I looked forward to, and it gave me a chance to get to know everyone better.</p><p>\u201cSo, that was the first time I bested Dad, although I\u2019m pretty sure he let me win,\u201d Bex said with a broad smile.</p><p>\u201cI remember that,\u201d Claire said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t let you win. He wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it after you went to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal y?\u201d Bex said, his eyes bright.</p><p>\u201cReal y.\u201d</p><p>Bex\u2019s smile faded. \u201cHe died four days after that.\u201d</p><p>Everyone lowered their chins, unsure how to advance the conversation.</p> <p>Jared final y spoke. \u201cThat must\u2019ve been hard on you, Bex. I don\u2019t think I ever asked you if you were okay.\u201d</p><p>Bex shrugged. \u201cI was, I guess. What else could I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn pain,\u201d Claire said. \u201cWe were all so wrapped up in our own, we didn\u2019t even try to help you through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed him. And then...I missed you guys. I was glad when Jared brought Nina around. The family kind of came back together, then. Now we have Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have Ryan,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>Ryan shot her a dirty look, and then softened his features for Bex. \u201cYes you do, man. I\u2019m here if you need me.\u201d</p><p>Claire rol ed her eyes. \u201cWhat would he need you for? To help with a school bul y?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo talk to,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cYou know, what we used to do before you became so hateful and mean.\u201d</p><p>Claire crossed her arms over her knees. \u201cYou don\u2019t give me a choice,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s acerbic tone lit Claire\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t give me a choice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, guys,\u201d I said. It was far too claustrophobic, even in the large cavern, for anyone to fight.</p><p>Ryan stood. \u201cWhat kinda choice would you like? The one that includes you stalking me all day without us talking? Or the one where we get along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can get along without you trying to land the unattainable blonde!\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s mouth fel open. \u201cIs that what you think I\u2019m trying to do?\u201d</p><p>Claire stood, meeting his glare. \u201cJust...back off.\u201d</p><p>Ryan took a step forward. \u201cI love you. I l ove you, and you act like I\u2019m some random frat boy trying to get lucky.\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cI should have packed ear plugs. I have nowhere to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just....\u201d Claire trailed off.</p><p>I knew she must care about him. She had bit her tongue to keep from hurting his feelings, which Claire never did.</p><p>Ryan took another step. He was only a few inches from her face. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you. A mil ion times! It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, say you don\u2019t love me. Say you don\u2019t see me in that way and I\u2019m just a helpless human to you. Say you hate me! Say something! I\u2019m tired of your vague excuses!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need excuses!\u201d she yel ed. \u201cI don\u2019t want that!\u201d She pointed to us. \u201cI don\u2019t want a family like I had or they have! You want children! You want a normal life, Ryan. I\u2019m not it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you! Whatever that is, I want it!\u201d</p><p>Claire frowned. Her body shook with anger. She grabbed his col ar with both fists. Ryan leaned away slightly and winced, waiting for her to land a punch on his face. Claire\u2019s lips pursed together, and then she pul ed him to her, pressing her lips against his, hard.</p><p>\u201cAgh,\u201d Jared said, turning.</p><p>Ryan paused in shock, and then his body melted against hers. He wrapped his arms around her, pulling her closer, and she wrapped her fingers around the back of his neck. The kiss was so intense that it looked nearly painful.</p><p>Bex giggled, but they didn\u2019t hear him. After a minute or two, it was uncomfortable to watch, so we all meandered to the other side of the cavern.</p><p>Jared seemed to be in a foul mood, which bothered me. Why he was so against Claire and Ryan was a mystery to me. They were perfect for each other, and clearly loved each other.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if that wil happen for me,\u201d Bex said, glancing back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look. No tel ing what\u2019s going on back there,\u201d Jared said, picking up a rock and throwing it.</p><p>\u201cIt might,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to Jared. He knows I\u2019m the best thing that ever happened to him.\u201d</p><p>Jared grabbed my hand and squeezed. \u201cOf course you are. Why would you believe I\u2019ve thought otherwise?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re so against them.\u201d I gestured behind us. \u201cLike my mother was so against us. Because it makes things hard.\u201d</p><p>Jared pul ed me closer and wrapped his arms around my knees. \u201cI just don\u2019t like Ryan. It has nothing to do with you, or us.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you like him?\u201d</p><p>Jared shifted nervously. \u201cRyan is the closest I\u2019ve come to losing the love of my life. That\u2019s not something you get over.\u201d</p><p>I touched his face. \u201cI love you. Ryan loves Claire. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed once, and looked to Bex. \u201cI hope it happens for you. I real y do.\u201d</p><p>Bex rol ed his eyes and stood, walking to the back of the tomb where the altar held the book. Kim spent a lot of time in that area, even slept there.</p><p>Bex sat next to her, and their voices became a stream of quiet conversation.</p><p>I balanced on all fours trying to navigate my large body to a standing position. Just as I pushed myself from the rock floor, my stomach clenched, and I stumbled. Jared caught me, but I couldn\u2019t stand straight up.</p><p>\u201cContraction?\u201d he said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, breathing through the pain.</p><p>Bex and Claire were immediately at our side, with Kim and Ryan trailing behind.</p><p>\u201cThe baby?\u201d Bex said. \u201cShould I set up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared said. Let\u2019s let her rest. See if it eases up.\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded, and assisted Jared in helping me to our makeshift bed. My feet up and relaxed, I tried to think about something else other than whether that pain would return. Labor was going to be a nightmare if I had to look forward to hours of that. I had hoped that my new abilities would anesthetize the pain a bit, but if the previous encounter with contractions had been any indication, I was screwed.</p><p>The pain crept up again, like a wave swal owing me whole.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in through my nose and blew out from my mouth, but it didn\u2019t help the pain. A large fist had gripped my uterus and was digging in its fingers while I suffered the worst case of food poisoning ever recorded\u2014that was what I felt.</p><p>\u201cShould we set up?\u201d Bex said again.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared said firmly. \u201cWe\u2019re just timing them now.\u201d</p><p>We waited several minutes, and then I felt another contraction, but it wasn\u2019t nearly as painful. They became less frequent painful before stopping al together. Everyone in the room breathed a col ective sigh of relief when Jared deemed the event a false alarm. He wouldn\u2019t all ow me to sit up, though, or even leave the bed after that. He or Claire would walk me to the hole in the floor if I needed to relieve myself. It was half-humiliating, half- frightening. My body hadn\u2019t felt like my own for quite a while, but now there was no control over the situation.</p><p>We had no idea what went on in the world aboveground. I wondered what Beth and Chad were doing, if they worried about us, and about Cynthia and Lil ian. If they leaned on each other for support, waiting to hear their grandchild had been born and that all of their children were alive. Even though I knew I needed to stay positive in those last difficult days, lying bed with nothing to do but read the same magazines, or think, my mind effortlessly traveled to less trivial things.</p><p>Checkers and chess were no longer entertaining. Even watching the others play cards irritated me. We were nearing the end of July, and I was so large I could barely maneuver. I had to let my mind wander to get away from the darkness of the tomb, from the fact that we were living in a tomb at all , and the dripping. For the love of all things holy, the dripping. That sound alone nearly pushed me out of my mind.</p><p>I would close my eyes, and pretend I was at Brown on the Main Green, lying with Jared while the summer air weaved through the trees. I blocked out the echoing and murmuring inside the tomb, and replaced it with laughing and jovial sounds of flag footbal on warm days, and the wonderful smel s coming wafting from the Gate. Even my dorm room at Andrews was an escape. Mostly, I concentrated on our oak tree, and the loft. I stil mourned our first home, but in my mind, it was untouched. Recal ing every memory of every place I\u2019d spent with Jared was the only thing that kept me sane at that point. That, and watching Claire and Ryan fal in love. Their sweet conversations, and the way they reveled every moment with each other kept me away from the darkness.</p><p>As the first of August came and went, my memories became harder to enjoy. They just mocked me. Us. Our faces had all grew pale, begging to see the sun again. Not even the promise of safety was worth this. Quiet times with Jared were something I had always wanted, but not in this prison.</p><p>Not in this tomb, where I already felt dead.</p><p>A smal twinge in my stomach made me hold my breath. It went away, but soon another came, and then another. They were stronger, and the more I hoped they would go away, the quicker and more intense they came.</p><p>I tried to breathe, but the air was so stale. When I tried to concentrate on my breathing through the pain, all I could hear was the water dripping.</p><p>Always dripping. It was maddening. I was in labor, and going to give birth inside a drippy, cold hole in the ground.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Jared read a book a few feet from the mattress, noticeably waiting for me to tel him I was uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t want to say it. Speaking the words made it real. There would be movement towards the supplies, and the unpacking of all the medical paraphernalia I didn\u2019t want to see.</p><p>Before another contraction came, I pushed myself out of bed. \u201cI have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Jared put down his worn copy of The Catcher in the Rye, and turned to face me. When he saw I was standing, he stood, too. \u201cNina, you have to lay down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s enough, Jared. I can\u2019t stay here, anymore. We need to find somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nowhere else.\u201d</p><p>I bent my knees and awkwardly bent over to pick up a few of my things lying around the bed. \u201cWel , we can\u2019t stay here. I can\u2019t...I can\u2019t have my baby here.\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cNina, stop. You\u2019re being irrational.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I\u2019m irrational. But I\u2019m going to be irrational outside, where I can breathe.\u201d</p><p>Jared tried to touch my hand, but I pul ed away. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI can, and I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>Ryan crossed his arms. \u201cThen go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared seethed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s stronger than all of us. If she doesn\u2019t want to stay, we can\u2019t make her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d I said to Jared, pointing to Ryan. \u201cHe listens to me. You\u2019re not listening!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Jared said, holding his hands in front of him. \u201cYou know what\u2019s waiting up there for us. We\u2019ll be attacked the second we breach the stairs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust for a minute,\u201d I said, trying to nonchalantly slide by him. I grabbed my stomach and hunched over a bit, trying to casual y weather another contraction.</p><p>Ryan touched Jared\u2019s arm. \u201cJared, we got through an entire city of shel s. If she wants to breathe some fresh air after nearly sixty days in a cave, I say let her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a say, so shut up,\u201d Jared said through his teeth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either?\u201d I said. I hobbled toward the entrance slowly, but Jared matched every step.</p> <p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d he said. \u201cJust...just let me think for a minute.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes tight. They twitched every time the drops of water slid from the rock wal to the ground. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. I can\u2019t think in here. I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t sleep. I feel like I\u2019m dying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d Ryan began.</p><p>\u201cShut the hel up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we all need some fresh air,\u201d Bex said.</p> <p>With wide eyes, both Jared and Claire craned their necks at their little brother.</p><p>Jared\u2019s jaws worked under his skin, and he struggled to relax enough to speak to me in a calm voice. \u201cNina, for all we know the devil is up there.</p><p>They wil stop at nothing now.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shrugged. \u201cSometimes you gotta dance with the devil to get out of Hel .\u201d</p><p>The further we got to the entrance, the darker it became. Bex had set up twin-head industrial light stands around the perimeter, so bright that at first, when they were all lit, it felt like day. Now the shadows they cast were just another reminder of our prison.</p><p>I moved quickly to the doorway, and Claire grabbed my wrist. \u201cMaybe we should sedate her?\u201d</p> <p>I yanked my arm back, easily shouldering past her. \u201cYou\u2019re not keeping me here against my wil ! I know I sound crazy! I feel crazy! This place is making me crazy! I don\u2019t want to leave forever. I just...I just want a couple of minutes of sunshine. Just a moment to feel alive again.\u201d</p><p>Ryan appeared in front of me, holding up his hands. \u201cWhoa, buddy. You\u2019re getting yourself all worked up,\u201d he said. He spoke through nervous laughter, trying to lighten the mood. \u201cYou need to take a minute to think about this. No one is making you stay, but maybe if you think about this a little more, you\u2019l reconsider.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked to me with hope in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were on my side,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI am, Nigh. I\u2019ve always been on your side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s on my side. No one hears me.\u201d</p><p>Ryan relaxed a bit. \u201cJust try to clear your head and think about it. You\u2019re not a prisoner here. You\u2019re here to keep the baby safe until it\u2019s born.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve thought about it. I can\u2019t stand it anymore. Who wants to have their baby in a tomb? Not me. This was a bad idea. I just need to go. I have to go.\u201d</p> <p>I made my way to the entrance that led to the stairs, but Jared stood in my way, his fingers digging into my shoulders. \u201cI can\u2019t let you go, sweetheart. If you go upstairs, they\u2019l kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, we...you...you need to get me out of here, okay? I don\u2019t want to be here any more.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded, his voice low and calm. \u201cI understand. As soon as the baby comes, We\u2019ll leave. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, the tears cascading down my cheeks. I took a step back. \u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t want to have the baby here. I can\u2019t stay here another night. Not another second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a prize-winning freakout, right there,\u201d Kim said without emotion.</p><p>Jared grimaced. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping, Kim. Listen,\u201d he said, returning his attention to me.</p><p>My body shook. I was in control of nothing. Not my body, not where I slept. I couldn\u2019t even go to the bathroom alone or take a walk. It was too much. Too much.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make me stay here. I can leave when I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You can leave when you want, but...I want you to stay. The second you\u2019re aboveground, Nina, you\u2019l regret your choice. Just...trust me? Please? Just a little bit longer. Can you stay with me a little bit longer?\u201d</p><p>Tiny twin rivers dripped from my jaw onto my dirty shirt. I closed my eyes, but all I could hear was the dripping. The damn dripping. It wouldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered. I ran for the door, and Claire and Jared grabbed my arms. With my ful strength, I took one step after another, slowly but surely making my way to the doorway.</p><p>Claire grunted against my strength. \u201cNina, stop!\u201d</p><p>Bex joined his siblings, grabbing both of my ankles and wrapping his feet around them. I could have broken free, but I didn\u2019t want to hurt him. I didn\u2019t want to hurt any of them, I just needed to be aboveground, to breathe fresh air and feel the sun on my skin. To hear my voice\u2014just one time\u2014 without an echo behind it.</p><p>\u201cNina, look at me! Look at me!\u201d Jared said, positioning his face in front of mine. \u201cYou have to stop. You\u2019re going to get yourself kill ed, and the baby wil die. Do you hear me? We\u2019ll all die! \u201d</p><p>I stopped struggling, and my body went limp as I sobbed on the ground against my husband. My focus on survival, irrational or not, had become a monster.</p><p>Claire and Bex took a step back with labored breath. I\u2019d given all three of them a run for their money.</p><p>Jared stood and pul ed me with him. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, watching him walk into the tomb. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Legion</p><p>I bolted for the top of the stairs, shoving the altar out of the way. I crawled out of the hole, squinting against the bright sun filtering in through the rotunda.</p><p>I took a deep breath, letting the warm, fresh air fil my lungs. I bathed in it, taking in every bit before Jared dragged me back underground. After a few seconds, the warm air went away, and the cold, dark feeling of the tomb surrounded me. Jared had barely let me take an entire breath before he\u2019d forced me to return.</p><p>I opened my eyes and realized I was stil in the Sepulchre. The room was ful of shel s, poised to pounce. I could hear Jared crawling up the stairs, yel ing my name, but immediately I was attacked. I fought off one, and then two and three at a time. By the time Jared reached the top, I had already taken out half the shel s in a fury of moves I didn\u2019t even have to think about. A smal woman threw herself at me, her arms flailing about. Jared incapacitated her with a single blow. Claire and Ryan reached the top, quickly fol owed by Bex, and the mob inside the Sepulchre quickly thinned.</p><p>More filed in, though, and we were running out of room.</p><p>\u201cBack up!\u201d Jared commanded. \u201cBack downstairs!\u201d</p><p>The wal s shook, and two large, dark forms squeezed their misshapen bodies into the entrance of the Sepulchre. They weren\u2019t shel s, but demons, large demons with gray skin and mouths ful of teeth under moist snouts.</p><p>The one on the right grabbed Jared while the other took my shirt in one hand, and slammed my back against the opposite wal .</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Kim yel ed from the mouth of the stairway. \u201cGet the hel out of here!\u201d Even though the monsters stood two heads tal er than her, she didn\u2019t seem nervous in the slightest. The demons wailed at her, shielding themselves with their shoulders, but they didn\u2019t retreat.</p><p>The demon that Jared fought barked at the black-eyed minions filing into the room, and before anyone could react, a half-dozen of the shel s dove at Kim, pushing her down the stairway. Her scream faded as she rol ed further underground.</p><p>Bex leapt in after her, and Claire and Ryan went to work on Jared\u2019s demon.</p><p>I tried to rip my shirt to escape the grip of the brute, but his hands were gigantic, and I couldn\u2019t break free. A shel in military fatigues slipped into the room, walked to me without hesitation, and held a pistol to my temple.</p><p>The demon holding me signaled his partner, capturing Jared, Claire and Ryan\u2019s attention as wel . In a move so fast I could barely fol ow, Jared pul ed his sidearm from his belt and held it on the shel . The entire room froze.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Move,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>I nodded. I was sure he was furious with me. His eyes glossed over, and his teeth clenched.</p><p>The shel spoke. \u201cWe\u2019re taking her out of this place. Do not fol ow, or We\u2019ll cut the child from her in the street.\u201d</p><p>Jared held his gun on the shel , his entire body shaking with rage. Final y he lowered his weapon a little. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said, immediately tensing his arms again.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019l just save me like you always do, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Just wait for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you,\u201d I said.</p><p>Hesitant, and clearly conflicted, Jared lowered his weapon. In the next moment, I was dragged backward with such force I felt I was flying. The rooms of the Sepulchre flew past, and then I was in the sunlight. The streets blurred as the demon raced me through the old city. A few minuts later, I was dragged into an old building.</p><p>The fiend tossed me, and I skidded to the middle of a room. At first glance, the room was a filthy mess, and then I realized the pile of sheets was a provisional bed. No medical supplies or baby blankets.</p><p>\u201cWhat wil you do to him?\u201d I asked, hesitant to make eye contact with the rotting pile of flesh standing at the door.</p><p>\u201cHe waits to devour him.\u201d</p><p>I groaned. Pain seared through my body, and I knew I would have to calm down if I were to slow down the contractions. The more time I gave Jared to reach us, the better chance we had. I climbed onto the tufts of sheets, and leaned back on the heels of my hands.</p><p>A shel , a large woman, was all owed entry. I braced myself to be attacked, but she grabbed a fistful of my sweat-drenched hair, lifted me to my feet, and then ripped off my clothes with her free hand. She pul ed an oversized nightgown over my head, pushing me to the floor. I raised my hands to defend myself, but she only grabbed my wrists and tied them with cloth restraints attached to wires. Those thick wires were fastened to the cement floor with bolts. Once she completed her task, the woman left me alone with the demon.</p><p>Dirty windows lined the wal to my left. The outlines of dozens of shel s cast shadows against the muddy glass. I wondered if I could take the giant standing guard at the door, but I knew that Jared and Claire had trouble with him, and I hadn\u2019t exactly trained how to ignore labor pains while on the offensive. I subtly tested the bolts. They seemed fairly secure, but I was sure I could break free when the time came. The one exit would pose a problem; I didn\u2019t know what else waited on the other side. I could probably break through the window, but once again, the contractions... I tensed, trying to breath through the pain. \u201cOh...my God!\u201d I grunted. Deep breaths turned into panting. Sweat dripped from my hairline into my eyes. Just when I thought I might break in half, the contraction subsided. I let my body relax against an old cushion propped against the wal .</p><p>\u201cCan I have some water?\u201d I asked.</p><p>The demon\u2019s beady eyes shifted toward me. He snarled, and then looked ahead.</p><p>The cramping grew more intense with the next few contractions, and then I felt a warm gush between my legs. When I looked down at the clear liquid that had drenched the sheets, I realized my water had broke. A short relief of pressure came, quickly fol owed by a spasm so intense that I nearly passed out.</p><p>I wailed, and moved back against the wal . Nothing I did escaped the agony. \u201cPlease,\u201d I whimpered between breaths, \u201chelp me.\u201d Another wave washed over me; my blood-curdling screams echoed throughout the building. The panting didn\u2019t help, nothing helped. My hands bal ed into fists, shaking and white-knuckled.</p><p>When the agony paused for a minute or two, I would let my body fal limp against the cushion. Already exhausted, I knew unless Jared saved us, my abilities would be worthless.</p><p>The intensity of the next contraction took me by surprise, and I sat up straight, my knees bent and widely spread, I straining against my restraints.</p><p>Unsure of what I was even saying, my mouth formed every obscenity I\u2019d ever heard in my life. When it was over, I col apsed against the cushion, bawling, whimpering for my husband. Pressure between my thighs provoked me to reach down. Something soft and wet, covered in hair was barely peeking out from inside me. The baby was beginning to crown. I looked to the demon. He didn\u2019t even seem to be on alert. Jared wasn\u2019t even close.</p><p>I closed my eyes, making a concentrated effort to relax all of my muscles. Even when the pain came again, I refused to give into it. I refused to push. When the agony became too much, I held my screams inside. Any tensing on my part could push out the baby, and that was something I refused to do until I saw my husband. The waved crashed into me, and I lowered my chin to my chest, bit my lip, and stared intently at the wal across the room. I would. Not. Push.</p><p>My body shook uncontrol ably. Just as the pain subsided, movement outside the windows caught my attention. The guard at the door made a noise and shifted. He was nervous. Jared was here.</p><p>The shadows of the shel s weaved back and forth. There was a large explosion, then a blotch of crimson sprayed against the mud on the glass, highlighted by a bal of fire. The glass broke, and my husband pushed through, his eyes wild but focused. He immediately attacked the guard at the door, fil ing the creature\u2019s head with an entire clip of bul ets. Once he fel to the ground, Kim ran into the glass opening. She made her way to the door, and closed it, holding her palms flat against the metal.</p><p>\u201cI got it!\u201d she said. She was covered in blood, and noticeably injured.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I cal ed to her.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNever been better. You just worry about delivering that ba\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before she could finish her sentence, a shel burst through the broken glass and pointed his gun at Kim. She turned, her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>Jared charged the shel , but was too late. The bul et burst through Kim\u2019s chest, blowing her back against the door.</p><p>\u201cKim!\u201d I cried, watching her limp body slide down the door to the ground. Her eyes were open, but she was dead before she hit the floor. \u201cKim!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNina!\u201d Jared yel ed, running to me. He slid on his knees and released me from the restraints, and then slipped his backpack from his shoulders, opening it and pulling out supplies.</p><p>Before I could speak, the overwhelming spasms engulfed me. I wailed, but I wouldn\u2019t push.</p><p>Jared checked between my legs, and his eyes grew wide. \u201cHe\u2019s crowning, sweetheart. Push.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but you have to push.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cYes, you can. You\u2019ve done so wel .\u201d</p><p>I peeked at Kim. \u201cThey\u2019re out there. Waiting for him.\u201d</p><p>Jared touched my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m here. I won\u2019t let anything happen to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey abandoned us,\u201d I cried.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Jared said, laying out sterile cloths.</p><p>\u201cHeaven! Where are they? Where is Samuel?\u201d The pain came again.</p><p>\u201cNina, push!\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019l kill him!\u201d</p><p>Jared grabbed my hand and squeezed. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he said, watching me as I panted. \u201cI won\u2019t let that happen. We wil protect him. Together.\u201d</p> <p>Tears wel ed up in my eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can, and you wil . Now, push!\u201d</p><p>I nodded and pushed myself up on the heels of my hands. When the contraction came, I pushed through it. My voice was low and gruff and I grunted, using all of my remaining strength.</p><p>Claire and Bex jumped through the glass opening, and paused, seeing Kim\u2019s body sitting stil against the door. They walked over to her. Claire gently shut her eyes, and then she rushed over to me. She got on her knees behind me, and hooked her elbows under my arms.</p><p>I stared at Kim, but Claire used her cheek to bar my line of sight. \u201cDon\u2019t look, honey.\u201d</p><p>I wailed, mourning for my friend. Claire hugged me tight. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she repeated, over and over.</p><p>Ryan leaned against the opposite wal , his rifle in hand, tears drawing clean lines down his dirty face.</p><p>\u201cCould you grab a cloth and wipe her forehead?\u201d Claire said. Ryan didn\u2019t hesitate, digging through the pack and then patting down my brow. He combed back my wet hair with his fingers and then kissed my cheek. \u201cDoing good, Nigh. Hang in there.\u201d</p> <p>I began to speak, but the urge to push came again, so I heaved. I pushed so hard that my body trembled. Yel ing seemed to help, so I did. I yel ed, and screamed, and cried out. I cried for Kim, and for the pain, and for fear of what would happen once Bean was vulnerable.</p><p>Jared held open my shaking knees. \u201cYou\u2019re almost there, Nina.\u201d</p><p>Just as he said the words, the baby seemed to spil out of me and into Jared\u2019s arms.</p><p>He laughed out loud, in shock, holding his blood-covered child in his arms.</p><p>Claire helped me to relax back against the cushion, and then she assisted Jared in cleaning off the infant and cutting the cord.</p><p>Bex pushed his back against the door. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some nasty ones on the way! They\u2019re boiling up straight from Hel !\u201d</p><p>Ryan gripped his rifle, and Claire stood. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThey\u2019ve sent an entire Legion.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Mother</p><p>There is a distinct difference between the ability to create life and the innate need to protect it, to cherish it. Appreciating that life is the one being you love most in the universe becomes duty, and as a direct result, one must neglect all else to preserve it.</p><p>The mother that throws herself in front of an oncoming car, the mother that eats a can of generic peaches when the last bit of food isn\u2019t enough to share, the mother that wears a ratty dress to work so that she can keep much-needed shoes on those tiny, precious feet...that is the distinction of a mother\u2019s love: self-sacrifice.</p><p>The moment I heard the cries of the tiny, gooey baby in Jared\u2019s arms, nothing else mattered. Not even me.</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cUh...yeah. She\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe?\u201d I said, stunned. I had prepared myself for almost everything that could happen when I delivered. A girl was not one of them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl?\u201d Claire squealed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl?\u201d Bex groaned.</p><p>Jared wrapped her in a clean blanket, and careful y lifted the tiny bundle to look into her eyes. He had no expression except for the smal est hint of a smile. His eyes focused on me, and then put her in my arms as if he were passing on the most fragile, priceless, precious treasure in existence.</p><p>I nestled her in the crook of my arm, and until that moment the times I thought I had sacrificed seemed trivial. Everything and everyone in my life was less important, less urgent. My life was simply an extension of the tiny, soft, innocent wonderment before me. I knew how mil ions of other women before me could behave so erratic, be so forgiving, and so courageous. My heart was no longer on the inside of my body. It was in my arms.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d Bex said. With one hand he held the door closed, with other, he gently slid Kim\u2019s lifeless body away from the door and against the wal .</p><p>A loud bang vibrated the wal , and Bex flew back, skidding across the floor. The door blew open, and creatures filed into the room, immediately attacking. A foul odor fil ed the room, and I held my baby close to me. Jared stayed close, violently fending off any demons that dared get close enough to his family.</p><p>Every window on the opposite wal from the door exploded. Jared covered us with his body to shield us from flying glass. When the dust cleared, Samuel stepped into the room, standing next to a familiar face in ful armor.</p><p>\u201cMichael,\u201d Jared breathed, stunned. It was Isaac\u2019s father; his entire army of warrior angels behind him.</p><p>The demons snarled and shrieked.</p><p>\u201cYou shal not touch this child,\u201d Michael said, drawing a long sword.</p><p>\u201cCome!\u201d Samuel chal enged, raising his arms. \u201cWe welcome Hel \u2019s most terrible wrath!\u201d</p><p>The demon that had taken me from the Sepulchre lifted his head and bleated, and then led a charge into the street.</p><p>Bex and Claire stood to the side, watching hundreds of demons surge past them, casting off wind like a freight train barreling through the room.</p><p>The clash outside between Heaven and Hel was audible, like nothing I\u2019d ever heard before, and then at once, it was silent, crossing planes.</p><p>Jared grabbed each side of my face with a broad smile. \u201cWe did it, Nina! Heaven wil protect her!\u201d</p><p>I sighed with relief and hugged my daughter to my chest. The quiet we shared was frozen in time. The end of the war around us was instantaneous. Bex, Ryan, Claire and Jared all looked in wonder at my little girl. She lay stil , peering around with her big, round, cloudy eyes, blinking at the bright light.</p><p>Jared kneeled before me, stil breathing hard, his face red and marked with shades of blood and dirt from his fight to reach us. Ryan and Claire crowded around us, their worried expressions softened by the sight of the child wrapped in my arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d Jared said. His voice cracked an infinitesimal amount as he spoke, but I couldn\u2019t look away to see his expression. The little girl in my arms was breathtaking.</p><p>Claire took a few silent steps until she was next to me. She rubbed her palm on her jeans and then reached out her smal hand, extending her index finger to touch the baby\u2019s pinky. \u201cShe\u2019s...here,\u201d she whispered, in awe.</p><p>\u201cYou did it,\u201d Ryan said with a half-smile.</p><p>Jared crawled to the opposite side of Claire, tenderly putting one arm behind my neck, the other touching his daughter\u2019s cheek with his thumb.</p><p>He kissed my hair and leaned in to whisper in my ear. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could love you more than I already did.\u201d</p><p>I looked into his eyes and smiled. \u201cYou did it, Jared. You saved us.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s blue-grey eyes glossed over, and he pul ed me closer, the three of us in a tender embrace.</p><p>After a few quiet moments, Jared\u2019s arms tensed, and he looked to the doorway. Claire flipped around, her hands bal ed into fists at her side. Bex stood in front of my makeshift bed, crouched in a defensive stance.</p><p>Ryan quickly cocked his gun and aimed at the door, ready for whatever the Hybrids were bracing for. \u201cWhat now?\u201d he said, his eyes focused at the same point as the others.</p><p>Claire shoved Ryan against the wal and then pointed at him. \u201cStay there,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cDon\u2019t. Move.\u201d</p><p>Ryan lowered his weapon, and waited.</p><p>The door opened slowly, and a man in a white suit walked, slow and lithe, through the threshold. His hair was shiny and black, his eyes deep-set and calm. He was beautiful and grotesque at the same time; a baby-faced supermodel with eons of hate and bitterness flowing through his veins.</p><p>Bex took a step, but Claire held out her hand and flattened it against his chest, restraining him. \u201cStand next to Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Bex protested.</p><p>\u201cDo it!\u201d she growled. I\u2019d never heard her take that tone with her little brother.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes darted to the youngest Ryel, his head unmoving. It was unnatural, frightening. Bex slowly walked to the wal , wary of the pair of eyes that studied his every move.</p><p>I pul ed my infant daughter closer to me, turning slightly so that my shoulder was in a position to protect her. I didn\u2019t notice the movement until I realized it had drawn the man\u2019s attention back to us.</p><p>\u201cDesecration,\u201d the man breathed. His was more of a hiss than a voice. \u201cEven more than your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not speak to her,\u201d Jared said, his tone low and terrifying.</p><p>Ryan looked to Claire. He was confused and worried, but he didn\u2019t move.</p><p>The man took another step.</p><p>Jared stood, and lifted his hand, pointing at the black-haired man. \u201cShe belongs to Him. You can\u2019t touch her. You may kill us all , but He\u2019s commanded that she live.\u201d</p><p>The man took in a deep breath through his nose, his eyes rol ing back into his head. His lids shuttered, and then popped open, focusing on the baby. When he spoke, his voice was many; distant and loud simultaneously. \u201cIf you\u2019ve noticed, I quite enjoy doing things He forbids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I shoot?\u201d Ryan whispered out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Claire said, her voice strained. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Ryan frowned, clearly unsettled. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Devil,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>The man\u2019s pupils bled into the whites of his eyes, the darkness inside them glistening from the light of the fire outside. He took another step.</p><p>A large vein bulged from his pasty forehead as his calculating eyes targeted my daughter.</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t wait for him to take another step. He charged, stopping abruptly when the Devil grabbed him by the throat. Claire immediately reacted, attacking him with astounding speed. Her smal body flew against the wal , and Ryan reacted.</p><p>She held up hand. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, standing.</p><p>Jared managed to pul free, and then he attacked him again with a series of punches. They traded blows, and suddenly Jared was struck to the ground. Claire rushed Satan again, but she was blown back, this time held by an unseen force high against the wal . She screamed in agony as dozens of deep, bloody gashes formed across her face, neck and body. Blood oozed from her wounds and down the front of her clothes, dripping from her shoes onto the floor beneath her.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Ryan yel ed, raising his weapon.</p><p>Bex reluctantly stopped him.</p><p>Ryan grabbed Bex\u2019s col ar. \u201cHelp her!\u201d</p><p>Jared crawled to all fours, and then attacked the King of Hel again. He groaned and grunted with each heavy blow Satan dealt him, and soon he was overpowered, and thrown to the floor. The man in white jerked his hand, commanding Jared\u2019s body against the wal under Claire. Her blood flowed from her wounds and dripped in a steady stream onto her brother\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Claire closed her eyes, her lids fluttering. \u201cHelp us,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? Help us,\u201d she begged.</p><p>The Devil took another step. He was just a few feet from my makeshift bed. I held my daughter\u2019s tiny head in the crook of my neck and touched my lips to her white, wispy hair. She smel ed like her father, but softer; more pure. I looked up at her assassin from under my brow, terrified and hopeless; cowering in his presence.</p><p>Jared took off once again, his form obscured by the speed. They crashed together, and with barely visible movements, they blurred from one space in the room to the other, stopping momentarily, and then moving again. Soon they were back where they started, and Jared was on the floor, his blood spil ing from his wounds.</p><p>Satan leaned in slowly, relishing my terror.</p><p>\u201cHelp her,\u201d Claire begged in a tiny whisper.</p><p>Ryan moved toward me with desperation on his face, but Bex grabbed his shoulder. \u201cLet me go!\u201d he said, struggling. Bex wrapped both of his arms around my friend, forbidding him to step in.</p><p>Bex and Ryan were going to watch us all die. If Bex could somehow escape with Ryan, Claire could be saved, but that would leave my child vulnerable. A mil ion thoughts ran through my head, hopes that even if I were kill ed, Jared would survive long enough to get our baby to safety.</p><p>In that moment, anger replaced my fear. I remembered Eli\u2019s words, and courage I never knew I owned swel ed inside of me. \u201cYou can\u2019t have her,\u201d</p><p>I seethed, lifting my chin in defiance. \u201cI am not afraid of you.\u201d My eyes fil ed with angry tears.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAnd what wil you do?\u201d he said, looking over to Kim\u2019s lifeless body. In one blurry moment she was in his arms. He cradled her, looking almost paternal as he brushed her cheek with his blackened fingers. He scanned her face with a somber expression, and then leaned down to smel her hair. \u201cShe had a heartbeat not an hour ago. Dreams. Aspirations. And now,\u201d he said, tossing her limp body across the room with one hand, \u201cnothing.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, unwil ing to let fear rob me of rational thinking. Before I was a mother, I might have run from the room, but I had carried her inside of me for the better part of year, and I had survived Hel before. Something inside of me whispered that my child was safe in my arms. I would have faith in what Eli had told me, and I would stand my ground. Nothing was stronger than a mother\u2019s love for her child...not even Satan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Claire dropped to the floor, and Ryan rushed over to her. Jared attempted to get to his feet, but instead resorted to crawling toward me. Jared made his way to his family, and then slowly stood on his knees, weaving with exhaustion. Once again, he was all that stood between us and death.</p><p>Satan took Jared\u2019s throat in his hand and lifted him off the ground. Jared gripped the man\u2019s arm with both hands as his feet dangled above the floor. Moving his arm to the side, Satan held Jared in the best position to watch the end.</p><p>Long, blackened fingers reached for the child. Without thinking, I pul ed her to the other side of my body, and with my free hand, gripped the Devil\u2019s wrist. It was cold and thin. My skin blazed against it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Touch. Her,\u201d I breathed.</p> <p>He frowned, noticeably confused. He tried to advance his hand to my child, but he was unable to move.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s far enough, Lucifer,\u201d Samuel said. As usual, he had blinked into our plane without detection, but time Eli was with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Lucifer said, struggling to reach the child. He was clearly straining, but he was powerless in my grasp.</p><p>Eli smiled. \u201cDaddy says no.\u201d</p><p>Lucifer wrenched his hand back, his eyes wild with anger. \u201cHe\u2019s all owing this...this human to defy me?\u201d he howled, dropping Jared to the ground.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know what this means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWar?\u201d Samuel grinned. \u201cToo late.\u201d</p><p>Satan began to speak, but Eli held up his hand. \u201cEnough, Lucifer. It\u2019s over. He has chosen to spare the child.\u201d</p><p>Lucifer charged at us, he arms extended, his fingers curled, preparing to kill the baby angel in my arms. Just before he reached us, he was blown back and held against the wal . Large, long fingers curled around his neck. Lucifer\u2019s eyes widened. The Prince of Darkness was afraid.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d Lucifer said, surprised.</p><p>\u201cHe said enough,\u201d Gabriel snarled. \u201cGo back to your pits, Satan. He wil not ask it of you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDad!\u201d Bex said, his hopeful and excited expression matching Claire\u2019s.</p><p>A figure stepped into the room from outside, through the broken remains of the windows. It was Michael, battle worn but victorious. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>Samuel stood beside Michael, crossing his arms; Eli stood before the warriors. His immaculate white shirt was a stark contrast to their heavy armor. Another form stepped over the broken glass and into the room, and then another. Soon, twenty members of Michael\u2019s army were in the room.</p><p>\u201cThe time of great suffering has come,\u201d Lucifer seethed. He stepped to the side, away from Gabriel\u2019s grip.</p><p>Eli lowered his chin. \u201cYou wil leave this family alone. Hel wil leave Gabriel\u2019s children, and their children\u2019s children, alone. He has commanded it,\u201d</p><p>he said firmly. \u201cThe child has found favor with God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not human!\u201d Lucifer hissed.</p><p>Gabriel took a step, his hands bal ed into fists at his sides. \u201cShe is my granddaughter.\u201d His voice boomed, but he did not yel . \u201cI swear to the Most High, your punishment wil have you wishing for the pits of Hel if you threaten her again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVile!\u201d the Devil screamed. \u201cVulgar! Iniquitous! Despicable!\u201d After his tantrum, he smiled. \u201cWel . He\u2019s final y stooped to my level. How delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlasphemy!\u201d Samuel said, taking a step. Eli stopped him.</p><p>Before Eli could utter a command, Satan disappeared.</p><p>I took a deep breath, letting out a sob. Jared crawled back to us, wrapping his bloody, sweaty arms around our daughter and me. I shook as I cried, kissing my baby\u2019s soft, delicate forehead as Jared kissed mine.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Ryan said, holding her in his arms.</p><p>Eli calmly walked across the room, kneeling beside them. \u201cYou look a fright.\u201d</p><p>Claire managed one weak laugh. \u201cReal y? I thought for a brush with the Devil I look pretty fly.\u201d</p><p>Gabe joined them, evaluating her wounds. \u201cPretty ugly, kiddo.\u201d He looked to Eli.</p><p>Eli motioned to Samuel, and Samuel was suddenly kneeling next to Eli, lifting Claire from Ryan\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>Samuel ignored him, setting Claire on her feet. Her clothes were stil ripped, but the gashes from her face and body had disappeared.</p><p>Gabe helped Ryan to his feet with one hand, and hooked his arm around Bex\u2019s neck with the other. \u201cThank you,\u201d Gabe said, seemingly to himself.</p><p>I knew it was God he spoke to.</p><p>Ryan pul ed Claire into his arms and smashed his lips onto hers, kissing her over and over. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he said, visibly upset.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cJust another day at work.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her tightly, a single tear running down his dirty cheek. He breathed in quickly, and then exhaled a faltering breath.</p><p>\u201cIn case I forget to tel you later,\u201d she said, pulling back. \u201cI kinda love you.\u201d</p><p>Ryan laughed once. \u201cJust remember who said it, first.\u201d</p><p>She nudged him, and they turned to watch Bex slowly return to Kim\u2019s body. He frowned, trying to hold back the overwhelming sadness that we al felt.</p><p>Ryan fetched a sheet from the corner of the room, and Claire helped him to spread it on the floor. Bex lifted Kim\u2019s body from the floor, laying her gently on the sheet. He straightened her bent legs, and crossed her hands against her chest.</p><p>Eli stood next to Ryan. \u201cWe offer Kim\u2019s soul to you, Father. Please welcome her into your kingdom, and your arms. Extend comfort to her father and to her friends, and remind them daily that the sacrifice she made, was made in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Bex said, covering her face with the sheet.</p><p>Ryan choked, and he and Claire wrapped their arms around each other.</p><p>My emotions were so tapped that I couldn\u2019t find the tears to cry. I just stared at her outline under the sheet in disbelief. She was real y gone. I imagined the horrible task of informing her father, and Beth. How we could possible explain how she died?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d Jared said. \u201cShe\u2019l receive the burial and respect she deserves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want her back,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cThis is my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have left. We would have all been safe if I\u2019d just stayed in the Sepulchre.\u201d</p><p>Jared touched my cheek. \u201cAnxiety is a struggle for anyone. You did what you believed you had to do in the moment, and the survival instinct is nearly impossible to ignore as a Hybrid. You didn\u2019t want this. Kim knew that.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but knew the guilt would haunt me for a lifetime. The threat I felt in the tomb was very real at the time, but looking back, I let my fear get the best of me, and it cost Kim her life. I would carry that for the rest of my life.</p><p>Gabe kneeled beside me to better see his grandchild. \u201cShe\u2019s absolutely beautiful,\u201d he said, touching her tiny hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, my eyes final y fil ing with tears.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand what you\u2019ve done here,\u201d he said, wiping the tender skin under my eye. \u201cYou saved her, and she wil save us all .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big job for a little girl,\u201d Jared said, looking down to the precious bundle in my arms. \u201cGood thing she\u2019s strong like her mom.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my chin, and touched Jared\u2019s lips to mine. His lips were warmer than mine for the first time in months. His scent mixed with our baby\u2019s, and I felt lightness from relief that was vaguely familiar. Feeling safe was like a distant memory, and it came to me in such a surreal way, as if I couldn\u2019t trust it. But, our family was safe. We earned a new beginning for us, for all of us, that Heaven had created. With that thought, I looked on the precious beauty in my arms. \u201cEden,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Jared said, nearly euphoric.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Eden.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>My hands were soaking wet. I wiped them on my gown, but they immediately became moist again. You can do this, I thought. This is nothing.</p><p>Definitely been through worse. I had, but there were hundreds of people watching. Waiting.</p><p>I turned to look for my husband. My eyes weren\u2019t what they were when I was pregnant, and it was very frustrating returning to a normal human after experiencing life with abilities. An arm waving above the crowd caught my attention, and I saw Lil ian smiling from ear to ear. Next to her was Cynthia. Bex, Claire, Ryan sat in a line on the other side of my mother, with Jared on the end, trying to keep hold on an excited and wiggly Eden.</p><p>She was ten months old, with rol s on rol s, and wavy blond hair. Her cheeks were so chubby that they hung down like a basset hound\u2019s. I could see her big blue eyes all the way from my seat. She stood on Jared\u2019s lap, bouncing and waving, flashing her two gapped front teeth. It seemed to be al Jared could do to see around her, but it was her big brown bow that obstructed his view. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh watching him try to see around it.</p><p>We had spent the last ten month is utter bliss. I finished my senior year at Brown as any other student, sans husband and child. No more looking over my shoulder. No more fear. Life was normal. Better than normal. We were living our happily ever after, and our daughter watched our absolute joy in our new freedom.</p><p>\u201cNina Grey Ryel,\u201d the announcer cal ed.</p><p>I walked up the stairs and across the stage, taking my diploma from the president. She greeted me, and I made my way across, shaking the hands of people I\u2019d never met, but were obviously important at Brown University.</p><p>Beth and Jared, Tucker, Josh and Lisa were among my classmates, and we were all both sad and excited that we had final y made it to graduation.</p><p>After the ceremony, we made our way to the gate, and danced through the famed Van Winkle gates with the band and Bruno, the Brown mascot.</p><p>Beth and I laughed and skipped all the way down the street, meeting my family at the end.</p><p>I was surrounded with hugs and kisses from my in-laws, and even from my mother. Eden reached for me, and Jared handed her to me, trading her for a kiss. Eden wrapped her chubby arms around my neck, tangling her fingers in my hair, and opening her mouth to give me a big, wet baby kiss on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d I said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could meet for dinner,\u201d Lil ian chirped.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I nodded. \u201cDo we need to bring anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d she winked. \u201cI\u2019ve been at it all morning.\u201d She kissed me again, and then nuzzled Eden\u2019s cheek before kissing her children goodbye. \u201cSee you at six!\u201d</p><p>Jared stuffed his hands in his pockets. \u201cWe might be a little late, Mom. We\u2019ve got to make a stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your graduation present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I said, lighting up.</p><p>Jared laughed. \u201cYou know I won\u2019t tel you!\u201d</p><p>I feigned disappointment. \u201cI loathe surprises!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he said, hugging me to his side.</p><p>Claire winked at Jared. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you guys at dinner. Congratulations! Bye, Edie!\u201d She kissed Eden\u2019s fat fingers, and then she and Ryan walked to her Exige, wrapped in each other\u2019s arms. Bex rol ed his eyes and reluctantly fol owed.</p><p>\u201cI need to change,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. We can do that, too.\u201d</p><p>Jared drove to the outskirts of town. We were on the same road as the warehouse, so I squirmed in my seat with excitement, believing Jared was taking me to see Eli. But we stopped several hundred yards from the warehouse. I could barely see it.</p><p>Jared pul ed into the driveway of a two-story house.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I said, taken aback. I looked at the house again. It was white with green shutters and porch with a swing. Very Norman Rockwel .</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Jared said. As soon as his door shut, mine opened, and then he opened the back door to unfasten Eden from her car seat. \u201cCome on!\u201d he said, barely able to contain his enthusiasm.</p><p>I held his hand, and we walked to the front door. Jared used the key, and then pushed the door open. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. The inside was identical to the loft. The same pictures on the wal s, the same decorations, even the same layout. The only difference was that the upstairs wasn\u2019t visible.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ours?\u201d I said, overwhelmed.</p><p>\u201cIt is. Our bedroom is upstairs, down the hal from Eden\u2019s, and there\u2019s a guest bedroom, too.\u201d</p><p>I hugged him tight, burying my face in his chest. \u201cJared! I love it! I can\u2019t believe you did this.\u201d</p><p>He suppressed a smile. \u201cCynthia isn\u2019t happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019l get over it!\u201d I said, looking around in awe.</p><p>We trotted up the stairs, and I gasped at our bedroom. It was like nothing had ever happened to our loft. It was the same. Excited to see the new additions, I rushed to Eden\u2019s room. Jared had made sure to decorate it exactly as it had been at Cynthia\u2019s. He sat Eden down in her crib with some toys, and then led me to the guest room by the hand. It was empty, and the wal s were white and bare.</p><p>\u201cYou left this one for me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I said, squeezing his hand.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how you\u2019d want it, so I thought I\u2019d just leave it alone. A blank canvas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it. I love all of it. I wil sleep better tonight than I have since we lost the lost.\u201d I looked at him. \u201cYou gave me back our home. I can\u2019t tel you what this means to me.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows pul ed together. \u201cNot even a fraction of what you mean to me.\u201d</p><p>I leaned up on the bal s of my feet and wrapped my arms around his neck. My lips pressed against his, and I smiled at the warmth he emanated.</p><p>I\u2019d missed how hot he felt against my human skin. His strong hands pressed against my back, and he pul ed me closer, every emotion he\u2019d ever felt coming through in that kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so happy...,\u201d I said against his mouth, \u201cand it\u2019s all because of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Always and Forever, Lara Jean (To All the Boys I've Loved Before #3)</p>  </body></html>"]
