He\u2019d watched his two cousins settle down over the last couple of years, going from Seattle\u2019s most eligible bachelors to happily married men and now he was left feeling like he was missing something.</p><p>His cousins, Derek and Drew were far more like brothers to him than cousins. They\u2019d been raised next to each other and gone from poverty level to billionaire status together. They\u2019d each done separate things in the business world but were by each another\u2019s sides as they climbed to the top of the world\u2019s richest ranks.</p><p>Ryan felt a bit excluded; as he watched his cousins find their true loves, leaving him behind for once. He was always welcome in their homes but now it was different. He was actually filled with envy as he watched them with their families.</p> <p>There he stood in a new house without furniture. He shook his head as he wandered around the rooms, his steps echoing off the bare walls. He heard a knock at the door and heard it opening.</p><p>\u201cRyan, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d he called back, as he heard the voice of his nephew. Jacob rounded the corner and the breath was pushed out of Ryan\u2019s body, as his thirteen year old nephew hurled himself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cThis place is great, Uncle Ryan,\u201d Jacob said with enthusiasm. He raced off to check out the home. Ryan was glad he\u2019d bought a place so close to his cousins because Jacob and the rest of his nieces and nephews could come over anytime.</p><p>\u201cNice place Ryan,\u201d Derek said as he joined them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m lucky to have found a place so close to you and Drew. I already mapped out the backyard and we can make a trail between the properties. Then the kids can ride four-wheelers back and forth. We can make a killer trail for all of us,\u201d Ryan said. He was excited to get started on the project. There would be no need for fences between the properties.</p><p>\u201cGreat thinking, cousin. You map it all out and I\u2019ll get the people in to forge the trail,\u201d Derek replied.</p><p>\u201cHey, maybe I don\u2019t want to tear up my yard. What if I want to keep you hooligans out,\u201d Drew jumped into the conversation. Both cousins ignored him, knowing he didn\u2019t mean a word of it.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the ladies?\u201d Ryan asked. He\u2019d expected them to be right behind their husbands.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re taking a spa day today. The young ones are at my house,\u201d Derek answered.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re already spectacular and in no way need to go to the spa,\u201d Ryan told them. Both cousins nodded, as they worshiped their wives. However, they would go to the ends of the earth for them and give them absolutely anything they wanted.</p> <p>\u201cWhen are you going to finally settle down?\u201d Derek asked him.</p><p>\u201cYou know me, I don\u2019t want a lady coming into my life and messing with a good thing,\u201d Ryan said. He had his typical cocky smile on his face but there was no real meaning behind his words. He was thinking being single wasn\u2019t as great as it had once been. As he looked around at his empty home he thought it would be pretty great to share it with someone.</p><p>He shook off his melancholy mood and showed his cousins around. Unbelievably the home was even larger than his two cousins\u2019 homes. He hadn\u2019t planned on the huge place but the location is what sold him. He wanted to be near his cousins. The older he was getting, the more he wanted to slow down a bit.</p><p>Ryan was a phenomenal architect and remodeled historic homes, which was a hobby for him and not his main career. He\u2019d made his first million in the stock market and his first billion through his many business investments. He had more money than he could ever spend in a lifetime and although he spent a lot of time in the office still, he took off when he wanted too, so he could pursue his love of historic properties.</p><p>Ryan called his secretary and gave her free reign on getting his house furnished, then headed towards the back yard with his cousins so they could plan the quad trail. The rest of the day flew by and Ryan forgot all about his troubles.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Nicole Lander parked her car, saying a prayer of thanks it had once again made it home. She was grateful each time she turned the key and the engine decided to turn over and work for another day.</p><p>She climbed the broken staircase, careful to not lean against the rusted out railing. She\u2019d made that mistake once and had almost fallen through. The only thing that saved her had been her great reflexes.</p> <p>She reached her door and inserted the key and spent the next couple of minutes wiggling it around until it finally grasped the mechanisms inside the knob and turned. She rushed inside, quickly relocking the door. She breathed a sigh of relief as she entered the safety of her apartment. She\u2019d seriously be in trouble if someone was ever chasing her because she certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to get inside quickly enough to save herself.</p><p>Nicole looked around the worn out studio apartment in disgust. It was scarcely furnished with second hand furniture, which had seen much better days. She tried to make her place as homey as possible but with her very limited budget there wasn\u2019t very much she could do. She opened her refrigerator, only to spot the empty shelves and shut it back up. She was exhausted and only had a few hours to sleep before she had to report to her temporary job.</p><p>She was so exhausted she could barely stand on her feet. She was working about twenty hours a day, six days a week, plus a few hours on her seventh day. She couldn\u2019t wait until she found a permanent, full-time job so she could actually have some decent hours. Between her jobs and visiting with her sister in the hospital she knew she looked like a complete wreck.</p><p>She fell face first on her bed and wasn\u2019t happy when her telephone woke her up a short hour later. She crawled from the bed to pick it up because she knew it had to be important. \u201cHello,\u201d she croaked into the phone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for Nicole Lander,\u201d said the voice on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cThis is Nicole, how can I help you?\u201d she replied, a bit more awake.</p><p>\u201cWe have prescreened you for a full-time job and think you\u2019d be perfect for the position,\u201d the woman said. Nicole was on instant alert.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to hear about it,\u201d she told the woman.</p><p>\u201cThe position is for a live in housecleaner. You\u2019d be provided room and board, plus a generous salary if you\u2019re interested in coming in for an interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there whenever you need me to be,\u201d Nicole said, without needing to ask any questions. She didn\u2019t care if she was scrubbing toilets all day, as long as she could get out of her current flat. \u201cWhen do you want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to come into the office and fill out some paperwork. Confidentiality is a must while working for this client. You\u2019ll have to sign papers you understand and won\u2019t speak about what happens in the household. You\u2019ll also be required to submit to a drug test. Your background check is already complete. If you come into the office this afternoon we can interview you. I want to let you know there are a few other people interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down there in a half hour. I have no problem signing whatever you need,\u201d Nicole told her. She hoped she wasn\u2019t sounding too desperate.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great, Nicole. I\u2019ll be waiting for you,\u201d she said before disconnecting the call. Nicole thought the client must be one of those wealthy hermits who didn\u2019t like the world to see them. She really didn\u2019t care. Her temp company wouldn\u2019t send her to an unsafe place. Even if her room was tiny it would be better than the studio she currently resided in. She was on the verge of losing the place anyway because her sister\u2019s hospital bills were depleting her bank account.</p><p>Even though she hadn\u2019t gotten enough sleep, she was wired with excitement running through her veins. She jumped into the shower and made it to the offices in just under thirty minutes. She walked from the interview confident she\u2019d be selected. By the time she got back home and crawled into bed, sleep overtook her and she felt some peace, which she hadn\u2019t felt in too long.</p><p>When she got the call the next day, she hung her head and barely managed to hold the tears back. Someone else had gotten the position. She was running out of options. She didn\u2019t know how she was going to take care of Patsy\u2019s hospital bills and still keep a roof over their heads. She got dressed and headed towards her waitressing job, where she would be lucky to take home thirty dollars in tips for a ten hour shift. It wasn\u2019t much motivation but it was better than nothing.</p><p>Three months later, Nicole sat by her phone trying to work up her courage. She had to call him, there was no other choice. Nicole was cringing at the thought of groveling at Ryan Titan\u2019s feet but she really didn\u2019t see any other options. Her sister needed the operation and as hard as Nicole worked she still couldn\u2019t pay for it. The hospital didn\u2019t care if it was a life or death matter. They only cared about the bottom line. She couldn\u2019t believe they said it was an elective surgery. It was something slowly killing her though and not an emergency. They wouldn\u2019t perform it without payment in full.</p><p>Nicole took a deep breath, with her hand resting on the phone. She\u2019d been in the same position for the last hour, trying to force herself to pick it up. Her palms were sweaty and her heart was beating irregularly, out of control. The tear tracks down her cheeks had long dried but the terror was still there.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t talked to Ryan in twelve years and the last conversation hadn\u2019t gone well. He still believed she\u2019d cheated on him. It had been so much easier to let him believe that but oh how it had broken her heart.</p><p>She told herself repeatedly it wasn\u2019t about her. It was about her little sister and no matter how much he may hate her he\u2019d always loved Patsy. There was no way he\u2019d sit back and let her die when he could help her.</p><p>She wiped her hands on her jeans and picked up the handle of the phone, trying to control her trembling hands. She had to redial the number three times. She was shaking so hard she kept misdialing.</p><p>As the phone started to ring her nerves were at the breaking point. She was hoping it would go to voicemail. Then she could just leave a message and not have to face hearing his voice.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d a voice demanded, startling her.</p><p>\u201cTh...this is Nicole,\u201d she stuttered. There was an uncomfortably long pause on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cNicole who?\u201d came the same voice, as cool as ice.</p><p>\u201cNicole Lander,\u201d she said, barely above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get my person number?\u201d his voice demanded. She was thinking she\u2019d made a really bad mistake. It sounded as if he didn\u2019t even remember who she was. Maybe their time together had been far more significant to her than to him.</p><p>\u201cI got it from your uncle,\u201d she finally managed to say. There was another really long silence at her words.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he demanded to know.</p><p>\u201cI um, wanted to see if I could, um, talk to you about something important,\u201d she forced through her trembling lips. \u201cWe used to know each other, a really long time ago, I don\u2019t know if you still remember me,\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to beat around the bush. Spit out what it is you want,\u201d he demanded of her. She didn\u2019t want to ask him for money over the phone but what choice did she have. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy little sister is in the hospital and she needs an operation and we don\u2019t have any other options. Your uncle said I should talk to you,\u201d she finally pushed out, on the verge of crying, once again. She could tell by his tone of voice he was simply humoring her and in no way was going to help them out. She was going to lose her baby sister and she didn\u2019t think she could possibly make it through the horrific experience.</p><p>He was silent for so long she thought he hung up the phone. He didn\u2019t remember her, or her sister and he was far too important a man to sit there on the phone with her. She\u2019d failed her last resort and she felt an overwhelming sense of grief. She was starting to take the phone from her ear when he finally spoke again.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where my office is?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes, in the city,\u201d she mumbled.</p> <p>\u201cBe there tomorrow at five,\u201d he said and then she heard nothing but a dial tone. She sat there for a couple of minutes in shock as the phone continued to beep at her. She finally managed to hang up and allowed the tears to fall down her cheeks. It wasn\u2019t hopeless. He was willing to hear her out. She didn\u2019t care what it took. She had to convince him to help her baby sister. She couldn\u2019t lose her.</p><p>Ryan sat at his desk, feeling a myriad of emotions coursing through him. He had known who was on the other end of his line from the very first word she had whispered. He could never forget that voice. It had haunted his dreams for the past twelve years. She\u2019d been the girl who got away; hell not only got away but thrust him from her life.</p><p>He ran his hands through his hair and let out a sigh of frustration. How he wished he could\u2019ve simply told her to go to hell and hung up the phone. There was no way he could be that much of a bastard. He\u2019d loved Patsy as if she was his own little sister.</p><p>He felt a smile lift the corner of his lips, as he thought back to little Patsy toddling around his legs, as he spent time with Nicole. She had become attached to him from the very first moment he came through her doors. Over the years of watching her grow up she\u2019d squeezed a piece of his heart.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t heard Patsy was hurt. He decided to make some calls and get some background information on the situation. He needed to be well prepared when Nicole stepped through his doors. He\u2019d been incredibly surprised by her call. He wasn\u2019t having any more surprises when she stepped back into his life. He also needed to speak to his uncle. He didn\u2019t know what the old man was up to but he knew not to give his number out to anyone. His uncle should\u2019ve taken her number and given it to Ryan. That way he wouldn\u2019t have been surprised. He didn\u2019t like to be blindsided.</p> <p>By the time Ryan got the answers he was looking for, he hung his head in shame. He couldn\u2019t believe how bad things had gotten for Patsy. He knew beyond any shadow of a doubt he would help her but Nicole had no clue of that. He would help Patsy but he was also going to get what he wanted out of Nicole.</p><p>She\u2019d once thought he wasn\u2019t good enough for her and now he was the only one who could save her baby sister. He felt a sense of justice in that knowledge. He knew there wasn\u2019t any point in working the rest of the day, as he couldn\u2019t concentrate. He was eager for his appointment the next day. A smile stole across his features, as he sat back in his chair. He enjoyed a challenge and Nicole would definitely provide him some entertainment.</p><p>He made several phone calls, which included getting Patsy moved to a private room. He then found the best cardiothoracic surgeon he could find, called in for a consult. He didn\u2019t do anything in half-measures and he wanted to make sure she received only the best of care.</p><p>By the time he hung up the phone, he felt more in control. Patsy was going to be well taken care of and he was going to get his chance for redemption with Nicole. She would pay for what she had done to him and they both would enjoy the punishment.</p><p>Ryan headed home, feeling better than he had felt in a long while. That somewhat empty feeling he had been dealing with for quite some time seemed to have completely lifted. He found himself smiling as he jogged up the stairs to change clothing. He was meeting up with Drew later in the evening and decided to enjoy his great mood.</p><p>Nicole paced outside the high rise building, working up her courage to enter through the double doors. He wouldn\u2019t have told her to come in unless he was going to help her sister. He may hate her for what he thought she\u2019d done to him but he used to be the kindest person she knew and there was no way he could let Patsy die.</p> <p>She squared her shoulders and held her head up high as she entered the plush interior of Titan Enterprises. Even the lobby of the building screamed luxury, with its marble floors and huge security desk. There were plants strategically placed to make the area warm and inviting and several people were moving around the lobby, coming in and out of different doors. She didn\u2019t know if the room was supposed to seem intimidating or not but it certainly made her feel out of place. The people he dealt with on a daily basis most likely didn\u2019t notice the luxury surrounding them as they were around it all the time.</p><p>The guard behind the desk looked pleasant enough but Nicole could see the steel in his gaze. If she wasn\u2019t on the acceptable list, there was no way she\u2019d make it to the elevators. She had to fight every instinct in her, which told her to turn around and run away. She was made stronger than that and wouldn\u2019t back down. She\u2019d fought harder battles in her life but her sister\u2019s surgery was the only one she\u2019d ever fought for with her whole being.</p><p>She tried to walk with as much confidence as she could muster. What if him having her come in had been a cruel joke and the guard was going to send her on her way? If that were the case she would leave kicking and screaming. There was nothing she wouldn\u2019t do for her sister, even if it meant humiliating herself.</p><p>\u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201d the man asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m here to see Mr. Titan,\u201d she answered. She\u2019d been trying to sound confident but her throaty voice sounded weak, even to her own ears. She took a few deep breaths, trying to pull herself together.</p><p>\u201cYour name, please?\u201d the guard asked.</p><p>\u201cNicole Lander,\u201d she replied. The man looked at his computer for a moment and she had to quell the panic from rising. After what seemed an inordinately long amount of time, though it was only seconds, he nodded his head and handed her a badge.</p><p>\u201cGo to the elevators and swipe this badge. Go up to the twentieth floor. When you step off the elevators go to the right and you\u2019ll find the reception desk. Mr. Titan is expecting you so check in with his secretary,\u201d the man said. Nicole nodded at him, to let him know she understood.</p> <p>Walking over to the elevators, she pushed the button and waited. It felt like she was in a fog as the bell chimed and the doors opened. She stepped inside and had to fight her claustrophobia as the metal machine rose higher and higher. Instead of the music being comforting, she was feeling more closed in. She hated small places but as the numbers lit up, signaling her imminent arrival, she could feel her breathing become shallower. She was seconds away from seeing her first love and she had a feeling the meeting would be quite the chilling one.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted him to hate her when she pushed him out of her life. It had been a far better option than the alternative. There was no way she wanted him to know who she really was. She would much rather have him look at her with anger and contempt in his eyes, than pity or disgust from knowing the truth.</p><p>The doors opened and she jumped a bit from the bell signaling her arrival. On wooden legs she stepped from the doors and made her way to the beautiful desk, which sat in the middle of a huge reception area.</p><p>\u201cName please,\u201d the woman asked, barely looking up from her computer.</p><p>\u201cNicole Lander,\u201d she answered in a bit stronger voice. The woman picked up her phone and spoke into it for a moment.</p><p>\u201cMr. Titan is currently busy. He asked me to tell you to have a seat. He\u2019ll call you when he\u2019s finished up,\u201d the woman said. She turned back to her computer, confident Nicole would do what she was told.</p><p>Nicole walked over to one of the plush seats and picked up a magazine. She glanced at her watch every few minutes. She was anxious to get back. She really wanted to make it to the hospital to visit with her sister before she had to report in to her waitressing job.</p><p>The time continued to tick by and she was getting seething mad once an hour had passed. She figured she\u2019d be in his office no more than a half hour but if she didn\u2019t get in there soon she wouldn\u2019t be able to visit her sister. She stepped up to the desk, thinking he\u2019d forgotten about her.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure Mr. Titan knew I was still here,\u201d she said to the receptionist. She knew she had a bit of bite to her tone but it was rude to make someone wait this long. He must assume he was the only one who had a life. The secretary looked up startled, like she couldn\u2019t possibly believe Nicole would dare to question her boss\u2019s intentions.</p><p>\u201cMr. Titan\u2019s a very busy man. You\u2019ll have to wait for him to call you in,\u201d the woman rudely replied. Nicole nodded and took her seat again. Another half hour passed, still with no word from Ryan and she could no longer wait. She couldn\u2019t afford to be late to her job. It looked like he\u2019d played her for a fool. He was most likely in his office, watching her fidget from some hidden camera and having a nice laugh to himself.</p><p>She slowly got up and headed off towards the elevator. She didn\u2019t approach the reception desk again, why bother? She took the elevator back downstairs and returned the badge to the security guard. She held her head high as she exited the building. She was going to barely make it to work on time so she wouldn\u2019t allow the tears fall, which were trying so hard to escape.</p><p>She felt like she had failed her baby sister. She really didn\u2019t see any other options of being able to pay the surgery bill. She\u2019d already given up her tiny apartment. She was living on friend\u2019s couches and her sister\u2019s hospital room chair. She had sold everything of value she owned and it still wasn\u2019t enough. Her car decided when it wanted to work, which was only about half the time. She wasn\u2019t a person to give up on anything but she didn\u2019t see what more she could possibly do.</p><p>She rushed in the doors of the second rate, all-night truck stop, where she waitressed and put her purse away. She made it out to the floor with a minute to spare. Her boss looked up with a glare and pointedly glanced at the clock. He then went back to his paper and ignored her. It was going to be a long night, as she hadn\u2019t gotten a descent night\u2019s sleep in forever. She was used to that and would deal with it like she did everything thrown her way.</p><p>Ryan hadn\u2019t expected the business call to take so long and was about to pull his hair out, when he finally managed to get off the phone. He\u2019d been planning on making Nicole wait for a while, just to make sure she squirmed in her seat a bit. He wasn\u2019t normally so rude though as to make someone wait two hours.</p><p>\u201cYou can send Ms. Lander in, now,\u201d he said into his intercom. There was a pause before his efficient secretary came back.</p><p>\u201cIt looks as if she left,\u201d came the reply. Ryan didn\u2019t say anything else. He hung up and called the security desk asking if she\u2019d left the building, only to find out she\u2019d indeed left about a half hour earlier. She wasn\u2019t acting like someone who wanted a favor. If any other person had walked out before he was ready to speak with them he would\u2019ve scrapped the whole thing but this wasn\u2019t business, it was personal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He made some phone calls and found out where she was. When he discovered where she was working, his bad mood deepened even further. He really shouldn\u2019t give a damn where she worked, or what she did. She shouldn\u2019t matter to him in the least but when he thought about her working overnight at the dive of a truck stop, his stomach clenched. He knew the kind of people who habituated a place like that in the wee hours of the morning and it was certainly no place for a woman.</p><p>He gathered up his things and called his driver. It looked like he was dining out that night. He smiled to himself, when he pictured her reaction to him entering the joint. Hell, when his car pulled up, he was sure there would be a bit of a stir. People like him simply didn\u2019t go to places like that. At least people like him nowadays. He would\u2019ve been happy to go anywhere when he was a kid. That would\u2019ve been a real treat.</p><p>It took the driver about forty minutes to navigate traffic and pull up in front of the diner. It was fairly busy and he looked through the windows, spotting her almost immediately. She\u2019d changed in the years since he\u2019d seen her last but not much.</p><p>Her young, sleek body had matured and now she had curves, though he couldn\u2019t see them well beneath the loose clothing and apron she was wearing. Her hair was still dark and hung low on her back in an unflattering braid, which looked like she had made up in minutes.</p> <p>As he stepped through the diner doors and quickly browsed before she noticed him, he could see the weariness in the set of her shoulders. When she finally turned to see who\u2019d walked in and caused a silence to fall over her customers, he felt a kick in his gut by the sheer exhaustion of her expression.</p><p>She\u2019d always been so full of life and now she looked drained, as if she bore the weight of the world on her shoulders. She approached him slowly, as if he was a dangerous animal ready to strike any moment. His lips turned up in a sardonic smile because he was a dangerous animal, far more deadly than any four legged creature she may encounter.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a table?\u201d she asked him suspiciously. She knew he normally wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in a truck stop restaurant.</p><p>\u201cThat would be great,\u201d he responded overconfidently. Her manager was watching the pair of them and she couldn\u2019t afford to get fired so she gritted her teeth and showed Ryan to the table. She didn\u2019t get why he\u2019d come to her place of work but she couldn\u2019t make a scene and as humiliating as it was she was going to be forced to serve him.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d she asked through clinched teeth.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a coffee,\u201d he replied. He\u2019d determined within minutes of walking in, she\u2019d be leaving with him. He knew exactly what he wanted in payment for helping her sister and he would get it. He would enjoy a little bit of cat and mouse in the meantime. He knew he would win, so he could be indulgent for a while.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the menu. I\u2019ll be right back with your coffee,\u201d she said and walked off. He enjoyed the sway of her hips, which were slightly thicker than when they were teenagers. She\u2019d definitely turned into a woman and he couldn\u2019t wait to explore the new her. She was still stunning, even with the stress and exhaustion etched into her features.</p><p>She returned with the coffee and he noticed the mirth in her eyes, as he took his first sip and a grimace passed over his features. It was horrible tasting and he had the feeling she was enjoying his suffering. He controlled his face and took another long sip, just so he could wipe that smug look off her face. She controlled her own expression but couldn\u2019t hide the twinkle in her gorgeous brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to place your order?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your specials?\u201d he asked in a serious tone. She thought two could play at him being just an ordinary customer.</p><p>\u201cWe have the chef\u2019s meatloaf special and we serve breakfast all day,\u201d she said sweetly. He perused the menu, like he really cared what he ordered. Her foot started taping impatiently, as she continued to wait for him.</p> <p>\u201cMs. Lander, can you please come over here?\u201d her boss asked and she couldn\u2019t keep the twinge from showing in her expression. She walked over to her obnoxious boss with what she hoped was an obedient expression pasted on her face.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Archer,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCould you please try and act more professional. That man showed up in a jaguar and you\u2019re taping your toe in impatience. Do you want to keep your job?\u201d he threatened her.</p><p>\u201cOf course, sir. I\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d she said, hopefully humbly enough. He dismissed her and she walked back over to Ryan, even more furious with the man. She saw the look of steel in his eyes and she was scared he was going to cause a scene.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about making you wait, have you decided yet?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a turkey sandwich and the soup of the day,\u201d he responded. Ryan didn\u2019t like the way her boss had spoken to her and it only solidified his decision she\u2019d be leaving with him. She jotted down his order and quickly disappeared.</p><p>Nicole served him his food quickly and he forced himself to choke some of it down, while he continued to watch her. She never stopped running, as she refilled coffee and took down orders. She kept his glass topped off, along with the other twenty or so customers. He almost came out of his seat when he saw some trucker get a little bit too friendly. He had to admit he was impressed how she handled the man, letting him know she was unavailable, while still being polite.</p><p>He gave up on eating the terrible food and sat back, drinking the muddy tasting coffee. He\u2019d been there for a couple of hours and several of the customers cleared out and yet she was still running around. Her boss snapped orders at her left and right and she still managed to keep a positive attitude. She had to be dead on her feet. He wasn\u2019t going to take much more.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he told her, when she came to top off his mug again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk right now, I\u2019m working,\u201d she told him, somewhat exasperated.</p><p>\u201cHave you had a break yet tonight?\u201d he asked her. She looked at him as if he were insane. She was lucky to get to run to the bathroom on any given night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only waitress here, I don\u2019t have time to take a break,\u201d she finally said and turned to walk away. He grabbed her wrist and pulled her into the booth, next to him and she gasped in outrage at his high-handedness.</p><p>\u201cMs. Lander, you have customers waiting on you,\u201d her boss said, thinking she was slacking on the job. She looked at Ryan in a panic. If he was trying to get her fired, he was doing an excellent job.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, I tripped,\u201d she said, as she struggled to get back up.</p><p>\u201cMs. Lander hasn\u2019t had a break the entire time I\u2019ve been here and I\u2019d like to speak to her for a few minutes,\u201d Ryan said to the man, while glaring over at him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate you telling me how to treat my employee\u2019s, as it\u2019s none of your business,\u201d her boss puffed up in anger at Ryan for having the audacity to call him on anything. \u201cGet back to work, Ms. Lander,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>She once again struggled to get up and Ryan still refused to let her go. She couldn\u2019t make a big scene in front of her boss but he was giving her no choice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get me fired,\u201d she said through gritted teeth. She was starting to get scared and he could see the vulnerability in her eyes. He was done with the place and she was leaving with him, even if he had to throw her over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving now,\u201d he said, as he released her and stood up. He threw some bills on the table and grabbed his jacket. Nicole quickly fled from him, then went around the tables and refilled her customers\u2019 glasses. He stood by the counter and waited until she was done.</p><p>\u201cI need to use the restroom. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Nicole told her boss and quickly disappeared. Ryan\u2019s rage increased when the man nodded tightly. He couldn\u2019t believe she needed to get permission to use the bathroom. It was ridiculous. He spotted the cook, who looked like an understanding man. He pulled a couple hundreds from his pocket and approached the guy.</p><p>\u201cCan you please grab Nicole\u2019s things for me? She\u2019s leaving with me now, whether she wants to or not and I think she would rather have her possessions,\u201d Ryan said to the guy, who sized him up. \u201cI in no way want to harm her. Our families are friends and she\u2019ll no longer need this job,\u201d he assured the cook.</p><p>\u201cShe should\u2019ve left here long ago. The boss treats her like crap,\u201d the cook said. He grabbed her belongings and set them on the counter, then stood waiting for Nicole to come out. She appeared quickly, since it seemed she wasn\u2019t allowed more than a couple of minutes, even to use the restroom.</p><p>\u201cNicole, do you know this guy?\u201d the cook asked her. Her shoulders seemed to sag a bit as she tried to figure out how to answer that question.</p><p>\u201cWe grew up together. Don\u2019t worry, Bubba, he\u2019s not trying to hurt me,\u201d she assured the cook. She had no clue she\u2019d just given the cook permission to let Ryan cart her out of the restaurant, or she would\u2019ve never said that. Bubba smiled at Ryan and gave him the thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cRight then, let\u2019s go,\u201d he told Nicole once again.</p><p>\u201cRyan, I already told you I\u2019m not going anywhere with you. I don\u2019t get off until eight in the morning,\u201d she almost yelled at him. She then looked over at her boss, who was glaring at her. She had to get him out of the restaurant. \u201cIf you really want to talk to me, I\u2019ll come to your offices in the morning,\u201d she finished and smiled at him, in what she hoped was a reassuring smile.</p><p>Ryan didn\u2019t feel the need to talk anymore. He grabbed her things up, then grabbed her around the waist and tossed her over his shoulder and started walking toward the front door. Nicole was in so much shock from his caveman display she said nothing until they were almost to the door.</p><p>\u201cRyan, I demand you put me down right this instant,\u201d she finally found her voice.</p><p>\u201cNicole, if you walk out that door now, you can kiss your job goodbye,\u201d her boss said to her. She looked at him from her upside down position with incredulity. She wasn\u2019t walking anywhere. Was no one going to stop this man from openly kidnapping her?</p><p>The few customers in the restaurant heard Ryan talking with Bubba so no one was stepping up to stop him. Nicole shuddered in disbelief as he carried her out the door and approached his car. The last thing she heard before the door of the restaurant closed was her boss yelling at her she was fired.</p><p>She started pounding on Ryan\u2019s back in anger as they stepped up to his car. His driver opened the backdoor like there was nothing wrong with him carrying a girl over his shoulder. Hell, for all she knew, he did it on a regular basis. He tossed her down on the back seat and quickly climbed in beside her, before she had the chance to get her breath back again.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Ryan said something to the driver and the car started to move through the nearly deserted streets. Nicole was in shock from his behavior. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d been openly kidnapped in the middle of a diner and no one had done a thing to stop it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded of him, once she got her wind back.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to talk and then walked out. You\u2019re lucky I\u2019m giving you a second chance,\u201d he stated in an arrogant tone of voice. She looked at him like he was insane. He thought he was doing her a favor by dragging her out of the diner, costing her a valuable job and most likely her last paycheck as well.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane? Do you know how difficult it is to find work?\u201d she demanded of him.</p><p>\u201cThat was a crap job and you know it. I did you a favor,\u201d he said. His tone of voice said he really did think he\u2019d done her a favor. She rolled her eyes at him and sat back in the car, crossing her arms across her chest and glared out the window. She had no idea where he was taking her, or even what to say to him.</p> <p>Ryan watched her, as she did her best to pretend like he wasn\u2019t even there. He was irritated by her, acting as if he\u2019d committed some crime, when what he\u2019d done, was help her out. She was much better off without an unsafe job and she\u2019d soon be thanking him. He grinned, as he thought about how she could thank him properly.</p><p>He was irritated by how much he desired her. He\u2019d wanted her more than life itself when they\u2019d been teenagers but they\u2019d both been far too young and had never cemented their relationship. They\u2019d certainly done some heavy petting but he\u2019d never taken her and made her his. He was ready to rectify that.</p><p>The car pulled up to his gate and slipped inside for the long ride up his private driveway. Nicole seemed to tense more, as she realized they weren\u2019t on the main road anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me, Ryan?\u201d she demanded to know.</p><p>\u201cTo my house, so we can finish our chat privately,\u201d he simply replied.</p> <p>Nicole looked at him nervously. She\u2019d been in no way prepared to step into his house. It was truly his domain and she didn\u2019t want to leave the vehicle. The driver pulled up to the massive home and opened the back door. She stubbornly sat there, refusing to exit the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cYou can get out and walk in, or I can carry you,\u201d Ryan said to her. The driver said nothing and Nicole knew Ryan wasn\u2019t bluffing so she reluctantly exited the car and followed him toward the house.</p><p>He opened the front door and she stood there in shock. She knew Ryan was incredibly wealthy but if she hadn\u2019t, the sheer size of his home would\u2019ve clued her in. She didn\u2019t understand why he would possibly need a place so large. The entryway alone was bigger than the house she\u2019d grown up in. She looked around in awe and desperately tried to tamp down her reaction.</p><p>Ryan watched her trying to contain her amazement and smiled to himself. He was no longer the poor kid who hadn\u2019t been good enough for her. He felt great at what he\u2019d accomplished. He\u2019d worked hard for everything he owned and he was in a position now to have anything he wanted. And currently he wanted Nicole.</p><p>Nicole was suddenly so exhausted she could barely even stand, let alone walk the long hallway they were traversing. The house seemed to be endless but she placed one foot in front of the other, as she followed him deeper into the home. Finally they rounded a turn and he led her into an inviting room with a warm fire crackling.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask him permission. She simply walked over to the comfortable looking sofa and got off her aching feet. Soon a woman walked into the room and placed a tray near her, which had a steaming cup of coffee on it, along with cream and sugar. She doctored up a cup and took a revitalizing sip. It was pure heaven. She hadn\u2019t had such good coffee in forever.</p> <p>Before she realized it, the entire cup was gone and Ryan was taking it away and placing a new cup in front of her. She prepared the coffee the way she liked it and sat back, sipping more slowly on her second cup. She didn\u2019t know what was in it but her eyes were feeling even heavier than before and her body was in a complete state of relaxation.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d Ryan asked, snapping her out of her trance.</p><p>\u201cThis must be decaffeinated because I\u2019m having a hard time staying awake,\u201d she answered him.</p><p>\u201cIt has a shot of rum in it to sooth your nerves,\u201d he answered, with a slight nod. Nicole was irritated with him for doing that without her permission but the liquor was doing its job and she felt too relaxed to yell at him. \u201cI need to make a call, so we will talk when I get back,\u201d he said and left her alone in the room. Nicole breathed out a sigh of relief. She wanted nothing more than to simply relax for a few minutes before they had the conversation.</p><p>She knew she needed to ask for his help with her sister and she was more confident he would help but she wasn\u2019t sure if she was going to be able to handle whatever he wanted out of her in return.</p><p>She was beginning to think he was going to want his pound of flesh in return. She shuddered, as she sat back and closed her eyes. Her mind drifted back to the awful day so many years before.</p><p>She\u2019d been sixteen years old and he was eighteen. They\u2019d dated for about a year and she was head over heels in love with him. That had been the summer things had gone to hell with her family. Her father had always been abusive but he\u2019d worked full time and she\u2019d managed to keep Ryan away from him. Her mother had been around but not much of a parent.</p><p>When her father lost his job, the abuse had gone to a whole new level and she realized she couldn\u2019t possibly keep a boyfriend without him realizing what was going on. Her father was taking out his aggravation on her daily and her body showed obvious signs. Her mother had decided to step out of reality by drowning herself in alcohol from morning to night. Nicole was miserable and in no way wanted the boy she was in love with to realize what a pathetic person she\u2019d become.</p> <p>She\u2019d planned on running away with Ryan when he headed to the city. She would work while he went to college and they could marry and have a nice little house with a white picket fence. Those dreams were lost because she couldn\u2019t leave her baby sister behind. If she wasn\u2019t there to protect Patsy, her sister would be the one taking the beatings instead of her and that wasn\u2019t acceptable. Patsy was only four at the time.</p><p>When she\u2019d realized she would have to break up with him she wanted him to think she was a selfish teenager instead of a pathetic one. She led him to believe she didn\u2019t think he was good enough for her. She played her role well and he walked away without once looking back. He\u2019d always been self-conscious of his poor roots and to the outside world her family seemed well off.</p><p>By the time Ryan left, things had gotten really bad at home. He was out of school and though she\u2019d seen him a few times in town, he acted like she didn\u2019t even exist. It nearly destroyed her when she ran into him, with another girl hanging on his arm. He\u2019d spotted her and sent her a wink and she walked away, trying to seem casual, then threw up once she was out of sight of him.</p><p>He left two years after they broke up, hating her just as much as the day she\u2019d broken up with him and she endured the abuse for another two years after that. Once she turned eighteen, she got a decent job, took her sister and moved out. Her father didn\u2019t try to stop her because he was afraid of going to jail and her mother was too gone to even notice her daughters left.</p><p>Her parents died in an automobile crash two years later and it had only been her and Patsy from that point on. They\u2019d been scraping by, doing fine until Patsy got heart disease, which threatened to take her life. The hospital staff said the surgery was an elective one and now she was sitting in Ryan\u2019s house begging for a hand-out.</p><p>Nicole fell asleep with her old memories fresh in her mind, exhaustion finally taking her away. She didn\u2019t want to think about the hurtful past or about her present condition.</p><p>Ryan walked into the den and found Nicole asleep on the couch. She looked so exhausted, with the dark circles under her eyes and her body limp, against the back of the couch. She looked so worn out, his anger was deflated.</p><p>He scooped her into his arms and in her sleep she turned towards him, seeking his protection. She wrapped herself around him, causing his body to stir with desire. He was disgusted with himself for being so affected, with little more than a simple movement in her sleep.</p><p>He placed her on his huge bed and she began to shiver. He quickly pulled off her shoes and pants, groaning at the small scrap of her panties visible to him. He quickly covered her up and decided there was no way he could walk away.</p><p>He took a very cold shower and still not trusting himself, put on a pair of sweats and climbed in next to her. She immediately curled into him and he laid there for hours with his body aching but his mind content. It was nice to simply lay there and hold her close and eventually his body relaxed and he drifted off into a dreamless sleep.</p><p>Nicole woke up and stretched her arms. She felt more rested, which was a wonderful feeling. She slowly opened her eyes and realized she was in a very comfortable and yet unfamiliar bed. She looked around in a bit of a panic, not knowing where she was. She was used to waking up in unfamiliar places, since she\u2019d been a nomad for months but she\u2019d never awakened somewhere so luxurious.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would ever wake up,\u201d Ryan\u2019s voice said. She jerked up in bed and suddenly remembered her strange night with him. She didn\u2019t have a clue how she\u2019d ended up in one of his bed\u2019s but was eternally grateful to discover she wasn\u2019t naked. She then noticed her missing pants and felt the blush rush over her cheeks. Had he been the one to take her pants off? She was wearing perfectly fine panties that wouldn\u2019t have shown him much but she was still a bit mortified.</p><p>\u201cHow did I get here?\u201d she managed to choke out.</p><p>\u201cI carried you,\u201d he answered and had the gall to wink at her. She couldn\u2019t stop her face from flaming even more red. \u201cI\u2019ll give you some privacy to shower and get dressed. Meet me downstairs in the den,\u201d he told her and disappeared out the door. She\u2019d never been so grateful for someone to leave.</p><p>She slowly climbed from the bed and took her time in his shower. If he insisted on her being in his place and treating her like a child then he could wait on her, she thought a bit too smugly. With no other reason to delay, she slowly made her way down the huge staircase in search of the den. She didn\u2019t have to look too long because her nose led the way. She smelled something that made her stomach growl and reminded her she hadn\u2019t eaten since breakfast twenty-four hours earlier.</p><p>She stepped into the den and her eyes were drawn to a side table with several dishes on it, filled with delicious smelling food. She wanted so badly to step over to the table and grab a plate full of food but she wasn\u2019t even a guest in the house and couldn\u2019t bring herself to do it.</p><p>Ryan was sitting at the small corner table and saw the look of hunger on Nicole\u2019s face. He silently watched her. Even though it was obvious she was starving, she was so damn stubborn, she wouldn\u2019t even feed herself. He blew out a breath of frustration.</p><p>\u201cWould you please quit staring at the food as if it will disappear and get yourself a plate? We can talk over breakfast,\u201d he said to her. She jumped when she heard his voice. It was obvious she hadn\u2019t realized he was in the room.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she muttered and didn\u2019t have to be told twice. She dug into the food like it was her last meal. Heck, the way she lived it could be a while before she was able to eat this well again and she knew it. She didn\u2019t even care if she looked like a complete pig. She was going to eat until her stomach hurt. She really didn\u2019t care what he\u2019d have to say about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nicole sat at the table and began eating as if it were a race. Unfortunately her stomach had shrunk over the months and she wasn\u2019t even able to finish a quarter of the food she\u2019d placed on her plate. His housekeeper came and tried to clear her plate and she almost growled at her. The woman looked up startled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done yet,\u201d she said and could feel the awful red flushing her cheeks again.</p><p>\u201cLet Maria take the plate and if you get hungry again, then you can grab some fresh food,\u201d Ryan said to her with a little chuckle. Nicole glared at him, snagged the muffin off the plate and reluctantly let his housekeeper take the rest away.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I think it\u2019s time to have our chat now,\u201d Ryan told her. Nicole took a deep breath and got ready to beg. There was no one, other than her sister, who she\u2019d lower herself for. Since she was more of a mother to Patsy than a sibling, she\u2019d do whatever it took to make sure she\u2019d be okay.</p> <p>\u201cPatsy has a rare heart disease requiring surgery but her insurance doesn\u2019t cover it. They say it\u2019s an elective surgery and yet if she doesn\u2019t get it, she won\u2019t survive to her seventeenth birthday,\u201d Nicole said in a rush. She was fighting tears, even speaking of the thought of losing Patsy. She loved her so much and she was supposed to take care of her. She was supposed to be the one who made sure she didn\u2019t get sick and now Patsy was barely hanging on. The thought of it nearly destroyed Nicole.</p><p>\u201cSo you need to borrow money?\u201d he asked her. He leaned back in his chair and was looking at her like she was a piece of meat he was about to devour. She had to fight not to glare at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s killing me to borrow money from you. I just need someone to pay her surgery costs. I\u2019ll get a new job right away and pay every dime of it back,\u201d she said stubbornly. She couldn\u2019t tell from his expression if he was going to do it or not. The waiting was killing her a bit more inside.</p><p>Ryan felt an immense satisfaction to have her sitting before him. It made up slightly for those years of pain he\u2019d gone through. No other girl had ever come close to holding his attention like she had.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you willing to do for me if I do this?\u201d he asked her coldly.</p> <p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t understand,\u201d she stuttered.</p><p>\u201cCome on Nicole, you\u2019re so much smarter than this, or at least you used to be. Money means nothing to me. I can pay the bill without it even placing a dent in my wallet so I don\u2019t need, nor want you to pay me back,\u201d he told her in a smug tone of voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked him, far too afraid of the answer he may give. He smiled at her and her stomach clenched. She was terrified of what was going to come out of his mouth next. What if the thing he wanted wasn\u2019t possible for her to give? If it was within her power, then of course she would do it but she couldn\u2019t figure out what he could possibly want from her - she had absolutely nothing.</p><p>Ryan knew he was going straight to hell but he didn\u2019t care. He wanted her and now he had the chance to get what he wanted. He would get from her what he wanted and when he was finished he\u2019d walk away. Then maybe he wouldn\u2019t feel the ache. She would never know he\u2019d already arranged the surgery and had Patsy moved the night before.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know that even if she walked right out the door and told him to go to hell he\u2019d still help Patsy. He\u2019d loved the little girl when she was only a couple years old and toddling at his feet. He\u2019d help her without requiring anything. But on the other hand why not get something out of Nicole if he could. He looked straight into her eyes so there would be no chance of a misunderstanding.</p><p>\u201cI want you in my house, in my bed, at my beck and call. You\u2019ll be here for me night and day for whatever I need until I\u2019m bored with you. Then I\u2019ll set both you and Patsy up in a decent place since apparently you\u2019re homeless at the moment and have nowhere for her to recover,\u201d he told her. He added the last part to drive home her desperate need of his help.</p> <p>He watched her expression as his words registered. Her eyes widened in comprehension and if he would\u2019ve seen only horror in her expression he would\u2019ve backed off but it wasn\u2019t the only thing he saw. He saw passion in her eyes and a quickening of her breath at his words. She wanted him, he was sure of it. He would bet his entire fortune on it. He also knew the moment he won. He saw the slump of her shoulders and she lowered her eyes in defeat.</p><p>\u201cI require an answer, now,\u201d he commanded. He didn\u2019t want to give her any time to change her mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat choice are you giving me?\u201d she yelled at him, as a tear slipped down her cheek. She\u2019d never hated the man more than she did at that moment. How could she not do whatever it took to keep her sister safe? It appeared the man knew everything and if the people at the hospital found out they were currently homeless, they would take Patsy away for sure and she would be placed in foster care. Nicole had managed to do just fine keeping them both safe until Patsy had come down with heart disease.</p><p>They were both survivors and she knew they would get back on their feet again. She only had to guard her heart from falling in love with Ryan all over again. She didn\u2019t know how that was possible if she\u2019d be sleeping with him. Since Ryan, she\u2019d been unable to give her heart or body to any other man.</p><p>Ryan refused to be swayed by her tears. For all he knew, she was letting the water works fall, as all women did, to get her own way. He turned from her and poured himself a shot of bourbon. He knew it was much too early in the day for a drink but it was either that or pull her into his arms and he wanted to save that for later.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll, of course, move in immediately as you have nowhere else to go and you\u2019ll act as if you\u2019re completely over the moon for me when we\u2019re out in public. I think we\u2019ll get along fine as long as you do as I say,\u201d he told her with an expression that said he was completely serious.</p><p>A shudder ran through Nicole. She didn\u2019t know what she was more afraid of, the fake relationship or that she wasn\u2019t horrified to be with him. She should\u2019ve been revolted at the thought of having to stay with him when he was treating her so callously, but she wasn\u2019t. She was grateful Patsy was going to be okay.</p><p>\u201cI need to see my sister,\u201d was all she said to him.</p> <p>\u201cWe can head over there now. Her surgery has already been arranged,\u201d he told her. She snapped her head up at his statement. If he\u2019d already arranged the surgery he must\u2019ve been sure she would say yes. She\u2019d never felt more like a high priced call girl in her life. She\u2019d just sold her soul to the devil but she could live with herself because she\u2019d done it for her sister.</p><p>\u201cYou were so sure of yourself?\u201d she finally said to him, finding some of her backbone once again.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have any doubt you\u2019d put your sister ahead of yourself. After all, you\u2019ve always been willing to self-sacrifice,\u201d he mocked her. She stood up, turned on her heels and left, not knowing where she was heading. She had to get away from him before she slapped the smug look off his face.</p><p>Before she made it more than a few steps, he was there whipping her around to face him. They glared at one another, neither willing to back down.</p><p>\u201cI think the occasion needs to be sealed with a kiss,\u201d he practically purred at her. Before she had any time to react to his statement, his lips pressed down onto hers and her world exploded.</p><p>She refused to open up to him at first but as his tongue flicked along the seam of her lips, she quickly lost her will-power. He pressed her lower back into his body, where she could feel his obvious arousal, causing a gasp to escape her lips, giving him access to her mouth. He dipped his tongue inside and all thoughts of resisting him dissipated.</p><p>His hands ran up and down her quivering body and he had her melting in a matter of seconds. No other man had ever kissed her like Ryan and she was grateful he was holding her up because her legs would\u2019ve given way long ago. Before she knew what she was doing her arms wrapped around his neck to pull him closer and she fell into the kiss with a passion that shocked both of them.</p><p>He continued to love her mouth with his tongue, while his hands worked their own magic on her needy body. She wanted more and wiggled as close as she could possibly get to him. She cursed the clothes that kept them separated.</p><p>He finally pulled away from her and she whimpered her displeasure of him doing so. His glazed eyes came back into focus, as he looked down at her flushed cheeks and beaded nipples, which had been pressed so tightly against him moments before. She started to regain her composure, realizing how wanton she\u2019d acted and he saw the shutters fly over her eyes. He lifted a mocking brow at her, which caused her temper to boil.</p><p>\u201cI think this arrangement will work out just fine, as long as you continue to be such a tempting little thing,\u201d he said to her with mockery in his tone. He was trying to cover up his own powerful reaction to her and he was doing a damn fine job of it.</p><p>\u201cYou really are despicable,\u201d she lashed back at him. He laughed at her temper, all the more turned on by it. Her glare hardened. He released her suddenly and she almost crumbled to the floor. Only her shear will-power kept her standing straight.</p><p>\u201cI may be despicable but you want me and this will be mutually pleasurable,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cOr, I\u2019m just one fine actress,\u201d she said, while smiling sweetly. She then made a very hasty exit when she saw the murderous expression enter his eyes. She locked herself into a bathroom, where she stayed until she had her breathing under control and her features blanked. She wouldn\u2019t let him know how much he affected her. He already had too much power; she couldn\u2019t give him her control too.</p><p>Ryan thought about chasing her down and proving to her there was no way in hell she\u2019d been acting. He\u2019d felt her coming apart in his arms from a simple kiss. When he finally took her to his bed and made her truly his, she would be screaming out his name.</p><p>He would\u2019ve done just that if he was in control of himself. As it was, he could barely stand and was afraid the day ahead would be a painful one. She did things to his body no other woman had ever been able to accomplish. He wanted her and that night he would finally have her. He\u2019d never wanted a day to end so badly.</p><p>When she finally returned to the den, they both looked at one another coolly. He would let her have some space, only because he needed it as well. She gathered her purse and they left for the hospital. He had all day to anticipate the night to come.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cI missed you last night, Nik,\u201d Patsy said when the two of them stepped into the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Hun, I got caught up at work but I came as early as I could this morning,\u201d Nicole said to her sister. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t remember Ryan,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cRyan, is that you?\u201d Patsy asked and a huge smile spread across her hollow features. Ryan couldn\u2019t believe how weak and small she looked. She\u2019d been full of life as a young toddler and though she was beautiful, she looked so ill it nearly brought him to his knees. He sat on the edge of the bed and she eagerly took his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been in so much pain,\u201d Ryan told her with a suspicious tightness in his throat. He tried to clear it, uncomfortable with the feeling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d she told him, almost accusatory.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too, little one, and I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been there for you,\u201d Ryan told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, now,\u201d she said, with a child\u2019s honesty.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he said, surprised by how much he meant the words.</p> <p>\u201cAre you and Nicole together again?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d he simply stated.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cool. Nicole has always loved you,\u201d she said, with the innocence of youth. Ryan looked over at Nicole, who was blushing scarlet. She glared at him and shook her head before turning to her sister.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get your operation, baby,\u201d Nicole told her as tears well up in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Patsy asked with disbelief as she looked from Ryan to Nicole.</p> <p>\u201cReally,\u201d Ryan told her. She held out her arms and he gently pulled her close to him. She was even tinier than he\u2019d originally thought. His heart ached, as he felt her tiny frame through the thin hospital gown.</p><p>Ryan and Nicole sat in her room for hours visiting and keeping her spirits up; until she could no longer stay awake. She fought going to sleep but finally drifted off. Ryan quietly led Nicole from the room.</p><p>No words were spoken as they walked from the hospital. He led her to his car and they made their way back towards his home. She\u2019d been able to dampen down the nerves, while she was visiting with her sister but now she was nervous. She knew he expected her to sleep with him and she didn\u2019t know how to respond to his request.</p><p>They pulled up to the house and there were a couple of cars in the driveway. Ryan blew out a breath of frustration when he spotted the vehicles, giving Nicole a look she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cWell now we are going to test your acting skills. Remember what you agreed to,\u201d he snapped at her, before leading her from the vehicle. She looked at him quizzically and followed him into the house.</p><p>\u201cAbout time you got back Ryan, did you forget about the barbeque?\u201d Derek said, as he stepped around the corner.</p> <p>Nicole got a shock as she saw Derek and Drew, a couple of women and some kids. She stood there like a doe in headlights, not knowing what to say. She hadn\u2019t seen Ryan\u2019s cousins since they were all kids. She\u2019d once loved them so much and although they\u2019d tried speaking to her after her and Ryan broke up she\u2019d found it too painful and cut all ties.</p><p>\u201cIs that you, Nicole? I haven\u2019t seen you in forever. You look great,\u201d Drew said when he realized who was standing next to his cousin. Before she knew what was happening, Drew walked over and engulfed her in a huge bear hug. She felt the tears stinging her eyes at the easy acceptance he offered.</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s this gorgeous woman you\u2019re mauling?\u201d Trinity asked good naturedly.</p><p>\u201cTrinity, this is Nicole. She and Ryan used to be all hot and heavy when we were teenagers. Nicole, this beautiful woman is my wife, Trinity,\u201d Drew introduced them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you, Nicole,\u201d Trinity said and shocked Nicole by stepping forward and giving her a big hug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, too,\u201d Nicole said shyly.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn, stranger,\u201d Derek said and stepped forward lifting her off her feet and spinning her around. \u201cIt\u2019s so great to see you.\u201d Jasmine stepped around the corner and spotted Nicole.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in forever,\u201d she said, throwing her arms around her. Nicole hugged her back, grateful to see a familiar female face. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m great,\u201d Nicole told her. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you and Derek got back together,\u201d she added. She remembered when Derek left and the devastation Jasmine felt. She\u2019d been feeling her own pain from one of the Titan cousins and felt sympathy.</p><p>\u201cYes and it\u2019s been amazing. It looks like these Titan boys are finally waking up,\u201d Jasmine told her with a wink. Nicole didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cYes, Nicole and I ran into each other again and we realized we simply couldn\u2019t live one more second apart,\u201d Ryan said. Nicole thought only she could hear the sarcasm in his tone. She had to fight not to flinch when he gave her a look that seemed to threaten her not to contradict him. She turned away from him, finding it difficult to look into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, we have to catch up and figure out ways to torture these men,\u201d Jasmine said and led the other two women away, leaving the men to watch them go.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going on with you? I adore Nicole, you know that, but I still remember the utter devastation you felt when she walked out of your life,\u201d Drew asked his cousin. Ryan wasn\u2019t ready to tell his cousins the truth. It made him too much of a cad and he didn\u2019t want to see the disapproving look in their eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe ran into each other and realized the spark was still there, so decided to pursue it,\u201d he finally said. He thought they may take exception that in reality he was blackmailing her into his bed. Hell, he\u2019d kick their asses if they did the same thing. It was much easier to notice other people\u2019s flaws than your own and he wanted her too badly to stop what he was doing, even knowing how wrong it was.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s even more gorgeous now than she was as a teenager,\u201d Derek said, with a wiggle of his brows.</p><p>\u201cBack off, you\u2019re a married man,\u201d Ryan told his cousin, feeling an irrational urge to mark his claim. He knew Derek was a happily married man but Ryan found he didn\u2019t like any man making a comment about her. Derek simply laughed at his cousin, before the three of them headed off towards the pool.</p><p>\u201cSo spill Nicole, we want all the juicy details of how you two got together and what you\u2019ve been up to,\u201d Jasmine demanded of Nicole. She actually relaxed, sitting in the presence of a familiar face and a new friend. There was something very reassuring about having women to talk with, who were nice and understanding.</p><p>She found she wanted to spill her guts to them but was afraid Ryan would be furious and then refuse to help her sister. She didn\u2019t think he\u2019d stop the surgery but she wasn\u2019t taking any chances. She still had feelings for Ryan so she could be as honest as possible.</p><p>\u201cMy sister\u2019s in the hospital and I didn\u2019t have anyone to turn to or talk with so I called Ryan. He was there instantly and the minute I saw him again all those old feelings came right back to the surface,\u201d Nicole said in as simple an explanation as she could.</p><p>\u201cYour sister\u2019s in the hospital? What\u2019s wrong with her? How can we help?\u201d Jasmine fired off a bunch of questions with a look of concern on her face. Nicole explained about the heart surgery and before long she was crying with Jasmine and Trinity holding her hands comfortingly. It was so nice to have someone to lean on and simply cry out her heartache. She\u2019d been holding it in for the last several months.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t allowed herself to break down and cry even once, because she knew if she were to let go she wouldn\u2019t be able to pick herself back up again. She realized she wasn\u2019t falling completely apart though. She was actually feeling supported by the two amazing women.</p><p>The men walked in and saw the three teary women and were instantly on alert. They looked at one another in a panic and knelt down.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Baby?\u201d Derek asked with concern.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry, Derek, we\u2019re simply women and this is what we do,\u201d Jasmine told her husband with a watery smile.</p><p>\u201cYou know we have to try and fix it,\u201d Drew added as he rubbed along Trinity\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re the most honorable men we know but we really will be okay,\u201d Trinity told Drew. Ryan stood motionless as he stared at the three women. He didn\u2019t have the right to fix Nicole\u2019s problems as he was responsible for causing half of them. Everything in him said he needed to pull her into his arms and hold her until the tears faded away, though. He had to remember what she\u2019d done to him. Otherwise he was afraid she\u2019d quickly have him wrapped around her finger once more.</p><p>\u201cNow boys, give us more time together, then we\u2019ll start making dinner,\u201d Jasmine said to the men. They reluctantly walked away, though they mumbled to each other about emotional women.</p><p>Jasmine and Trinity continued to comfort Nicole until all the tears ran dry. They slowly pulled themselves together and headed toward the kitchen. There was a household staff who normally cooked but sometimes it was soothing to prepare a meal together.</p><p>\u201cI hear Joshua crying. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Trinity said, walking over to grab her infant from his car seat.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Nicole said with longing. She\u2019d never allowed herself to even think about having a baby. You had to have a relationship first and she didn\u2019t have the time for one.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only three months old. Jasmine and I had our youngest within a few weeks of each other and it\u2019s been great to share the experience,\u201d Trinity told her as she brought her son close to nurse.</p><p>Jasmine pulled her son Mark out of his car seat. He was awake but not hungry yet. Nicole wanted to hold him with an ache that surprised her but she didn\u2019t want to be forward and ask. As if Jasmine could read her mind, she handed over her son and Nicole sighed in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t held such a tiny baby since Patsy was a newborn,\u201d Nicole said in awe, as she rubbed his precious cheek. \u201cHe\u2019s so little,\u201d she added in complete awe.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a lot of work but worth every single minute and Derek is such an attentive and amazing father. He shares the nights with me, making everything perfect. There are many people who are disgusted with us,\u201d Jasmine gushed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know of many men who are up for the three A.M feedings,\u201d Trinity added. \u201cDrew is just as amazing at helping me out. I couldn\u2019t imagine doing this all on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you get to stay at home with them?\u201d Nicole asked.</p><p>\u201cWe own a shop together but only spend minimal time there and the babies always come with us. Ryan built us an amazing nursery and a play structure for the older kids. We get to have a business that\u2019s ours. We take pride in it but still get to be the kind of mothers we want to be,\u201d Trinity told her. Nicole was filled with a bit of envy, which she instantly felt guilty about.</p><p>It would be so heavenly to not have any worries and get to be a full-time mother. She felt more like a mom to Patsy, instead of a big sister and she wished she\u2019d been able to be with her more but she always worked hard to keep a roof over their heads and the supplies Patsy needed to get a good education. She\u2019d spend every free moment with her though, which was another reason she didn\u2019t date. She really had a full plate.</p><p>The sad thing was she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever get to hold her own child in her arms. Maybe someday she thought wistfully. The women continued to visit and Nicole got her baby fix, holding little Mark in her arms.</p><p>The men slowly walked into the kitchen like it was a war zone. They were afraid the women were going to send them away again and the alpha males didn\u2019t like the feeling of being told to go away. They crept through the doorway and there was an audible sigh of relief from all three men when they saw the women laughing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They once again looked at each other as if they really couldn\u2019t understand the complicated minds of women. One minute they were sobbing together and the next laughing as if all was right in the world.</p><p>\u201cCan we help you with anything?\u201d Derek questioned. The girls looked up, as if surprised to see the guys standing there.</p><p>\u201cYou can get the steak going. The rest of this food will be ready before you know it,\u201d Trinity told them. They grabbed the marinated steaks and made a quick exit. The girls giggled at the guy\u2019s haste.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s terrible to play with them but sometimes it\u2019s simply way too much fun not to,\u201d Jasmine said with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Trinity said. Nicole nodded, although she was afraid to play with Ryan. She had a feeling if she tried to play she was going to get seriously burned. She put it out of her mind and simply enjoyed her time of peace in a world, which had been shattered for many years.</p><p>They all enjoyed a wonderful meal, then sat by a fire, where Nicole found herself laughing more than she\u2019d ever done in her life. The cousins were certainly entertaining and Nicole forgot, for a small moment in time, how much stress she was under. When it was past midnight, the family headed out she was uncomfortably aware she was alone with Ryan. She didn\u2019t know how to behave, or what to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really tired, so if you could tell me where I\u2019m sleeping I\u2019ll leave you alone,\u201d she mumbled at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be sleeping in my bed again but this time I won\u2019t lay awake half the night in frustration,\u201d he growled at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping in your bed, Ryan,\u201d she said with her own rising temper. He couldn\u2019t force her to sleep with him. Ryan glared at her and slowly stood up. He seemed more of a predator than she\u2019d ever seen before. She was somewhat terrified but more aroused than she would ever admit. He was an impressively masculine man and with that look of desire, mixed with fury in his eyes her stomach turned into a quivering mass.</p><p>Ryan slowly started stalking towards her and she couldn\u2019t help herself from slowly retreating. She wanted to stand firm but she was too afraid of what would happen if he touched her. She wasn\u2019t convinced of her own will-power.</p><p>\u201cRyan you need to back off, I know we have an agreement but I\u2019m tired and not ready to share your bed yet,\u201d Nicole tried to reason with him, still backing away as he made a steady advance toward her. He said nothing as he continued to stalk her, as if she really was his prey. He didn\u2019t speed up, he didn\u2019t yell. He did nothing but follow her.</p><p>She looked behind her and realized he was backing her into a corner. She knew it was the chicken\u2019s way out but she didn\u2019t care. If she didn\u2019t flee the room and really soon, he was going to grab her and she knew if that happened she\u2019d be lost.</p><p>She noticed the table to her left and made a dash around it and started running from the room. She could call herself a chicken later. Her only thought was getting into another room, one with a lock where she would in no way be tempted to let him take her to bed.</p><p>She made it to the bottom of the stairs, when his fingers locked around her wrist. He whipped her around, jerking her body against his and smiled in triumph, only seconds before his mouth fell on hers. She was panting from her short sprint, leaving her mouth open to his probing tongue. She gasped aloud as his tongue stroked her mouth, causing liquid fire to burn through her veins.</p><p>She\u2019d kissed him countless times as a teenager but it had in no way prepared her for the kiss of a man. He was devastating her system in a matter of seconds. She tried to pull out of his arms. She tried to regain her composure but he was touching her in a way that left all thoughts from her mind. Suddenly he picked her up in his arms, while continuing to love her mouth. She was losing all will of saying no to the man.</p><p>He carried them quickly up the stairs and before Nicole knew what was happening, he was laying her down on the bed and her clothes were stripped away. Ryan laid alongside her, quickly taking her back in his arms and once again locking his lips down on hers.</p><p>She needed to stop him. She needed to let him know she wasn\u2019t ready. She needed to gain the will-power to stop but she couldn\u2019t do it. She couldn\u2019t even think, let alone find the strength to deny him and herself.</p><p>Ryan released her mouth, only to trail his lips down her neck and run his tongue along the mounds of her breasts. By the time he finally clasped her aching nipple into his mouth, her entire body jerked off the bed. She was done with any protests she\u2019d thought about issuing. He ran his tongue over her nipples and she could feel the tightening in her stomach and the wetness in her core. Her body was preparing for his entrance and she wanted him more than she wanted anything else.</p><p>He was making her feel completely possessed with his domination of her body. She was weak to his every command. He continued circling her chest with his tongue and she could do nothing but moan in pleasure, as her hands rubbed over his body. She could feel the slight sheen of sweat on his skin, which only turned her on more, to witness his loss of ever present control. She\u2019d brought him to a state of arousal with nothing more than her responses to him.</p><p>She could feel his impressive erection pressing into her thigh and her body squirmed underneath him, needing to feel him press against her core. She needed him to join them together and she couldn\u2019t wait much longer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do this since the first kiss we shared,\u201d he confided to her in a ragged voice. His tone made her squirm even more. He was on the edge of control and she didn\u2019t mind being the one to push him over the cliff.</p><p>He brought his lips back to hers and kissed her so tenderly, she was washed away with emotions. How could he be so cold and calculating one moment and kiss her as if she was the most precious thing in the universe the next. If she hadn\u2019t already been past the point of no return that kiss would\u2019ve done it.</p><p>He pressed the head of his erection against her slick opening and she could feel the heat burning in her aching core. \u201cPlease,\u201d she begged him, when he still wouldn\u2019t thrust inside her.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer,\u201d he growled at her. He wanted to make it good for her, he wanted to make sure she was ready for him but he\u2019d wanted her for so long and hadn\u2019t been with any other in months and there was no way he could drag out their lovemaking.</p><p>He lifted her leg, pushing it behind his back, opening her up fully for him. He could feel her heat against his head and it was making his entire body break out in a sweat, trying to maintain his control. He\u2019d never before lost control over his body with any other woman.</p><p>She gasped aloud at the intense pleasure washing through her and jerked her hips, trying to get him to enter her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need any more prompting. With one quick thrust, he buried himself fully in her. She tensed as his entire girth filled her fully, causing a brief moment of pain.</p><p>Ryan groaned at the tightness of her body gripping him. He couldn\u2019t believe how hard she was holding onto him. It sent him over the rest of the edge of sanity and after a small pause, he pulled out of her and thrust back in, faster with each move. He was out of control as he gripped her hips, raising her higher so he could sink even further inside.</p><p>After the initial shock of him filling her up, Nicole felt nothing but pleasure and soon lifted her hips up to meet his thrusts. She could feel her body tightening more and more with each thrust inside of her.</p><p>Suddenly a pleasure unlike anything she\u2019d ever felt before was gripping her body. She cried out as the lightening shot through her core, up through her stomach and down each limb. She was shaking from head to toe, as the orgasm kept rippling through her in spasm after spasm.</p><p>Her clenching heat was all it took to send Ryan over the edge and within seconds he was buried deep inside her, shooting his pleasure deep within her core. He pumped into her for longer than he\u2019d ever done before, then collapsed against her body, not having the energy to move a limb. She\u2019d completely drained him.</p><p>He realized he must be crushing her and managed to turn them both on their sides with their bodies still connected. They slid along one another since they both had a sheen of sweat all over their bodies. They were both panting as if they\u2019d run a marathon. Nicole couldn\u2019t believe how amazing an experience that had been and was almost regretful she\u2019d waited so long. She had a feeling it wouldn\u2019t have been the same with any other man except Ryan. She\u2019d never felt such intense emotions for any other man but him, which was most likely how she\u2019d managed to remain a virgin well into her twenties.</p><p>Ryan finally pulled out of her body and she felt as if she lost a piece of herself. She grumbled at him, which caused a chuckle to escape his throat. She tensed at his laughter but she was so tired, she couldn\u2019t manage to pull away or even open her eyes to glare at him.</p><p>She would allow herself to lie there for a few more moments before she got up and found another bed. She may have caved into the sex but she wouldn\u2019t give him her heart or soul. If she slept with him nightly she was afraid he would get both of those things. She fell asleep with those frightening thoughts on her mind.</p><p>Ryan woke up and found himself alone in the bed and wasn\u2019t happy about it. He\u2019d left the bed of many clingy women but found he didn\u2019t like being the one left. He threw the covers off him, getting ready to track Nicole down and bring her back. He got up and twisted around and then his heartbeat stopped.</p><p>He looked closer at the bed and saw the blood. Had he hurt her without knowing? The thought was incomprehensible. He thought about their lovemaking. He\u2019d taken her a bit roughly and noticed her tensing but assumed it may have been a while for her, so he\u2019d given her a few moments to adjust to him. He knew she was unbelievably tight but she couldn\u2019t possibly have been a virgin. There was no way a woman could reach her age without losing her innocence but the evidence was staring him straight in the face.</p><p>His legs wouldn\u2019t support him so he sunk down on the bed in shock. He\u2019d thought she\u2019d dumped him as a teenager to explore her options and date guys she thought were better than him and he\u2019d been filled with rage. As he thought back he realized he hadn\u2019t seen her with one other guy after him. He\u2019d been so angry with her he\u2019d never thought much about it.</p><p>There had to be another explanation for the blood because there was no way she\u2019d been innocent. He threw it from his mind because the other option made him far too much of a jerk. He couldn\u2019t face that. She\u2019d been the one to dump him without ever looking back and she deserved to suffer a bit. It wasn\u2019t like she wasn\u2019t getting to live in the lap of luxury, so she was getting something out of the arrangement as well. He went to hunt her down, so she would be perfectly aware of where she belonged. She could leave his bed when he was ready for her to do so.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Nicole was abruptly awakened by a very angry looking Ryan. She\u2019d woken up after the second time he\u2019d taken her in the middle of the night and had waited for him to fall asleep, before she\u2019d snuck from his bed, to find another room. It hadn\u2019t been hard, as the place seemed to have an endless supply of spare rooms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing in here?\u201d he demanded of her, after staring down at her in silence for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to sleep,\u201d she snapped back and turned over and lay back down, shutting her eyes. Ryan was furious with her. How dare she not only leave his bed but then have the gall to ignore him when he was trying to speak to her?</p><p>He ripped the blanket off her body, which caused her to sit straight up in bed, no longer pretending to be sleepy. She glared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be sleeping all night in my bed,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep where I want to,\u201d she stated right back at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most insufferable woman I\u2019ve ever met in my life. Did you forget we have an agreement? Did you think I\u2019d simply fork out a ton of my own money, set you up in my home and get nothing in return?\u201d he demanded of her. She flinched at his words and the rage behind them.</p><p>\u201cYou got what you wanted last night,\u201d she finally spat at him, still humiliated she\u2019d so easily caved into him. A shiver ran down her spine as she thought about the way she\u2019d responded to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll continue to get what I want and what I want is you in my bed every night, all night,\u201d he told her as he leaned down on the bed in front of her. She glared back at him, with her arms crossed against her chest. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d he asked her, only inches from her face.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she spat, willing to say about anything to get him to back off and give her some breathing space. He smiled triumphantly and closed the space between them. She gasped in shock at the passion of the kiss and before she had time to react, he pulled away and walked from the room.</p> <p>Nicole sat there trembling on the bed. She wasn\u2019t sure if she was relieved he\u2019d left, or not. She couldn\u2019t deny she wanted him but that was natural, as she\u2019d been head over heels in love with him at one of the darkest times in her life. She\u2019d depended on him and needed him and she\u2019d ended up having to let him go, for fear of him pitying her. There would\u2019ve been nothing worse.</p><p>She slowly got up and headed back to his room to find her clothing. It was mercifully in the closet. She looked at her few pathetic items and hung her head down. She\u2019d been living with only a few outfits for as long as she could remember. Her sister\u2019s needs had been so much more important than her own. Patsy had never been aware of the sacrifices she\u2019d made because there was no reason for her to know. Nicole was only doing what any sister should do in her circumstances.</p><p>Nicole made her way downstairs and headed straight for the food. She was once again starving and filled her plate. She ate a bit more than she had the day before but her stomach was still not used to having a full meal. There was a secure feeling in knowing she would have a warm meal in the morning. She would rather have that guarantee than a full dinner.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get going, so we can see Patsy before she\u2019s taken into surgery,\u201d Ryan told her. She stuffed the toast in her mouth and jumped up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she told him through her mouthful of food and walked toward the front door. Ryan followed her and they had a silent drive to the hospital. Nicole had to tell herself she was doing the right thing and nothing else mattered except for her sister getting better. It was hard to remember anything when she was in the small space with Ryan, though.</p><p>His scent invaded her senses and caused her stomach to tighten with need. Even when she was mad at him, she still wanted to be near him and she still wanted to feel his touch. She tried to convince herself she was simply exhausted and when her sister was better she wouldn\u2019t feel the pull toward him. She\u2019d worried about everything for so long she needed some worry free days. Her body needed time to recharge itself.</p> <p>Patsy was alert and nervous when they stepped into her room. It took a while for them to calm her down, especially considering Nicole was just as nervous as Patsy was. When they wheeled her into the surgery room Nicole couldn\u2019t say a word. She was close to bursting into tears.</p><p>\u201cThe surgery\u2019s going to take a couple of hours so why don\u2019t we go out to lunch. You need to get your mind off of what\u2019s going on,\u201d Ryan suggested as they walked towards the waiting area.</p><p>\u201cNo, I need to be here in case the doctor comes out,\u201d she said in almost a panic.</p><p>\u201cWe can stay, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he offered. They stepped through the doors and Nicole was dazed to find his family sitting in there. It was all of them, including his cousins, their spouses and both of his uncles. The women jumped up and immediately threw their arms around her, causing the tears she refused to let fall, come cascading down her cheeks. She was scared and very happy to let Jasmine and Trinity comfort her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she finally managed to ask them. After all, Patsy wasn\u2019t related to them. She was more than grateful for their presence, though.</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t let you go through this on your own,\u201d Jasmine said, as if she was crazy to think anything differently. Nicole was more than willing to accept their love and support and continued to cry all her fears into their arms.</p><p>Ryan found himself a third wheel and didn\u2019t like the feeling. He should be the one who she was turning to. It should have been his shoulder she was crying into. He wanted to kick himself when he had those thoughts because he normally hated clingy, emotional women and ran the second they behaved in that manner.</p><p>The men pulled him out of the room and walked him to the caf\u00e9 to get some much needed coffee. None of them said anything, just drank some coffee and let the girls have some needed time together. Not one of them could possibly understand the female mind and felt safer at a distance, so they didn\u2019t accidentally say something that may land them in hot water.</p> <p>When they\u2019d let enough time pass, they finally made their way back to the room with coffee and donuts to share. The women managed to get Nicole to drink the coffee but no amount of pleading would get her to eat. Ryan was relieved the tears had at least dried up. He didn\u2019t know how to handle them.</p><p>The hours waiting for the doctor to come back in were the longest of Nicole\u2019s life. She paced up and down the hallways, waiting for him to bring her any information. She needed to know her baby sister was going to be okay and she wouldn\u2019t feel better until that moment. Ryan tried to get her to eat something but there was no way she could keep any food down. The breakfast she\u2019d eaten was sitting uneasily in her stomach and she feared she was going to vomit all over the pristine floors.</p><p>\u201cMs. Lander,\u201d a doctor said, as he stepped into the room. She whipped her head around and looked at him with both fear and hope. Nothing could\u2019ve happened to Patsy. She wouldn\u2019t survive it.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said barely above a whisper. She was terrified but needed to know.</p><p>\u201cYour sister is out of surgery and it looks like everything will be fine. The next few hours are critical but it looks like your sister is going to make a full recovery,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she sobbed and threw her arms around the doctor, clinging tightly to him. He patted her back and whispered reassurances. She was so relieved the nightmare seemed to finally be over. She had to see for herself she was alive and breathing.</p><p>Nicole didn\u2019t know when Patsy was transferred but she noticed her sister was being held by Ryan. The doctor was nowhere to be seen. He was rubbing her back and whispering reassuring words to her. She finally managed to pull herself together and was led into Patsy\u2019s recovery room.</p><p>Ryan sent the rest of the family home, as Patsy wouldn\u2019t be awake more than minutes at a time. There wasn\u2019t any point in them staying there. They reluctantly left and exhaustion took over Nicole as she lay in the chair next to Patsy\u2019s bed. She fell asleep for the first time in a long while, with peace in her heart.</p><p>The night was long, with Patsy only waking for short periods of time. Every time the nurses came in to check on her they assured both Nicole and Ryan, who also refused to leave, she was healing fine and it looked like she would be okay. Nicole wouldn\u2019t completely believe them until she walked out of the hospital but she was happy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming out with us today. You\u2019ve done nothing but sit here and worry about your sister and she\u2019s fine. She has a million magazines, doctors and nurses at her beck and call and food being brought in. You, on the other hand, look like you haven\u2019t eaten in a month, have dark circles under your eyes and are in desperate need of a manicure,\u201d Jasmine said to Nicole.</p><p>Nicole stared at the two women before her, feeling slightly shell shocked. They were trying to get her to leave the hospital room but she would feel so guilty doing so. Patsy needed her there and she had an irrational fear if she left her side something would happen to her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave her,\u201d she pled with them.</p><p>\u201cNicole we simply aren\u2019t taking no for an answer. You can either walk out of here with us, or we will get the guys to come and drag you out but you\u2019re going out for a day of much needed pampering,\u201d Trinity said.</p><p>\u201cGo with them Nicole. You have been amazing and I love you to pieces but you need to take care of yourself and not just me all the time. Now get out of here and I\u2019ll tell the doctors you aren\u2019t allowed back in until tomorrow,\u201d Patsy told her.</p><p>\u201cPatsy, you don\u2019t mean that, you need me here,\u201d Nicole said, a little hurt by her sisters words.</p><p>\u201cI do need you and I love you more than anything. I know how much you sacrifice for me and how much you have always given up for me. Get the shocked look off your face, I\u2019m not blind. You make sacrifices every day to take care of me and I love and appreciate you even more for that but please take care of yourself. Now get out and I mean it when I say you aren\u2019t allowed back until tomorrow,\u201d Patsy reinforced.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never a sacrifice because I love you,\u201d Nicole told her.</p><p>\u201cYou heard your sister, let\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Jasmine said.</p><p>\u201cI guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt to get out for a few hours,\u201d Nicole conceded. Both women nodded encouragingly to her. She gathered her purse and made sure Patsy was properly covered before reluctantly following the women from the room.</p><p>\u201cFirst thing we are doing is getting you a hot lunch,\u201d Trinity said.</p><p>\u201cThen, we\u2019re going to the salon for manicures and pedicures,\u201d Jasmine added.</p><p>\u201cAfter all that fun we\u2019re doing some shopping and don\u2019t you dare shake your head at me. It looks as if you haven\u2019t pampered yourself in a long time. I\u2019ve demanded Ryan\u2019s credit card and your day\u2019s on him. Seriously, you\u2019ve got to quit shaking your head at me. The man isn\u2019t going to go broke because you purchase a few outfits,\u201d Trinity said.</p><p>Nicole was thinking there was no way she was going to spend Ryan\u2019s money. He\u2019d already forked out an arm and a leg on Patsy\u2019s operation but she could live with that because it wasn\u2019t for her. She didn\u2019t find it acceptable to have him buying her personal clothing, though.</p><p>\u201cWe can argue about it more once you\u2019re fed and pampered, then I\u2019ll feel better winning because my opponent doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s about to blow over in a small wind,\u201d Jasmine said with a smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The three women ate an amazing lunch, which had Nicole groaning and wishing she could unbutton her jeans. On the way to the salon, she realized that she\u2019d never had either a pedicure or manicure and the thought of that luxury was out of the world. She sat back in the plush chair, while a woman rubbed lotion over her feet and knew in that moment she\u2019d died and gone to heaven. If there was a greater pleasure in life she wasn\u2019t sure what it was.</p><p>\u201cOkay that was a slice of heaven, now let\u2019s do some shopping,\u201d Trinity said with a pleased look on her face.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, the lunch and the salon were amazing and I really am feeling much better but Ryan and I have just started seeing each other and I\u2019m not comfortable with him buying me clothes,\u201d Nicole told them. She couldn\u2019t tell them she was basically selling herself to the man for her sister\u2019s operation.</p><p>\u201cNicole, we can do this the easy way or the hard way,\u201d Jasmine once again threatened.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we wander around and I can be with you guys while you get new things,\u201d Nicole tried to compromise. The two women smiled at each other and dragged her off toward some fancy store.</p><p>Nicole ran her hands along the silk of some gowns and knew it was all beyond her normal price range. She wouldn\u2019t even be able to afford a pair of panties in a store like the one the girls had brought her to. When Patsy graduated and she was able to get some more education, maybe she\u2019d be able to spoil herself a bit but that would be several years away. She really didn\u2019t mind the menial sacrifices though, as long as her sister turned out okay. It would be a miracle considering the parents they were unfortunate enough to have received.</p><p>\u201cDerek and I are throwing a masquerade ball and you need a stunning gown for it,\u201d Jasmine told her.</p><p>\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t go to a party and leave Patsy, anyway,\u201d Nicole said with reluctance. The thought of going to a large party was very appealing, especially all dressed up. It would be really nice to feel like a princess for a night but she couldn\u2019t justify spending the funds.</p><p>\u201cPatsy will be well taken care of and it would truly hurt my feelings if you didn\u2019t come,\u201d Jasmine said, sealing Nicole\u2019s fate. She wouldn\u2019t want to hurt either of the two women who\u2019d been so good to her.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt to get one dress but seriously it doesn\u2019t have to be extravagant,\u201d Nicole conceded. Both Jasmine and Trinity squealed with delight and by the end of their shopping day Nicole was regretting those few simple words.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how the women had managed it but she ended walking from the stores with several bags and the most stunning dress she\u2019d ever seen. She\u2019d felt like amazing when she tried it on. She couldn\u2019t imagine how she was going to feel when her hair was all done and she had on the heels and accessories. She was looking forward to the masquerade but she was terrified to know how much she\u2019d spent. She was determined to pay every cent back.</p><p>Trinity and Jasmine had refused to let her see any of the totals but she would tell Ryan she wanted to know the amount and she would pay him back. She wouldn\u2019t allow him to refuse her. She felt too much like a call-girl, with him buying her clothes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your dress and accessories back to my place. I want you to come over early so we can all get ready together,\u201d Jasmine told her. She\u2019d still not let her see what she\u2019d bought to go with the dress.</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d Nicole told her. By the time they headed back to the hospital, Nicole realized she\u2019d had an amazing day but she was certainly exhausted. The women left her and she quickly fell asleep in the cot the staff had brought in for her.</p><p>It was her first night to sleep soundly, the whole night, since the surgery. She was grateful Patsy had been sound asleep herself, or she figured her little sister would\u2019ve carried through on her threat and made her leave until the morning. Nicole would\u2019ve been too stressed to sleep at the house and besides she was trying to avoid Ryan. She really didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be able to resist him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, you can really stop fussing over me now,\u201d Patsy said, with some impatience with her overprotective sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m simply worried about you. You did have major surgery and are finally safe and sound and out of that horrible hospital,\u201d Nicole told her little sister with all the patience of a saint. Patsy had been in a dreadful mood the last few days and was incredibly sick of laying in bed. She\u2019d always been an active child and she was thoroughly sick of bed rest.</p><p>\u201cRemember your doctor said you can\u2019t overdo it, only mild walks and no school for at least another month,\u201d Nicole reminded her.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I have you here to remind me,\u201d Patsy told her with a sincere smile. She may be grumpy but she knew her sister was only trying to make sure she\u2019d be okay.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d Nicole told her, fighting back the tears.</p><p>\u201cI love you too sis, now go relax for a while. I promise you I won\u2019t melt away while I sit here and watch a movie,\u201d Patsy told her. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we are in this amazing house and I really hope we get to stay for a while,\u201d she added.</p><p>Patsy had been just as amazed of Ryan\u2019s home as Nicole had initially been. She\u2019d stayed there for a little over two weeks now though and had adjusted to the palatial place. For Patsy, it was all brand new and she wanted to explore everything. She was still getting winded too easily though, and had to take it easy. Nicole was going to make sure she did indeed relax.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ryan snapped at his poor receptionist when she buzzed him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt you Mr. Titan but you have a call on line one,\u201d she said to him. His entire office staff had gone out of their way to avoid him over the last two weeks. He\u2019d been a bear to be around and he couldn\u2019t seem to stop himself.</p><p>Nicole had been living with him for a couple weeks and he hadn\u2019t been alone with her since the night her sister had gone in for surgery. She\u2019d stayed night and day at the hospital and though he\u2019d wanted to drag her from the room by her hair and insist she share his bed he couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>He convinced himself he was only thinking about Patsy and didn\u2019t care about what Nicole had actually needed. Even though he wanted his revenge on her he couldn\u2019t hurt her as bad as he would\u2019ve been by making her leave her sister. Nicole had only started to look better in the last few days. She was finally sleeping and her skin was getting a healthy flush to it. It would feel much better to challenge her if she was able to give as well as she got.</p><p>Patsy had finally been moved to Ryan\u2019s house that afternoon and Nicole would be back in his bed. Maybe after he satisfied his needs, he\u2019d stop snapping at every person who dared to even look at him.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said shortly and took the call. He barely managed to be civil to the man on the other end of the line and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he didn\u2019t call back for a very long time. Ryan gave up on work and headed out the door. He was in no state to be around decent people.</p><p>His driver got him home in record time, since there wasn\u2019t any rush hour traffic to deal with. He slipped inside and worked the rest of the day from his home office. He didn\u2019t trust himself to be around Nicole yet because he was sure she was tending her sister and it wouldn\u2019t be good for Patsy\u2019s heart to watch her sister be ravished right in front of her. Man, he was acting like a horny teenager.</p><p>His door opened and he was about to growl at the person who dared to interrupt him, when Derek stepped in through the door. He still grumbled a bit at his cousin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up your burr?\u201d Derek asked with a laugh. Ryan ignored the question.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Derek?\u201d he asked instead. He knew he was being rude but his arrangement with Nicole was seriously killing him. He was supposed to have her in his bed every night and so far all he\u2019d gotten was one night in two weeks.</p><p>\u201cI was just coming to remind you about the party tomorrow night,\u201d Derek said, barely able to suppress his humor at his cousin\u2019s mood.</p><p>\u201cI did forget about that. I don\u2019t know if I can make it with Patsy just getting here,\u201d Ryan said. He was certainly in no mood to be at a party and he was sure he wouldn\u2019t be able to drag Nicole away.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s too bad because then you\u2019re going to miss out on Nicole looking hot and sexy,\u201d Derek said, knowing he would get a reaction out of his cousin. Ryan\u2019s head flew up in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think she would be willing to part from her sister, even though I have round the clock care for her,\u201d Ryan grumbled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already over at the house. Jasmine insisted she and Trinity stay the night so they could do the whole beauty thing together,\u201d Derek said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cCrap, I feel out of the loop, I didn\u2019t even know she\u2019d left. Her and I are going to have a serious talk,\u201d Ryan said, a bit of a threat in his tone.</p><p>\u201cSounds as if you\u2019re being knocked off your feet by a woman,\u201d Derek told him, with far too smug of a look on his face. Ryan simply glared at him, until Derek chuckled. He then went over and helped himself to a generous amount of Ryan\u2019s best bourbon.</p><p>\u201cWell, Drew is on his way over. We figured if the girls were kicking us out, then we would make it a guy\u2019s night,\u201d Derek told him. \u201cSo put your work away and let\u2019s go out to the grease joint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Ryan agreed. Drew showed up and the men headed out. Being with his cousins helped his mood slightly but he knew he wasn\u2019t going to feel better until he had Nicole back in his bed again. He couldn\u2019t wait until he got her out of his system for good.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cSo I know it\u2019s completely over the top but we have a hair stylist and a make-up artist coming in tomorrow. I want to wow my husband and I have spared no expense,\u201d Jasmine said, with a giggle.</p><p>Nicole\u2019s eyes widened at the amount of money this family seemed to have. She couldn\u2019t imagine ever being comfortable having someone hired to come in and do her hair and make-up. That was for movie stars and models, of which she was neither. She felt way in over her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got all the beauty products we need for tonight. It\u2019s a good thing you sent your husband away, otherwise he\u2019d go screaming from the house,\u201d Trinity said, as she produced a large bag and emptied the contents onto the kitchen table.</p><p>Nicole picked up a few of the products, having no clue what they were for. There were facial masks, lotions, essential oils and body scrubs. She had the feeling her body was going to be completely raw come morning.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head up to my room to apply the masks. We can do the paraffin wax on our hands and feet, next. After that we\u2019ll take bathes and turn our skin to silk,\u201d Jasmine said, as she quickly started putting all the things back in the bag. The two women dragged Nicole up the stairs for their night of beauty to begin.</p><p>Nicole had never had such an amazing night and never wanted it to end. After several hours of beauty treatment her skin felt like smooth satin and her face was still tingling from whatever they\u2019d plastered all over her. She felt attractive and mellow and she was incredibly nervous for the next day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The women didn\u2019t get to sleep until after two in the morning, sleeping until noon. It was a luxury she\u2019d never before allowed herself. When she awoke, the day began in earnest and she was plucked and waxed and twisted in every imaginable way.</p><p>She was now standing before a full length mirror and didn\u2019t recognize the person staring back at her. The dress was stunning and showed off every one of her curves to perfection and the accessories Jasmine and Trinity had added were over the top. She really felt like a princess about to enter her first ball. Jasmine had insisted on her borrowing some jewelry and Nicole was terrified one of the huge sapphires was going to fall from her ears. She didn\u2019t want to even think about the cost of them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most stunning creature. When Ryan see\u2019s you tonight he\u2019s going to have a heart attack. Beyond that, every man in the room will be determined to whisk you away from him. I can\u2019t wait to see his face,\u201d Trinity said, coming up to stand beside her.</p><p>Nicole thought she was the one who was stunning. Both Trinity and Jasmine were beyond gorgeous in their gowns and jewelry. No one would ever be able to guess they\u2019d both had children because it certainly didn\u2019t show in their perfect figures. Nicole never would\u2019ve realized she was equally as devastating.</p> <p>When the women finally made their entrance into the hall, wearing their jeweled masks, every head in the place turned to watch. The three cousins sucked in air, which wasn\u2019t released for some time. They were the most stunning women in the room.</p><p>Nicole looked around the huge room and wondered how the women had talked her into going to the party. She wanted to turn around and leave the instant she saw all the fancily dressed people filling up the place, all wearing masks. She was so out of her league. She really did underestimate her own beauty.</p><p>Jasmine and Trinity were whisked away by their husbands, leaving Nicole standing their feeling foolish. Ryan wasn\u2019t approaching her, which she figured was most likely a good thing but she was also too insecure to handle being all alone.</p><p>She turned to leave, when someone tugged on her arm. \u201cIs that you, Nicole?\u201d a voice asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. She couldn\u2019t figure out who was speaking to her. The masks certainly hid one\u2019s identity but she should still be able to have an inkling of who the person was.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Stephanie, we went to school together, remember?\u201d she said and Nicole then knew exactly who it was. They\u2019d been friends for years but like everyone else she\u2019d once been close to she\u2019d lost contact.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so great to see you Stephanie, it\u2019s been too many years,\u201d Nicole said, truly meaning her words. It was nice to see another familiar face in a crowd of strangers. Stephanie gave her a hug.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let this party intimidate you, Jasmine would never invite anyone who was too horrible,\u201d Stephanie reassured her.</p><p>\u201cI know but I feel too old to be at a dance,\u201d Nicole told her self-consciously.</p><p>\u201cSeriously you need to live a little bit, once in a while is my philosophy. I remember from school you were far more likely to study than attend a dance, so let go and pretend you have no responsibilities for a night. Most people won\u2019t even recognize you and you look beyond gorgeous, so stop worrying about things and allow yourself to have a great time,\u201d Stephanie told her.</p><p>Nicole knew Stephanie was right. What made anyone in the room any better than her? Ryan was insisting she hang on his arm at certain events like arm candy so she\u2019d better get used to it. Besides, just because the other people in the room were blessed with more money than they needed didn\u2019t make them any better than her.</p> <p>A lot of the people were from money and hadn\u2019t worked an honest day in their lives. She didn\u2019t mean Jasmine and Derek. They were the nicest people she\u2019d ever known. She could see from the looks of some of the guests it was all about who had the most expensive things and that was a huge turn off for Nicole.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off to find some sexy man to whisk me off to paradise,\u201d Stephanie told her. \u201cI\u2019ll look for you later, it really was great to see you,\u201d she added and hugged Nicole.</p><p>Stephanie took off in one direction and left Nicole to wander around to a quiet corner. She grabbed a plate and swiped some food. She was starving and the smells from the food were making her stomach growl. She was used to eating top ramen, or a good soup, when she was really lucky, so the table full of delicacies\u2019 was making her practically drool.</p><p>She was still living each day as if she was on her last meal. It was how it had been for too many years to remember anything different. She loaded her plate to overflowing, then snuck off to a corner and started shoveling it in, praying no one noticed her. She was certainly not acting like any of the other women who\u2019d never eat at a function, in fear of gaining a pound or getting something stuck between their teeth.</p><p>Ryan was standing in a group of people, desperately trying to keep up with the boring conversation but his eyes were following Nicole everywhere she went. He was trying to maintain some distance from her but the second he\u2019d spotted her in the figure hugging gown, his groin had jumped to life and he\u2019d known he was far better off to avoid her for a while. He certainly approved of whatever the girls had been up to the night before.</p><p>He half listened to what his companions were talking about. He nodded where he was supposed to and uttered a comment here and there but his eyes never left Nicole. He felt his lips tilt, as he noticed her flick her eyes around the room guiltily, then fill her plate to overflowing. If he had any doubts she wasn\u2019t one of the high society women normally at the parties her full plate would\u2019ve clued him in. He was thinking he was going to play a game with her that night.</p><p>Why not start from scratch and pretend to be strangers? He could romance her and add some mystery to their relationship. Nothing else seemed to be working to keep her mind off her worries, so why not spice things up, he thought. He was getting more excited by the moment, imagining how things were going to end that night.</p><p>Ryan watched as she glanced around again and seemed to sigh a bit as she didn\u2019t think anyone was watching her.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d almost refused to come to the masquerade. His mood lightened up considerably. As he looked around he noticed all the women wearing their usual skimpy designer dresses and ostentatious jewelry.</p><p>Even though it was a masquerade and everyone was supposed to disguise themselves, the women wanted to be noticed and most held masques on sticks, so they could move them aside. He was personally wearing a Zorro mask but it hadn\u2019t taken the barracuda women long to figure out who he was and they were swarming him. They would be shocked to find who he chose to take home with him. Most of the people in the room knew nothing of his past.</p><p>\u201cRyan, you didn\u2019t hear a word I just said,\u201d the grating voice of the current female trying to hold his attention said to him. She\u2019d been giving him signals for months she was readily available and looking for her next husband to keep her in the lifestyle she was so accustomed. He hadn\u2019t wanted to be rude to her but he had a feeling he was going to have to spell it out in black and white, he wasn\u2019t interested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my mind was on business,\u201d he easily lied, soothing her feelings. She gave her best fake smile and rubbed her barely covered breasts up against his arm. He felt nothing from the touch. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to leave you ladies but I\u2019m going for a bite to eat, then I have business to discuss with Tom,\u201d he said, as he pulled away from the group.</p><p>\u201cYou know how to find us when you\u2019re ready to play instead of talk business,\u201d another woman pouted at him. He couldn\u2019t even remember her name. He needed to make it known soon he was no longer available, although he knew that wouldn\u2019t stop most of the women he was used to dealing with. He walked away and forgot all about them as soon as he left.</p><p>He kept his eyes on Nicole, feeling a clenching in his gut, as he tried to figure out what she was thinking of the party. He knew it was so far removed from her normal life she was most likely uncomfortable.</p><p>He was stopped several times on his way over towards her and had to fight to not growl at the continued interruptions. He wanted to get to her before she decided to slip away. He wouldn\u2019t be able to play out his game if she were to run away and change. After all it was a masquerade; the night was about secrets and romance.</p><p>He ignored the next couple of people who tried to stop him and made a beeline toward Nicole. Damn, she was so unlike the stick figure women surrounding him. She had on a fitted black dress, showing off her luscious hips and impressive breasts to perfection. Her stomach was flat and her legs seemed to go on forever. She was wearing a pair of high heels that only enhanced those gorgeous legs. He would definitely make sure his cousin\u2019s spouses took her out shopping more often, since he greatly liked the affect.</p><p>He wanted to see her dark hair released from the bun it was currently tied in. He wanted to rip the mask off her features and see her flawless skin but then the mystery of the game would fade away.</p><p>\u201cHow are you this evening?\u201d he asked her from behind, as he finally made his way to her darkened corner. He had to fight the smile as her entire body stiffened for a moment as she slowly turned to face him. He felt another clench in his gut as she looked at him with her incredible blue eyes enhanced by make-up to look even more exotic than ever before. The part of her face he could see was stunning, as usual. Let the games begin.</p><p>Nicole looked at Ryan and forgot how to speak for a moment. He was seriously the sexiest guy she\u2019d ever encountered before, even with the mask, or maybe because of it. He towered over her own five and a half foot height, making her have to look upward. He had broad shoulders, shown to perfection beneath the custom made black suit. He\u2019d been gorgeous as a teenager but the man before her was simply breathtaking.</p><p>His full lips were tilted up in a smile that seemed to be hiding some kind of a secret. His intense green eyes were looking at her as if she was his next conquest and she found the idea wasn\u2019t unpleasant. She saw his hand lifting towards her mask and quickly took a step backwards.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wonderful and yourself?\u201d she finally managed to answer him, with what she hoped was the proper amount of mystery.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m much better now that I\u2019ve managed to find you. Have we met before?\u201d he asked. She couldn\u2019t figure out what he was playing at but she found she was intrigued. She knew he had no doubts about who she was but for some reason, he wanted to play a game. She was willing to play along for a while, especially after her glass of champagne. She also had added confidence from her clothes and expertly applied make-up.</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019d remember meeting you but isn\u2019t the whole point of a masquerade to remain a mystery?\u201d she asked him. She was surprised by the quivering in her stomach, which didn\u2019t seem to be subsiding. She had to admit she was still attracted to Ryan and his admiration was stroking her ego.</p><p>\u201cAh yes, a masquerade is full of mystery but I\u2019m finding I really want to see what\u2019s behind your mask,\u201d he said, putting his full amount of charm behind the words. The longer they played their game, the more aroused he was getting. He couldn\u2019t ever remember wanting a woman as much as he wanted her. He forgot his cousins were even in the room and completely forgot about all the other party goers. He had eyes for only Nicole. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard you don\u2019t always get what you want?\u201d she said with a full smile. She knew she needed to make an excuse and get away from him but she found she was enjoying the flirting. What could it harm, anyway? She could put all their problems behind her for one night. He wouldn\u2019t try anything at the party and she could go back to being distant when the bell chimed midnight but for now she felt like Cinderella, which made her daring and bold.</p><p>\u201cActually, no one has told me \u2018no\u2019 for about twelve years,\u201d he answered. He watched her eyes widen as she realized he was serious and she\u2019d been the last person to tell him no. He found it unbelievably erotic she wasn\u2019t afraid to stand up to him. He loved her spark and he loved that she wasn\u2019t willing to cower at his feet. It was never fun to chase someone when they weren\u2019t willing to run.</p><p>\u201cWell then I think it\u2019s about time you were told you can\u2019t have something you want,\u201d she said with a seductive smile. She then turned and started to walk away. Ryan was so stunned he almost let her go. He felt the grin spread across his features and was shocked to find he was suddenly having a very good time. He quickly caught up to her at the edge of the dance floor and without saying a word he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>Nicole had turned down many dates in her life and the men seemed to crawl away with their tale between their legs. She\u2019d never walked away before and had the guy chase her. She found she was incredibly turned on by his boldness. That worried her more than anything else. The game was suddenly starting to scare her. She should\u2019ve known she could never compete with a man like Ryan. He was far out of her league. She kept her body stiff, as his hand pushed on her lower back, pulling her into his strength.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall you asking me to dance and I certainly didn\u2019t say I would,\u201d she finally said to him as she stood stock still in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask,\u201d he said with confidence, as he looked down into her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to make a scene so unless you like to be the center of attention I suggest you simply go with the dance because I\u2019m not letting go.\u201d</p><p>Nicole thought about stomping on his foot with the high heel of her shoe but she noticed several heads were turned their way and didn\u2019t want anyone to notice her. If anyone really took a look at her, they would realize quickly she didn\u2019t belong in their world. She glared up at him as she allowed him to maneuver her around the dance floor. He kept pulling her tightly against his body and she kept pushing away from it. It was a game they played for the next several minutes.</p><p>Ryan was walking a thin line and he knew it. The feel of her pressed against his body was both agony and ecstasy. Her hips were well rounded and he swept his hand lower, while she reached around and pushed his hand back up. It was a game of cat and mouse and he knew he\u2019d become the victor. She may be glaring at him but he could also feel the accelerated pulse in her wrist. He saw her eyes darken with desire and he could feel her breath coming out in pants against his neck. She was as turned on as him but she was fighting it. He would break her down, or he would die trying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little too warm, I need to step outside,\u201d she said. She was frustrated with herself at the breathless quality to her tone. How was she going to convince Ryan she didn\u2019t want him when she couldn\u2019t control her own desire, which contradicted her words? She knew they had an agreement but that didn\u2019t mean she had to be so easy.</p><p>\u201cI could use a cooling off, myself,\u201d he said between clenched teeth. He wasn\u2019t sure which one of them was more worked up at that point. He knew no one around them would be able to tell how he felt, as he was a master of hiding his emotions but he was one step away from embarrassing himself, as if he was a teenager, instead of a mature man.</p><p>Nicole said nothing else, as she pulled away from him and started walking towards the balcony doors. She tried to pull her hand free but he refused to let go. She couldn\u2019t pull free of his touch without attracting attention so she once again let him have his way. She was going to give him a piece of her mind if he didn\u2019t back off, though.</p><p>They stepped through the doorway, onto the dark balcony. Ryan looked over his shoulder before closing the door and was relieved to find no one had noticed their departure. He released Nicole\u2019s hand and she quickly went to the far end of the balcony, trying to get as far from him as possible. He smiled to himself. It was never any fun if you caught your prey too soon.</p><p>He quietly grabbed a deck chair and pushed it under the doorknob. He didn\u2019t want anyone coming out and interrupting his time with her. It had been too long since he\u2019d been deep inside her body and no one was going to stop him that night.</p><p>Nicole leaned against the railing and tried to get her body back under control. She was playing a game with a man who could eat her for lunch. He\u2019d been the one in control from the moment she made that phone call and he was once again letting her know it. She could feel her breathing slowly get back under control and her heart return beating at a normal rate. She continued to stare out at the nearly black sky.</p><p>In Seattle a clear night was a rare thing and that night was no exception. It was unusually warm but the cloud cover made the deck completely sealed off from the rest of the world. She would gain control over her raging hormones and slip back inside and away from the party she should\u2019ve never attended in the first place. She should be helping her sister, not flirting with the man who was making her into something she despised.</p><p>As Nicole was getting ready to turn back around, she felt Ryan come up behind her, his hands wrapping around her body. Her pulse skyrocketed and her breathing exercises went out the window. One touch from him and she felt like a bowl of jello, with zero control over her own body.</p><p>His hands were splayed across her stomach and his body was pressed along the length of her back. She could feel his hot breath on her neck and couldn\u2019t stop the shiver running down her spine. He said nothing, as he stood there and rubbed circles on her quivering stomach.</p><p>\u201cI really need to get back and check on Patsy,\u201d she said, barely above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cShe has round the clock care, so what\u2019s your hurry?\u201d he asked, before she felt the press of his lips on her neck. She was barely able to contain the groan wanting to escape her throat. His mouth felt so good touching her skin. He was kissing along the length of her neck and she could feel the swipe of his tongue along her beating pulse point. She would stop him in just a moment. He\u2019d asked her a question but for the life of her, she couldn\u2019t remember what it was.</p><p>His hands continued to caress her stomach, causing her body to shake with need. She was quickly losing her resolve to walk away. What would it hurt to have one night of recklessness? She\u2019d always been the good girl, the responsible one, the one who could be counted on. She\u2019d always walked away to make a better choice. Their making love again was inevitable, so why keep fighting it.</p><p>\u201cTell me you want me,\u201d he demanded of her. His hands were skimming higher and she could feel the brush of them on the underside of her breasts, which were swollen and aching to feel his masculine hands grip them. Her nipples were straining against her bra and the lace was irritating her sensitive skin. She\u2019d never wanted her clothing off so badly. She\u2019d never wanted a man to touch her more than she wanted her next breath of oxygen.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she finally managed to choke out. He seemed to tense for a moment, before he growled low in his throat and bit the side of her neck. She felt a slight sting and then unbelievable pleasure as he ran his tongue over the spot and then sucked it into his mouth.</p><p>His hands finally pushed over the mounds of her breasts and she gasped as his thumbs rubbed over her tightened nipples. He rubbed his hips into her backside and she could feel his erection pushing into her. She couldn\u2019t stop herself from pressing her body back into his. His growl of pleasure gave her a boldness she didn\u2019t know she possessed.</p> <p>He quickly turned her around molding his mouth to hers and all other thoughts were wiped from her mind. When his tongue slipped inside, she saw an explosion of light behind her eyelids.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and clung to him, as his hands roamed all over her body. She didn\u2019t know how or when it happened but suddenly she felt the warm breeze on her naked breasts a few seconds before she felt his mouth break from hers, only to take her swollen bud into his mouth.</p><p>She threw her head back as he lavished her aching breasts. He took his time on one, before switching to the other, to give it equal attention. She could feel the heat pooling in her core and wanted nothing more than for him to fill the void inside her.</p><p>His hands were rubbing along her thighs and she wanted more. She needed him in a way she\u2019d never needed a man before. He was turning her into an addict for his body. The things he did to her were almost worth the guilt when it was over.</p><p>Ryan pulled her dress up and groaned aloud at the wisp of fabric covering her core. She was suddenly grateful Jasmine had made her purchase the sexy lingerie.</p><p>His hand brushed over the fabric and he lost all sense of control when he felt the wetness soaking the thin material. She was the most responsive woman he\u2019d ever been with and there was nothing fake about her. She was all woman and she was writhing in pleasure beneath his touch. It was quickly sending him over the edge. He grabbed the side of her thong and it easily ripped in his hand and left her uncovered for his pleasure. He\u2019d never wanted light more in his life than at that moment. He could barely see her body and he wanted to take in every inch of her.</p><p>He grabbed her in his arms and laid her down in one of the loungers on the deck. He buried his head in the juncture between her thighs and as her sweet scent hit him, he felt his body pulse in painful desire. She was so beautiful and the groans coming from her were making him realize he wasn\u2019t going to last long. He wanted to draw it out but there would be next time for that.</p><p>Nicole jerked in pleasure at the first swipe of his tongue against her aroused flesh. She\u2019d never felt so out of control and couldn\u2019t stop moving under his masterful administrations to her sensitive body. He swiped his tongue along her moist folds and took the sensitized bud into his mouth gently sucking it. That was all it took to send her flying over a cliff, which seemed to have no bottom. Her body jerked in a powerful orgasm as wave after wave of ecstasy washed through her. She was shaking as the pleasure rushed through her in what seemed like an endless storm.</p><p>She felt his finger dip inside of her heat and wanted to shake her head no. She couldn\u2019t take any more lovemaking. Her body was spent and she could barely breathe as it was. His tongue traveled the length of her body upwards, until his lips fastened onto her still sensitive nipples once again. She felt a stirring in her stomach, as he took the still hardened peaks into his mouth and sucked them deep inside. When he gently bit down on her, her back arched off the lounger and she felt the stirrings of pleasure start to rise again.</p><p>She\u2019d heard about women who could have more than one orgasm but she\u2019d never thought she could be so sexual. Her eyes widened in shock, as she felt the heat building to an unbearable pitch again. His fingers were still inside her, slowly pumping in and out of her heated folds and she once again started to wiggle beneath his administering. He moved his body upwards and suddenly his lips were fastened onto hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He thrust his tongue inside of her mouth, giving as much as he took. He moved his hand from her body and she cried out at the empty feeling. She needed more but she didn\u2019t even know what that need was. \u201cPlease,\u201d she cried out not knowing what she was crying out for.</p><p>She felt the weight of his body, as he settled over her thighs. He was gloriously naked above her and she greedily rubbed her hands along the muscled length of his back and arms. He was kissing her so deeply she could barely breathe but she didn\u2019t care. She didn\u2019t need oxygen. She didn\u2019t need anything but the feeling he was bringing her. She suddenly felt pressure as he pushed up against her opening and a new wave of heat hit her, moistening her body for his entrance.</p><p>He lifted his lips from hers and bit gently down on her neck again, as he thrust inside her in one long motion. She tensed up from the sheer size of the man. She knew it would be a long time before she could take him inside her, without feeling stretched beyond her limits. Her body took him in and as she adjusted around him, the pleasure was almost too much to bear. She heard him swear, as he tried to gain some control of himself. She felt him start to pull out of her but she was finally adjusting to his size and she wanted him to move within her, not leave her empty.</p><p>Ryan could feel he\u2019d stretched her too much. He was too big for her and needed to get some control over himself. How could he forget the sight of his sheets the last time? Then she wrapped her legs around his back and jerked her hips upwards and he lost all sense of control. With her thrust upwards, he was sent over the edge and there was no going back.</p> <p>Nicole could feel the sheen of sweat from both their bodies, allowing them to easily rub against each other. As he grabbed her hips and started thrusting in and out of her, faster and faster, she was quickly building up to a crashing crescendo. Her nipples were rubbing up against his hard chest and every time he sunk deep inside of her, her swollen nub would brush against his pelvic bone. Between all the sensations he was giving her, she could feel the orgasm getting ready to take her away. She held onto him and didn\u2019t even think about fighting it.</p><p>He was pushing into her harder and harder and suddenly she couldn\u2019t take any more and her body tensed, as the most earth shattering explosion washed through her. She shook as wave after wave of electricity shot through her body. Her legs were in a death grip around his back and her nails dug into his shoulders. The release washed through her, over and over again and she couldn\u2019t prevent the cry that rang from her scorched throat.</p><p>Ryan was barely hanging on to his sanity as he pushed deep inside of her and when she started gripping him, he was completely lost. He let his own cry of pleasure ring out as he emptied himself deep inside of her. She was the most passionate woman he\u2019d ever taken and he didn\u2019t want it to end but how could he not want to feel total completion? It was unlike anything else he\u2019d ever experienced. She continued to grip him in convulsions, draining him of every last ounce of himself. He fell against her in satisfaction, then shifted them to their sides.</p><p>His body was burning up and he was grateful for the gentle breeze blowing against them. He couldn\u2019t open his eyes as he laid there with her in his arms. He stroked her back and neither of them said anything. They could always talk later.</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>Nicole woke up because she was freezing. She started to panic as she wondered where she was. As she moved and felt the arms around her, everything came back to her with the force of a wrecking crane.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe how easily she\u2019d fallen into his arms once again. She was never going to convince the man he didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with her, when she continued to fall into bed with him the second he touched her. Her entire goal was for him to get sick of her so she and Patsy could get on with their lives. She was already starting to have deep feelings for him again and that would never do. He was simply with her to exact some kind of revenge for the way she\u2019d left him. He couldn\u2019t know she\u2019d done it for the best possible reasons.</p><p>She slowly began to untangle herself from his arms. He started to stir and she went completely still. She wanted nothing more than to get as far from him as she could and figure out what she was going to do next. She knew he would be angry with her, as he\u2019d told her she wouldn\u2019t run from his bed again but that was one thing in her control and she couldn\u2019t let it go. Besides, she wasn\u2019t technically in a bed so she wasn\u2019t breaking any of his ridiculous rules.</p><p>She finally managed to untangle herself from his arms and searched the darkened deck for her missing clothes. Luckily, the dress never came off all the way and her light jacket was easy to find. She couldn\u2019t spot her panties and decided she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She walked towards the doors and spotted the deck chair under the door knob. She was both horrified and relieved to see it. She was glad no one had been able to come out and spot her lying in his arms, half naked and yet horrified that he\u2019d thought to enclose the two of them. He must\u2019ve had zero doubts she would succumb to him once again.</p><p>She was trying to decide how to remove the chair, without making any noise, when she spotted a stair case to her left. She walked over and was relieved to see it led to the yard below. She knew the walk back to his house was a long one but there was a trail and it would be good for her. She would have plenty of time to think about what she was going to do next.</p> <p>Ryan woke up a while after Nicole slipped away and looked around in disbelief. He couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d once again run out on him. He\u2019d told her she wasn\u2019t to leave his bed. He had to smile to himself mockingly, considering she didn\u2019t really break his rule as they\u2019d fallen asleep in a lounger. He jumped up and straightened out his clothing. The sun was just starting to come up in the sky, giving him a bit of light.</p><p>He spotted her delicate panties, which were completely destroyed. He threw them in his pocket, then looked over the deck. There was no sign of her, anywhere. He saw the chair was still under the doorknob so he knew she must\u2019ve escaped down the stairs.</p><p>He squared his shoulders and headed towards his vehicle. There was no way he wanted to risk running into his cousin, with his knowing eyes. He wouldn\u2019t live it down that his woman snuck off in the middle of the night. Hell, Derek and Drew were both incredibly lucky men. They had beautiful wives who idolized them. Their women were in no way push-over\u2019s and had certainly given his cousins a run for their money. But he knew they didn\u2019t slip from their beds in the middle of the night. No, his cousins most likely woke up to be satisfied fully each morning, instead of left aching.</p><p>Luckily, there was no one about at the early hour of the morning and he was able to sneak off. He headed straight for home, where he planned on having a rip roaring fight with his woman and she would certainly learn her place. He was going to teach her that her place was in his bed. He cringed a bit at what a chauvinist he sounded like but he didn\u2019t care, she was his and she needed to learn that.</p><p>Ryan wasn\u2019t normally a man who ever accepted defeat, which was why he had billions in his bank account and she would soon learn this fact. He pulled into his driveway in anticipation. He slowed the car as he drove up the long driveway. He could take his time now because he knew soon he would get what he wanted.</p><p>He stepped through the front doors and all was quiet in the house. He peaked in on Patsy, who was sleeping soundly. He smiled at her much healthier complexion, knowing she was going to be okay. That alone was worth all the heartache her sister was giving him.</p><p>He climbed the stairs and of course she wasn\u2019t in his room. He blew out a breath of frustration. He next went to the room he\u2019d found her in the last time and opened the door. His breath was knocked out of him. Standing before him was Nicole in nothing but a towel. She was so unbelievably gorgeous, even without a lick of make-up on her face and her hair hanging wetly down her back.</p><p>She glared at him and he glared right back. It was time to let her know how a proper mistress acted. She seemed to have forgotten in the last couple of weeks.</p> <p>\u201cI woke up alone again,\u201d he stated the obvious.</p><p>\u201cAnd this concerns me how?\u201d she asked with a raise of her brows. Her snide answer sent his blood to boiling.</p><p>\u201cI told you that you won\u2019t leave my bed in the middle of the night,\u201d he growled at her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you I\u2019ll do as I please,\u201d she snapped right back. He slowly began to stalk her and he was satisfied when her eyes rounded and she started to retreat from him.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to break our agreement Nicole?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t own me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh but I do own you Nicole. Our agreement is I help your sister and you\u2019re my mistress until I see fit of disposing of you. You aren\u2019t keeping me very happy right now so I guess I could throw you and Patsy out of here. Then she wouldn\u2019t get the medical treatment she still needs,\u201d he threatened her. He knew he was sinking to an all-time low but he was so angry he didn\u2019t even care.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d she said but not with much confidence.</p><p>\u201cTry me. Leave my bed again before I\u2019m ready for you too and you\u2019ll see exactly what I\u2019ll do,\u201d he said with a confident smile. He prayed she wouldn\u2019t call his bluff because there was no way in hell he\u2019d punish Patsy. His ace in the hole was that Nicole had no idea what he would or wouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d she spat at him. He smiled hugely at her, as his gaze flicked over her body. She was flushed and her breathing was coming out in pants. She may hate him but her body wanted him and she couldn\u2019t deny that.</p><p>\u201cYou sure haven\u2019t acted like you hate me when you\u2019re moaning in my arms,\u201d he said with confidence.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure I\u2019m not faking the whole thing?\u201d she said with her own version of a cocky smile. She wasn\u2019t pulling it off. His eyes narrowed even further and he stalked closer to her. He now had her backed up to the bed, with nowhere for her to go. He was breathing just as heavily as her and his temper was close to the snapping point.</p><p>He ran his hand along the top of the towel, making her body shiver, betraying her words. He smiled in triumph once again and she continued to glare at him. She\u2019d thrown down her bluff and he\u2019d won. It was definitely a heady feeling.</p><p>\u201cDeny it all you want but you want me just as badly as I want you. You can play the martyr but we both know sharing my bed is no hardship for you,\u201d he said, as he continued to caress her skin.</p><p>She said nothing else, she knew she\u2019d lost the small battle but she wouldn\u2019t concede the entire war. She tilted her chin in defiance, which only made him smile more. He grabbed the knot on her towel and in one movement he ripped the thing off of her, leaving her completely naked in front of him.</p><p>Nicole gasped aloud at his boldness and wanted badly to cover herself up. She felt exposed, standing before him completely naked. There was no way to hide his affect on her, with her nipples already hardened into tight peaks.</p><p>Ryan felt like he\u2019d been kicked in the gut, at the sight of her luscious curves before him and he was no longer angry. He was hungry and he was going to prove to her how much she needed him. He did exactly that over the next several hours and felt immense satisfaction as she lay in his arms, sound asleep afterward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was too wired to fall asleep and slowly untangled himself from her. He felt much better and decided to get some work done. He\u2019d proven his point and though he knew she would still fight him each step of the way, he didn\u2019t think he would wake up to find her in another bed again.</p><p>He realized he\u2019d always been surrounded by women willing to concede to him, with the slightest crook of his finger and it had bored him. He was glad she was stubborn and independent. She certainly would never bore him. He actually whistled as he took his shower and dressed for the day, then headed downstairs. The drive into the office didn\u2019t take him long.</p><p>He almost laughed aloud at the relieved looks of his staff as he smiled at them and asked how their days were going. He hadn\u2019t realized what a complete grouch he\u2019d been. He had a feeling his mood was only going to improve each day he had with Nicole. He pushed the button to page his secretary.</p><p>\u201cCan you please get Nicole on the line and put her through?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>\u201cYes sir,\u201d she efficiently replied. He could\u2019ve easily rang her himself, especially since he was sitting at his desk doing nothing, in anticipation of her voice coming over the line but it was a game of who had the most power and he was determined to win.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on line three, sir,\u201d the voice spoke over his intercom. He forced himself to wait a full two minutes before picking up the phone.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ryan here,\u201d he spoke into the handset as if bored.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who called me,\u201d she said exasperated, when he forgot who he was even speaking to.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I almost forgot,\u201d Ryan lied to her. \u201cI\u2019d like for you to come into the office today and have lunch with me,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d she said simply and his easy mood evaporated.</p><p>\u201cWell then you\u2019ll undo any plans you\u2019ve made and be here by noon,\u201d he told her, brooking no room for argument. The other end of the line was silent for so long he was beginning to think she\u2019d actually had the audacity to hang up on him. His good mood was gone and he was about to explode.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d she finally said in a none too happy voice.</p><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019ll see you then,\u201d he practically yelled before disconnecting the call. He was seething mad as he sat in his chair. There were women all around who\u2019d be climbing all over themselves to spend one minute in his company and the one woman he actually wanted to be with acted as if she was going to the gallows every time he requested her presence. It was absolutely ridiculous and he needed to gain some control over himself. He refused to let her affect him so much.</p><p>\u201cMr. Titan, you have an international call on line one,\u201d his secretary\u2019s voice came over the intercom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d he snapped at the woman. He received no reply and rightfully so. His staff was terrified of what kind of a mood he\u2019d be in because it changed every two minutes. He took the call and was grateful it occupied him over the next couple of hours. He didn\u2019t have time to sit around and brood about what Nicole was thinking or doing.</p> <p>He was working on one of his accounts when his door opened. He was surprised, since no one ever walked into his office without either calling first, or at least knocking. He was about to bite the intruders head off, for the gall of interrupting him in his current mood, when Nicole flowed through the doorway.</p><p>\u201cHas no one taught you manners? You should knock before walking into someone\u2019s office. I could\u2019ve been in an important meeting,\u201d he snapped at her. She raised her brows at him and the smirk on her face wasn\u2019t helping his mood. \u201cWhere the hell is my secretary anyway, she should have stopped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve obviously been terrorizing your office staff and I told your secretary we were meeting for lunch and there was no need to buzz you. If you have a problem with that then you can take it out on me and not her. I think if you blow up at the poor woman one more time, she\u2019s going to walk out the door, while telling you where you can stick your bad attitude,\u201d she told him with arrogance.</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess you\u2019re telling me how to run my offices now?\u201d he questioned her.</p><p>\u201cObviously, someone needs to,\u201d she gave right back.</p><p>\u201cYou drive me to the point of madness,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cWell that makes two of us. I don\u2019t see why you want to continue this arrangement when we are both so miserable. You\u2019re the one who insisted I come down here,\u201d she yelled. He knew his staff was getting bits and pieces of their conversation and he really didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry, let\u2019s go,\u201d he commanded and walked out the door, not trusting himself to touch her. He was in a foul mood and he\u2019d end up throwing her over his desk. He wanted to bend her to his will but at the same time, part of his immense attraction for her was the fact she wasn\u2019t just another whimpering female, wanting only to please him. He wouldn\u2019t mind a little bit of appreciation from her, though.</p> <p>\u201cYes sir,\u201d she mumbled. He pretended not to hear her. It was better for both of them that way. As he crossed the offices he noticed his employees weren\u2019t making eye contact with him. He started to feel a bit badly about that. He normally wasn\u2019t a bear and people loved to work for him. He really was going to have to try not to take his frustrations out on his employees. He looked over to his secretary and waited until he got her attention.</p><p>\u201cOrder lunch for everybody today and use my credit card. After lunch, those who don\u2019t have immediate things to be finished tonight can have the rest of the afternoon off,\u201d he said and walked toward the elevators. He smiled as his employees faces lit up.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Titan,\u201d a few different people shouted out to him as he entered the elevator. He nodded his head before the doors shut, locking him and Nicole into the small space.</p><p>\u201cThat was really sweet of you,\u201d Nicole told him. Her entire demeanor had relaxed with those few words he\u2019d uttered. He looked at her with surprise. She threw thousand dollar gifts back in his face with contempt but he spends a few hundred dollars on lunch for strangers and she gets all warm and fuzzy. He couldn\u2019t understand her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a nice guy,\u201d he said with a leer. He then couldn\u2019t take the space between them anymore, so he reached out and pulled her into his arms. She stiffened for about two seconds, then her body melted into his. Sexual chemistry wasn\u2019t something they were lacking. He kissed her with all his pent up anger and need and by the time the elevator reached the bottom floor, they were both panting.</p><p>His security staff acted as if they hadn\u2019t seen anything, thankfully. He knew the cameras in the elevators had given them quite a show. If Nicole knew that, she would\u2019ve been mortified. He was going to speak to his staff and have a panel put in the elevator because he suddenly needed to have a way to turn off those monitors.</p><p>He pulled her out into the busy Seattle streets and led her to a small diner. There were so many great little caf\u00e9s with excellent food in the city he was constantly being surprised. Nicole thawed out and they enjoyed a nice lunch together.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t have herself armed against him she would actually relax and he could see pieces of the teenage girl he\u2019d been in love with so many years before. That had to be the reason he couldn\u2019t yet let go of her. He simply had to purge himself of those long ago teenager fantasies. He\u2019d be fine once he\u2019d done that.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do some shopping,\u201d he told her. She wore the same clothing over and over again and not that she looked bad in anything she wore but he was an incredibly wealthy man and he wouldn\u2019t be made a fool.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave Patsy for too long,\u201d she told him, as she followed him from the table to the car waiting for them. She hadn\u2019t even heard him call for his driver.</p><p>\u201cPatsy has round the clock care and will be fine for a few hours,\u201d he said with frustration. She looked for any excuse to get away from him and he wasn\u2019t going to allow it.</p><p>\u201cI know but she still needs me,\u201d Nicole said. She had to fight her attraction to Ryan every second of being with him and it was exhausting. She\u2019d been wobbly ever since their passionate kiss in the elevator. That may be something he did on a daily basis but it knocked her off her feet and it took every ounce of her concentration to keep up in conversation with him.</p><p>She also found it extremely difficult to keep maintaining her distance to the man when he was charming, such as buying his staff lunch. He\u2019d not actually admitted to being a bear around them but he\u2019d apologized, none-the-less, with his gesture. She was sure he was already forgiven by his staff. The man had a charismatic way about him that simply made people want to jump to please him.</p><p>They arrived at some top end mall she\u2019d never been to. The cheapest store in the place was way beyond what her budget would allow. She was a bit self-conscious, walking into the building in her current jeans and t-shirt combo. She held her head up high though because clothes didn\u2019t make the person. She didn\u2019t need fancy items to wear to make her as good as the other women around her.</p><p>As they walked around she couldn\u2019t help but notice the snobby looks she received from some women and the looks of envy from others. Most of the women probably thought she was a poor relative of Ryan\u2019s because he certainly fit in with the crowd in his custom made Armani suit and Italian loafers.</p><p>They walked into a store and the clerk approached them eagerly, practically purring at Ryan. Nicole felt a slight pang of jealousy and had to fight it down. Ryan grinned down at her, far too brilliantly, in Nicole\u2019s opinion.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d she asked Ryan, completely ignoring Nicole. She was a bit irritated by it.</p><p>\u201cWe need to purchase an entire wardrobe. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to help us,\u201d he practically purred back at her. The woman actually blushed a bit at his brilliant smile and Nicole had to suck in the words she wanted to shout at the piranha.</p><p>Then she realized they were in a woman\u2019s shop and what he was intending. Her face turned scarlet, as the woman turned towards her for an assessment. She could see the woman wanted to know who she was and she could also see she was hoping she was his little sister.</p><p>\u201cI can certainly help you with new clothing, please follow me,\u201d she said and sauntered off, moving her hips much more than needed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Nicole accused underneath her breath, certainly not wanting the very elegant woman to overhear her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m purchasing you some clothes,\u201d he said. He then looked at her as if she wasn\u2019t too bright, since they were standing in a store.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for you to purchase me clothing, nor do I want them,\u201d she hissed at him and started to walk out the door. He was so stunned by her refusal, he almost allowed her to walk out the door. At the last second, he snaked his arm out, grabbing her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll allow me to do this. You need to dress a certain way for occasions I want you to attend,\u201d he said to her. They glared at each other for several moments. Nicole was trying to figure out how to get out of the store without making a scene. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you coming?\u201d the sales lady asked from the back of the store, with some concern in her voice. She was most likely worried about losing the huge commission he\u2019d promised her.</p><p>\u201cYes, we are,\u201d Ryan said and literally dragged Nicole to the back of the store. Before she knew it, the lovely woman had her stripped from her clothing, standing in nothing but her bra and panties, taking her measurements.</p><p>Ryan sat there, cool as ice, as he watched her. She turned her face away and had to fight tears, she was so angry. The sales woman, whose name was Barbie, very fitting, Nicole thought snidely, was bringing different items out for Ryan\u2019s approval.</p><p>Nicole refused to comment on a single item so Ryan picked everything. She didn\u2019t need to try anything on, as the clothes were chosen from the measurements the woman took earlier. The entire ordeal lasted a few hours and by the time they were done, Nicole had a raging headache and couldn\u2019t have described a single item Ryan chose. He had all the clothes boxed, then had his driver come and haul them all out to his vehicle.</p> <p>She figured he\u2019d just wasted an incredible amount of money because she wouldn\u2019t wear one single thing he\u2019d picked. He could save them for his next mistress. She wouldn\u2019t be bought.</p><p>They reached the office and she gladly left his car and headed over towards her own. She was done talking to him and wanted to go back to the house, have a hot bath and forget the day had happened. If she stayed around him too much longer she would end up smacking him in his gorgeous face.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Ryan had the opportunity to work on an amazing historical site. It was the first time in his life he wanted to turn the project away but in the end, it was simply too great of an opportunity to let it go. He couldn\u2019t believe he was even considering not doing it but Patsy wasn\u2019t ready to leave the country and there was no way he could take Nicole. She would be miserable, wondering how her sister was doing.</p><p>Things had been much better over the last month. She still fought him every step of the way and his hunger for her was still as strong as it had been from the first day but he would wake up many mornings to find her gone. She didn\u2019t try climbing into another bed but he would find her on the sofa, watching a movie, or out in the garden. He couldn\u2019t complain and keep her locked to his bed twenty-four-seven but he\u2019d like to do that.</p> <p>He decided to force himself to go on the trip. He refused to let her alter his lifestyle, especially since she wasn\u2019t giving him anything of herself emotionally. But even beyond that the trip would be good. Maybe when he was gone she\u2019d miss him and start appreciating the things he did for her. He was happy and hopeful about her possibly missing him. He was also afraid he was going to be the one aching and miserable.</p><p>He could swear she was a witch and had him under some kind of a spell. She even got along spectacularly with all of his family members. He seemed to be the only one who ever got under her skin. He hadn\u2019t once in his adult life, lasted so long with any woman. He couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of her, even when she was snapping at him. It figured he wanted more than anything the one thing he should cut ties with.</p><p>\u201cHey, where did you go?\u201d Derek asked him.</p><p>\u201cSorry, my mind drifted off,\u201d Ryan told his cousin.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember those days. I bet your thoughts were filled with a dark haired beauty,\u201d Derek said with a waggle of his brows.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I\u2019m thinking about my upcoming trip,\u201d Ryan lied smoothly.</p> <p>\u201cWhen are you leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to take off tonight. I won\u2019t be back for at least a month, maybe longer. Hopefully by then I\u2019ll have some more control over myself,\u201d Ryan told him. Derek actually had the gall to laugh, which caused Ryan to glare. That only made Derek laugh even harder. He guessed he deserved it, as he\u2019d pushed Derek\u2019s buttons when he\u2019d been miserable.</p><p>\u201cI have a trip next week in that direction so I\u2019ll stop by and see what you\u2019re working on. I haven\u2019t been able to take Jasmine out in a while and I think she\u2019d really love Rome,\u201d Derek told him with a sappy look in his eye.</p><p>\u201cSeriously Derek, you\u2019re disgustingly pleasant now. What the hell happened to the corporate powerhouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasmine happened. I didn\u2019t know I could be so happy but man, if I\u2019m away from her for even a night I feel empty,\u201d Derek said. Ryan\u2019s gut clenched at those words. He was forcing himself to be away from Nicole for much longer than one night. He wasn\u2019t his cousin though and wouldn\u2019t allow himself to think about it. It was a good thought at least.</p><p>\u201cI feel like a freaking third wheel around you and Drew now,\u201d Ryan said, feeling a little bit sorry for himself. He loved his cousins\u2019 spouses but both of them were over the moon in happiness. He felt like they were sharing some great secret he couldn\u2019t possibly understand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if Drew and Trinity want to join me on the trip. I don\u2019t think Trinity\u2019s ever been to Rome either. I don\u2019t know if I can drag them away from the kids, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah you guys can all come and throw your happiness in my face,\u201d Ryan grumbled. He may have been complaining a bit but he would be really happy to have his family show up and see one of his projects.</p> <p>\u201cAll joking aside, I think you have something special with Nicole. Take my advice and let down your defenses and maybe you\u2019ll get that same sappy look on your face,\u201d Derek told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I said too. Let\u2019s see if you last as long as I did,\u201d Derek said, with a knowing look on his face. Derek took off and Ryan tried to put Nicole out of his mind, while he started focusing on his project. He really did enjoy Rome. It was a beautiful place and the project he was taking on was the biggest and oldest he\u2019d worked on yet. It would consume him wholeheartedly, which was a good thing.</p><p>Ryan slammed the hammer down with far more force than was needed. He\u2019d been at the job for over a month and sitting at a desk, behind the scenes, wasn\u2019t even enough to quell his bad mood. He couldn\u2019t believe he was still unable to get Nicole out of his mind. He\u2019d even called her several times, making up excuses but the real reason was just to hear her voice. He was going home that day. He couldn\u2019t take being apart from her any longer. He still reassured himself he simply needed to get her out of his system.</p><p>His family had shown up and been suitably impressed with his project but even the normal joy he felt in restoring a historic site was gone. He\u2019d taken a few days off, to tour the city with his family but his smile had been fake and his joy had been subdued. He continued to hammer away his frustration and when he bent yet another nail, he decided to call it a day.</p><p>He was ready to head home and take back what was his. He couldn\u2019t get her off his mind, so the next best thing was to go home and see where things were going to lead. He had a real problem though because he\u2019d gotten really attached to Patsy. Hell she was still a kid, even if she was a teenager.</p><p>The first time she said \u2018I love you\u2019 to him, so casually, his heart had jumped in his throat. There was no way he wanted to kick her out of his home. She seemed to be doing so good and her grades were thriving. He refused to think about any of that right then. His only thought was getting home and taking Nicole to his bed, where she belonged.</p><p>Nicole stretched as the sunlight filtered through the window, waking her up. She\u2019d been living at Ryan\u2019s for three months and she\u2019d fallen in love with the place. He\u2019d been gone over the past month and she would never admit it but she missed him like crazy. He\u2019d called her a few times and she would get off the phone aching to be held by him again. She was angry with herself for being so weak.</p><p>Her room was a dream and larger than her old apartment. She lay there, enjoying the softness of the mattress and yet filled with an emptiness to be in it alone. She couldn\u2019t believe how attached she\u2019d gotten to Ryan again in such a short amount of time. She figured she\u2019d never really stopped loving him in the first place and being around him again was like a knife through her heart.</p><p>Nicole jumped from her bed, quickly showered, got dressed and headed outside. She spent every moment she could outside, when the weather allowed. The morning was starting off beautiful and warm, which was highly unusual for Seattle, home of the rain.</p><p>She took off down one of the trails on a jog, enjoying the little bit of heaven, not far outside of the city limits. When she jogged along the trail, she felt like she was in a park, instead of a yard. She ran out of steam quickly, which was normal lately and she didn\u2019t understand it. She was used to going and going day in and out and didn\u2019t know why her energy levels had been so depleted lately.</p><p>As Nicole walked along, she thought about her baby sister. She loved how well Patsy was doing. She was back in school and healthier than ever before. She\u2019d fallen in love, at the better high school, which Derek had insisted she attend. She had new friends who\u2019d been at the house a lot and was even getting ready for her first dance.</p><p>Nicole had felt guilty about spending more of Ryan\u2019s money but when he\u2019d found out about the dance, he\u2019d insisted she buy Patsy the best dress out there. Jasmine and Trinity were far more knowing of the latest fashions than she herself was so she\u2019d asked them to come along with them and they\u2019d enthusiastically agreed.</p><p>Pasty had the best day ever, as the girls not only picked out a dress but new shoes and accessories and even a small tiara to wear. The girls had then dragged them both from shop to shop, where Patsy had been loaded down with an entire new wardrobe. The girls had snuck several items in there for Nicole as well and she was cringing to think what the final bill had tallied out to.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had the heart to say no to Patsy though as she hadn\u2019t seen her little sister\u2019s eyes light up with pleasure that intense ever. The day hadn\u2019t been completed until they all went in for pedicures and manicures. Patsy had even gotten fake nails put on for her dance. She\u2019d been prancing around the house ever since.</p><p>That night when Ryan called, Patsy jumped on the phone and talked to him for about fifteen minutes. She went through her entire day and all the amazing clothes she\u2019d gotten. She didn\u2019t have any clue he was the one fitting the bill. As she got ready to hand the phone over to Nicole, she told him she loved him, as only a teenager could and Nicole had to fight back the tears.</p><p>She knew she would be considered the most evil person ever if she tried to take Patsy away from the home where she\u2019d made new friends. But wouldn\u2019t she have to leave eventually, when Patsy was done with school, if not sooner. Whenever Ryan was sick of her, they were out. She had a feeling he would allow Patsy to stay though, as he seemed attached to her.</p><p>Nicole felt a stinging in her leg, which snapped her back to the present and looked down to see red running downward. She panicked for a moment, thinking something had bitten her and she was pouring blood but as she looked closer she realized it was paint. She smiled, as she realized the kids were out having a paintball gun fight again. She\u2019d run into them several times. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m an innocent bystander,\u201d she called out good naturedly.</p><p>\u201cNicole, sorry we didn\u2019t know you were out here,\u201d the oldest boy, Jacob said, as he came running up to her, looking very guilty. He had several friends trailing behind him, all with the same expressions of guilt on their faces. \u201cI heard a noise over here and thought it was one of the guys,\u201d he said, as a slight blush stole over his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine Jacob, it looks like you guys are having a great time,\u201d she reassured him.</p><p>\u201cWe are, do you want to join us?\u201d he offered. The other boys nodded their heads encouragingly.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I have to get back but maybe some other time,\u201d she told them. She turned around to walk back towards the house and the boys all ran off in the other direction, shouting and firing at the same time. She smiled to herself. Jacob was Ryan\u2019s nephew, well technically his cousin but the three men were more brothers than cousins and the kids called both the men uncle. She was impressed with the very tightly knit family.</p><p>She finally reached the house and realized the paint ball hit her harder than she originally thought. She had a slight limp and a huge knot on her leg. She stepped into the kitchen so she could clean up when a shadow nearly scared her to death.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your leg?\u201d Ryan said to her. She was speechless for a moment, as she looked up and saw him standing before her. She hadn\u2019t expected him back for a few more weeks and she was worried by how much she wanted to throw her arms around the man who haunted her dreams each night.</p><p>\u201cI got shot with a paintball but it looks far worse than it is. This is only paint,\u201d she said and bent to run her finger over the paint.</p><p>Ryan sucked in the breath he\u2019d been holding. He\u2019d missed her so much and when he\u2019d arrived home and not been able to find her, he\u2019d gone a bit crazy. He\u2019d thought she may have left him but her clothes were there and Patsy\u2019s room was filled with her possessions. He smiled to think how well Patsy had settled in. At least one of them had no problem with him spoiling them. Nicole acted like he was committing a sin when he tried to give her anything. It was downright insulting.</p> <p>He had more money than he could possibly ever spend but she didn\u2019t want to allow him to buy her a simple pair of jeans. He wouldn\u2019t allow people to think he mistreated her in any form. He would purchase her things, even if he had to literally take her into the dressing rooms and dress her himself. He got hard just thinking about that scenario.</p><p>He stared at her, from her toes, to the top of her head. She was make-up free with her hair thrown back in a sloppy ponytail and she was wearing loose work-out clothes. She\u2019d never looked sexier to him. Damn, he was in a really bad state.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, your nephews were having a paintball war and I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It could\u2019ve been worse, they might\u2019ve been going for the kill shot,\u201d she said on a laugh. His lips rose slightly at the corners.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d he said before he could stop himself. He hadn\u2019t meant for it to slip out but from the gleam in her eyes, it had been the right thing to say. He had a feeling she\u2019d missed him too, although he didn\u2019t think he could get her to admit it.</p><p>\u201cUm, I um, need to, um go get this off of me,\u201d she stuttered, acting more like a middle school child, than a full grown adult. She needed to get a grip. She quickly fled the room and never saw the smile split across Ryan\u2019s face. It was the first genuine smile he felt cross his features since the night he dragged her from that restaurant.</p> <p>He began whistling as he followed her up the stairs. He would wait for her to get out of the shower and then give them what they both so desperately wanted. His aroused body was making it difficult to climb the stairs but the pain was worth it. Soon she\u2019d be relieving that for him.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d Ryan asked furiously, as Nicole walked in the door. He\u2019d come home early from work and she\u2019d been gone. He didn\u2019t like the feeling of not knowing where she was.</p><p>\u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business but I was at work,\u201d she snapped back at him. He\u2019d been back for a week and though they made love nightly, their days were not so pleasant. He was still highly demanding and she was still inserting her own independence.</p><p>She had zero doubt she was in love with the man but she also knew she was simply a play thing for him and he would eventually grow bored with her. Then she would be devastated all over again. To top all that off she had a really bad feeling she was pregnant. She\u2019d been ignoring it for months but her stomach was starting to thicken and she\u2019d been so exhausted.</p><p>She could pass off the thickening stomach to the amount of food she consumed but the unusual desire for foods she\u2019d never liked before, the complete exhaustion and the mood swings were a dead giveaway. She\u2019d refused to take a test. Then she\u2019d know for sure and she\u2019d have to break the news to Ryan. She wasn\u2019t ready for that.</p><p>\u201cEverything you do is my business. How quickly you forget what we agreed upon,\u201d he snapped. He was beyond mad she\u2019d taken one of her worthless jobs again when he was willing to provide everything she and Patsy needed. She allowed him to spoil Patsy but she refused to wear the jewelry he bought her and wore the same old clothes she\u2019d come to his home with, over and over again. It was really making him angry.</p><p>Every other woman he\u2019d ever dated had tried to get every last thing they could out of him and he finally had a woman he wanted to buy things for and she tossed them back in his face. He\u2019d already had a frustrating day at the office, which was why he\u2019d come home early in the first place and she was now aggravating his mood even further. He\u2019d hoped being with her would\u2019ve calmed him down. It wasn\u2019t happening.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll quit whatever crappy job you took because I want you home when I need you,\u201d he told her. She looked at him like he was insane for a moment. He could see she was trying to decide whether to yell at him or walk away. Finally she started laughing. He stood there in complete shock. No one ever laughed at him. He didn\u2019t like it happening to him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t quit my job. I happen to have found one that I love. I know my measly little paycheck for two weeks doesn\u2019t even compare to what you make in one hour but it\u2019s my money and I\u2019m earning it on my own. I\u2019ve told you before I\u2019ll pay back every penny you\u2019ve spent on Patsy and I. I need a job to be able to afford to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you I don\u2019t want a dime from you,\u201d he said for the hundredth time.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t take hand outs and I\u2019ll be paying you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell do you have to be so stubborn all the time? It\u2019s ridiculous and you\u2019re doing nothing but hurting yourself and your sister. Grow up and stop acting like a damn child,\u201d he said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cJust because you have far more money than any one person should ever have doesn\u2019t mean you can throw it in my face. If I want to pay you back then I\u2019ll do it, whether I have to stuff it down your throat or not,\u201d she told him stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even talk to you,\u201d he shouted, as he ran his fingers through his hair once again.</p><p>\u201cWell, that goes both ways, you arrogant jerk,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess then I\u2019ll have to drag you away from this job you have. I\u2019ve done it once, don\u2019t think I won\u2019t do it again,\u201d he threatened.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be able to do that,\u201d she smirked at him, which caused his blood to boil even more.</p><p>\u201cI can figure out easily where you\u2019re working Nicole, so don\u2019t act so cocky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t have a problem telling you where I work. My co-workers will rip you apart if you so much as lay one finger on me while I\u2019m there,\u201d she said far too smugly.</p><p>Images of her working at a strip club with bouncers went through his mind. He could think of no other place where she would foolishly believe he wouldn\u2019t try and drag her out. He would certainly drag her out of a strip club too and he\u2019d look forward to the fight. She caused more emotions in him than any other person on the planet.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re working at some trashy night club, or bar I swear I\u2019ll be going to jail for pounding the crap out of whoever has dared to look at you,\u201d he yelled. Nicole was shocked by the intensity of his worlds. A shiver ran down her spine as she realized he was serious. Thank goodness she hadn\u2019t been that stupid.</p><p>\u201cIf you must know, I\u2019m working with Jasmine and Trinity at their place,\u201d she said smugly. She watched a mixture of relief and acceptance wash over his features.</p><p>Ryan blew out his breath, as he realized she was right, there was no way in hell he would try and drag her out of there. Jasmine and Trinity would tear him apart. There wasn\u2019t a man on the planet he feared but his cousin\u2019s wives were a whole different matter.</p><p>She once again laughed at him, loving she\u2019d won that argument. She took off up the stairs like she didn\u2019t have a care in the world.</p><p>He stared in shock. She laughed in his face and then outright defied him. To top off everything, she had the gall to walk away when he wasn\u2019t finished with their argument. He knew logically he should let her go so he could calm himself down but he was never one to walk away from a fight.</p><p>He slowly stalked her up the stairs and found her in their bedroom. His temper was already escalated and seeing her in their room, in the same raggedy clothes made him snap. He was sick and tired of seeing her lessen herself by wearing rags.</p><p>Nicole turned around and the look on Ryan\u2019s face terrified her. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever seen him so furious. Maybe she\u2019d pushed it a little bit far. She was thinking it may be much wiser to apologize and tuck tail and run. She wasn\u2019t going to quit her job though. She was getting ready to do just that when he opened his mouth once again and infuriated her all over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve bought you new clothes and you still choose to wear those rags. I demand you toss them out now,\u201d he yelled at her. Her hackles were immediately up again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be naked than wear your charity hand-outs,\u201d she shouted right back. Her eyes widened by the look that came into his eyes.</p><p>He walked into her closet and ripped her precious few items off the hangers and walked over to her dresser and took out the few pairs of her underclothing she\u2019d brought with her. He tossed it all on the bed and stalked towards her.</p><p>She backed up, like anyone would do when a predator was coming towards them. She was terrified and yet incredibly aroused at the same time. He was so masculine and she couldn\u2019t tear her gaze away from him.</p><p>\u201cTake them off,\u201d he said in a deadly calm voice.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life,\u201d she spat back but her words were bellied by the breathless quality to her voice. He walked up to her and yanked the shirt off, then tossed her on the bed, which caused her to gasp. He pulled her jeans off next, leaving her in nothing but her bra and panties. She was incredibly grateful she was wearing one of the pairs the girls had made her get or she was sure he would\u2019ve ripped those off as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was breathing heavily, as his eyes raked over her exposed skin. Catching her by surprise, he stooped down and grabbed the clothes he\u2019d taken off her, then walked out of the room. It took her a few moments before the shock wore off and then she went in search of something to cover herself. She couldn\u2019t go chasing him through the house in nothing but her underclothes.</p><p>By the time she got a robe on and followed him down the stairs, she couldn\u2019t find him anywhere. Suddenly a smell hit her and she gasped again. He wouldn\u2019t dare, she thought, as she made a dash towards the back yard. Her eyes widened in shock and fury, as she saw what he was doing. She came running out the door and he turned and gave her a victorious smile.</p><p>He was standing in front of the huge fire pit they used for bonfires and her clothes were going up in flames. She couldn\u2019t believe he would burn her clothes. He must\u2019ve doused them in gasoline first because the flames were huge. There was no chance she could salvage them.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you burn my clothes,\u201d she yelled, fury making her see red. He then winked at her. She wanted to claw his eyes out. She was so mad, she was beyond reasonable thinking. The staff had seen what was going on and had all scurried away, no one brave enough to come between the two of them in the middle of a fight.</p> <p>\u201cI do whatever I want to do,\u201d he said in a mocking voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know what? Let\u2019s just add more fuel to the fire,\u201d she shouted. She ripped off her robe and tossed it in the flames. She then pulled her bra off and tossed it in. She was so mad she didn\u2019t even think about the fact she was stripping in the middle of the day, where anyone could possibly walk by.</p><p>Ryan watched her strip the robe, exposing her luscious breasts to him, before his brain kicked in again. Anyone could walk out the backdoor and see her standing there nearly naked. She may have been trying to prove a point but all she\u2019d done was turn his anger into complete and total desire.</p><p>He grabbed her in his arms before she could strip the panties off and then shielding her body with his own, carried her into the house and took the back stairs to their bedroom. She yelled and pounded on him with her fists the entire way, which only fueled his desire. He would tame her in the best way he could possibly imagine.</p><p>He unceremoniously tossed her onto their bed and she was so stunned it gave him a few precious seconds to strip himself. When she realized what he was doing, she quickly tried to scramble off the bed but he grabbed her and pinned her beneath him. Her hands were locked above her head and he was fully pressed into her nearly naked body. The only thing stopping him from sinking deep inside her heat was a tiny scrap of silk.</p> <p>He was so throbbing hard, he was sure he could rip through the tiny piece of material. They glared at one another, locked there on the bed. She squirmed underneath him, which only caused his erection to jump with painful intensity.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch me, you arrogant pig,\u201d she said through clenched teeth. He would\u2019ve come to his senses and let her go if he would\u2019ve seen fear in her eyes or even pure fury. But he saw desire quickly consuming her and it showed in her very readable face. He could feel her nipples, which were obviously peaked into hard nubs pressing against his chest. They both had a light sheen of sweat breaking out on their bodies and neither of them was breathing normally.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch you like this?\u201d he questioned her and moved his mouth down to her neck, where he gently bit down on the sensitive skin where her shoulder met her smooth throat. He licked the spot and ran open mouthed kisses along her neck and up her throat. He licked the edge of her lips but didn\u2019t kiss her quite yet.</p><p>\u201cOr like this?\u201d he said huskily, as he ground his hips into the heat between her thighs. She was shaking beneath him and he could see she was trying to fight herself far harder than she was trying to fight him.</p><p>\u201cOr this?\u201d he growled, before he finally connected their mouths and slipped his tongue inside. He still had her hands pinned above her head and her squirming began in earnest but for an entirely different reason than before.</p><p>Her anger had fled and now she was writhing underneath him in pleasure. He released her hands and she moved them into his hair to pull him closer. He ripped the sides of her panties and not being able to wait a single second longer, he thrust inside her heat. She was wet and tight, showing him she was as turned on as he was.</p> <p>She may hate him at the moment but she wanted him with as much passion as he wanted her. He grabbed her hips in his hands, so he could angle her heat up higher. He wanted to be sunk so deeply inside her, he wouldn\u2019t know where he ended and she began. She was crying out in pleasure as he pounded in and out of her.</p><p>\u201cSay you want me,\u201d he growled at her. She shook her head no, even in the throes of passion she didn\u2019t want to surrender to him. He needed her surrender and as much as it caused him actual physical pain, he buried himself deeply in her and stopped moving. She squirmed underneath him, so close to her peak, needing him to move. \u201cSay it,\u201d he again demanded through clenched teeth. She glared at him through her desire filled eyes, almost sobbing with her frustration and need of him to move within her.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she finally cried out. He rewarded them both by thrusting in and out of her with so much frantic speed they both tumbled over the edge within seconds. She squeezed his erection with her intense orgasm and cried out as he spilled inside of her. It was the longest and most intense pleasure he\u2019d ever felt in his life.</p><p>After the shaking in both of their bodies stopped, he collapsed against her, not having the strength to move one muscle in his body. He was trying to simply get his breathing back under control. No woman had ever had the power to make him snap that much. He noticed she was squirming beneath him and realized he was most likely crushing her under his weight. Hell, he weighed more than twice as much as her. He turned their bodies, refusing to let her go.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the energy to fight him anymore, not after the intense pleasure she\u2019d just received and allowed him to keep her tucked at his side. They both fell asleep from the strenuous fight and love-making. Ryan realized he was glad it happened. He may have burned her clothing in anger but at least they were gone and the love-making alone had been worth it. He fell asleep with a smile on his face.</p><p>Nicole woke up wrapped around Ryan\u2019s body. She felt her face heat up with embarrassment. She couldn\u2019t believe the fight they had. She also couldn\u2019t believe how much she\u2019d needed him after it was all over. She\u2019d felt like she would explode if he didn\u2019t relieve the ache in her body.</p><p>She shifted slightly and tried to untangle herself from him. She wanted to run away and hide for a while. After they\u2019d both passed out, she\u2019d awoken again, only to be ravished by him with even more intensity than before. She knew it must be the middle of the night but she was wide awake and she had to get out of there.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d she heard Ryan say and his grip tightened on her body. She tensed.</p> <p>\u201cI need to use the restroom,\u201d she said in excuse. She couldn\u2019t see his face and she was glad he couldn\u2019t see hers because she knew it was flaming scarlet in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come and hunt you down if you aren\u2019t back in less than five minutes,\u201d he warned her, before finally releasing her from his arms. Nicole quickly ran to the bathroom, where she washed her face and stared at herself in the mirror.</p><p>She ignored his threat and jumped into the shower. The hot water cascading over her sore muscles caused a groan to escape her lips. The water felt wonderful. She knew Ryan was going to be irritated but she didn\u2019t care about anything at that moment except for the water running down her skin.</p><p>Ryan heard the shower start and sat up with irritation. The insufferable woman had to defy him no matter what he said. He figured after yesterday she would take him a bit more seriously. He looked at the clock and saw it was two in the morning.</p><p>His stomach growled, reminding him they\u2019d both missed dinner. He threw a robe on and ran down to the kitchen, loaded up a tray with food and dashed back to their room. He was relieved when he heard the shower still running. He was beginning to enjoy chasing his woman.</p><p>He set the tray on the bed, stripped the robe off and headed into the bathroom to join her in the shower. He could feed both of his hungers in a few minutes time.</p><p>Nicole gasped when Ryan\u2019s arms came around her in the shower. She shouldn\u2019t have been surprised he would follow her in but she\u2019d been just about finished and figured he\u2019d fallen back asleep. She\u2019d planned on sneaking downstairs.</p><p>Ryan said nothing to her. He simply took her in his arms and reminded her she was his woman, or at least her body belonged to him. The things he did to her, made it almost worth being under his power.</p><p>They climbed from the shower together and he wrapped her in a huge fluffy towel. She enjoyed his towels and didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever be able to go back to the scratchy kind, which had never bothered her before.</p><p>When she stepped into the room, she was embarrassed by the loud growling in her stomach the smell of the food caused. Ryan raised his brow at her and gave her a smile. She chose to ignore him and made a dash for the food. She didn\u2019t care how it made her look.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you actually start listening to me?\u201d Ryan asked her in such a conversational tone of voice it took a few moments for the words to actually sink in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your possession, your call-girl, or your employee and therefore I don\u2019t have to listen to you,\u201d she stated back at him in the same conversational tone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t hold your breath in anticipation of that. No, wait a minute, go ahead and do just that. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t take too long,\u201d she said sugary sweet and batted her eyes at him.</p><p>Ryan laughed out loud. He really could get used to her being a part of his life on a permanent basis. She was good for his huge ego, or at least for taking it down a notch or two. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever get her tamed but he was sure going to enjoy trying.</p><p>They finished up the food and Ryan shut the light off and pulled her down next to him. Unbelievably, he was still tired. He never slept more than about six hours a night but he had a feeling by the time they got up it would be more likely ten hours that particular night.</p><p>Nicole held herself stiffly in his arms to show her stubbornness but that got too uncomfortable for her and after a while she finally relaxed and they both fell asleep.</p><p>Ryan knew they\u2019d both won some of the smaller battles that evening but over-all he\u2019d won the war. He\u2019d gotten exactly what he wanted, with her in his bed. He\u2019d make sure he woke up with her still in his arms. It may have been a small thing but to him it was a matter of a stick being drawn in the sand and her learning not to cross it.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no way I\u2019m going to another one of those parties with you and that\u2019s final,\u201d Nicole said. She placed her arms across her chest and glared at Ryan.</p><p>\u201cWe have an agreement and if I want to parade you around to ten of those parties a week, you won\u2019t only go but you\u2019ll do it with a smile plastered across your face,\u201d he yelled at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hadn\u2019t yet seen her put her foot down. He may have thought she\u2019d been stubborn before but the last party he\u2019d made her attend had been miserable and the women had been piranhas. Neither Jasmine, nor Trinity had been there and she\u2019d fought tears the entire time and wouldn\u2019t put herself through that again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about the stupid agreement. You\u2019re expecting too much,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThe only reason you were miserable at the last party was because of your own stupid stubbornness,\u201d he mocked her. She\u2019d refused to wear the dress he\u2019d purchased, or the jewelry that lined her drawer. Instead she\u2019d worn some discount dress and had looked like she should be attending a back yard barbeque. Of course the socialites had ripped her to shreds.</p><p>He\u2019d been angry with her for refusing his gifts and ignored her most of the night and they\u2019d both walked away from the evening ticked off. He didn\u2019t even want to go to the stupid party they were fighting about but accepted the invitation because he wanted to punish her. He knew it was stupid but she had a way of really getting under his skin.</p> <p>\u201cWell you can take your party and stick it up your...\u201d he didn\u2019t let her finish her words. He grabbed her in his arms and smashed his mouth down on hers. She angered him more than any other woman but she also ignited his passion just as strongly.</p><p>It was several minutes before he found the will power to release her from his grasp. He held her in his arms, satisfied by the look in her eyes. She may fight him every step of the way but when she was in his arms her body betrayed her. She wanted him as much as he wanted her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be ready by seven tonight,\u201d he told her and walked from the room. She smiled at the closed door. He really had another thing coming if he thought he\u2019d get his way. If he didn\u2019t like how she was behaving, then he could kick her out. She didn\u2019t like the feeling that thought caused in her gut. She may think he was a pompous jerk half the time but he was also the boy she\u2019d loved more than any other.</p><p>What really scared her was falling for the man he now was. He was beautiful, caring, family-oriented, and made love with so much passion she never wanted to let him go afterward.</p><p>Nicole got ready for work and left her room. She crept down the stairs, grateful he was nowhere around. She jumped into her car with a smile. Her car was another point of contention between them. He\u2019d actually had the gall to go out and buy her a new car. It sat untouched in his oversized garage. She refused to drive it. She really wanted to, more than she would ever let him know but she was too afraid she would like it more than she should.</p> <p>It was a beautiful sparkly red convertible with all the bells and whistles and if he\u2019d been in love with her, she would\u2019ve been more than happy to accept the generous gift but that wasn\u2019t the case. It was a gift for a mistress and she couldn\u2019t accept it without feeling horrible about herself. Because of this, she wouldn\u2019t accept anything he tried to buy for her. If she caved in even once, she\u2019d lose a piece of herself and she couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>He was already getting her in his bed every night and she loved each minute, though she wouldn\u2019t admit it to him. She was beginning to want what she could never have. She turned the key in her ignition and smiled victoriously when the motor turned over and started.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a real good girl,\u201d she praised her car. It drove her sister nuts when she talked to the car like it was a human being but she didn\u2019t care. She figured her words of praise were the only things keeping her car going.</p><p>She drove to work, only a few miles away, thankfully, and felt her tension evaporate. She loved working with Jasmine and Trinity at their shop. It was an amazing place with a caf\u00e9, floral department and unique gifts. She couldn\u2019t imagine how satisfying it must be for them to know it was theirs and no one could take it away.</p><p>She knew their husbands had more money than they would ever spend and they didn\u2019t need to work but they, like her, needed something of their own.</p><p>\u201cGood morning Nicole, how are you today?\u201d Trinity said, as she walked in the door.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m great, how about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful. Now, come sit with us and have some breakfast. Jasmine just made the most incredible pastries I\u2019ve ever eaten in my life,\u201d Trinity demanded. Nicole felt a bit guilty sitting on the job. She didn\u2019t want to take advantage of her friends, who\u2019d been kind enough to give her a job.</p><p>\u201cI really should get to work,\u201d she told them.</p><p>\u201cNonsense. As you can see, we don\u2019t have any customers right now and the whole idea of having a place like this is so we can have our own place to gossip and get away from the house,\u201d Jasmine said. She set an overflowing plate of pastries on the table with a pot of specialty made coffee. The delicious aroma filled every breathable space in the store. Nicole was sure she was going to gain a hundred pounds while working with the girls. She\u2019d never before had a job where she had so much down time.</p><p>\u201cI think my clothes are fitting tighter just being in here,\u201d she said with a laugh. The women chatted for a while, enjoying each other\u2019s company. A couple of the other employee\u2019s came in and moved around the shop but it was a really casual atmosphere.</p><p>\u201cSo, if you could do anything, what would it be?\u201d Trinity asked her. Nicole missed the sly look between the two women.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to have some place like this, actually. This is amazing. I\u2019d enjoy having my own scrapbooking store, someday. I haven\u2019t had time to create any albums of my own in years. The cost to get set up is expensive and with as much as I\u2019ve always worked, I couldn\u2019t justify spending the money,\u201d she said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, it\u2019s so interesting you mention that because Jasmine and I have talked about expanding and bringing in more products,\u201d Trinity said with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be so great if you brought in scrapbooking supplies. I know you wouldn\u2019t regret it. It\u2019s such a popular craft. I know you don\u2019t need money but it\u2019s a huge earning potential. I\u2019d love to help you pick out some products and I could even teach some of the classes,\u201d Nicole said with real enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cHow about if you\u2019re running your own scrapbooking store,\u201d Jasmine told her. Nicole was filled with a desire she didn\u2019t even want to think about. There was no way she could take on her own business. She would never be able to get the loans and if it failed, as so many small businesses did, she\u2019d never be able to recover. She already owed Ryan her left arm and leg. She couldn\u2019t pay for a business and pay him back too.</p><p>\u201cThat would be such a dream, but now isn\u2019t the right time in my life to go into such a huge investment,\u201d Nicole told them sadly.</p><p>\u201cWell, you have two new best friends who already own the space. It wouldn\u2019t take Ryan long to build an addition and you have nothing to lose as we\u2019re already established. We\u2019re going to invest in you because we know beyond a shadow of a doubt you\u2019ll excel at it,\u201d Trinity told her. Nicole\u2019s eyes filled with tears at the confidence her friends had in her. It was such an overwhelming feeling, leaving her speechless.</p><p>She finally got up and gave them each a huge hug. She couldn\u2019t keep the tear from sliding down her face at having met two women who were so caring and wonderful. She really wished she\u2019d known Jasmine more during their school years because she had the feeling they would\u2019ve been inseparable.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, I really do and maybe later I can think about doing that but not right now. For now, I\u2019ll help the two of you because I love working here,\u201d Nicole told them. \u201cNow, I have to use the restroom,\u201d she added and made her escape, before she burst into tears.</p><p>Jasmine and Trinity waited until she was out of earshot to make plans. They knew she wanted it but was scared. They were determined to give her something she could be proud of. Jasmine called Ryan and told him they wanted him to build on an addition. They didn\u2019t tell him what it was for, either. They couldn\u2019t risk any chance of Nicole finding out about it until the moment it was ready.</p><p>They would certainly be keeping her busy over the next month with purchasing all the supplies to fill the new addition. The girls could hardly wait.</p><p>Nicole finished her day and headed out of the shop. Trinity and Jasmine left earlier and she\u2019d drug her feet, not wanting to get back to the house early and fight with Ryan.</p><p>She jumped into her car and it started once again, making her incredibly happy. It was just starting to get dark out and she was feeling really tired. She wanted a hot bath and her soft bed. She got a few miles down the road and her car spluttered and died. She coasted it to the side of the road and tried to get it going for about fifteen minutes. She finally gave up and settled for walking. The place was only about a couple more miles but it may as well have been twenty with the exhaustion she felt.</p><p>She was creeped out by the dark and had to take a few deep breaths, to work up the courage for her trek. She got out of the car and started walking along the side of the road. A few cars passed by her but she kept her head down and they kept going. She would never get in the car with a stranger, no matter how harmless they looked or how great the neighborhood seemed.</p><p>Ryan paced by the door, waiting for her to come in. When she was still not there by six he called the shop. There was no answer and he knew she must have left at least an hour earlier. He was beyond angry she\u2019d gone somewhere else. He grabbed his keys and decided to go searching for her. Of course, she refused to take the cell phone he\u2019d gotten her. She refused to use anything he got her. She only wore the bare minimum of clothes he\u2019d purchased because he\u2019d burned all her original clothes. He didn\u2019t regret doing that, especially considering how the night ended.</p><p>He drove down the route he knew she\u2019d take home and passed right by her, walking on the side of the road because he hadn\u2019t expected her to be there. When he reached her car, he started to panic a bit. He jumped out of his car and walked over to the piece of junk. He knew it was going to eventually leave her stranded. It was infuriating she wouldn\u2019t use the perfectly good car he\u2019d bought her. Well, her rusted car was heading to the junk yard and there was nothing else she could do but drive the car he\u2019d bought.</p><p>He drove back the way he\u2019d come, much slower, praying he\u2019d spot her and nothing bad had happened. He saw her about a mile from her car and breathed a sigh of relief. He pulled up next to her and opened his door.</p><p>\u201cGet in, Nicole,\u201d he told her through clenched teeth. She should never have been in that death trap in the first place and seeing her walking along the dark road pushed his short temper over the edge of reason.</p><p>Nicole took one look at Ryan\u2019s face and decided there was no way she was getting in his car. She was still mad at him about their earlier fight and his tone set her own temper to the boiling point.</p><p>\u201cNo thank you,\u201d she said and picked up her pace. Ryan was so stunned by her refusal, she got a few yards ahead of him before he snapped out of it and gunned the engine. He pulled in front of her and leapt from the car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He said nothing else to her, as he didn\u2019t trust his voice. He simply picked her up and threw her over his shoulder. Nicole immediately started pounding on his back and demanded he put her down. They were both breathing heavily by the time he dumped her into his passenger seat. She tried to get back out of the car and he saw red.</p><p>\u201cI swear to you Nicole, if you get out of this car, I\u2019ll tie you down in the trunk,\u201d he threatened her. He leaned over her, his face only inches from her own. She knew he meant what he said. She decided not to test him. She sat back, with her arms across her chest and stared out the window, refusing to speak to him.</p><p>Ryan drove increasingly fast toward home. He wanted to throttle her so he knew it wasn\u2019t a good idea for them to remain alone. He knew he\u2019d never physically abuse her but he still may say something he\u2019d regret at a later time.</p><p>They arrived at the house and he got out of the car and came around her side before she even had the chance to unbuckle her seatbelt. She glared as he reached over and unsnapped it, then took her arm and led her inside.</p> <p>She tried to pull away from him but he wasn\u2019t letting that happen. He pulled her after him, straight into the den. He pushed her onto the couch and glared, letting her know she needed to stay exactly where she was. He walked to the liquor cabinet and poured himself a generous amount of bourbon and gulped it down. The burning feeling, as it washed down his throat, eased his temper. He took a deep breath and headed to the phone.</p><p>Nicole watched him wearily, as he picked it up. He spoke for a few minutes before she realized what he was doing. He\u2019d called a wrecking yard and ordered her car to be destroyed. She came unglued.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you have my car destroyed? You call them back right now and tell them I want it going to the shop,\u201d she demanded of him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no chance in hell you\u2019re driving that car again. Do you know what could\u2019ve happened to you out there on that dark road? You\u2019re incredibly lucky it was me who found you and not some sick and demented fool,\u201d he yelled right back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t call it lucky, you being the one to come to my rescue. I would\u2019ve rather taken my chances with a psycho,\u201d she said, too angry to even think about what she was saying. He was getting rid of her car and there was no way she would drive his, so she would be without transportation.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re pushing me to the ends of my limit, Nicole,\u201d he said, as he stalked towards her.</p><p>\u201cGood, then maybe you\u2019ll figure it out and leave me the heck alone,\u201d she shouted. Ryan completely lost his temper. He was trying to do everything to make sure she and her sister were comfortable and she didn\u2019t appreciate a damn thing. He was standing close to her and lifted his hand quickly in the air, in a show of frustration and what happened then would change his life forever.</p><p>Nicole saw his hand rising towards her and terror took over. She cried out, with real fear and dropped to the ground, cowering. It had been so many years since she\u2019d been beaten she\u2019d forgotten you couldn\u2019t get a man that angry. She rolled up on the ground in a fetal position, her mind back to those teenager years when her father had beaten her so bad she would black out.</p><p>Ryan stood there in complete shock, his hand still in the air. He looked at Nicole and saw she was truly terrified. She had a haunted expression on her face and he knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, someone had beaten her. They\u2019d not only beaten her, but had done it so badly she was no longer in control of herself, from just the thought of him hitting her.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s temper evaporated instantly and all he wanted to do was protect her, even if it was from himself. He\u2019d never in his life even thought about hitting a woman but she didn\u2019t know that. He didn\u2019t even think she knew exactly who he was at that moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, Nicole. I don\u2019t care how bad we\u2019re fighting, or how angry I am. I\u2019d never hurt you. Do you understand?\u201d he asked her softly. She wouldn\u2019t look at him. She was in her own world right then. \u201cI\u2019m going to take you upstairs,\u201d he told her in the same soft tone. He didn\u2019t want to scare her any more than he already had.</p> <p>He needed answers to what had happened to her. He may have appeared calm on the outside but inside he was a madman. He wanted to rip the person apart who\u2019d dared to lay a hand on her. Had it been an ex-boyfriend? It was the only answer that made sense to him. How could she have allowed a man to beat her? It had to have happened for quite a long time because terror like that didn\u2019t come from a one-time occurrence.</p><p>He scooped her into his arms and she let out a little protest but then lay silently against his chest as he carried her up the stairs. He placed her on the bed and went into her bathroom, where he drew a hot bath. He added some different salts and beads, remembering his cousins once said their wives liked to relax with a soothing bubble bath. He figured it would help her and he was willing to do anything to get that haunted look from her eyes.</p><p>He even lit a few candles, bringing a comforting ambiance. He knew she loved to take candlelit bubble baths and hoped it would help.</p><p>Once the tub was ready, he stepped back into the bedroom and found her still lying on the bed. She looked a bit better but her face was still white and he wasn\u2019t happy he\u2019d been the one to make her look that way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to undress you now. I have a bath ready for you. I think it will help calm your nerves,\u201d he told her, speaking softly. She said nothing as he started pulling her clothes off. He stripped her quickly and for once the sight of her body didn\u2019t send him over the edge of insanity. He wanted nothing more than to console her.</p><p>He carried her into the bathroom, gently lowering her into the tub. She sunk into the water and a sigh escaped her throat. He didn\u2019t want to leave her but he needed some answers and he was sure he wouldn\u2019t get them out of her, so he needed to seek out Patsy.</p><p>\u201cWill you be okay in here?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Ryan. I\u2019m sorry about that. I think I\u2019m just tired. I know you\u2019d never hit me,\u201d she said, trying to sound casual but not pulling it off. He bent down and gently took her lips with his, needing to reassure them both that everything was going to be okay.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d he told her and walked from the room. He left the door open a crack and told the housekeeper to keep an eye on her. He also had the cook send up something for her to snack on, while in the tub. He knew she\u2019d be back to normal soon.</p><p>Ryan walked down the hall and knocked on Patsy\u2019s door. He was amazed but a smile came to his face because her music was playing so loud she couldn\u2019t have heard anything. He hated to open her door and invade her privacy but he needed to talk to her. He cracked the door and peaked inside and she was in the middle of the room, dancing around to some obnoxious song coming from the stereo system he\u2019d bought her. At least she appreciated his gifts, he thought.</p><p>He smiled, watching her for a few minutes, loving the happy expression on her face. She was a great kid and he was glad her life was a bit more comfortable. She swung around and spotted him there, a pink flush coming to her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear you come in,\u201d she said a bit sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. I knocked but I don\u2019t think you would\u2019ve heard if the house had come falling down around you,\u201d he told her a little too loudly since that was the only way she could hear him.</p><p>She walked over to her radio and turned the volume down. There was still a bit of ringing in his ears and he prayed the horrible song she was listening to didn\u2019t get stuck in his head. He thought he really must be getting old because there was a time he would\u2019ve blasted the radio just as loudly and danced along with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up Ryan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if we could talk for a few minutes. Can you come downstairs, with me?\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t want to get lost in her chaotic room. She was certainly not a clean freak but what teenager was?</p><p>\u201cSure, I was starting to crave some chocolate, anyway,\u201d she agreed and followed him to the kitchen. He waited while she grabbed some brownies and milk and sat at the table with him. The cook had long ago discovered her love of brownies and always made sure to have fresh ones ready, daily. The entire staff had fallen in love with both Patsy and Nicole.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you about Nicole. She won\u2019t want to talk to me about it but I need to know, so I can help her,\u201d he said to Patsy, making sure she was looking at him and could understand what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know about the beatings, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked him, completely shocking him. She said it in almost a casual tone but he could see the pain behind her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said to her. He didn\u2019t know what else he could say, so he sat back and waited for her to speak. She looked at her plate, then pushed it away as if she\u2019d lost her appetite. He could relate to that. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to ever eat again.</p><p>\u201cIt started when she was still pretty young,\u201d Patsy began and he was shocked. Who the hell would\u2019ve beaten her when she was young? He simply couldn\u2019t comprehend what she was telling him. \u201cWhen dad lost his job, he sunk to an all-time low. He was always grouchy and kind of cruel with his words but when he lost work, he started taking it out on Nicole. Mom was a drunk and didn\u2019t help at home. As I got older, he started noticing me more, but Nicole always got between us. She never once allowed him to hit me but that just meant she took twice as much. I know he cracked a few of her bones and she was always black and blue,\u201d she said, as a tear tracked down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cHe was really careful to never hit her in the face though. He couldn\u2019t let anyone see how he was terrorizing her. I begged for her to let me tell someone but she said she\u2019d take it until she turned eighteen. Then she\u2019d be able to look after me. She said if we ever told anyone they\u2019d put us in foster care and we wouldn\u2019t be in the same home. She was always so strong too, she never screamed, or even cried out. Her tears would fall which that bastard seemed to really enjoy. It seemed his whole purpose in life was to break her but she was so strong. He never really did break her. I think she hurt far more when you were no longer a part of her life, than when he hit her,\u201d Patsy finished. Tears were now soaking her face and he handed her napkins.</p><p>\u201cI never knew,\u201d he said painfully.</p><p>\u201cNobody knew because that\u2019s how she wanted it. When we left, neither of us ever looked back and when they died, neither of us cried. We didn\u2019t feel any loss. To tell you the truth, we both felt safer knowing there was no chance he could come after us again. If it wouldn\u2019t have been for Nicole he would\u2019ve broken me. I\u2019m not nearly as strong as her and I couldn\u2019t have taken the beatings, like she did. I tried though, Ryan, I really did. I tried to come between them but she\u2019d lock me out of her room and I\u2019d hear him through the doorway, hitting her over and over again,\u201d she said, openly sobbing. She couldn\u2019t talk any more.</p><p>Ryan pulled her onto his lap and rubbed her back, trying to comfort her the best way he knew how. His gut hurt so much, he didn\u2019t know how he wasn\u2019t throwing up. He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d never known what she\u2019d gone through. It was beyond a nightmare and he\u2019d done nothing in the last several months, except to terrify her more. He felt like the lowest human being on the earth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She must hate him and God help him but he still couldn\u2019t set her free. He was certainly going to change a few things but he needed her in his life. He needed to see her when he walked in the door, he needed to hear her voice ringing out through the hallways and he needed to smell her sweet scent. He couldn\u2019t free her but he knew she may leave eventually. She\u2019d already been through hell and didn\u2019t need to live it for the rest of her life.</p><p>He rocked Patsy in his arms, while she sobbed out her own pain. He couldn\u2019t imagine the terror she\u2019d gone through herself. She\u2019d only been a toddler when all that had occurred. He guessed the fates had stepped in to save them both. He wished her father was still alive because he\u2019d never wanted to seriously harm someone as badly as he wanted to at that moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay now,\u201d Patsy gulped, as she looked at him with her innocent eyes. She seemed more like twelve than sixteen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you went through all that and I\u2019m even sorrier I wasn\u2019t there for you,\u201d he told her, fighting to not show his own pain.</p> <p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have been there for us. She didn\u2019t allow anyone to help her shoulder the pain,\u201d Patsy told him. He knew she was right but it sure didn\u2019t make him feel any better. When she\u2019d sent him walking, he\u2019d never looked back. He hadn\u2019t wanted to show her any weakness and because of that, she\u2019d been hurt.</p><p>He swore to make it up to her. He would make sure her life was so much better than it ever had been before. She\u2019d never have to worry about money problems or where she was going to sleep. She\u2019d never have a single worry again. He smiled wryly at himself thinking about how well that conversation would go over.</p><p>He\u2019d make sure she and her sister were okay and her love of Patsy is what he would use to get her to accept his offerings. He knew she\u2019d already gone to the ends of the earth for her sister and he also knew she\u2019d continue to do so the rest of her life.</p><p>Her sacrifices weren\u2019t even sacrifices in her own eyes. She believed everyone would do the same thing for their family. She was so wrong. Most people he\u2019d ever known didn\u2019t give a lick about anyone or anything but themselves. She was an exception.</p><p>Patsy finally pulled herself together and he went back into the den to have another drink. He had to calm down again before he saw her. Patsy had promised not to tell Nicole of their conversation. He hated to have her sister keep secrets from her but he also didn\u2019t want her defensive because he knew her secrets. He had to be careful not to act too differently around her, or she\u2019d be furious. She obviously didn\u2019t want to be pitied and she didn\u2019t want to be a martyr.</p> <p>He finally had himself under control enough to walk up the stairs. He\u2019d been gone over an hour and was shocked to find her still in the tub. She was lying back in the water but she was awake. He walked in and groaned, as the bubbles were quickly fading. He reached in and felt the water had cooled off so he turned the faucet on hot to re-warm the tub.</p><p>\u201cI can do that myself,\u201d she said, bringing her knees up to her chest in modesty. He looked at her with his brows raised high. She was hiding not only what he\u2019d seen many times over but licked, sucked and done just about everything imaginable too. As if she could read his thoughts, her cheeks turned scarlet and she quickly looked away.</p><p>He released some of the cooler water and soon the tub was back up to a nice temperature and full of new bubbles. She relaxed her body eyeing him warily. He blew out his breath, reminding himself to not act differently. What would he have done before his world had been knocked off of its axis? That was easy. He would\u2019ve joined her in the tub.</p><p>He gave her a very seductive smile and began stripping his clothing off. She looked at him in shock and he could see she was trying to decide whether to stay in the safety of her bubbles, or jump out of the tub. He really hoped she stayed.</p><p>He got his clothes off, not even trying to hide his desire for her and stepped into the tub. He moved her forward and sat down behind her, quickly pulling her into his arms. It was like coming home. She leaned against him tensely for a few moments and when he didn\u2019t try doing anything other than hold her, she finally started to relax.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go to that party anyway,\u201d he said, as if not attending was his idea.</p> <p>\u201cHa,\u201d she said, with a jerk of her shoulder. He had to fight off the smile. He loved how she had to have the last word and he loved how he could wipe all words from her. He began rubbing his hands against her stomach. He felt the shudder run through her body and his worries started melting away.</p><p>His hands soon traveled up her soapy body, until they gripped her incredibly luscious breasts. He rubbed her hardened nipples between his fingers, causing her to gasp out loud. He was incredibly aroused at that point and couldn\u2019t imagine a time when she wouldn\u2019t turn his brain to mush.</p><p>His hands kept stroking her, making moans of pleasure escape her body. He wanted her supple and willing to concede to his every wish, before he started the conversation he wanted to have with her. It was really hard to use sex as a way to get what he wanted though because the second he touched her, his own mind went out the window and he tended to forget what he wanted to talk about.</p><p>She pushed her body back against him and he was the one who let a moan escape. She was slippery and wet and he was beyond ready to join their bodies together. He leaned forward and kissed along her slender neck, nipping and licking the tender skin. He loved the taste and smell of her. His one hand continued to massage her breast, while his other hand slipped lower on her body, finding her aching nub and making her cry out in pleasure. It didn\u2019t take him long, rubbing her swollen womanhood, before she began shaking in pleasure.</p><p>He slid his fingers inside her moist heat and felt her contractions grip him, as she flew over the edge in ecstasy. She was so responsive to his every touch he should\u2019ve known he never could count on having a conversation in the middle of love-making.</p><p>He quickly turned her body around so she was straddling him and took her ripe nipple into his mouth. He had to taste her skin; he had to feel her heartbeat against him. He had to have her right then.</p><p>He lifted her hips above his straining erection and slowly lowered her on his shaft. He groaned, as her heat surrounded him. She was so tight, wet and hot he couldn\u2019t hold off. She took over for him and braced her hands on his shoulders, moving her hips up and down on his thick shaft.</p><p>He grabbed her head, bringing it down to his, needing to drink from her lips. He thrust his tongue inside her soft mouth, tasting her and tangling their tongues together. He held her back so she was smashed up against him. Her breasts were rubbing against his chest, causing lightening to shoot down his entire body. She moved her hips faster and faster, up and down his throbbing shaft. He could feel her body getting even tighter, as she neared orgasm again. She was so unbelievably responsive.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t tear his lips away from hers. He kept greedily drinking, as she kept up the intense rhythm of their love-making.</p><p>Suddenly, she ripped her head away and cried out, as her body grabbed him so tightly, it was almost painful for him. She was gripping him over and over again with the strength of her release, sending him spiraling out of control. He moved his hands down to grip her hips, as he surged into her as far as he could go and shot his release deep within her. He could feel himself pumping repeatedly, giving her every single ounce of himself.</p><p>The orgasm was so powerful, it felt as if a very piece of his soul had departed him and seeped into her. She truly owned him, if only she knew. There was nothing in the world he wouldn\u2019t do for her. He prayed she never knew that because it may end up destroying him, if the one thing she asked for was to be set free.</p><p>He pulled her head down to his shoulder, not wanting her to see into his eyes but needing her to be next to him. He needed them to be skin to skin with his body inside her, never moving from that position. He stroked her back, as they both enjoyed the aftermath. Neither of them was willing to speak or break the moment. Their conversation would have to wait until later.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll use the stupid car then,\u201d Nicole said, as she threw her hands up in frustration. She\u2019d called a cab to pick her up and take her to work and when Ryan found out he flipped.</p><p>Ryan had sent one of his security men to the gate, to pay the driver and send him on his way. There was no way in hell he was letting her call a cab when she had a vehicle to drive.</p><p>He\u2019d blocked her entrance at the front door and wasn\u2019t moving an inch on the matter. If she wanted to leave the house, it was going to be in the car he\u2019d bought her. He stood there, blocking the door, with the keys dangling from his fingers and a smug look on his face. She\u2019d finally backed down and let him have his way.</p><p>\u201cWas that really so hard?\u201d he practically growled at her.</p><p>\u201cYes, it was, and thanks for asking,\u201d she mocked him. He wanted to bend her over his knee. Of course, that thought got his mind going in the wrong direction and he was already late for a board meeting. He had to hurry and get his work finished at the office so he could get over to the shop and meet the architect for the remodel work Jasmine requested. He found it amusing he\u2019d much rather be doing that than sitting in his office.</p><p>Nicole didn\u2019t know he\u2019d be at her work place later that day and he was looking forward to surprising her. He didn\u2019t think it was going to be a surprise she was delighted about but that was just too bad for her.</p><p>Nicole grabbed the keys from him, with a little huff and marched out to the garage, with him right on her heels. He loved watching the sway of her hips as she walked away from him, especially when she was in a tiff and the movements were more pronounced.</p><p>\u201cAre you stalking me now?\u201d she asked, as she stepped through the garage door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving for work too,\u201d he informed her and chuckled. That earned him another glare.</p><p>\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll see you later,\u201d she said and reached for her car door. He spun her around and kissed her long and hard, leaving her breathless.</p><p>\u201cThink about that today,\u201d he said, then jumped in his car and drove away. Nicole stood there dazed for a few moments and blew out her breath in frustration. The man got under her skin in seconds. He evoked powerful emotions in her, whether it was anger, lust, or happiness. He didn\u2019t do anything half-way.</p><p>She pulled onto the street and had to stop a couple miles down the road at a drug store. She\u2019d put off taking a pregnancy test for a ridiculous amount of time and knew it was time. She was terrified to confirm what she already knew in her heart but she had to do it. She wouldn\u2019t take the test at home where Ryan could read her face like a book.</p><p>She walked out of the store, with the test safely stored in her handbag and had to control her breathing. What scared her more than knowing the truth was how much she wanted the baby. At first she\u2019d been terrified to think she was pregnant and then as the thought sunk in that she was most likely carrying Ryan\u2019s baby she\u2019d been overwhelmed with joy.</p><p>She knew beyond a shadow of a doubt her love for Ryan had never gone away. She\u2019d loved him with the innocence of a child and since living with him that had grown into an adult\u2019s deep and binding love. She knew he didn\u2019t love her and that knowledge was enough to destroy her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She knew he desired her and in the months they\u2019d been together, that desire had turned into a red hot inferno. It seemed neither of them could get enough of each other but that wasn\u2019t enough to make a relationship work, especially with a baby on the way. She had such mixed feelings over the test. She wanted the baby with an overwhelming desire but at the same time was terrified of what that would mean between Ryan and her.</p><p>She walked into the shop and for once was grateful neither Jasmine nor Trinity was there. They were as bad as Ryan at reading her every expression and she really needed time to take her test and deal with the emotions to follow, whether the answer was yes, or no.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wait even a second longer and headed straight for the bathroom. Shakily she read the instructions, then sat with the small stick sitting on the edge of the sink. She waited a full ten minutes before getting the courage to grab the stick again and see what the results were.</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears and overflowed down her cheeks but they were not tears of sadness, or even terror. They were tears of complete joy. She\u2019d already known the answer, so she really didn\u2019t see why the stick turning blue should be able to fill her with so much emotion but it was a confirmation that she was carrying Ryan\u2019s baby within her womb.</p> <p>By the size of her stomach, she figured she was several months along already too. She was surprised he hadn\u2019t said anything about her weight gain. Actually, looking back, he\u2019d made a comment she was so much healthier and her body was even more attractive to him. She smiled as she thought how his tune would change when she was as big as a whale.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready to share her secret with anyone yet, so she stayed in the bathroom a while longer. She had to get control over her features, or the girls would know for sure something was up. She buried the test in the bottom of the garbage can and walked out.</p><p>Jasmine had arrived but was literally buried to her elbows in batter, so she couldn\u2019t follow Nicole around, as she sometimes did. Trinity ended calling them and saying she couldn\u2019t make it in because her youngest child had a cold. Nicole knew the women loved owning their own place, most of all because it allowed them to be mothers first.</p><p>She unconsciously rubbed her hand along her stomach and thought she\u2019d love to be a full-time mother. If she could still work for them, she\u2019d get to make that a reality. The place was set up for kids, with a nursery in the back and a playground out front. It would be ideal for a new mother.</p><p>She had real hope and she wanted to shout to the world she was going to be a mother. It would be hard not to say anything to Ryan that night but she wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to share with him, yet. She didn\u2019t know how he was going to react to the news. She knew he loved children because he was amazing with his cousin\u2019s kids but he\u2019d been emphatic with her that their relationship was a temporary thing.</p> <p>A child tied them together unlike anything else and even when they went their separate ways, they would always be a part of each other\u2019s lives. It was all too complicated, so she decided to make some floral arrangements to get her mind off the situation.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Ryan said, getting Nicole\u2019s attention. She jerked in surprise and looked up with guilty eyes.</p><p>Ryan wondered what she was up to. He\u2019d stood there watching her for several minutes and she\u2019d been concentrating so hard on what she was doing she hadn\u2019t been aware of anything around her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked him suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting an architect here for the girls, they want some remodel work done,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said, seeming to breathe a relieved sigh. She really had his curiosity up. She wasn\u2019t normally one to keep secrets. If she wanted to say something, she outright said it and to hell with the consequences.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like we\u2019ll be around each other a lot because this project will take at least a couple months,\u201d he said, with a self satisfied smile. Her eyes rounded at his words. There was no way she could be around him constantly at home and at her place of work and still keep her secret to herself. She needed to tell him but didn\u2019t know how to do it.</p><p>\u201cWell, um, I need to do some stuff in the back,\u201d she said and then ran away. He was close to chasing her down and demanding to know why she was acting odd, but the man he was meeting showed up and that kept him busy for several hours.</p><p>By the time he was finished, Nicole managed to pull herself together and he knew he was getting nothing out of her. Ryan had discovered over the last several months even though she infuriated him on a continual basis he couldn\u2019t imagine living without her, or Patsy for that matter.</p><p>He looked forward to seeing them both when he walked in the door and his once empty home was filled with warmth and laughter and he didn\u2019t want it to go away. Now that he knew what she\u2019d gone through as a child he knew she hadn\u2019t left him for the reasons he\u2019d once thought. It was time to put his heart out on the table and take a gamble.</p><p>He was afraid if she rejected him again he\u2019d never be the same but he didn\u2019t want to continue on the way things had been. He didn\u2019t want her to give him everything of herself in their bed and nothing in the daylight.</p><p>\u201cI have to head back home. I\u2019ll see you in a few hours,\u201d he said. Taking her in his arms, he kissed her with so much tenderness it left tears in her eyes. Nicole stared at him with a shell-shocked expression and simply nodded at him.</p><p>Ryan walked out of the shop whistling and feeling positive about the night to come. He went home and began setting the scene for what he hoped would be a romantic night, with a very happy ending.</p><p>Nicole got held up at the shop. The girls never asked her to stay late but they\u2019d needed inventory done and asked for her help. It was eight by the time she made her way out the door. She was dead on her feet and still in shock over the pregnancy test.</p> <p>She\u2019d figured out she\u2019d simply tell him the truth and explain a baby didn\u2019t mean they needed to change things. They could come to a mutual agreement so they could both be equal participants in their child\u2019s life. She hated the thought of them being nothing more than strangers. It hurt her in ways nothing had ever hurt before.</p><p>Nicole stepped into the house and looked around in confusion. The lighting was incredibly dim and no one seemed to be about. She looked down at the floor and saw rose petals everywhere. Had someone spilled something? Had there been an accident? She followed the path and found herself in the dining room.</p><p>Nicole gasped as she saw the scene before her. Her body began to tremble and her mind refused to acknowledge what she was seeing. Ryan was standing at one end of the room in a tuxedo, which showed his impressive body off to perfection. The man really wore a tux well, she thought. He was stunning and she could barely pull her eyes away from his magnificent form.</p><p>She looked at the table that was set for seduction. There were candles burning and more rose petals strewn about. Champagne was chilling and the aroma\u2019s drifting in made her stomach growl in hunger. In the middle of it all, there was the largest rose bouquet she\u2019d ever seen. A romantic song was playing in the background causing her body to react.</p><p>\u201cWhat is all this?\u201d she asked in awe.</p><p>\u201cI thought you deserved a bit of romance,\u201d he told her, with passion burning in his eyes. It took her breath away. He\u2019d gone to so much trouble.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d she finally gasped. She felt the prickle of tears come to her eyes and quickly turned, not wanting him to see. She blamed her weak emotions on her pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cDance with me,\u201d he gently commanded and then she was in his arms. She didn\u2019t even think about resisting him. She fit into his body as if they were meant to be together. She laid her head on his masculine shoulder and he pulled her tightly against his hard body.</p><p>He smelled like home and she burrowed even closer against him. She didn\u2019t care about anything other than that moment. She needed to have this night with him, before she told him about the baby and their world changed. She knew she\u2019d look back on their night together and it would cause pain but at least she would be able to honestly tell her child how very much she was in love with her father.</p><p>Nicole had the feeling she would still be in love with him until the day she died. She\u2019d never loved another and something like that didn\u2019t just fall away. She would certainly lose a piece of her soul when he ended it.</p><p>Ryan spun her around the room in a gentle dance that was for just the two of them. He bent his head down and took her lips with his in such tender passion her heart grew to twice its normal size. She ran her hands up his neck and pulled him even closer.</p><p>He broke apart from her and took a step back, leaving her unsure and aching. He never broke contact with her and she didn\u2019t think that was a good sign. She didn\u2019t know it but she was looking at him with her heart in her eyes and Ryan knew at that moment she loved him. As long as she loved him the rest would fall into place.</p><p>\u201cI want you badly, never doubt that but tonight is about romance and if I keep kissing you dinner will be forgotten and we\u2019ll end up in bed,\u201d he growled at her. Her chest puffed up with pride. She knew it was only sex but weren\u2019t many other relationships built on so much less than that.</p><p>Ryan sat her down at the table and within moments a plate was set before her. They ate their meal and she found herself relaxing. He\u2019d gone to a lot of trouble to give her a romantic night and she was feeling the effects of it. He poured her a glass of champagne and she didn\u2019t say anything but made sure she didn\u2019t pick it up instead of her water.</p><p>Over their dessert, Ryan took her hand in his and started caressing her wrist, which immediately sent her pulse skyrocketing. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever get enough of him.</p><p>\u201cNicole, you\u2019re unlike any other woman I\u2019ve ever known and before you get all defensive, that\u2019s a good thing. You\u2019re beautiful, without a doubt but you\u2019re also compassionate, loyal, giving, passionate, stubborn and everything else any man could possibly ever want. I started this relationship wanting to punish you for leaving me. No don\u2019t try and pull away, let me finish,\u201d he said to her when she tried removing her hands.</p><p>She squirmed in her seat but stopped trying to pull away. She could hear him out but it sounded as if he was about to break up with her and she didn\u2019t know how she was going to listen to him with her heart breaking apart. She wanted to rub her stomach and somehow guard her unborn child from hearing his words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to say I screwed up. I tried to punish you for leaving me but I know what really happened. Patsy talked to me and I wish so much you would\u2019ve told me. I would have been there for you and protected you. I loved you then and I love you now and it nearly destroys me to know I wasn\u2019t there to keep you safe. I should\u2019ve been the one taking your pain. I should\u2019ve known something was wrong but I let pride get in my way. I\u2019ll never let that happen again. I\u2019m laying my heart before you, right here and now. I love you, Nicole and I can\u2019t imagine my life without you in it. Please accept my love and let me protect you for the rest of my life,\u201d he said tenderly, never breaking eye-contact. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nicole couldn\u2019t even breathe as tears trailed down her cheeks. She\u2019d thought he was breaking up with her and instead he was giving her his love. She didn\u2019t see how she deserved such an amazing man. She hated him knowing about the abuse. It made her feel weak, but as she looked into his eyes she realized he didn\u2019t think of her as weak at all. She believed he really did love her. She stared at him in wonder.</p><p>Her hand drifted up to his face. He said nothing else to her. He simply held her hand and waited for her to get her emotions under control. She stared into his eyes, looking for anything there that may belly his words. She saw nothing but love and acceptance within their depths.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Ryan. I always have and I had to send you away back then because I didn\u2019t want you to know how weak I was,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare ever say you were weak. You\u2019re the strongest person I\u2019ve ever known and you took all that punishment for your sister\u2019s sake. You took the weight of the world on your shoulders, you stubborn fool. I would\u2019ve gladly taken that weight for you but I understand why you did it. Now, you have me by your side and we can conquer anything as long as we\u2019re together,\u201d he interrupted her.</p> <p>\u201cI was a fool Ryan, I always blamed myself for the beatings and I thought you would be horrified and leave me anyway if you knew about it. I was so young,\u201d she said in explanation.</p><p>\u201cTell me again,\u201d he demanded and she knew what he wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cI love you Ryan Titan, I always have and I always will, even when you\u2019re driving me insane with your cave-man ways,\u201d she said, with true joy in her voice. She knew they\u2019d be fine. She knew her life would be okay from that day forward. He crushed her lips beneath his before she could tell him about the baby.</p><p>It was several minutes before they broke apart for air and she was left even more breathless by the pure love shining through his eyes. He suddenly let go of her and dropped to his knee. She gasped in shock and more tears tracked down her face.</p><p>\u201cMarry me, Nicole. Make me an honest man. Tell me always when I\u2019m wrong, love me day and night, give me a lot of children and let me help you fulfill all your dreams,\u201d he said with a choked up voice. She sobbed as she shook her head yes. She couldn\u2019t have gotten words past her throat if her life depended on it.</p> <p>He opened the small velvet box and she was surprised she didn\u2019t faint. He was presenting her an exquisite diamond ring. The center stone was perfect, surrounded by a beautiful pattern of smaller diamonds. She watched him take it from the box and slip it on her finger. She stared down at the sparkling ring, a symbol of his love.</p><p>\u201cI hope you like it. I had it made especially for you,\u201d he said, sounding unsure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stunning, Ryan but you didn\u2019t have to get such a large one. I would\u2019ve been happy with a simple band,\u201d she told him, meaning what she said. He looked at her as if she was insane.</p><p>\u201cIf your ring size equaled the love I feel for you, you wouldn\u2019t be able to lift your hand. I actually toned it down a bit from what I originally wanted,\u201d he said a bit sheepishly. She threw her arms around his neck and held on tightly. How could she have ever taken his generosity as controlling?</p><p>He\u2019d been showing her love all along, just in the wrong ways. He\u2019d bought her things, which she\u2019d continued to reject because it was the only way he knew how to show love. She would teach him what she really wanted and that was only him.</p><p>\u201cSo you want a lot of children, huh?\u201d she asked him slyly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love to fill this house from top to bottom with them,\u201d he said with a wicked smile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about filling the place from top to bottom but I could manage to have one in here in about five months,\u201d she said and waited for it to sink in. She watched as his eyes looked at her in confusion for a few moments and then widened as what she said dawned on him.</p><p>He looked from her eyes to her stomach and back up again and she nodded at him. His mouth parted in the biggest smile she\u2019d ever seen him give and he grabbed the hem of her shirt and lifted it out of his way. He ran his hand over her stomach, which was just barely beginning to show.</p><p>\u201cHow could I not have realized?\u201d he asked her, as his hand continued to caress the smooth surface. His rubbing wasn\u2019t meant to be sexual but he was turning her body to liquid fire with his innocent caress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve suspected for a while but just found out for sure today. At first I thought I was getting fat from all the food you\u2019ve been feeding me,\u201d she said a bit sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cI love your body. Don\u2019t ever say anything like that again. I\u2019ve enjoyed your curves and was simply so turned on by you I didn\u2019t pay attention to the changes,\u201d he said with real passion behind his words.</p><p>\u201cRyan, you\u2019re so good for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan on being there for you every day for the rest of our lives,\u201d he told her. He took her back into his arms and the talking came to an end. He carried her to their room, where he worshiped her body, noticing the slight changes his child was causing in her and more turned on than ever before, knowing they\u2019d created a life.</p> <p>They stayed up late into the night, lovemaking, talking and planning for their future together, both of them feeling a peace unlike anything either of them had ever known.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cBlow out the candles, baby,\u201d Nicole said to her two year old daughter. She couldn\u2019t believe how much her life had changed in the last few years. She was happier than she could\u2019ve ever thought possible.</p><p>The crowd erupted in applause as Jessica blew out her two candles and rewarded everyone with her precious smile and giggles.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s daddy\u2019s good girl. I can\u2019t believe how big you are,\u201d Ryan said to his daughter, before scooping her up in his arms.</p><p>He then wrapped Nicole close to him, still as passionate about her as the day they\u2019d reunited. He couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of her. She\u2019d given him the gift of his daughter, and her love, and he couldn\u2019t be any happier.</p><p>He looked around his yard, grateful for the beautiful Seattle day. There wasn\u2019t a cloud in the sky, as if the fates were shining down on them. His cousins were playing on the enormous play structure with their children. He smiled at his ever growing family.</p><p>He laughed to himself, thinking how hard he and his cousin\u2019s had fought marriage and commitments. None of them could picture their lives without their beautiful brides and to top it off, the women all got along so amazingly well together. They\u2019d quickly become best friends, sharing their shop together and motherhood.</p><p>They were all a family, closer than anyone he knew. Jasmine called Nicole over and he reluctantly let her go and watched as she laughed with the other two women. He headed over towards the play structure, where Jessica squirmed to get down and play with her cousins.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done really well, cousin,\u201d Drew said, with a satisfied smile, as his focus ran from his children to his wife.</p><p>\u201cYes we have,\u201d Ryan agreed triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how stupid we were to think life was complete without these women in it,\u201d Derek added. The three men all nodded together.</p><p>\u201cI feel like the luckiest man alive. I have an amazing wife, beautiful daughter and though Nicole wanted to wait a couple more weeks to tell you, I can\u2019t stand not sharing. She\u2019s pregnant, again,\u201d he told them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Drew said, slapping his back hard enough to send a lesser man to his knees.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Derek added with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cHow is Patsy doing?\u201d Drew asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s loving college but man do I miss her. I\u2019m glad she decided to stay closer to home but still we don\u2019t see her enough with her living on campus. I\u2019ve already had to scare the crap out of one guy who was getting far too amorous with her. She was mad at me for weeks because he won\u2019t even look at her now,\u201d Ryan said with satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve done the same thing. I can\u2019t even imagine what I\u2019m going to go through when my kids begin to date,\u201d Derek said with a narrowing of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Patsy is technically my sister-in-law but I think of her like a daughter and I swear I\u2019ll destroy any guy who tries to hurt her,\u201d he told them.</p><p>\u201cI almost feel sorry for the poor guys who try and over-step their bounds,\u201d Derek said but the look in his eyes contradicted his words. He would thoroughly enjoy terrorizing those men.</p><p>\u201cAt least we have a long time to prepare,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d both of his cousins agreed.</p><p>\u201cCome eat, boys,\u201d Trinity called and the men eagerly headed towards their wives. Nothing gave any of them greater joy than time with family. They\u2019d been wealthy but marriage and children made them richer than kings and they counted their blessings daily. </p> </body></html>"]
