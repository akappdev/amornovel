The lace edging her silk gloves fluttered as she folded her hands and placed them in a ladylike spot on her lap. \u201cIt\u2019s the only explanation.\u201d</p><p>A yawn tugged at my jaw; I swallowed it along with a mouthful of tea. \u201cIf you want an exormage, Lady Walsh, there\u2019s a small horde of them on the first floor.\u201d</p><p>Her soft brown eyes shimmered. \u201cOver the last month I\u2019ve had fifteen of them to the house. The curse rendered them powerless. They couldn\u2019t even determine the nature of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably because there is no such thing as a curse,\u201d I said as kindly as I could. I heard a familiar scratching sound at the door and collected some coppers from my drawer. \u201cExcuse me for a moment, milady. I have a delivery.\u201d</p><p>I closed the inner door to my office before I went to the entry and yanked it open. \u201cBack for another go, then, Gert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSatan\u2019s whore. I will not rest until I have sent you back to the hell that spawned you.\u201d The old woman produced a long gnarled twig and shook it at my face. \u201cWither and burn, wither and burn.\u201d</p><p>I folded my arms and waited several seconds, but neither I nor anything else burst into flames. \u201cApparently not today, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am made powerless.\u201d Gert lowered her stick and glared at me. \u201cThe Evil One protects you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, and you\u2019d think he\u2019d give me a doorman.\u201d She looked thinner and hungrier than usual. \u201cGo have some tea. You\u2019ll feel better.\u201d I offered her the coppers, which she snatched from my palm.</p><p>\u201cAbbadon\u2019s pit of eternal fire awaits you,\u201d Gert promised. \u201cYou cannot escape it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t try, I promise.\u201d I watched her hobble off and then eyed the incantation she\u2019d scribbled on the door\u2019s glass. No doubt it was meant to send me directly to some highly unpleasant level of hell, I thought as I took out my handkerchief and wiped it off. Gert always came with a backup plan for my doom.</p><p>I returned to my office, where Lady Walsh sat staring at the door. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>She regarded me with appalled fascination. \u201cYou truly don\u2019t believe in magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI truly don\u2019t.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI also have an appointment to get to downtown. Do you want me to call for your coach, or do you need a private carri?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait. Please. I can show you proof.\u201d The corkscrew curls framing her face bobbled as she began stripping off her gloves. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how difficult it\u2019s been, trying to hide this from my husband. When I woke this morning and saw them, I nearly screamed.\u201d</p><p>I tried logic. \u201cI presume your husband\u2019s first wife died before he married you?\u201d When she nodded, I asked, \u201cHow is it that would she even know about you, much less cast a curse on you from the grave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say how these spells work, Miss Kittredge, but obviously her spirit has refused to leave the house.\u201d She fiddled with a fold of her skirt. \u201cI think seeing how happy I make Nolan has caused her to become jealous and vengeful.\u201d</p><p>I was going to be late for my fictitious appointment, it seemed. \u201cI\u2019m sure an unexpected rash can seem like something malicious and supernatural in origin, especially for a woman as beautiful as you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held out her soft, pale hands, and I forgot to breathe. Someone had used a knife to carve a word below the knuckles on each: GREEDY and SLUT.</p><p>My own hands trembled before I clenched them into fists. \u201cBloody hell.\u201d She thought magic had done this, this brutal, malicious thing. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot tell you. After my husband left me last night, I slept alone with the doors and windows bolted from the inside.\u201d She stared at the marks. \u201cThe curse did this to me while I slept. I never woke, not once.\u201d</p><p>I gently took the hand marked SLUT and examined the wound. It appeared at first glance to be written in dark-red ink, but when I brushed a fingertip over the letters I felt the cut marks in her skin. \u201cHow did you explain the stains on your linens, milady?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere were none. Nothing on my gown, either. That\u2019s why it has to be magic.\u201d She watched my face. \u201cThat, and I suffer no discomfort. I can\u2019t even feel them.\u201d</p><p>Ladies were taught never to show pain, but not to feel it? \u201cWere the other incidents like this?\u201d</p><p>Her head moved in a tight nod. \u201cThe same two words every time, on the insides of my arms, the back of my neck, and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder and lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cOn my knees.\u201d</p><p>Whoever had done this hadn\u2019t used a spell\u2014more like a very thin, sharp boning knife. I knew of some salves that numbed the skin; that would explain why she didn\u2019t feel the cuts. Or if someone had slipped some drugs into her wine at dinner, and gained access to her bedchamber through a hidden door or crawlspace . . . \u201cDoes your husband have any children from his first marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree. His son and two daughters. We are all quite good friends.\u201d She hesitated before she added, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not exactly true. They want their father to be happy. They tolerate me because I do that, I make him happy.\u201d Suddenly she clutched at my hands. \u201cI know your reputation, Miss Kittredge. There is no one in the city that can dispel magic as you do. I\u2019m afraid to go to sleep. I keep thinking one morning I\u2019ll look in the mirror and she\u2019ll have cut them into my face\u2014\u201d</p><p>She collapsed against me and burst into tears.</p><p>I supported her by the elbows and made some comforting noises. This was why I seldom took on female clients; their silly notions and endless waterworks made it difficult to ferret out the truth. But someone had been secretly assaulting Lady Walsh, and no woman should have to endure that\u2014in or out of her own bed.</p><p>I helped her back over to the client\u2019s chair and silently passed her my handkerchief before I took her teacup over to the cart to refresh it and give her a little time to mop up and compose herself. My tea was nothing special\u2014whatever was on sale that week at the grocer\u2019s\u2014but I added a dash of soother to the brew before I brought it back to her.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told your husband about these attacks.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to make it a question.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t trouble dear Nolan with this.\u201d She put her gloves back on before she sipped from her cup. \u201cHe\u2019s so loving and attentive, it would destroy him.\u201d She gave me an owl-eyed look of mute, helpless appeal.</p><p>She was an old rich man\u2019s young trophy wife, likely the most fetching daughter of a posh who had fallen on hard times. Marrying Nolan Walsh would have resulted in some restoration of her family\u2019s fortunes and likewise assured Lady Walsh of a lifetime of comfortable financial security. She\u2019d personally slice herself up before she endangered that.</p><p>I knew I was probably going to regret this. I didn\u2019t like working for the rich or titled, and I had other, very good reasons to avoid the Hill. But someone had gone to vicious lengths to torment her, and it was obvious from the repeated attacks that they had no intention of stopping.</p><p>\u201cHow will you bring me into your household?\u201d</p><p>She brightened immediately. \u201cI thought I would have you as a cousin\u2014a very distant one, of course\u2014who has only just discovered our family connection.\u201d Her smile turned self-conscious. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that genealogy is one of my little self-indulgences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t one of mine, so you\u2019d better be the one to make the discovery.\u201d Now, when to call. I checked my brooch watch and thought about the rest of my day. \u201cDinner is too intimate for a new acquaintance; it\u2019ll have to be tea. I\u2019ll also need an excuse to visit your bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>She nodded quickly. \u201cI keep some family portints on my vanity. I can remark on your resemblance to my great-aunt Hortense and invite you up to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur great-aunt Hortense.\u201d I sighed. \u201cLady Walsh, you should know that in the past I\u2019ve been hired by other families on the Hill. Some of your servants might recognize me. If anyone asks, it\u2019s best that we not lie about how I earn my living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that Nolan will think it\u2019s charming that you, ah, work for yourself.\u201d She glanced at the gold letters spelling out Disenchanted &amp; Co. on the frosted glass of my office door. \u201cHe\u2019s very progressive that way about women, you know. He even believes we should have the vote, bless him.\u201d</p><p>But he would never employ any women at his bank, I guessed, or trust them to manage their own funds. \u201cGood on your husband.\u201d I held out my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at four.\u201d</p><p>Lady Walsh clasped my hand tightly. \u201cThank you so much, Miss Kittredge. Oh, dear, what is your given name? With our connection I should call you by that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m known as Kit.\u201d Only one person left in the world still called me Charmian, but one day he\u2019d walk in front of my carri and I\u2019d put an end to that. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Diana, and forever in your debt, Kit.\u201d She gave my hand a final fervent squeeze and went to the door. A man dressed in cream-and-scarlet livery standing outside opened it for her and closed it before he followed her out of sight.</p><p>Odd that I hadn\u2019t seen him when I\u2019d confronted Gert. Most footmen waited with the coach; only the wealthiest of women used them as body servants.</p><p>\u201cOr your dear, loving Nolan doesn\u2019t quite trust you to leave the house alone,\u201d I murmured under my breath as I picked up my keylace and knotted it around my wrist. \u201cI wonder why.\u201d</p><p>After I locked up the office, I took the stairs down to the underground level, better known to me and the other tenants of the Davies Building as the Dungeon.</p><p>The sole occupant of the understair had once been a royal machinist, one of the finest who had ever served H.M., or so the Honorable Reginald P. Docket would have everyone believe. We never asked why he had given up his choice position to immigrate; no one left England for the Provincial Union of Victoriana unless they had made a horrible marriage or committed an unpardonable offense against the Crown. Since Docket remained a bachelor, and his constructs sometimes didn\u2019t perform according to spec, I imagined it to be the latter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d A sweaty face smeared with grease popped up from behind a cabinet filled with cogs and gears. \u201cKit? Oh, fabulous. You\u2019re just in time for the latest bash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d I glanced around me to see if anything appeared ready to clout me, fall on me, or explode. Most everything did. \u201cI can come back later, if you like.\u201d</p><p>Docket waved a wrench. \u201cNonsense. This is just the sort of thing you females love.\u201d</p> <p>I studied the cabinet he\u2019d been fiddling with, which seemed to be sprouting mechanical arms with hooks on the end. \u201cIt\u2019s a tenner printing press?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Take off your jacket and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost new,\u201d I warned him as I shrugged out of it. \u201cI\u2019m very fond of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely why you need my HangItAll.\u201d He adjusted one of the dials on the side of the cabinet and stepped away as its internal works began to grind and whistle. \u201cHold it out. Go on, it won\u2019t bite you.\u201d</p><p>With a great many misgivings, I held out my jacket. One of the mechanical arms stretched out, folding over on itself to form an elongated triangle with its hook at the top. It inserted one corner of the triangle into a sleeve as it pulled my jacket out of my hand and then tilted up as it inserted the opposite corner. The arm retracted my jacket into the cabinet, catching a rod inside with the hook and neatly hanging it.</p> <p>\u201cYou see?\u201d Docket beamed. \u201cYou\u2019ll never have to wait for a maid to answer your bell again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, because I don\u2019t have any maids or bells,\u201d I reminded him as I peered into the cabinet. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this working off your boiler, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI started out with hydraulics, but the joints leaked oil onto the garms. Bloody mess it was.\u201d He caressed the side of the cabinet with his hand. \u201cWhat do you think? I\u2019ll wager someday one of these will be in every man\u2019s front hall, and every female\u2019s boudoir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly the wash house.\u201d I reached in and removed my jacket from the interior, which caused him to yelp. Then I held it up so he could see the condensate drip from the sodden hem. \u201cIf you change the name to WashItAll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\u201d As he watched me wring out the sopping-wet material, he scratched at his chin whiskers. \u201cWashItAll\u2019s not bad. Would it sell, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose, if you came up with a way to dry them as well.\u201d I glanced down at the puddle forming around the base of the cabinet. \u201cAnd install a catch basin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCapital idea.\u201d Never one to brood, Docket closed off the boiler feed valve and wiped his hands on a dirty rag. \u201cSo what can I do for you today, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need some dippers and an echo.\u201d I briefly described Lady Walsh\u2019s situation, leaving out the names and personal details, and added, \u201cThe echo will have to be very small. Something I can hide in a satchel or under my skirts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just the thing.\u201d He disappeared into his mechanized warren, and after some loud banging and scraping emerged with an envelope and a small mallet. He led me over to the nearest worktable, shoved aside some blueprints, and set them out.</p><p>\u201cBest tuck the dippers somewhere they can\u2019t be spotted,\u201d he said, carefully counting out from the envelope five thin, folded strips of paper. \u201cDip or dab them with a drop of wine, trace of powder, or whatever you think is tainted. If all\u2019s not as it should be, they\u2019ll show color.\u201d</p><p>I removed and unfolded one strip and sniffed it. The chemical odor wasn\u2019t so strong that it would be detected coming from my person. \u201cBlue for drugs, black for poison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>I took out my da\u2019s pocket watch and tucked them in the back of the case. I could get at them easily by pretending to check the time. I glanced at the little mallet beside the envelope \u201cI can\u2019t go about hammering on the walls, Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to.\u201d He gestured for me to follow him over to one of the Dungeon\u2019s support walls. He placed the flat end of the mallet head against the wall, and flipped up the cap on the other end, revealing a magnifying lens. \u201cPress in the bottom of the handle, like so.\u201d</p> <p>He demonstrated, and through the lens I saw a wide, solid green bar appear. The bar glowed faintly, as if it were hot.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a strut on the other side of the wall. Move it along careful-like\u201d\u2014he slid the mallet slowly across the wall until the green bar disappeared and the lens filled with rough green pebbles\u2014\u201cand there, you see? That\u2019s the fill between the struts. The foundation walls down here don\u2019t have any hidey-holes, but if there\u2019s one in your manor house, it will show black on the lens. Then you\u2019ve only to find the seams and pop it open.\u201d</p><p>I took the mallet from him and studied it. \u201cWhat makes it glow like that?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, showing all the gaps in his teeth. \u201cIf I told you that, I\u2019d have to marry you.\u201d</p><p>Not because he loved me, I imagined, but to keep me from bearing witness. Once a woman gave her hand in marriage, she became her husband\u2019s legal property. Property could not testify against its owner\u2014something I imagined would prove useful if the Crown ever questioned the origins, and the exact rights claim, to any particularly clever mech.</p><p>Now it was time to dicker over price, which Docket and I usually took out in barter. \u201cWhat do you want for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks\u2019 laundering and five hot suppers hand-delivered,\u201d he said promptly.</p><p>\u201cOne week laundering and two hot suppers by bucket,\u201d I countered. As he started to bluster, I added, \u201cAnd a grand pudding.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a suspicious look. \u201cWhat sort? Not plum. Too hot for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer pudding,\u201d I said, and moved in for the kill. \u201cFresh-picked raspberry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaspberry.\u201d Docket\u2019s expression turned dreamy for a moment before he eyed me. \u201cYou\u2019ll get all of the stains out of me coveralls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn act of New Parliament couldn\u2019t do that, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well, I\u2019d just dirty them up again anyway.\u201d He wiped a filthy hand over the front of his bib. \u201cMake it three dinners by bucket, and I\u2019ll shake on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d I kissed his bald, shiny pate. \u201cIn lieu of the shake.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed pleasure made his face rosy. \u201cIf only I were thirty years younger.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Lady Walsh\u2019s request did make a trip downtown a necessity, but the day was so fine I decided to take the trolley. A few old ladies in the back seats frowned my way as I stood with the men at the front of the car, reminding me that I was still in my skirts. If I\u2019d dressed in my native costume of bucks they wouldn\u2019t have given me a second glance.</p><p>The men, mostly young clerks and old gophers who couldn\u2019t afford to keep their own carri, collectively ignored me. A woman who didn\u2019t assume her proper place in public effectively rendered herself invisible to the tonners and anyone who emulated them, which were most of the respectable citizens of Rumsen. Rina called it wishful blindness.</p><p>As we passed through one of the older quarters, a funeral procession halted the trolley, and as the black-shrouded carts and carris passed, I saw a shimmering form drifting after them. The ghost of the deceased, I guessed. I often caught glimpses of such specters following the newly dead or hovering about a fresh grave. When I tried to go near them, they faded from sight.</p><p>I knew from experience that they weren\u2019t creatures of magic. While mages insisted the proper spell or ritual could bring back the spirits of the dead, I\u2019d found enough noise-making contraptions hidden in s\u00e9ance chambers to explain such convenient \u201cvisitations.\u201d I had no explanation for what I sometimes saw, but I suspected they might be a trace of the spirit left behind by those who passed on. Like the scent of a lady\u2019s perfume that lingered in a room for a time after her departure, or the outlines of a face in an old, sun-faded portint.</p><p>Mum would have insisted they were fantasies of the imagination, nothing more. I often wondered how she\u2019d explain away the chill they left behind in the air once they vanished.</p><p>At Pike Street I got off and walked to an alley between a boardinghouse and a dressmaker\u2019s shop.</p><p>The alley was famous for one thing: it was the lowest point in the city. It also had flooded every year during the storm season until one Mrs. Carina Eagle had purchased the boardinghouse and hired a road crew to dig trenches on either side for drainage pipes. As for the boardinghouse, where no one ever boarded for longer than a night, it still bore the sign Mrs. Holcomb\u2019s Rooms to Let, but everyone knew it as the Eagle\u2019s Nest.</p><p>I stopped in front of a bruiser in a pilled tweed coat who had one shoulder propped against the corner. He was reading over a short sheet without much interest and rubbing a flat, milky-white stone between his broad thumb and the stump of his first finger.</p><p>I waited politely until he finished reading and looked up at me. \u201cMorning, Wrecker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Kit.\u201d He touched the brim of his cap. \u201cShe\u2019s not up yet. Late night, she had, what with all of \u2019em sailors what come into port yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Wrecker had been sent over to Toriana on work-release from Sydney a few years back after serving ten years in the quarries for kneecapping the wrong chap. He\u2019d finished out his debt to the Crown and now lived as a freedman. Had Rina not hired him, he might have kept at the work he knew best. Luckily protecting her and her gels required Wreck to commit far fewer felonies.</p><p>\u201cNo worries, I\u2019ll bring her a cup.\u201d</p><p>Knowing my long-standing relationship with his mistress, he nodded and let me pass.</p><p>At the other end of the alley was the back of the boardinghouse, a red door, and a bright brass bell. After I tugged on the pull, a narrow eye-slot appeared in the door.</p><p>\u201cMiss Kittredge to see Mrs. Eagle.\u201d</p><p>The door opened, and a fellow almost as huge as Wrecker inspected me. He was new, which meant his predecessor was either dead or in prison. \u201cSelling or buying?\u201d The way he ogled my body from the neck down made it clear he hoped I was selling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNeither,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m a friend.\u201d</p><p>He pouted a little. \u201cHer\u2019s still abed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.\u201d I went past him and made my way to the kitchen, where Mrs. Eagle\u2019s cook stood cracking eggs into a large mixpot with one hand and flipping rashers with the other.</p> <p>\u201cMorning, Almira.\u201d I asked, nipping a piece of bacon from a platter and dodging a swat from her spatula. \u201cHave you sent up her tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I? She left word that she\u2019s not to be disturbed before noon.\u201d Almira nodded toward the kettle. \u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d drop in a pinch of willowbark.\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cRough trade last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMariners in for their first shore leave since the Skirmish.\u201d She pulled a whisk from her apron pocket and began beating the eggs. \u201cRandy boys, the lot of them.\u201d</p><p>I made up a tray and took it to the back stairs, where I carried it up one flight to the mistress\u2019s chambers. Walking into Mrs. Eagle\u2019s private sanctuary was like crossing the threshold of a dark church: a cool rush of shadows and incense-scented air. I made my way to the cart carefully, and after depositing the tray, I lit the wall lamp and turned to the bed.</p> <p>\u201cFor the love of Jesu,\u201d a muffled voice said from beneath a mound of golden silk puffs. \u201cPiss off.\u201d</p><p>I poured and carried a cup of tea over to the mound. \u201cYou know this is why your mother wanted you to be a nun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo hard on the knees.\u201d A small head of tousled blond hair appeared, and a slender hand took the cup from me. \u201cWhat do you want, and sweet Mary, don\u2019t say anything that involves my bum in motion, or I\u2019ll thump you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs ever-tempted as I am by your charms\u201d\u2014I sat down on the edge of the mound\u2014\u201cI came for a gown.\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand toward her armoire of indecently beautiful negligees as she guzzled the tea. \u201cTake whatever you want and be gone with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that sort of gown.\u201d</p> <p>She pushed a handful of hair out of her eyes to give me an irate squint. \u201cYou said you were through working the Hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial exception, just this one time,\u201d I promised. \u201cSomeone\u2019s taken the cut direct to a new and nasty level.\u201d</p><p>She yawned. \u201cHow nasty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlicing hateful words into her skin while she sleeps.\u201d I touched a whisker burn on her cheek. \u201cDoes that sound like anyone you\u2019ve thrown out lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChastity had a biter last month. Horrid man. I had Wrecker relieve him of his front teeth before showing him out.\u201d She sat up and held out her cup. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>I poured her tea and waited as my friend gradually roused. Without her jewels and cosmetics, Carina Eagle looked too young to be let out on her own. She had been, once upon a time, long before she had become the queen of backstreet brothels.</p><p>We\u2019d found each other, Rina and I, drawn together as fellow outcasts in a society that wanted nothing to do with either of us. I\u2019d had it a bit easier, coming to Rumsen as a penniless, nameless waif who\u2019d had as much chance at being respectable as a hemp picker had of residing on the Hill.</p><p>Rina\u2019s family had been merchant class, indecently successful, and had employed their hard-earned riches in hopes of marrying her off to better. The hard-fisted gambler they\u2019d snagged had strung them along while gaming away her bride price. When the bleeding sod had wagered Rina\u2019s maiden night in a card game, and lost, she\u2019d been forced to pay the debt. The morning after, the vicious bastard had refused to marry her, claiming publicly that she was bespoiled goods, which conveniently canceled his financial and social obligations to her family. Rina had been ruined, of course, and turned out onto the streets.</p> <p>I\u2019d met Rina shortly after that, when she\u2019d still been green enough to let herself be cornered. Stopping the brute I found beating her half to death in a back alley had required only a brick to the back of the head; the real task had been convincing her to come home with me so I could fix her up. She\u2019d stayed with me for a few days, but as soon as she was mostly healed she left and went back on the stroll.</p><p>Since then I\u2019d tried to persuade her to give up the business, but the money had always been too good, and the trade too steady. Because Rina was young, beautiful, and posh enough to attract a better sort, she\u2019d quickly built a list of generous regulars. They\u2019d funded the purchase of her house of ill repute, which in turn provided shelter and protection for the lost gels my friend regularly plucked from the streets. For those too young to know what they were about, Rina even found decent employment. Her success had made her notorious, but Rina took great pleasure in being the most scandalous female in Rumsen\u2014and still banked more money in one month than I did in a year.</p><p>My friend finally emerged from her bed and tottered to the lamps to light a few more. The old, threadbare flannel gown she wore made me stifle a chuckle\u2014it bore no resemblance to the lacy, gauzy negligees she wore when entertaining her clients.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Rina fell into an armchair and propped her brow against her hand. \u201cTell me who it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan Walsh\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Diana.\u201d She exhaled heavily. \u201cYou\u2019ve picked yourself a right one there. She\u2019d be the eldest spawn of one of the Landau brothers.\u201d</p><p>I thought through all the scandals I knew that involved Landaus. \u201cThe one who gambled, or the one who drank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe investor. Lost everything in mine speculation.\u201d She winced. \u201cWilliam or Wilson or something like that. In any case, he tugged the old school tie, sold her off. Pretty little thing, but no spine at all. You know she cried at the wedding?\u201d</p><p>Rina faithfully attended every society wedding open to the public, always arriving heavily veiled and dressed in widow\u2019s weeds. She claimed it was to drum up trade, as virginal brides always sent their newly wed husbands looking for satisfaction elsewhere, but I knew better. Rina had a passion for watching ceremonies and rituals, the grander the better. In a strange way, they seemed to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cWould Walsh have a hand in this?\u201d Men who secretly abused their wives disgusted me, but there was always a possibility that the banker had acquired a taste for hurting women or perhaps had his sights set on a third wife.</p><p>\u201cDoubtful. He shows her off too much. He\u2019d never rip up a brand-new waistcoat and then wear it after.\u201d Rina smothered a yawn. \u201cMy money\u2019s on the son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiseased. Sent home from Oxford after a bad case of the drips.\u201d She said it with a strumpet\u2019s satisfied relish. \u201cMarried five years now, but no children.\u201d</p><p>I sat back. Since he only otherwise had two daughters . . . \u201cOh. So that\u2019s why he married her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why he took her so young,\u201d Rina agreed. \u201cWalsh has a good twenty, thirty more years on this earth. Plenty of time to do the deed and then some. But why are you taking this job, Kit? You know how it will end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks she\u2019s been cursed,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>Rina hmphed. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s under an evil spell, it\u2019s you.\u201d She stood and stretched. \u201cWhen do you call on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday, for tea. I\u2019m a newfound, poor cousin.\u201d I thought for a minute. \u201cI need something in sprigged muslin, genteel-cut but no sashing. Lace. A very little lace.\u201d</p><p>Already thinking, Rina nodded. \u201cYellowed or shabby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYellowed. I\u2019m a working lass.\u201d</p><p>I followed her into the adjoining room, which was filled with freestanding racks of gowns. Rina had once made a vow never to wear the same gown more than twice, and after making a mutually satisfactory arrangement with her neighbor the spinster dressmaker, she had managed to keep it.</p><p>\u201cI did a garden party play a few years ago,\u201d she said as she sorted through one rack. \u201cOld gent, wanted all of us dressed like debs. Had each of us sit on his lap so he could fondle us while we fed him biscuits and called him Daddums.\u201d</p><p>I hid my revulsion. \u201cI can\u2019t wear white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can, love.\u201d She winked as she extracted one gown, held it up to me, and then exchanged it for another. \u201cIf you don\u2019t soon start carrying a shade when you go out, you\u2019ll be as dark as a shaman.\u201d She switched the gown for a third, and nodded. \u201cThis will do for tea.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down. \u201cIt\u2019s pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI despise pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s baby\u2019s blush, and it makes you look like a proper lass. Turn round.\u201d When I did, she held the yoke of the bodice to my shoulders. \u201cIf I snip out the pads, it should fit.\u201d She tugged at the chain around my neck. \u201cCan\u2019t wear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tuck it under.\u201d I only took off my pendant when I bathed, and even then I kept it within reach. I\u2019d promised my mum I always would.</p><p>\u201cSlippers.\u201d She bent to retrieve a pair from a box beneath the gowns and handed them to me.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re too big.\u201d And even pinker than the gown.</p><p>\u201cStuff the toes with paper. Satchel.\u201d She found and placed a fringed drawstring reticule on top of the slippers. \u201cCrinoline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said flatly.</p><p>\u201cKit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey itch and they make me sweat,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019d rather go naked.\u201d</p><p>She glared at me. \u201cThen it will have to be three petticoats.\u201d When I opened my mouth she tapped my cheek sharply. \u201cThis is not open for discussion, you silly twit. You\u2019re going to the Hill. You know the butler will be counting them before he lets you through the door. Showing up underdressed is as smart as standing in the marketplace and shouting you\u2019ve become an agent for the Crown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hang myself first.\u201d She was right. \u201cI hate being female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, until you sprout a beard and a cock, there you are.\u201d She patted my shoulder. \u201cCome on, while you\u2019re here I might as well feed you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I left the hateful pink gown and accoutrements in Rina\u2019s bedchamber as she dressed, and then followed her down to the kitchen, where Almira had two steaming plates of eggs, bacon, and fry bread waiting for us.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s worked a charm on poor Liv,\u201d the cook told Rina. \u201cShe says she can\u2019t feel her bum.\u201d</p><p>Rina sat down and dug into her food. \u201cThat\u2019s because she sits on it too much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI smacked her bare with a switch meself to test it. Drew blood, but she didn\u2019t even flinch.\u201d Almira glanced at me. \u201cMaybe someone could make herself useful while she\u2019s dawdling here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy eggs will get cold,\u201d I complained.</p><p>She whisked my plate out from under my fork. \u201cI\u2019ll keep them on the stove.\u201d</p><p>I turned to Rina, who shrugged. \u201cAll right, where\u2019s poor Liv?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPurple door, third floor.\u201d The cook beamed at me. \u201cYou\u2019re a good lass, Kit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a deprived lass. I\u2019m a starving lass.\u201d I tromped back up the stairs to the third floor, found Liv\u2019s purple door, and knocked on it. \u201cLiv? It\u2019s Kit, Mrs. Eagle\u2019s friend from uptown. Let me in.\u201d</p><p>I heard breathing, and then two strangled words: \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I propped a hand against the door frame. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>More breathing, and choking. \u201cCan\u2019t . . . move.\u201d</p><p>I tried the knob, which jammed at first and then opened. Inside I found Liv, wide-eyed and naked on the floorboards. I knelt beside her. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic,\u201d she gasped, as if she were having trouble taking in air. \u201cKilling me.\u201d</p> <p>I looked her over, reached down, and slapped her face. \u201cCome on. Snap out of it, there\u2019s a good gel.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head wildly, and then her eyes bulged as she gulped in a huge breath.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweet Jesu.\u201d She panted as if she\u2019d been running for miles. \u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe, I couldn\u2019t . . .\u201d She stared at the hand she had lifted to her face and then at me. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI walloped you.\u201d I helped her up from the floor and wrapped her in a robe. \u201cSit before you fall back down.\u201d When she did, I looked around her room. Aside from the usual female fripperies, I noticed nothing out of the ordinary. \u201cWhat have you been using?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I swear. Mistress doesn\u2019t allow it.\u201d Liv huddled in her robe. \u201cThank God you came, miss. I thought for sure I was going to die.\u201d</p><p>I knelt down beside her bed, lifted the skirt, and looked under it. A small brown box lay among the drifts of dust, and when I pulled it out, Liv saw it and uttered a shriek.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a box.\u201d I tugged open the string and poured the contents into my hand, which turned out to be six polished green stones. \u201cA box of rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Liv whispered. \u201cSomeone put them there. Someone bespelled them to kill me. Take them away.\u201d Her voice rose to a screech. \u201cTake them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re rocks, Liv, not magic.\u201d As she shouted more nonsense at me, I went to the window and tossed them out. \u201cThere. They\u2019re gone. Stop screaming.\u201d</p><p>Liv staggered to her feet and collapsed against me to give me a trembling hug. \u201cThank you,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cYou saved me life.\u201d</p><p>What was it about me that attracted so many tearful females? \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d I set her at arm\u2019s length. \u201cYou should go see the physick today, though. You might have picked a bad spider bite or something.\u201d</p><p>She wrenched away and hurried over to her dresser. \u201cI have to leave the city. Right away, before they try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop by the physick\u2019s first,\u201d I suggested, before I let myself out and returned downstairs.</p><p>Rina had finished her breakfast and drank some juice as she watched me eat mine. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed a mouthful of bread. \u201cHysteria, or maybe a spider bite. I found a box of green rocks under her bed. She\u2019s fine.\u201d I glanced at Rina. \u201cShe\u2019s also packing her bags. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably staged it. The lazy tart never could turn more than two johnnies a night.\u201d Rina didn\u2019t seem dismayed. \u201cSo much for her numb bum. Thanks, Kit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d I noticed Almira staring at me. \u201cShe\u2019ll be all right. I only gave her a little slap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreen stones are said to be spellbinders,\u201d the cook said. \u201cThat\u2019s rotten magic, Miss Kit.\u201d</p><p>I exchanged an amused look with Rina. \u201cIs there any other kind?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>I left the Eagle\u2019s Nest with Wrecker in one of Rina\u2019s carris. She insisted on giving me a ride to my flat as repayment for disenchanting poor Liv, but the truth was she despised the city trolleys\u2014\u201cdamn cattle carts\u201d according to her\u2014as well as my fondness for riding them.</p><p>\u201cWrecker can ferry you up the Hill at four,\u201d she advised me. \u201cHave him wait for you, too. Walsh\u2019s so high-necked he won\u2019t bridle a half-dead nag for a poor cousin, not even if you offered to ride it to the glueworks for him.\u201d</p><p>As I waited in the alley for Wrecker to come round, I spotted a gleam of dark green on the cobblestones and picked up one of the rocks I\u2019d tossed out Liv\u2019s window. Idly I tossed it in my hand and then dropped it in my pocket as Wrecker wheeled the carri around the corner.</p><p>Carris came into being out of necessity after the horse plagues of \u201966 emptied most of the coach houses in the city. I still remembered the first ones bouncing along the streets, causing women to cower and scream, and men to chase after them. From a distance they had looked a bit like burning, runaway carts, at least until the smoke cleared enough for one to see the grinning fool tonner sitting behind the great wheel.</p><p>In the twenty years since the first carri rolled off the assembly line, much had been done to improve the horseless coaches. The first big, wooden-spoke wheels had been replaced by wider, iron-rimmed rounders coated with a thick pad of gray-brown rubber. The mechs in the Chester factories had also whittled down the carri\u2019s boxy sideboards and clad them in thin, black-painted plates of copper. When the paint wore, it flaked in rows, which exposed red-gold streaks that young turks seemed to like. They would sometimes scrape off long strips to speed the process so they could boast of driving a \u201cstreaky.\u201d</p><p>Only the oldest carris still had one flat bench seat in the back and two box perches in the front; these days everyone changed them out for the custom horsehide seats. None of the newer carris used coal burners anymore; the latest were fitted with keroseel steam tanks that didn\u2019t belch black smoke or have to be refilled as often.</p><p>Wrecker pushed on the brake and reached out to give me a hand up. \u201cFancy a ride through the park, Miss Kit?\u201d</p><p>He liked driving through Center Park, both to show off his mistress\u2019s carri and to worry his way through the noontime parade of tonners on horseback. So did I, but there was no time for a joyride. \u201cI\u2019ve a job to get to, sorry. Another time, Wrecker.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and glanced at my lap to see I was belted in before he let off the handbrake.</p><p>Before the gold rush days had brought every scrabbler and digger from the eastern provinces to the west coast, Rumsen had belonged to the Fleers, who had crossed the plains rather than give in to Church and state. When I was a kid, some bone hunters had dug up the foundation of the only prayerhouse the Fleers had managed to build before the army caught up with them; from the number of scorched skeletons they\u2019d uncovered, it appeared to have burned to the ground with most of the Fleers inside.</p><p>The governor had issued the usual statement about what a tragedy it was to learn that the fugitives had accidentally torched themselves in their illegal place of worship, mainly to remind us all that for Torians it still was Church or nothing, and if any of us were to break the faith laws, the same sort of accident could happen again.</p><p>I\u2019d once visited the site of the old prayerhouse, over which a merchants\u2019 exchange now stood. I didn\u2019t see any ghosts floating around the building, but when I\u2019d looked up at the second floor, every window I saw slowly turned white with frost.</p><p>All trace of the Fleers had been wiped away by the Occupancy, which had established Rumsen as a troop station and trading post, although it really was more of a dumping ground for the misfits and malcontents in the service. The Crown began sending over the deserters, upstarts, and failures from the ranks; if they survived the trek through native lands, they remained in Rumsen on permanent assignment.</p><p>In those days, the only females to be had as bedservants were native, and common practice was to capture and defile them before they could be recovered by their kin. Some of the old, crude cabins the surly troops had built for themselves and their squawks (named for the way they\u2019d screech when stolen from their tribes) still stood on the fringe of the city. Rina\u2019s people could trace their line back to a randy captain and a squawk who had borne him six children before finally cutting his throat one night while he slept.</p><p>I lived in one of the oldest sections of the town, in a small goldstone nestled among the slaterows and clopboard mercantiles. My flathouse had once been a granary, and on hot days the walls, which had once housed tons of seed wheat, still gave off a scent like that of bread baking.</p><p>Wrecker conveyed me straight to my door and even shut off the engine to jump out, come round, and hand me down like a fine lady. \u201cBe back at half past, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll do.\u201d I pressed a couple of coins into his ham-size hand. \u201cThere\u2019s a decent pie shop two blocks south. Tell the counterlass that I sent you, and she\u2019ll fix you up with a special.\u201d</p><p>I let myself in through the front door, locking it behind me. Although there were seven flats in my building, I was presently the only tenant. Over the years I\u2019d quietly bought up the leases for the other flats, and then offered for the building. At first the former owner, a hatchet-faced pork trader named Billings, had flatly refused to sell to me. \u201cFemales can\u2019t manage property,\u201d he\u2019d informed me. \u201cYou\u2019d do better to bank your funds and find yourself a nice young man, miss.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My money was as good as any man\u2019s, which made me think about taking him to property court, but then bad luck solved the problem for me. Five of the pork trader\u2019s buildings had been unexpectedly inspected and condemned as firetraps and promptly demolished. He\u2019d come back to me, desperate for coin, and with a little dickering I bought the building for half my original offer.</p><p>I knew it was foolish to keep the other flats empty, but I liked living alone. When I had a little money, I did some renovating here and there. Eventually I hoped to convert the whole place from a flathouse into a single-family home.</p><p>For convenience\u2019s sake I lived in the first-floor flat, which was also the largest, the other floors each being split between two units. This also gave me direct access to the kitchen, pantry, and bathing room.</p> <p>I hung up the borrowed dress before I went in to stoke the stove and put on the kettle. I rarely cooked; it was easier to pick up something quick at the pie shop or one of the corner wichcarts. I retrieved a leftover tart from the piesafe, made my tea, and carried both into the bathing room.</p><p>I could hear my mother in the back of my head, gently scolding me: Ladies don\u2019t eat in the bath, Charmian. They bathe.</p><p>I set down my mug and plate and went to my tub. It was an old claw-footer, made from thick clearstone gone white on the inside from years of use. I cranked the pump for a minute before I opened the tap and tested the flow with my fingers; there was no hot water left from last night. I needed to replace the old coal boiler outside with an in-house furnace, but then walls would have to be torn out to convert the pipes, work for which no decent piper would barter. I was saving up for it, though, and in the meantime made do with what I could coax out of the old blackpot.</p><p>Wrecker arrived at my door promptly at three thirty and peered at my face as he helped me up into the carri. \u201cYou all right, Miss Kit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hot water for my bath.\u201d I pinched my cheeks to bring some color to them and recalled the ugly words sliced into the back of Diana Walsh\u2019s hands. \u201cWrecker, do you believe in curses?\u201d</p> <p>He pushed out his lower lip. \u201cDon\u2019t disbelieve. All manner of things in this world, Miss Kit. Man\u2019s gotta keep an open mind.\u201d</p><p>I shivered a little and blamed it on the ice-cold bath I\u2019d been obliged to take. \u201cTo the Hill, please, Wreck.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and started off toward the main thoroughfare.</p><p>The Hill, also known to the lesser citizens of Rumsen as Poshtown or the Vineyard, constituted the newest part of the city. The land it occupied had once been sacred to a local native tribe, long since exterminated by the first settlers, who had then plowed and cultivated the slopes into enormous vineyards. The dense, fertile black soil had produced some of the sweetest dark wines in the province, but not for very long. When the Crown had decided to prohibit drink, the army had been obliged to round up the winemakers and distillers and smash their vats and cookeries. To protect the city, the vineyard had been subjected to a controlled burn, and the ashes plowed back into the ground.</p><p>Only clover and sweet grass had flourished on the Hill until that time when it\u2014and most of Rumsen\u2014was bought up by a beloved bastard son of an English duke. He had the slopes cleared again so that he could build a towering mansion from which he could overlook his new domain.</p><p>The bastard son had died without issue, but rather than add the property to his entitled estate, the old duke had sold it off piecemeal to other wealthy families in the queensland, who in turn built homes there for their undesirable relations. Over time the blues had intermarried with the merchant class to create the first ton. The result was the Hill: some four hundred mansions covering every square inch of the old vineyard, and housing Toriana\u2019s only claim to aristocracy.</p> <p>No doubt guilt over stranding their castoff kin on the other side of the world from the queensland had loosened many purse strings; some of the finest manors ever built on Torian soil marched up the Hill. Gildstone and bronze cast work glittered in the bright midday sun, while the genteel pastel colors of the paintwork gave off a subtle glow, thanks to the ground sparkglass that had been added to the different tints.</p><p>Many of the men who built the Hill soon after begun coughing up blood. All of them died lingering, painful deaths. The city\u2019s more superstitious dolts had claimed old native magic had death-cursed the workmen, but more scientifically, it had been inhaling the sparkglass that took them out. Once breathed in, the tiny, deadly grains began eating into their noses, throats, and chests and caused them to waste away slowly from internal bleeding. The Hill was beautiful, but the price it extracted had been too costly. There wasn\u2019t a builder in Rumsen who hadn\u2019t sent a dozen men or better to early graves from glasslung.</p><p>Walsh\u2019s Folly, a modest-size palace occupying a respectable two acres, had been styled with the later fashion of turrets and crowswalks, with dozens of balconies from which the inhabitants could gaze upon the sea, the city, the pastureland to the south, and the forests to the north.</p><p>It was also pink and sported wardlings over every threshold, so I hated it at first sight.</p><p>Wrecker handed me down, promised to return in two hours, and took off before the butler could get a good look at him through the peeper. I gathered my borrowed skirt and made my way up the right steps of the two-sided stair\u2014built so that ladies and gents could ascend separately to prevent any unintentional vulgar glimpse by male eye of female ankle\u2014and took the correct place before the door so that I could be viewed from within. One did not knock on doors or ring bells on the Hill.</p><p>After a moderately insulting five minutes, the door slowly opened inward, and an iron-haired scarecrow in immaculate blacks glared down at me without a word.</p><p>\u201cMiss Kittredge to see Lady Walsh.\u201d I offered him a name card and waited with a blank smile as he read every letter on it four times over. He then looked around me as if trying to find something. \u201cI have no maid with me,\u201d I said helpfully.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d he said in a dour, disapproving tone, and barely waited until I was over the threshold before closing the door. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p> <p>I followed the towering old winge through the lovely foyer and past several open doors, through which I saw beautiful rooms filled with enough antiques to stock several shops. Along the walls were portraits in oil of every Walsh who had ever drawn breath, I presumed, noting the succession of weak chins and receding hairlines. Walsh came from a family of bankers, judging by the bleakness of their dress and the cut of their waistcoats. Men who handled money for a living were the most conservative of dressers and never enslaved themselves to the whims of fashion; they wanted to project an aura of unwavering knowledge and sober experience, not flightiness and impulsivity.</p><p>The butler halted in front of two double doors, knocking once before opening them and standing on the threshold. \u201cA Miss Kittredge,\u201d he said in the same tone he\u2019d use to announce that a stray dog, one that might possibly be rabid, had been found on the premises.</p><p>\u201cDear Cousin Kit,\u201d Lady Walsh said, rising and crossing the room to take my hands in hers. \u201cYou\u2019re as lovely as I imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind, Lady Diana.\u201d I bobbed a curtsey to mollify the butler. I thought of all the glasslung that painting this monstrosity must have inflicted and added with a touch of irony, \u201cYour home is quite breathtaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a lovely sanctuary from the worries of the world.\u201d She squeezed my hands before releasing them. \u201cNow come and let me introduce you to the family.\u201d</p><p>The family present in the receiving room consisted of two men and one lady. The eldest, a weak-chinned, nearly bald man of fifty in a heavy dark-blue suit, was the master of the house, Nolan Walsh. A thin, mousy-looking woman dressed in an exquisitely fitted lavender half-mourning gown was introduced as Miranda Walsh, Nolan\u2019s younger daughter. A leaner version of Nolan stood by the mantel fiddling with a timepiece; he was the only son and doubtful heir, Nolan Jr., called Montrose.</p><p>\u201cMy wife tells me you and she are connected through the Landaus,\u201d Nolan said after introductions had been made. \u201cIt must be a happy thing for you to meet your distant cousin.\u201d</p><p>The way he emphasized distant made me brighten my smile. \u201cA great and humbling happiness, milord.\u201d</p><p>Lady Walsh rang for tea, which she served with the elegance of long practice. I refused her offer of cakes and pretended to take a sip now and then while I let my tea grow stone-cold. We spoke of the fine weather, the agreeable effect it was having on the city\u2019s gardens, and whether it promised a milder winter than last season.</p><p>As we began to run out of polite topics, Montrose shambled near and bent over oddly, until I realized he was peering at my face.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see anything of Diana in you,\u201d he said in a voice that sounded female and querulous. \u201cAre you the get of the gambler or the drinker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonty, what a thing to ask.\u201d Lady Walsh uttered an embarrassed titter. \u201cCousin Kit is the daughter of the third son of my great-aunt Hortense Landau.\u201d To me she said, \u201cYou do bear a striking resemblance to her, my dear.\u201d</p><p>That was my cue. \u201cThank you for saying so, cousin. I never had the pleasure of meeting my father\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why not?\u201d Montrose rasped. \u201cThe old bat lived until she was ninety-seven, didn\u2019t she, Di?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and my father were estranged for quite some time.\u201d I noted the faint yellow tint to the whites of his muddy brown eyes, and the network of fine red lines webbing the skin around his nostrils. Even if I\u2019d missed them, I couldn\u2019t escape his breath, which reeked of gin. The drips might have rendered Junior barren, but it was the blue ruin that was going to kill him.</p><p>Montrose showed me his overbite. \u201cWhat did your old man do, marry a squawk?\u201d</p><p>Diana became a beautiful statue, Miranda sucked in a shocked breath and tried to cover it with her bony hand, and Nolan Sr. cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhy, no, sir,\u201d I said as pleasantly as I could. \u201cThat would have been against the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as dark as one.\u201d His gaze wandered over my black hair before settling on my eyes. \u201cWho were your mother\u2019s people?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That proved a bit too much, even for the old man, who snapped, \u201cThat will suffice, Montrose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, milord.\u201d I smiled at his jackass of a son. \u201cMy mother\u2019s people were Welshires and Norders. Working class, I believe.\u201d</p><p>As I expected, admitting that one-half of my family had been common laborers explained my coloring, invalidated any suspicion that I might be trying to better my situation, and satisfied Montrose\u2019s desire to take me down to the bottom peg.</p> <p>I needed to get away from these people before I decked someone. \u201cMy father always regretted the rift his marriage caused between him and the family. He had no portraits of them, but he often told me how much I reminded him of his mother.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI only wish I could have made her acquaintance before she passed away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my rooms I have a portint of Great-aunt Hortense when she was about your age,\u201d Diana said, rising from the settee. \u201cWould you care to see it, Kit?\u201d</p><p>I managed a surprised smile. \u201cWhy, yes, I would very much, thank you, cousin.\u201d</p><p>Diana glanced at her stepson before addressing her husband. \u201cIf you will excuse us, my dear.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, clearly relieved. He must have assumed Diana was taking me off to give him the time and privacy to lecture his son over his wayward lip. I could just imagine how Father Walsh would scold: Gentlemen do not speak of such scum in polite company, my lad.</p> <p>As soon as we were out of earshot, the lady touched my arm. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Kit. Monty usually doesn\u2019t drink so much before dinner. Now, shall we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink nothing of it, cousin.\u201d Aware that there were still servants around who could overhear us, I touched a finger to my lips to silence her, and then said clearly, \u201cI am so anxious to see the portint of your great-aunt, my grandmother. Do you really believe I bear a resemblance to her?\u201d</p><p>As Diana assured me at length of how much I did, she led me upstairs and through a maze of halls to her personal chambers, which included two sitting rooms, a dressing room, a bath, and an enormous bedchamber. A young, plump female sat working carefully to mend the torn hem of a gown hanging from a dress form. As soon as she saw us, she darted her needle and stood.</p><p>\u201cMilady.\u201d A well-trained lass, the chambermaid didn\u2019t spare me a single glance. \u201cDo you need something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Betsy. This is my cousin, Miss Kittredge.\u201d She waited until the maid dropped a curtsey my way before she added, \u201cActually, you know, there is something I want. Would you please run down to the apothecary and fetch me a pain powder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt once, milady.\u201d The maid departed.</p> <p>\u201cI never have the headache, except now and then in the morning,\u201d Diana confided as she led me into her bedchamber. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only task I could think of that will take her some time to accomplish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will help.\u201d I closed the doors before I opened my satchel and took out the echo. \u201cDo you know how long Montrose was away on his tour after school?\u201d</p><p>Her brows arched. \u201cI think Nolan told me once that he spent three years traveling. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious.\u201d I went to the wall nearest her bed.</p><p>Diana went to the window to look down at the city. \u201cMy stepdaughters are both kind in their own fashion, but Montrose . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what compels him to be so provocative. Or vulgar.\u201d</p><p>I did, and after a moment of silent debate decided to tell her. \u201cMontrose never made a tour, milady. He likely spent those three years in hospital, taking the cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cure?\u201d She turned to me. \u201cWhatever for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe drips.\u201d</p> <p>She swayed and then abruptly sat down on her bed. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Montrose was already married, so I thought my father meant to offer me to him. I was so astonished when Nolan admitted his regard for me.\u201d Her hand touched her ashen cheek. \u201cMy God.\u201d She gazed up. \u201cMontrose\u2019s wife\u2014he must have given it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful, milady. After the first year the rot moves into the brain, where it harms no one but the unfortunate one infected.\u201d I popped the cap on the echo and checked the lens. \u201cIt is likely the reason behind these attacks. Young Walsh can never inherit, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I understand why Nolan is always so attentive to . . . his husbandly duties.\u201d A giggle escaped her. \u201cI\u2019m to provide him with a new heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d And I was.</p><p>She blotted her eyes with a lace handkerchief. \u201cHow could you know this? Have you been one of Montrose\u2019s . . . particular companions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have friends in the city who acquire such information. One of them shared it with me.\u201d I went around the bed and began working on the next wall.</p><p>She ran her hand over the embroidered coverlet beneath her. \u201cHe\u2019ll keep coming to me every night, won\u2019t he? Until I increase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is another way,\u201d I told her. \u201cTake a younger lover. One who has the same coloring as Lord Walsh. Someone you can trust to keep his mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never betray Nolan.\u201d But after that instant of shock, she grew silent and thoughtful.</p><p>While Lady Walsh sorted through her mental list of suitable, fertile young lovers, I finished my sweep of the room. The only recesses in the walls were spaces between the support posts, too narrow to serve as hidey-holes. I checked the two windows, the locks on which had not been tampered with, and then the door bolts, which were likewise secure. Whoever was coming into the lady\u2019s room at night was not using a hidey-hole or a secret passage. There wasn\u2019t even enough room in her armoire for someone to hide behind the gowns.</p><p>Solving poor Liv\u2019s problem had been a great deal easier, I thought, and then whirled around to look at the lady\u2019s bed. It was made of old, carefully tended terebinth, posted and canopied, and so massive it probably would have required a small army to shift it.</p><p>The frame of it sat some two and a half feet off the floor.</p><p>I knelt down and bent over sideways to look under the frame. The hardwood floor beneath it was lightly covered in dust, except for a long, wide rectangle in the center. I crawled under, stopping short of the rectangle, and extended the echo over it. I had to crane my head a bit to see into the lens, but it showed a two-by-three-foot section under the floor that was completely black.</p><p>Plenty of room for someone with a knife to hide and wait.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>I couldn\u2019t bring a candle under the bed without setting fire to the mattress, so I was obliged to blindly feel for the seams. Something thin and rough brushed my fingertips, and I grasped a bit of cord. When I tugged it, a section of the floor slats lifted up.</p><p>Inside the hidey-hole was a short ladder that led down into the darkness. On the top rung lay something folded and white. I reached for it, removed the handkerchief, and brought it to my face, turning away quickly as soon as I identified the scent.</p><p>It still smelled of the ether it had been soaked with.</p><p>I never have the headache, except now and then in the morning.</p><p>I replaced the handkerchief, scooted back, lowered the panel back into place, and inched back out from under the bed.</p><p>\u201cHeavens, Kit.\u201d Diana helped me to my feet and brushed her hands over my sleeves. \u201cYou\u2019re covered with dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d I helped her. \u201cThere\u2019s a passageway in the floor concealed beneath your bed. Someone\u2019s been coming through it, and they\u2019ve been using ether to keep you asleep while they cut you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>I gestured toward the edge of the frame. \u201cSee for yourself. Be careful when you tug on the cord; don\u2019t snap it.\u201d</p><p>Diana crawled under the bed, gave a muffled cry, and pushed herself back out. \u201cWe have to call the police,\u201d she said as she stumbled to her feet. \u201cAt once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Montrose is responsible for this, that would be very unwise.\u201d I put a restraining hand on her shoulder. \u201cLord Walsh has to discover what is being done to you. When you come to bed tonight, first go under there and dislodge the panel, just enough for it to be easily noticed. As soon as your husband comes to you, drop your wedding ring and kick it under the bed. Then ask him to retrieve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She gave me a wild look. \u201cWhy would I arrange such a farce? Someone is trying to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone is trying to badly frighten you.\u201d When she began to protest, I cut her off with, \u201cIf they wanted you dead, milady, they\u2019d have slit your throat the first night.\u201d</p><p>Her face a mask of alabaster now, she pressed a hand to her neck. \u201cWhy would they do this? What purpose would it serve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say, milady. But once your husband discovers the passage under your bed, I expect he\u2019ll get to the bottom of it.\u201d That might not be the result, however, and I couldn\u2019t abandon her to a husband who might be part of this scheme. \u201cIf Lord Walsh retrieves the ring and says nothing about the panel, then he is the one responsible. I can help you get away from him.\u201d When Diana gave me a surprised look, I explained, \u201cWe\u2019ll make him believe you\u2019ve left to visit your family.\u201d I heard one of the outer doors opening and quickly stowed the echo before brushing the last of the dust from Lady Walsh\u2019s gown. \u201cYou must act as if nothing has happened, or the game will be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what this is to you? A game?\u201d Before I could answer, she drew herself up and composed her expression. \u201cForgive me, Miss Kittredge. You have been most helpful, but your services are no longer required.\u201d</p><p>Which was the lady\u2019s way of telling me to piss off. \u201cThink nothing of it, Lady Diana.\u201d</p><p>She retrieved a small silk purse from her bedside table and dropped it in my hands. \u201cYour continued discretion is also appreciated.\u201d</p><p>From the weight I knew I was being paid three times the agreed-on fee. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my mouth shut, milady. You needn\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>She assumed with perfection the exquisitely bored look of a tonner. \u201cWhy ever would I do that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The chambermaid stood waiting in the front sitting room, a glass of water and a twist of paper on a small silver tray.</p><p>\u201cBetsy, Miss Kittredge is leaving,\u201d the lady told her. \u201cWould you please show her the way out?\u201d</p><p>Betsy looked relieved. \u201cYes, milady.\u201d</p> <p>After running a gauntlet of frowning maids and glowering footmen, I was shown out through the side entrance reserved for tradesmen and visiting servants.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said to the door Betsy closed firmly in my face before walking down the short stairs to the street. Wrecker was nowhere to be seen, and I couldn\u2019t wait for him on the street without attracting attention from a nobber\u2014one of the private security guards who patrolled the streets of the Hill to safeguard the residents from unwelcome intruders. Nobbers liked to crack heads first and ask questions later. I started making my way down the narrow walk.</p><p>Before I could reach the thoroughfare and hail a cab, a large, gleaming coach drawn by four magnificent grays cut me off. I would have gone around it but for the silver fist-and-pike crest on the door.</p><p>Of course it would be him.</p><p>Shadows shrouded the inside of the coach and the man who said, \u201cGet in.\u201d</p> <p>The driver and the footman didn\u2019t move from their positions; I wasn\u2019t worth the trouble. So I unlatched the door and boosted myself up inside.</p><p>The interior was, like the coach and the horses and the servant\u2019s livery, a dismal gray. I perched on the rear-facing bench, taking the time to arrange my skirts and satchel before I looked out the window. Watching the scenery couldn\u2019t erase the delicious spicy scent teasing my nose or calm the nerves humming beneath every inch of my skin, but he didn\u2019t have to know that.</p><p>\u201cTrolling on the Hill now, are we?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, didn\u2019t your last spell for the governor provide the promised amount of dazzle?\u201d</p><p>No answer came, not that I expected one from Dredmore.</p><p>No, Lucien Dredmore, the former Lord Travallian, mentalist, deathmage, and current acknowledged Grand Master of the Dark Arts in the whole of Toriana, simply popped a matchit with his thumbnail and lit a thin black cigar clamped between his strong white teeth. The flame briefly illuminated his craggy features but failed to find a reflection in his black eyes. Then he shook out the matchit and blew out a thin stream of smoke.</p><p>I might have loved the smell of him, but I hated his cigars. I coughed and banged my fist against the panel under the driver\u2019s ass. \u201cGetting out,\u201d I called.</p> <p>The coach didn\u2019t even slow.</p><p>Lucien puffed a few more times before he examined the glowing tip of his smoke. \u201cWhat were you doing at Walsh\u2019s, Charmian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDusting the furniture. Haven\u2019t you heard? All the maids on the Hill have gone on strike.\u201d Inside I braced myself before I looked directly at his cruelly handsome face. \u201cWhy, is Walsh someone you haven\u2019t yet fleeced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan Walsh is a member of a very powerful financial consortium,\u201d he said. \u201cHe does the fleecing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so he\u2019s your friend.\u201d I sat back. \u201cI think it\u2019s fabulous that you still have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan wouldn\u2019t hire the likes of you,\u201d he said, as if I weren\u2019t there. \u201cIt would have been the daughter. Or the new wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t discuss my business with thieves and liars,\u201d I told him sweetly. \u201cBut I\u2019d happily tell them all about it before I\u2019d confide in scum like you.\u201d</p><p>Accustomed as he was to my insults, Dredmore didn\u2019t even bat an eyelash. \u201cThere\u2019s a dark, dire force moving through the city, Charmian. You\u2019d be smart to stay clear of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA dark, dire force.\u201d I laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s good, Lucien, that\u2019s very good. I will say one thing for you, your showmanship never disappoints.\u201d I sensed I was running out of time and gave the panel another thump. \u201cStop this rubbish cart now, or I\u2019ll scream murder.\u201d</p><p>He regarded me through the cloud of smoke between us. \u201cYou\u2019d rather tromp all the way back to that hovel of yours than accept my assistance? Why get in, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I didn\u2019t,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cYou had one of your hooligans grab me and toss me in.\u201d Lucien had gagged me that time and put his hands on me as well, something I still wanted to stab him in the heart for.</p><p>He leaned forward. \u201cCome to supper tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Short, unadorned, straight to the point: that was the only way to refuse Dredmore. That and the visible brandishment of one or more sharp weapons. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have left my daggers at home.</p><p>\u201cI felt something today,\u201d he told me. \u201cA disturbance in the netherside. Old magic.\u201d</p><p>The netherside, realm of all things mystical. Supposedly it was parked up against reality, just out of sight to ordinary folk, though mages claimed they could sense it.</p><p>\u201cLikely a spot of indigestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d He stared at my lips. \u201cIt tasted of you.\u201d</p><p>Now I was going to be sick, hopefully all over his spotless trousers and gleaming boots. \u201cThere is no such thing as the netherside or magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you rabbit about disenchanting things?\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cI investigate real crimes, I expose the frauds dressing them up as magic, and I stop good, hardworking people from wasting what little they have on charlatans who do nothing.\u201d I waited a beat. \u201cLike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will find out what you were doing at Walsh\u2019s.\u201d He sat back. \u201cThen you and I will have a very long discussion about the consequences for young females who are too headstrong and foolish to stay in their proper place.\u201d</p><p>I curled my upper lip. \u201cWhere\u2019s that for me, then? In your bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a tedious lack of imagination.\u201d He pitched his cigar out the window before he pulled down the shades. \u201cI have you where I want you now.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything in here but annoy me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201d Dredmore dragged me off the seat and onto his thighs, where he clamped me against his chest. \u201cNo, don\u2019t struggle, Charmian. You made the challenge.\u201d He wrapped the chain of my pendant around his fist until it became a noose around my neck. \u201cI am only rising to the occasion.\u201d</p><p>I felt a bulge of blunt hardness against my thigh and went still, ducking my head to hide my fear. \u201cYou\u2019re pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to annoying?\u201d His lips glanced over my cheekbone. \u201cLift your chin.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the vee of his waistcoat. \u201cGo to the devil.\u201d</p><p>He released the chain, took hold of my hair, and gave it a sharp tug, and I jerked up my chin. I made myself stone as he put his mouth over mine, and I kept my teeth clamped together to prevent his tongue any access.</p><p>Like all the others, this would not count as my first kiss, I thought as he worked his lips against mine. Another mauling, most definitely, but I wasn\u2019t kissing him. I\u2019d never kiss him. I would never, ever give in to such brute tactics\u2014</p><p>And then I was kissing him, my mouth open to his, my tongue curling round the silky glide of his. Dimly I felt him let go of my hair and gather me closer, his fingers at my bodice and then my breast, cupping and squeezing. He ceased that only to reach down, and then I felt my skirts sliding up over my calves and then my knees\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I wrenched my face to one side, first to drag in breath and then to hold it. My body wanted to do terrible things, and my mind wanted worse, and I could not relent to either. Not here, and not with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did that feel like, Charmian?\u201d He caught a tendril of hair hanging in my eyes and smoothed it back. \u201cAnnoyance, or something deeper? And would you like to feel it all night?\u201d</p><p>I would have smashed my brow into his, but all it wanted to do was rest against his shoulder as my shaking hand pushed my skirts back down. \u201cYou have to stop doing this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I straightened and looked into his black, soulless eyes as I let how I felt show on my face.</p><p>\u201cSo we remain at impasse. Very well.\u201d Carefully he lifted me and placed me back on the opposite seat. Before I could shift back into the corner, he reached out and clamped a black-gloved hand over my wrist. \u201cYou will come to me, Charmian. Perhaps not now, but soon. The portents are never wrong.\u201d</p><p>He did have the deepest, most commanding voice of any man I\u2019d known. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night, covered in sweat, hearing the last echo of it humming in my ears as I remembered other times he\u2019d touched and kissed me. If anyone could ever bespell me, it would be Lucien Dredmore.</p><p>Over my dead body.</p><p>He dodged my fist and thrust me back, calling out, \u201cHere, Connell.\u201d</p><p>The coach came to a swift stop.</p><p>I glanced out and saw that I was back in town. \u201cThank you for the ride, Dredmore. Very decent of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharmian.\u201d He watched me climb out.</p><p>From there I walked a few blocks to the local fishncrisp to pick up two hot meals for me and Docket. The encounter with Dredmore had killed what appetite I had, so I ordered a pot of bisque and some crackers for myself and a big platter of fried coddles and shoelace-thin crispies for the mech. Since the owner still owed me a massive debt for dispelling all of his fish shops, I\u2019d agreed to take meals in barter.</p><p>\u201cRight you are, miss,\u201d the counter boy said as he loaded the meal containers into two round packing cylinders marked with his shop\u2019s brand. \u201cWhere to drop?\u201d</p><p>I had to go home to freshen up, but I intended to spend a few hours at the office, so I gave him my building and drop numbers. He tagged them on the side of the cylinders in grease pencil, and I lingered long enough to watch him load the meal buckets into the tube.</p><p>The shops that sent hot food by bucket around the city were scrupulously honest\u2014their business depended on it\u2014but sometimes too many buckets in the tubes created a backup at the sorting stations, and if so I\u2019d just stop for the meals later on my way to the office myself (and Docket would have his hand delivery.) This time, however, the cylinders shot off directly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I left I passed a number of magic shops and tellers, most just opening for night business. While I generally ignored them for the nonsense hope peddlers that they were, Dredmore\u2019s warning and Lady Diana\u2019s strange wounds caused me to glance in a few windows.</p><p>Mages, tellers, and other practitioners of the dark arts were a clannish bunch and rarely socialized outside their ranks\u2014Dredmore being one of the few, annoying exceptions, though he had once been titled, which evidently made him less repulsive to the tonners. They invariably lived where they worked, in small cramped lofts above their shops, which offered any and every sort of magic one could desire, from seeings to seekings to special charms.</p><p>The latest addition to their industry were warders: specialty mages who charmed wardlings forged of silver that were supposed to cast protective charms over people and homes and even whole buildings to protect them from the netherside and\u2014what else?\u2014ward off harmful or evil spells. One could hardly find a window or threshold in the city that hadn\u2019t been adorned with a wardling.</p> <p>What was interesting to me was just how many wardlings I saw in the windows and over the doors of the magic shops. Pretty as the inscribed silver disks were, they were as useless as oversize coins. Still, warders had been growing very influential of late, which baffled me to no end. I\u2019d never thought that the other charlatans in their trade would ever believe that manner of foolishness.</p><p>I approached an old native shaman, who crouched in front of a neighborhood stable. He\u2019d drawn a circle in the dirt around a white rat that had been tied to a large stone. I looked away as the old man used his blade to nick the rodent\u2019s neck; I knew he\u2019d use the blood to paint some strange design over the threshold of the stable. One of the local\u2019s mounts must have died suddenly; the superstitious natives wouldn\u2019t touch another horse in the same stable until the rat-blood ritual was performed. I had no love for rats, but seeing any creature bled for something so meaningless revolted me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d stopped in front of a richly decorated window until the middle-aged female proprietor unlocked the shop door, stepped out, and spoke to me. \u201cSee your future, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a believer,\u201d I said absently, and nodded toward her window, where she had displayed a row of inscribed silver disks hanging from neck chains. \u201cAre you lot selling wardlings as baubles now?\u201d</p><p>Her expression turned shuttered. \u201cPr\u2019aps you\u2019d best move on, miss. \u2019Twill be dark soon.\u201d She turned and went back into the shop.</p> <p>Tellers were the least offensive of mages, so I followed her in. \u201cHang on,\u201d I called after her. \u201cI changed my mind. I do want a seeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, can\u2019t. I\u2019m about to close.\u201d She scampered behind a long counter covered with hundreds of lit candles, vials of colored stones, and large blueglass spirit snuffballs. \u201cThere\u2019s another teller four doors down. She\u2019ll see for you. She sees for anyone.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never patronized a teller before, but I vaguely remembered one of Rina\u2019s gels comparing them to strumpets in that they demanded payment before service was rendered.</p><p>She wanted the money first, then. \u201cHow much is it?\u201d I asked as I reached into my satchel for some coin.</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I\u2019m done in for the day, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only just opened your door,\u201d I reminded her. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you see for me?\u201d Something occurred to me. \u201cDo you know a witch named Gert?\u201d</p> <p>She flicked her eyes over me, as if she were afraid to look at me too long. \u201cNo. And I never seen the likes of you.\u201d She made a funny gesture and whispered, \u201cHope never to see again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpells are nonsense,\u201d I informed her, in the event she was about to cast one. \u201cMight as well save your breath.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a frightened look and the next thing she said came out in a hill country accent. \u201cEv doan nowhat to ye, elshy. Lave oof m\u2019now.\u201d</p><p>Something buzzed in my ears. \u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t utter another word but spun and ran back into a storeroom, slamming the door and locking it behind her.</p><p>I dropped my coin tuck back in my reticule and resisted the urge to give it a swing and smash a few candleglasses. That was when I noticed the dozens of smoke wisps rising around me, and how dark it had become inside the shop.</p><p>Something had blown out the teller\u2019s candles. All of them.</p><p>At home I ran a bath, but while I was undressing something snapped and slithered down between my breasts. I didn\u2019t realize it was my pendant until I pulled it out of my bodice and stared at the broken links.</p> <p>\u201cDamn me.\u201d The chain was older than me, and thanks to my tussle with Dredmore in the carriage it had finally snapped. I left the pendant on my vanity and went to the little cashsafe I kept behind a painting of New Yorkshire. I had another chain I\u2019d taken in lieu of payment from a silversmith with a fireplace he thought haunted but that I\u2019d found occupied by a nesting owl.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you.\u201d</p><p>I whirled around to see a strange old man standing in my bedchamber. \u201cWho are you?\u201d I yanked up my bodice to cover my chest and glanced at the door and the windows, all of which were still closed. \u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d</p><p>He held up hands that looked too long and narrow for his short, thin frame. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, lass. In fact, if you\u2019ll give a moment to explain, I may be of some considerable assistance to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff that.\u201d I grabbed a prodder from the hearth and brandished it. Wrecker had once shown me the best spots to cripple a man and I remembered all of them. \u201cGet out of here or I\u2019ll cosh in your skull.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jesting with you, old man.\u201d Was he a burglar or a rapist? \u201cI don\u2019t know what you want, but I\u2019ve nothing worth nicking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve everything I gave you, Charm, as well as a few things I didn\u2019t.\u201d He began wandering around the room, touching things that were not his. \u201cDon\u2019t the maids ever dust in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have maids. What the devil are you doing? Don\u2019t touch that.\u201d I went after him as he peered at my pendant. When I tried to grab him, my hand passed straight through him, as if he wasn\u2019t even there. My fingers came away stiff with cold, as if I\u2019d held my hand to a block of ice.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d He was a ghost, and he was talking to me. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free, love. After twenty years of waiting and watching.\u201d He drew back from my vanity. \u201cThough I imagine your da is spinning like a top in his grave. He never did like me, you know. And your mother . . .\u201d He gave a shudder that made his form shimmer.</p><p>He was a ghost and a loon. \u201cWhy are you haunting me?\u201d I demanded. \u201cI don\u2019t know you. I didn\u2019t kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, my gel, is a very long story.\u201d He eyed the window. \u201cI\u2019d leave you in peace, but it\u2019s still daylight. My sort can only go about freely after dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you are not staying here all day,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not inclined to. You\u2019ve a green stone in your left pocket,\u201d he told me. \u201cGive it to me.\u201d</p><p>Here was a chance to find out more about the real nature of ghosts versus the nonsense the magic trade always spouted about them. I took out the pebble and tossed it to him. Instead of passing through him as my hand had, it landed in his open palm. He closed his fingers over it and frowned.</p><p>\u201cNasty bit of spell put on this.\u201d He made a fist, relaxed it, and bits of green gravel fell to the floor. \u201cWhoever gave this to you wants you dead, Charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not mine.\u201d The magical nickname made me glower. \u201cAnd I\u2019m called Kit.\u201d</p><p>His white hair ruffled as he shook his head. \u201cYour name is Charmian Constance. Your mother called you that after your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the wrong Charmian,\u201d I told him through my teeth.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s name was Christopher Kittredge, wasn\u2019t it? Your mother would have taken his name. She could never use mine.\u201d His expression turned thoughtful. \u201cI\u2019m not certain she even knew it.\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped. \u201cYou were married to my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was her father. I\u2019m your grandfather, Charm.\u201d He sketched a bow. \u201cHarry White, at your service.\u201d</p><p>Talking to this mirage was giving me a headache. \u201cGo haunt someone else, Harry White.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe daylight problem, as I mentioned, prevents my departure.\u201d He started toward me. \u201cThen there\u2019s the fact that you\u2019re in grave danger. Dark forces are gathering.\u201d</p><p>It was almost exactly what Dredmore had said. \u201cWhat dark forces?\u201d</p><p>He gestured at the vanity. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to wear that at all times, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Is that what he was after? My pendant? I went over and picked it up. \u201cI do already,\u201d I said, turning around to face him. \u201cNow what\u2014\u201d</p><p>I discovered I was talking to myself, as it seemed that Harry White had done the same as every ghost I\u2019d ever encountered: vanished without a word.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Being the only female tenant in my office building had some advantages, like the use of a lavatory I had to share only with the occasional female client (rare) and my own chutes for rubbish, post, and meal drops (none of the other tenants wanted the contents of their tubes mixed in with a woman\u2019s). The only significant drawback to being the sole woman on the premises was my lack of staff; I had to deal with anyone and everyone who came to call\u2014even some of the other tenants who wandered past my door.</p><p>Tonight it was Horace Eduwin Gremley the Fourth, a clerk from the second-floor title office. Horace the Second, a semirespectable land broker, had arranged the job for his grandson when Horace the Third had deserted his wife and son for the lure of gold. I knew the lad\u2019s father had been swept off and drowned while unwisely panning during an early thaw, so I tried to be tolerant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMiss Kittredge\u201d\u2014the lad\u2019s grandfather had beaten some manners into the fourth bearer of his esteemed name, and he folded himself over in a generous bow\u2014\u201cI\u2019d hoped to run into you before I left for home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Gremley.\u201d I gave him a tiny bob and held on to my key rather than unlock the door. \u201cHow may I be of assistance?\u201d</p><p>His eyes skipped up and down the length of my gown. \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing so important. Simply a small matter I wished to discuss with you.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019d have to discuss it out in the hall, because the last thing I would ever do on this earth would be to closet myself alone in a room with Fourth. \u201cDo go on.\u201d</p><p>His beady eyes darted to the knob. \u201cIt is something of a delicate nature.\u201d</p><p>Blast it, he was going to ask me out again. I glanced around him. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone on the other floors will hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother bids me attend the opening of the opera.\u201d His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed. \u201cI would be greatly honored if you would consent to be my escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow kind of you to think of me.\u201d I pretended to consider it. \u201cWhen is this opening?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThursday next.\u201d</p><p>I produced my usual disappointed face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but I have a previous engagement that night.\u201d As I had had the twenty-six other times when he had asked for my companionship.</p><p>\u201cDid I say Thursday?\u201d he said, his eyes gleaming with triumph. \u201cOh, dear. I meant Friday.\u201d</p><p>The little snot was actually trying to out-lie me. \u201cAlas, Mr. Gremley, my engagement is out of the city, and of some duration. I daresay I will be gone until Sunday next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Under the yoke of his ill-fitting jacket, his bony shoulders sagged. \u201cMother was adamant about my obtaining a proper escort this year. If I do not, she threatens to match me with one of the Plumsens.\u201d</p><p>Despite my annoyance I felt a pang of sympathy for him. \u201cThe Plumsens are a very respectable family.\u201d And their da had passed to each of his daughters a perfect replica of his uptilted nozzer, giving them all the look of well-fed infant swine.</p> <p>\u201cI should be glad to have any escort, I know,\u201d Fourth said on a heartfelt sigh. \u201cBut the Plumsen daughters are nothing to you, Miss Kittredge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind, Mr. Gremley.\u201d Perhaps I could solve my problem with Fourth in a different manner. \u201cI wonder, sir, have you ever been introduced to Mr. Skolnik from the first floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkolnik the importer?\u201d When I nodded, he looked confused. \u201cWe are nodding acquaintances, yes.\u201d</p><p>That was all he needed. \u201cDid you know then that Mr. Skolnik has an unmarried daughter who has recently come over to live with him? Maritza, I believe her name is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not English or Torian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I believe that she doesn\u2019t speak much English, either, but I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting her and she\u2019s quite lovely.\u201d I described her in genteel terms, and then added, \u201cI imagine if you persuaded Mr. Skolnik to introduce you to Maritza, she would be delighted to accept an invitation to the opera.\u201d</p><p>Fourth seemed taken aback by my suggestion. \u201cBut if she speaks so little English, how would Mama or I converse with her?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cWith such a companion, Mr. Gremley, you need not converse at all.\u201d</p> <p>I could almost hear the seldom-used gears in Fourth\u2019s head start to turn. \u201cMama would not be able to grill . . . I mean, inquire as to her family connections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich are, of course, quite respectable.\u201d In her own country, anyway. \u201cI have been engaged by Mr. Skolnik several times, and he is a pleasant, amiable gentleman. You might mention that I am greatly in favor of your introduction.\u201d</p><p>Fourth\u2019s grin tried to reach from one jug-handle ear to the other. \u201cYou have done me a great service, Miss Kittredge.\u201d He bowed again. \u201cI am forever in your debt.\u201d</p><p>I bobbed. \u201cA pleasure as always, Mr. Gremley.\u201d I still waited until he dashed to the stair before entering my office.</p><p>I checked the tubes, removed my still-hot bisque from the bucket before sending the container back through, and picked through some advertisements as I nibbled on a cracker. No invitations for tea, supper, or parties, which saved me an hour of penning polite refusals. Then I found a thin gray envelope sealed with silver wax that bore the impression of a spike-wielding fist.</p><p>I should have tossed it into the fire as I had all the others, but Dredmore\u2019s remarks still had me unsettled. I sat down behind my desk and used my letter dagger to slice off the seal.</p><p>The envelope contained a single sheet of thin silver vellum folded in thirds. The paper exuded a faint scent of smoke and burnt herbs; the black ink he\u2019d used to pen the thick, slashing letters gleamed with a ghostly sheen. With it he\u2019d written:</p><p>Charmian,</p><p>You are meddling in matters beyond your scope. I will see to Walsh, and you will refrain from calling on his wife again. Whatever sums she promised you are not worth your life.</p><p>Dredmore</p><p>P.S. Now you may burn this and eat your supper before your bisque grows too cold.</p><p>He always knew what I was doing or eating, and I had no idea how he managed that. He wanted me to believe it was magic, of course.</p><p>\u201cCheeky sod.\u201d I crumpled the stationery in my fist and threw the ball of it into the hearth, where it blazed up in a fountain of silvery sparks before shrinking to a snail of ash. \u201cI\u2019ll call on Lady Walsh three times a day if I please.\u201d</p><p>Thoughts of Dredmore did not entirely preoccupy my supper hour. Rather it was the name the teller had called me in her twangy, wrong-voweled accent: elshy.</p><p>I jumped as someone knocked on the office door. \u201cMadam Kittredge,\u201d a mellow, male voice called. \u201cThis is NSY. Open up if you please.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t please, but the Yard could break down any door if they so chose, so I went out to let him in. Through the panel I saw one man, fair-haired and average-sized, dressed in a plainclothesman\u2019s long trench and low-brim. Behind him hovered the darker shape of a beater in dark blue, holding his trunch as if ready to smash in the glass.</p><p>I opened the door. \u201cYes?\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to offer my assistance, not to the cops.</p><p>The inspector doffed his hat, revealing the tough, wind-weathered features and sun-faded blue eyes of a former navyman. \u201cForgive the intrusion, madam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s miss,\u201d I corrected him, frowning a little. I didn\u2019t know any mariners, but his features still looked awfully familiar. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cInspector Thomas Doyle, Rumsen Main Station.\u201d</p><p>Now there was a name I knew; one that made me smile. \u201cAny relation to the Middleway Doyles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather Arthur.\u201d He frowned. \u201cHang on. Kittredge, Kittredge . . .\u201d His expression cleared. \u201cYou\u2019re Rachel\u2019s little Charmian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, just a bit bigger.\u201d I made the last connection, although the inspector looked much different than he had at the age of five, when he\u2019d lost to me at croke. \u201cAnd you\u2019d be Arthur\u2019s Tommy?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and peered over my shoulder, making me realize that I was making the grandson of one of my mother\u2019s oldest friends stand out in the hall. I stepped back. \u201cDo come in.\u201d</p><p>Doyle had a quiet word with his beater, who nodded and positioned himself beside the door. Then he came in and followed me through the front sitting room to my office, where he refused to sit or have a cup of tea.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, but I\u2019ve come to speak to Mr. Kittredge,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf he\u2019s stepped out, I can wait for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need a teller, then.\u201d I wanted to dunk my throbbing head in my tea mug but settled for sipping from it as I went behind the desk and sat down. \u201cMy father died with my mother some years ago.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cMy condolences. I meant the Mr. Kittredge who owns this business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be me.\u201d I didn\u2019t chuckle at his reaction, but it was close. \u201cDon\u2019t look so shocked, Inspector. Women may never have the vote, but these days we are permitted to work. And you used to call me Kit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I did.\u201d He looked around again, this time as if expecting the walls to collapse on him. \u201cHow, exactly, does a woman obtain an investigator\u2019s license?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual way.\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to incriminate myself or the officials I\u2019d bribed, or admit that for the first four years I\u2019d been in business I\u2019d been obliged to conduct my work without a proper license. \u201cI\u2019m about to have my dinner. Fancy some bisque?\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later we were sipping mugs in front of my fire. Doyle\u2019s tough face softened as he spoke of his parents and regaled me with some of the amusing adventures they\u2019d had at their farm. As he did, I smiled and nodded while sorting through my memories until I recalled the last time I\u2019d seen Tommy: a birthday tea we\u2019d both attended when I was seven years old. Mum had dropped me off with Tom, promising to return for us both in a few hours.</p><p>When he reached a lull in his own conversation, I asked, \u201cDo you remember the time we went to Deidre\u2019s garden tea?\u201d</p><p>Doyle nodded. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like the mage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe smelled of gin and had dandruff in his eyebrows.\u201d I took his empty mug and mine over to my little washbasin. \u201cDo you remember what happened with the old sot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeidre asked him to conjure her a blue rabbit.\u201d He came over to watch me wash the crockery. \u201cBut he couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you supposed to bring a rabbit?\u201d my seven-year-old self asked the smelly old man as he kept drawing bigger circles in the air with his stick.</p><p>Big tears welled up in Deidre\u2019s eyes, and she shrieked for her mother, who rushed over. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, darling?\u201d As soon as the birthday gel told her, the mother turned to the old man. \u201cGo on, then. Give her a rabbit.\u201d</p><p>He straightened. \u201cI\u2019ve tried, madam, many times. It will not manifest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She propped her fists on her hips. \u201cFor the ten shillings I\u2019m paying you, it had better manifest, and right this instant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must rowan or witchbane planted nearby.\u201d The old man glanced around at the neat flower beds. \u201cI fear I am powerless here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dodgy charlatan. If I wanted to be gypped, I\u2019d have hired a Rom.\u201d She pointed to the gate. \u201cPiss off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut ye\u2019ve not paid me\u2014\u201d The old man stopped and yelped as the birthday gel bit his hand. \u201cBloody little savage!\u201d</p><p>He swung his stick at her head, but I grabbed it before he could hit her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad man,\u201d I said, and broke the stick in two. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>His eyes showed whites all the way around as he pointed a trembling finger at me. \u201cIt\u2019s her,\u201d he croaked. \u201cShe\u2019s done it, she has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKit?\u201d</p> <p>I looked up at Doyle\u2019s concerned face and realized for the first time just how much I liked it. \u201cSorry.\u201d The last thing I needed was to go sweet on a cop. \u201cBefore Deidre\u2019s mum threw out the old tosser, he called me something. Something nasty. Do you remember what it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must have missed that part of the tea.\u201d He smiled a little. \u201cWhy do you care what a drunken old bully said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause someone called me the same thing today.\u201d</p><p>The inspector wasn\u2019t looking me in the eye anymore.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Elshy,\u2019\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I still don\u2019t know what it means. Do you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p> <p>Like all cops, Tommy Doyle knew how to lie. Most defenders of the truth usually did. I decided not to press the issue\u2014for now. \u201cSo why have you come to call on Disenchanted &amp; Company, Inspector?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assigned to the Hill,\u201d he said. \u201cWe received a report of a disturbance at Walsh\u2019s Folly yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow terrible.\u201d I meant his assignment, not the disturbance.</p><p>\u201cA young woman imposed herself on one of the wealthier families.\u201d He leaned against my wall. \u201cApparently she claimed some sort of connection and had to be ordered off the premises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat cheek.\u201d The butler had reported me, I guessed. Nolan had no cause, and Diana wouldn\u2019t risk it. \u201cI do hope you find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lass in question called herself Kittredge.\u201d His mouth stretched and curled. \u201cDo you have a sister I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, I\u2019m the only female Kittredge in the city.\u201d I peered down at the random notes I had scrawled on my blotter. \u201cHow odd. I called on Lady Diana Walsh yesterday, at her invitation. I had tea with her and her delightful family before I departed, and that is all. Perhaps there\u2019s been some terrible misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Walsh will verify your visit?\u201d After my nod he demanded, \u201cDid you go there to extort money from the lady?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d What had that creaky old winge reported, that I was a blackmailer? \u201cI make my money honestly, Inspector. Ask anyone.\u201d I thought of Gert. \u201cExcept old witches. They\u2019re not too fond of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called on a family of means with whom you have no connection. You are unmarried, and you went alone. You know how that looks.\u201d His blue eyes searched my face. \u201cWho hired you, and why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not employed by the Walshes or anyone on the Hill,\u201d I said truthfully. \u201cAs for the ton\u2019s rules of behavior, they do not include women who work for their living.\u201d Now it was my turn to attack. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the Yard gave credence to servants\u2019 gossip. So how does it work, Inspector? Do you run about chasing down every tittle-tattle you hear, or only the really juicy ones?\u201d</p><p>Two flags of color rosied the jut of his cheekbones, giving him an unexpectedly boyish look. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me the real reason you called on the lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe what I\u2019ve told you, ask her,\u201d I suggested, feeling a little pang in my heart. He\u2019d been a lovely boy, and he was a fetching man, but he was only a few steps above a beater. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019d pass her a note from you, as long as it\u2019s got a Yard seal and has been sprayed for nits. Not like you\u2019re a nobber, right?\u201d</p><p>Doyle shook his head. \u201cYou shame your mother with that mouth, Kit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve covered the Doyle name with glory?\u201d I leaned forward. \u201cWhat would my dear old uncle Arthur, rest his spirit, think of his grandson, Tommy the copper?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d hope that would provoke him enough to send him on his way. Instead, he grinned. \u201cGrandda would have loved seeing me earn my shield, you brat, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>His grandfather had come from royal blood, the highest of high posh, the truest of the blue, but the old gent had been inordinately fond of Toriana\u2019s vast working classes, especially those who protected the innocent.</p><p>\u201cAye . . . you\u2019re right. He\u2019d have been proud of you, Tommy.\u201d So was I, and in that moment I wished we were two other people. As we were, we\u2019d never have a chance.</p><p>He gave me a speculative look. \u201cWhy did you leave Middleway for Rumsen? You\u2019ve no people here, Kit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one there, either.\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to tell him how horrible it had been, living in the house where my parents had died, sick with grief, unable to think. How the vultures had barely waited until Mum and Da were in the pyre before coming for me. \u201cAs you see, I\u2019m doing all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He retrieved his longcoat. \u201cAfter your mother was sent from the queensland to Toriana, my grandfather made her his ward. She enjoyed his unwavering affection, his protection . . . and confided in him her most guarded secrets.\u201d</p><p>Old Arthur must have let something slip; he would never have told anyone, not even his own blood. \u201cYou needn\u2019t hint, Doyle. I know my mother was a nameless bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all you know?\u201d Before I could reply, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve worked on the Hill in the past, so you know what you\u2019re tempting. Walsh will do whatever he must to protect his wife\u2019s reputation. But first, he\u2019ll go excavating.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cLet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalsh belongs to the Tillers,\u201d he continued, referring to the grandest of not-so-secret secret societies for men in Rumsen. \u201cHe won\u2019t just dig, Kit. If he can\u2019t find what he wants, he\u2019ll plant it.\u201d He took out a card, wrote something on the back, and handed it to me. \u201cDirections to Mum and Da\u2019s place. I know they\u2019d love you to call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow kind of you to say.\u201d I took it, and after a small hesitation gave him one of my own. \u201cShould you ever find yourself in need of my professional services, my rates are quite reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think ten years policing have disenchanted me nicely.\u201d But he pocketed the card. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay off the Hill, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no plans to return,\u201d I said honestly.</p><p>He touched his brim. \u201cThen good day, Miss Kittredge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInspector.\u201d I bobbed with the same courtesy.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>The gurgling sound of my BrewsMaid roused me from the last minutes of my uncomfortable night sleeping on the office settee. I might have rolled over and tried for another restless hour or two, if not for the tasks that awaited me.</p><p>Tom Doyle could have done a lot more than simply ask questions on behalf of Nolan Walsh. Last night he could have hauled me in for questioning, or even tossed me in a cell to be held under suspicion. I appreciated his restraint; I also heeded his warning about Lady Diana\u2019s husband.</p><p>Too many odd things had been happening too fast. I\u2019d met the ghost of a grandfather I\u2019d never known existed. Doyle had been sent to question me and then had hinted he knew more about my mother than I did. Even Dredmore had made a point to warn me off Walsh while nattering on about his dark and dire forces, whatever that meant.</p><p>I\u2019d never investigated myself or my family, but it seemed a prudent time to remedy that. I\u2019d start by going down to the City Archives, where I could search the Hall of Records.</p><p>Before I left the office, I retreated into my private lavatory, where I kept several changes of clothes. In going into the realm of men I had two options: donning my gray switch, some face paint, and my blacks to project the appearance of a widow lady, which would be costly, or stripping myself down to the skin and donning my bucks. Since Walsh might be having me watched, and I never cared to hand out bribes unless they were absolutely necessary, I decided to go native.</p><p>Erasing every aspect of my gender didn\u2019t take much time. I sprayed my face, arms, hands, ankles, and feet with bronzen, which darkened my tanned skin to a copper brown. Making my brow fringe stand on end and stay that way required the careful application of axle grease mixed with a bit of flour. I could do nothing about the color of my eyes, but enough native women had been captured and released along with their too-dark children during the settlement that tribal people with light eyes were not uncommon now.</p><p>Finally I stuffed my crotch with a stocking-covered sausage, a trick Rina had picked up from her clients and had passed along to me. \u201cIf you\u2019re ever wondering if the bulge your beau sports is real,\u201d she had advised, \u201cintroduce him to a hungry dog.\u201d</p><p>My garments were fashioned out of scraped hides sewn together with leather lacings and decorated modestly with native beadwork. Out of respect for the real natives, I didn\u2019t wear any feathers in my hair or on my person; those were reserved for braves who had bloodied themselves in war. They were also sported by the only natives I truly despised, the shamans, who claimed to have the sight.</p><p>Native magic was every bit as phony as the kind performed by Rumsen\u2019s resident magefolk, but far more dangerous. The city practitioners faked their spells out of greed, in order to swindle their victims; the shamans used their false conjuring to control their entire tribe, to whom magic was like a religion.</p><p>The only drawback to going native was the lack of transport; I couldn\u2019t take the trolley or hail a cab, and natives were not permitted to own carris or coaches. Instead I hired a pleasant mare from a public stable and rode on horseback to City Hall. There I had to ride past a native stablehand, but he must not have looked too closely at me, for he made only the terse, sidewise jerk of the head that served as a wordless greeting among the tribes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Natives lived outside Rumsen on the lands permanently deeded to them by the Crown after the last treaty had been struck, and they did not permit their women to leave its boundaries. However, after failing to become the farmers the Crown had desired them to be, the tribesmen had gradually drifted back to Rumsen to seek work in the city. They were generally employed to look after horses or livestock, as they preferred animals to people, or worked in tanneries or potteries. I\u2019d seen a few light-skinned braves serving as drivers and footmen to young bachelor masters, as they were ferocious fighters and made the best bodyguards. Given the distressing history between the races, few families trusted them around their females, and so natives were never brought on as household staff, even among the working class.</p><p>The one prime convenience the treaty had brought for the natives was equal rights as voting citizens. New Parliament had argued for years against it, but a change in attitude toward the preservation of indigenous peoples throughout the Empire had resulted in the males of the tribes being made full citizens. Posing as a native male I had the right to access any of the government\u2019s archives whenever I pleased\u2014something not even the wealthiest of white women could do without paying a prodigious number of bribes.</p><p>As it was a weekday, I expected the City Archives Building to be jammed\u2014and it was. But most of the citizens came to purchase permits and licenses or pay their taxes, which created long lines outside Provincial Planning and H.M.\u2019s Revenue &amp; Customs. By comparison the small, cramped office of the Hall of Records was nearly empty, with only a sour-faced legal clerk and two vicars waiting in line. The collars ignored me, a poor heathen who in their view was already doomed to burn in hell everlasting. After one desultory glance I also ceased to exist for the legal clerk, who could not expect to solicit business from a citizen whose interests could only be represented in court by a tribal conciliator.</p> <p>After fifteen minutes of standing and waiting\u2014something a woman would never have been expected to do\u2014I faced the records secretary. He was one of the thousand ubiquitous young clerks in the city, overly groomed and hopelessly attired, but he greeted me courteously enough and asked via universal hand gestures if I required an interpreter.</p><p>\u201cI speak and read the English,\u201d I said in my deepest guttural native accent.</p><p>\u201cThank the Son,\u201d the secretary said baldly. \u201cTakes forever to hand-speak things with you lot, especially with the documents. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seek record of grandfather, soldierman, work class,\u201d I told him. \u201cFather wish give name papers for young sister to husband\u2019s tribe.\u201d</p><p>Some of the natives believed having blood ties to important white families, particularly if they were friendly, elevated the status of a female and could result in her husband\u2019s family offering a higher bride price. Since the government collected a hefty percentage of bride prices from the tribe, they encouraged the practice.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know how to operate the sorter, then?\u201d When I nodded, the secretary gestured toward one of the empty booths to the left of the counter.</p><p>I placed a pound note through the window slot. \u201cHow long I can use?\u201d Generally there was a limit of one hour, but the clerks tended to give natives more time for translation purposes.</p><p>\u201cUnless we\u2019ve a rush come in, you can use it as long as you like,\u201d he said as he placed the note in his cash drawer. \u201cIf you need assistance, tap the bell.\u201d</p><p>I entered the glass-sided booth, which smelled of dust, paper, and men\u2019s sweat, and sat down on the hard-backed chair in front of the wide records sorter panel.</p><p>Three large levers were marked with the B, M, and D representing the three major record rondellas (Birth, Marriage, and Death). To the right of each were twenty-six smaller levers marked with every letter of the alphabet, along with two extra with I and D that sorted out incomplete or damaged records. Another row of seven levers further separated the records by province of origin, and at the bottom of the panel was a long row of even smaller annum levers with faded labels indicating years in five-decade increments.</p><p>I pulled the B lever and watched through the glass window of the booth as the sorter\u2019s arm descended from the ceiling, then I flipped down the W, another for Tull province, and the annum lever for the fifty-year span before my mother\u2019s birth date.</p> <p>With its internal cogs adjusted by the levers, the arm stretched out, plucking the first sheaf of glassined documents from the archive shelves. It dropped them into a flat-sided chute, which carried them one by one to my window, where I used the stop knob to hold and glance at each one before allowing it to be whisked by the chute back to its shelf.</p><p>Surnames beginning with W in Tull province were common, so there were a great many records to skim through before I reached the Wh\u2019s, and all the birth records of Tullan citizens of the time period named White. There were seventy-two, and not one of them named Harold, Harrison, or Harcourt.</p><p>Which was impossible, because my grandfather could not have immigrated to Toriana without registering some sort of document of origin.</p><p>I searched the records for the annum of my mother\u2019s birth and found none registered for her either. I then went to the annum of my own birth, which I had never seen, and found the record of my delivery at Middy Women\u2019s Hospital, which noted my parents\u2019 names. Mum had been listed not as White but as Doyle. Using the new surname, I found among the birth records a writ of adoption, which named Rachel White as a foundling taken in by the Doyle family at age sixteen.</p><p>Tommy\u2019s grandfather must have gone to a great deal of trouble and expense to formally adopt my mother, but why? Had my grandfather been some sort of criminal, living underground or under a false identity?</p><p>I went back to the annum of my mother\u2019s birth and this time pulled all the incomplete records. I found one single handwritten note filed by the midwife who had attended the birth of a female child, delivered to a Harry White, Esq., and wife. My grandmother was not named but was listed as having passed in childbirth. I found no corresponding death certificate for her.</p><p>The paper trail ended there. My grandfather had come into existence on the night of my mother\u2019s birth, had evidently lived for sixteen years after without ever registering his identity, and had vanished after Arthur Doyle had adopted her.</p><p>I made note of the number stamped on the glassine seal before sending the last of the documents back to the archives, then stepped out of the booth. The other patrons had left, and I saw the secretary was finishing up his lunch at his desk. He came over to the window as soon as he saw me.</p> <p>\u201cFind what you needed?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted, only just remembering to alter my voice. \u201cIf man has no papers here, where else they could be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll citizens of Toriana are required by law to register birth, marriage, and death certificates.\u201d He sighed. \u201cUnless the man was a criminal, or protected by the Crown. Then his papers would be held by the Ministry of Prisons for the length of his sentence, or kept under seal.\u201d</p><p>I doubted even someone as high in society as Arthur Doyle could have adopted Rachel if her father had been a convict. \u201cWhere these seal papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll protected documents are kept in the secured archives belowground,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut you can\u2019t access them without a writ from the governor\u2019s office, and they won\u2019t issue those to a native. Sorry, old man.\u201d</p><p>I knew what I needed then, so I gruffly thanked him and left.</p><p>One of the strangest jobs I\u2019d ever undertaken had been for one of the city\u2019s moles, who had contracted me by tube to investigate a sudden infestation of rats in a posh hotel, for which he was being blamed. He in turn claimed to me that the hotel had been placed under a dark enchantment by a rival establishment hoping to drive them out of business.</p><p>I\u2019d never realized how vast and intricate the labyrinth of tubes, drainageways, and mech rooms beneath the city was until I searched them for the source of the rodents. I\u2019d discovered the hotel\u2019s new rubbish tubes had actually been the culprit, for the builders had used substandard materials that had allowed the rats infesting the city\u2019s landfill to gnaw through a joint and come up into the hotel\u2019s kitchens. The old tunneler had been too poor to pay me, but thinking I might someday need to use his warren, I\u2019d accepted a favor to be claimed as settlement.</p><p>Gaining access to the underground from the surface was not easy; the storm drains were protected by mesh to keep out debris, and the busy downtown traffic ruled out using one of the hatch drops spaced along the middle of the streets. Fortunately my investigation had also taught me where the less traditional access points in the city were, and I went to the nearest bathhouse where I was known.</p><p>My native disguise didn\u2019t fool the proprietor, a genial woman named Delia, for longer than an eyeblink.</p><p>\u201cEh, Miss Kit, is that you under all that bronze? So it is.\u201d She chuckled as she handed me a cowled cloak. \u201cMind you keep your head down in there. Don\u2019t want the ladies thinking I\u2019ve sold them out to the savages.\u201d</p><p>She led me back through the communal baths to the private rooms used by ladies who enjoyed a rub before or after their wash. The young men who attended them worked stripped to the waist and had been trained to use their hands to deliver various degrees of pleasure. Rina always claimed the bathboys were doing a great deal more than that behind the locked doors, but I thought not. If a woman wished to be penetrated and run the risk of catching a babe, she went to her husband, or a lover who resembled her husband. If she wished to be stroked and petted and made to feel beautiful in her skin, she came here for a rub.</p><p>Delia let me into her tube room and the stairs leading down to the small sorting station beneath it. \u201cTell Clancy while you\u2019re down there that I don\u2019t want no holdup on the linens in those tubes today. Missus Trevors and her ducklings are coming in at three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll nine of them?\u201d I pulled on my gloves and gogs. \u201cBetter let the boys have an early supper, Del.\u201d</p><p>I climbed down through the darkness on the rusty, rickety staircase and stepped off into a damp, murky room filled with tubes from the bathhouse and several other businesses. Four of Delia\u2019s brothers worked in the station, and they rarely had a moment\u2019s rest from dawn until dusk, when all the tubes finally closed. Clancy, her eldest sibling, paused long enough to laugh soon as he saw me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this, then?\u201d He rerouted a load of damp, soiled towels from the bathhouse to the launderer\u2019s tube. \u201cYou giving up the civilized life, Miss Kit?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cWhy do I never fool you people?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou may dress the part of a savage well enough, but you smell of roses and lavender. That lot, they smell of horses or trees, or naught \u2019tall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNext time I\u2019ll have to remember to dab some pine resin behind my ears.\u201d I passed along his sister\u2019s message, and then asked, \u201cHave you seen Hedger today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he came up with his bucket at noon.\u201d Clancy waved his hand toward the tubes that curved out of sight beside a hatch. \u201cSaid to me he were off to scram under the exchange today. Here.\u201d He tossed me a watershed. \u201cKeep your heathen skin from washing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Clance.\u201d I pulled on the rubber cloak and followed the tubes.</p><p>Descending into Rumsen\u2019s bowels required I bring my own light, so I borrowed a flystick from Clancy and gently shook it until the bugs inside the glass rod gave off a blue-green glow. That lit my path down into the sublevels and tunnels where old Hedger dwelled and worked.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p> <p>As usual, the stink from the sewer tubes hit me first and took my breath away. Every time I came belowground I wondered how the old man could tolerate living in it. He claimed one became accustomed to it and even grew to like it, although I doubted I\u2019d ever accomplish the feat.</p><p>Toriana\u2019s first citizens had used pit privies and rubbish dumps for their waste, but when the blues sent over their architects to begin building a more permanent settlement, the builders had been instructed to attend first to the works needed belowground. For every building erected, three sublevels had been dug out and reinforced around what had been sewer lines and root bunkers.</p><p>As tubeworks and iceboxes had come along into common use, the sewer lines had been converted over, and the bunkers emptied. Now and then I spotted a cluster of carrot or potato plants that had grown from what had been left to rot in the old storage bins, their stunted, whitish-green leaves looking ghostly and unnatural.</p><p>The darkness and the smell didn\u2019t unnerve me, nor had the rats I\u2019d helped the old tunneler clear out. (Crate traps baited with raw bacon and nut butter had done the trick, along with some judicious reinforcement of the dump tubes.) The inherent dampness of the tunnels made trodding through them a wet business, but my bucks and Clancy\u2019s watershed kept me dry enough. I even liked the echoing clatter, plings, and bongs of the mechworks overhead, and the constant rush of air sucked along by the tubes.</p><p>Something else crawled along my skin, however. Something I didn\u2019t feel aboveground, a kind of awareness I\u2019d never understood. A sense of presence just out of view, of watching eyes and waiting fists.</p><p>\u201cEre ye, hold on.\u201d Hedger popped out of a hatch some three feet to the side of me, his gnarled hands pulling up his fogged gogs to expose bulging, tunnel-dilated eyes. \u201cMiss Kit? Is that ye in all that getup?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is.\u201d I smiled. \u201cAfternoon, Mr. Hedgeworth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be blind.\u201d The old man hoisted himself out of the drop and stood, shaking some of the water from the old-fashioned waders he wore over his clothes. \u201cNever tell them hotel people sent ye back. I\u2019ve not seen hide nor hair down here since we emptied the last of them crates uptoppers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m here to collect on the favor owed for that, if you\u2019ve some time now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight with ye.\u201d He hoisted his catchall and a dripping kipbag. \u201cJust let me empty these in the blower.\u201d</p><p>I followed him to one of his stations, the one where he dried out whatever he found while inspecting the tubes. Every tube in the city suffered occasional blockages, and snakelike unjammers were sent through those that conveyed goods that could not be lost. Every station had the ability to valve off their tubes and blow out blockages through release doors, however, and did so with goods unworthy of the time and expense of unjamming. Once blown out of the tubes, whatever had been discarded fell into the gutters that ran under the tubes, where they were carried off to be redeposited in the main rubbish tube. Anything thus dumped in the gutter was referred to as scram.</p><p>Hedger\u2019s main occupation was to keep the underground tubes in good repair, but he did a nice side business in reselling whatever he retrieved from the scram before it reached the rubbish tube. Today he emptied two voluminous skirts, a gent\u2019s velvet bacco jacket, and several pairs of homespun stockings into an elbow tube that had a mesh plate on either end to prevent the contents from being sucked into the feed tube. The air still passed through the mesh, which blew the contents into a constant, billowing tumble that eventually dried them.</p><p>\u201cKeeping the jacket?\u201d I guessed. Hedger disdained most of the creature comforts most citizens took for granted, but he did have a soft spot for embroidered velvet.</p><p>\u201cAye. Cold season\u2019s just round the corner.\u201d He secured the blower and turned to me. \u201cSo what can I do ye for, Miss Kit? Ye\u2019re wanting a thing or a service?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cService,\u201d I said. \u201cI need to get into the vault under the City Archives.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cThat\u2019ll be a trick and a half. They keep it under close watch round the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anyone can smuggle me in and out of there,\u201d I assured him, \u201cit\u2019ll be you, Mr. Hedgeworth.\u201d</p><p>He nodded toward my bucks. \u201cYe\u2019ll need to change out of that getup and put on me spare waders.\u201d He went to a rack of dried garments and selected a small workman\u2019s shirt, trousers, and skullcap. \u201cThese first. I\u2019ll collect the waders. Use the basin to wash that muck from yer face; they\u2019ll never believe I\u2019ve taken on a native \u2019prentice.\u201d</p><p>He left me there to change and returned just as I was scrubbing the bronzen off my face. After helping me step in and fasten the waders, he smeared his dirty hands over my cheeks, chin, and brow, and handed me a heavy tool pouch. He then shouldered two air tanks onto his bent back.</p><p>\u201cLet me take one of those,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMaster all the ways carries the tank. Ye just keep yer head down and let me do the yammering,\u201d he advised as I followed him out of the station. \u201c\u2019Em boys up there aren\u2019t as thick as I\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>We crossed through several tunnels until we reached a staircase and climbed up into the back of an enormous room packed with shelves of boxes. Before he approached the two guards sitting at the front, Hedger used a wrench to loosen a joint on a water pipe, just enough to create a steady drip.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the leak, Jimmy,\u201d he said in a loud tone, and then called out, \u201cTunnel service.\u201d</p><p>One of the guards strolled back. \u201cHang on, old man, you can\u2019t go barging in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure and I\u2019ll leave now.\u201d Hedger nodded toward the leaking pipe. \u201cBut ye boys best put on yer waders and fetch some pails.\u201d</p><p>The guard surveyed the pipe. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight not burst right away,\u201d Hedger said. \u201cCould go tomorrow, the day after. But it\u2019s a main line, lad. When she goes, she\u2019ll go a-gusher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then what are you pissing about for?\u201d The big man gestured toward the pipe. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t use me torches with ye lot in here,\u201d Hedger said patiently. \u201cGas\u2019ll leave ye senseless.\u201d He hefted the tanks he carried. \u201cOnly brought enough air and nozzes for me and the lad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlame my ass. Oy, Jerry,\u201d the guard called to his partner. \u201cTunneler\u2019s got to torch a sprung pipe. Fancy an early tea?\u201d</p><p>The other guard grumbled but left with his partner, leaving us alone in the vault room. Hedger immediately began setting up his torches.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t do that,\u201d I said. \u201cJust tighten the joint again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to burn a bit of it; they\u2019ll be sniffing the air and checking the pipe when they get back.\u201d He thrust a tank at me. \u201cKeep the noz on while ye\u2019re looking, or the gas will knock ye on yer little bum.\u201d</p><p>Even with the cumbersome air tank on, being allowed to roam freely through the city\u2019s protected archives was a bit like being a hungry child turned loose in an unattended sweets shop.</p><p>I gave in to the temptation briefly and glanced inside one long box at random; the first sheaf of glassines inside held the birth records of three royal bastards, the testimony of a minister who had uncovered a massive swindling scheme to defraud and embarrass the Crown, and an old, slashed waistcoat marked as belonging to the governor\u2019s deceased valet, whose blood staining it had dried to an ugly dark maroon.</p><p>Something twinkled at me from the bottom corner of the box, and when I took it out, I saw it was a tiny silver disk, marked with the queen\u2019s rose and edged with runes.</p><p>I dropped the wardling, shoved the box back in place, and took a deep breath through the noz. Whatever I found here would be dangerous to know, the sort of information I always avoided. But even if I were suffering from some form of hopefully temporary madness, I had to know who my grandfather was. Otherwise I\u2019d spend the rest of my days wondering until I truly went mad.</p><p>I took a few moments and checked the sides of the long boxes, noting how they were sorted by date and surname and following the sequence back to the annum of my mother\u2019s birth. There I searched through the glassines one by one until at last I found a thin envelope marked Doyle-Weiss. Until she married, Mum had used the name Doyle. But who was this Weiss?</p><p>\u201cLad. Lad.\u201d</p><p>A rough hand shook my shoulder, startling me back to the present. I turned my head to Hedger, who had taken off his noz to speak. I did the same and smelled a trace of the sickening-sweet scent of gas. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming back,\u201d he whispered. \u201cShake yer ass, gel.\u201d He stalked back to the pipe.</p><p>I regarded the pile of glassines I\u2019d taken from the box, which I now had no time to read. Destroying them would serve no purpose; six copies of them were stored in the protected archives of the other provinces, and the Crown would have the originals safely secured in the Royal vaults. But I had to know what they contained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a trembling hand I removed from the box all the glassines pertaining to my grandfather and mother and stuffed them inside my shirt before I trudged back to rejoin the old tunneler.</p><p>\u201cGood enough, then.\u201d Hedger tapped the pipe with the side of his fist. \u201cDid you see any seepage under the shelves, lad?\u201d</p><p>I heard the guards unlocking the gates to the vault room behind me and managed a strangled \u201cNo, marster.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood on ye.\u201d Hedger tramped through the aisle of shelving, had a word with the guards about opening the outside air slats to ventilate the last of the gas from the room, and then brought one back to see the unnecessary work he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure this\u2019ll hold?\u201d the guard asked.</p><p>\u201cAye, it\u2019s as strong a patch as any I\u2019ve done, and none of them ever have cracked.\u201d</p><p>The guard yawned. \u201cGet on with you, then.\u201d</p><p>As I stepped toward the hatch, the glassine in my shirt crackled, and something grabbed my collar and turned me around.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you got on you, boy?\u201d the guard demanded.</p><p>\u201cNaught but lunch, Cap\u2019n,\u201d Hedger said, taking out a glassine bundle from his pocket and holding it up. \u201cWet down here. The old glassies we scram make fine wraps, keep our sandwiches dry.\u201d</p><p>If the guard demanded I show him my nonexistent sandwich, Hedger and I were going to the gaol. The whimper that broke from my lips was quite genuine.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Sall right, boy,\u201d the guard said, releasing my collar and giving my shoulder a rough shove. \u201cI\u2019d eat dirt before I\u2019d touch scram.\u201d He turned to Hedger. \u201cYou be sure to secure that hatch, old rat.\u201d</p><p>Hedger nodded eagerly and hustled me out of the vault. Once he\u2019d closed the hatch and spun the hub to lock it, he leaned against it and pressed a blacking-streaked fist against his heart as he murmured a prayer.</p><p>If I\u2019d been Church, I\u2019d have done the same. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d He dragged me down the tunnel until we were well away from the vault. \u201cWhat were ye thinking, Kit? Ye\u2019re no thief. Were ye trying to get us shot?\u201d</p><p>I was too shaken to lie. \u201cThe papers are about my family. There\u2019s a man who\u2019s looking into my past, and I can\u2019t let him find them.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand. \u201cGive \u2019em over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHedger\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s naught about ye that could rattle me bars,\u201d he snapped. \u201cBut I\u2019ll see what ye just near stretched me neck over.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out the glassines and handed them to him and watched as he sorted through them. In the midst of the pile he went still.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re Harry\u2019s Charm.\u201d He looked at me, his face gone leech white under the layer of dirt. \u201cWhy did ye never say so, gel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t quite know who I am, Hedger.\u201d I tried to smile. \u201cDid you know my grandfather?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cServed with him, I did.\u201d His voice grew distant as he stared at nothing in particular. \u201cUntil he went up to the North Country. Then he disappeared for years, until . . .\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything else, and my skin prickled with unease. \u201cMr. Hedgeworth?\u201d</p><p>His face darkened abruptly. \u201cThis settles things between us.\u201d He seized my arm. \u201cYe\u2019re to go now, and ye\u2019re not to come back down here, do ye understand? Never again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe debt is settled,\u201d was all he would say.</p><p>He allowed me just enough time to change back into my bucks before he marched me back to the bathhouse, where he gave me a hard push toward the stairs.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t leave without knowing. \u201cWho was my grandfather, Mr. Hedgeworth?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>His face twisted. \u201cGet on with ye now.\u201d He turned away.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I called after him. \u201cI have to know.\u201d</p><p>Hedger glanced back at me. \u201cHarry saved me life. And I\u2019ve cursed him every day since. Now get out.\u201d</p><p>I rode home, shoved the papers I\u2019d stolen in my cashsafe, washed the rest of the bronzen from my body, and spent another hour soaking in the tub. I kept seeing the hatred in Hedger\u2019s eyes. Whatever Harry had done, it had made the old scrammer loathe him.</p><p>I climbed out of the tepid water to dry off and dress. It had never been my habit to avoid the truth. Weiss sounded too much like White; the name had to belong to Harry or his family. It was time to find out.</p><p>A few minutes later, I finished reading the last of the glassines I\u2019d stolen. Harry\u2019s name, as I assumed, had been Weiss, not White. He\u2019d been born a Hungarian.</p><p>He\u2019d also been an agent for the Crown.</p><p>Dread iced the blood in my veins, but anger soon thawed it out and set it to boil. Harry, the nice old gent, had been a traitor. An informer. One of Her Majesty\u2019s rats. For a moment the elegant words on the royal documents proving I was the granddaughter of a filthy sodding turncoat blurred. I blinked, and they instantly rewrote themselves.</p><p>Working as a royal spy had obviously been quite lucrative for my grandfather, who had probably used his earnings to change his identity, marry, and acquire Torian citizenship. That my mother had been the daughter and I the granddaughter of a Hungarian\u2014an enemy of the Crown\u2014hardly registered anymore. I was bound by blood to a member of H.M.\u2019s secret service.</p><p>After the failure of the Great Uprising, Toriana may have remained part of the Empire, and grown accustomed to the occupation and institution of Crown law, but we\u2019d never fostered any love for it. Now and then some young hothead commoners would stage a small revolt, embarrass their parents, and spend a few years in the gaol, but they always got out quieter and wiser\u2014or they were kept behind bars where they could make no mischief.</p><p>I knew precisely what this connection meant for me. If it became common knowledge that my grandfather had been a spy, I\u2019d be completely and irrevocably ruined. No one would give me the time of day, much less trade with me. Unless redcoats were stationed to protect it, my home would be ransacked and burnt to the ground.</p><p>We Torians were still Empire, oh, yes, but we had never forgotten the fate of the first colonists. When the revolution had been crushed, all the survivors who refused to take an oath of loyalty to the Crown had been marched out of Valley Forge into the snows and made to dig their own graves before they\u2019d been shot and shoved into them. Upon hearing of their comrades\u2019 fate, every man left in camp who had taken the oath of service had then killed himself, either by pistol or blade. Forty-seven men had famously marched in formation into the icy waters of the Potomac\u2014refusing to stop even when the redcoats had begun firing on them\u2014and had promptly drowned.</p><p>Since then every agent of the Crown who had made himself known as such on Torian soil had vanished shortly thereafter. The remains of a few would occasionally be found floating in whatever river or lake they\u2019d been drowned in. The Crown had never been able to prove their agents had been murdered, but after several more years of the same they\u2019d instructed the traitors to hide their work and operate under the guise of ordinary citizens.</p><p>As my grandfather had apparently done.</p><p>I\u2019d always known my mother to be a bastard and guessed her to have been the get of some undesirable, or her people would have come forward after my parents\u2019 death to protect me. Not a single relation had. Finally I knew why.</p><p>As a schoolgel I\u2019d made my oath to the Crown and renewed it every five years as was required by law, just as every Torian child did. I\u2019d never especially liked or disliked being H.M.\u2019s subject; I\u2019d never really thought about it. It was what it was, an unchanging part of life in my country. Wondering what Toriana would have been like if we\u2019d won the Great Uprising was nothing but a waste of time. We\u2019d lost. After Washington\u2019s surrender at Broken Forge, the Empire would have been within its rights to jail or kill us all. No doubt our ancestors had been grateful to be allowed to continue on as occupied colonies and permitted the means to explore, settle, and develop our country into the provinces of today.</p><p>But I was born Torian, not English, and that also meant something. The Union Jack never graced my eaves; in the back of my dresser I still had a small, handmade patch with the stars and stripes the Rebels had carried. I\u2019d sewn it myself as a gel, with a child\u2019s resentment of atrocities she\u2019d never experienced firsthand, when everything had seemed so black and white. While I never indulged in redcoat baiting, putting out forty-seven flowers on Remembrance Day, or any of the other subtle ways Torians thumbed their noses at the Crown, I\u2019d never been a bootlicker. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever see Independence, at least not in my lifetime, but I still dreamed of it. Most Torians did. All that had changed now that I knew the truth about my grandfather.</p><p>Harry the Hungarian. Harry the traitor.</p><p>If Nolan Walsh had enough influence to gain access to these records, and he knew my mother\u2019s history and where to look, he could ruin my life forever.</p><p>But then, anyone else who read them could as well.</p><p>I spent an endless night tossing and turning before I finally gave up on sleep and rose to dress. My dire mood dragged at me, reminding me of those first terrible days when I\u2019d come to Rumsen, when I\u2019d slept for an hour here and there on park benches and walked the streets in a hopeless fog. If I hadn\u2019t stopped an old gent from walking into the path of an oncoming cart, I might have been found one cold morning, starved and frozen in the gutter.</p><p>That one good deed had changed everything: the old man had insisted his thoughts had been paralyzed by evil magic, magic he believed I\u2019d dispelled with my touch. I\u2019d not argued with him or the fifty pounds he\u2019d gratefully pressed in my hands. I\u2019d asked for directions to a respectable boardinghouse.</p><p>That first fifty pounds had gone to feeding and sheltering me while I looked for work. After several more encounters similar to the one with the old man in the street, word spread about my alleged ability to dispel magic.</p><p>At first it had felt like thievery, taking money for doing nothing, but the people who had come to me were more desperate than I. I dealt with my guilt by looking for the real source of their woes, and I discovered I had a natural talent for detecting. Combining the two allowed me to provide service without feeling as if I\u2019d become just another magic swindler, like Dredmore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I dragged myself from my flat the next morning, I couldn\u2019t help thinking I\u2019d have been happier to learn that Harry had been a practicing mage, or even a fete teller.</p><p>I stopped at a corner teacart I frequented and bought a cup of Irish red and a sticky bun.

You\u2019re looking beat today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRestless night.\u201d I offered her a wan smile before I surrendered my spot to a new customer and moved on.</p><p>I made myself eat the bun, which helped loosen the knot in my belly a notch and made me feel a little better. I\u2019d worked hard and made a new life for myself here in Rumsen, and the prospect of losing it terrified me. The unfairness stung, too. If the truth about Harry ever came out, I\u2019d be judged over something that had happened before I\u2019d been born.</p><p>The anger boiled up inside me again. The blood in my veins might be tainted by my mother\u2019s unfortunate birth and my grandfather\u2019s foreign blood and domestic betrayals, but I didn\u2019t deserve to have my situation stolen from me for a second time. No matter what sort of traitorous bastard my grandfather had been, he\u2019d done nothing for me, nor had I profited from his spywork. Everything I owned in this world I\u2019d worked for and earned by myself.</p><p>I tossed the last crust of my bun in a rubbish bin outside the Davies Building and emptied the lukewarm dregs of my tea in the gutter. Harry White or Weiss or whoever he\u2019d been be damned; I wasn\u2019t going to cower in fear or give up and run. He was a ghost; perhaps no more than an echo of a life that was over now. Whatever evil Harry had done in the past had nothing to do with me. Rumsen was my home, and I was Torian. I\u2019d earned the right to live and do business here.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, miss.\u201d</p> <p>I jumped a little and turned to see a heavily cloaked figure standing behind me. A hat and heavy veil disguised her face, but I recognized the reddened, callused hands.</p><p>\u201cThe nearest apothecary is one block over,\u201d I told Lady Walsh\u2019s chambermaid. \u201cBut his pain powders are mostly chalk dust.\u201d</p><p>Betsy looked around before she stepped closer. \u201cMilady asks that you attend her, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. You can tell your lady she can\u2014\u201d I stopped myself, knowing any insult I offered would be passed along verbatim. \u201cFind another distant cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, miss.\u201d Betsy followed me into the building. \u201cMy mistress is in terrible danger.\u201d</p><p>I paused at the foot of the stairs. \u201cThen go to Rumsen Main Station and ask for Inspector Tom Doyle. He works the Hill.\u201d I glanced back at her. \u201cI don\u2019t anymore.\u201d</p><p>Betsy didn\u2019t give up easily. She trailed after me up the stairs and down the hall, assuring me that her mistress had been most insistent that I come to her aid and that no one else would do. It gave me a healthy amount of pleasure to close my office door in her face, but I didn\u2019t bolt it, so as soon as I moved away from it, she came in after me.</p><p>\u201cAre you deaf?\u201d I inquired as I took off my wrap and hung it on the coat stand. \u201cOr simply daft?\u201d</p> <p>Rather than beg me to reconsider, Betsy went on the attack. \u201cThis is your doing, miss. All of it. If milady hadn\u2019t brought you up to the house, none of this would have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course not.\u201d I folded my arms. \u201cSo what\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>Betsy sniffed. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can\u2019t say. You\u2019ll have to hear it from milady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave her write me a letter. I\u2019ll read it when I get time.\u201d Maybe sometime around Christmas, when I was feeling a bit more generous.</p><p>The maid followed me into my office and planted herself in front of my desk, where she tried to stare me down. I collected my morning post from the tube and began sorting through it.</p><p>Betsy broke first. \u201cIf you don\u2019t come to see her and do something, miss, she\u2019ll be ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t work the Hill anymore,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cNow run along, or I\u2019ll call for the beater.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t budge. \u201cYou\u2019ll want payment in advance, I suppose.\u201d She took out a pitifully small purse out of her reticule and dropped it in front of me.</p><p>I picked up the purse, which had been fashioned from a piece of felted wool, now shiny at the seams from long use. From the weight of it, it contained a paltry few pounds in small coin. I glanced up at her. \u201cThis is your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been putting a bit aside for a place of me own someday.\u201d She lifted her chin. \u201cIt should be enough, but if it isn\u2019t, I can get a little more from me beau.\u201d</p><p>I held on to the purse and sat back in my chair. \u201cNow why would you hand over your life savings to me?\u201d</p><p>Betsy looked ready to burst. \u201cI\u2019m not daft,\u201d she snapped. \u201cMilady is a decent, fair mistress. She never shouts or hits, or gives the maid staff more work than we can do. She sees to it that we have enough to eat, proper clothes, time to go to Church and to visit our families. We sleep safe in our beds. We would do anything for her.\u201d She gave me a defiant look. \u201cEven pay the likes of you.\u201d</p><p>I got up and came round the desk to shove the purse into her hands. \u201cI\u2019m not taking your money, Betsy.\u201d Before she could protest, I added, \u201cI\u2019ll see your lady one more time, for free, but not on the Hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe don\u2019t want you to come round the house,\u201d the chambermaid told me with some satisfaction. \u201cShe\u2019ll see you at her dressmaker\u2019s, the Silken Dream, today at one o\u2019clock sharp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d I let her get as far as the threshold before I added, \u201cYou may think the world of your mistress, Betsy, but being treated fairly is your due. Your right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it now?\u201d She gave me a contemptuous look. \u201cAnd here I thought you said you worked the Hill.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>If Rina had seen me steeling myself to stroll into the Silken Dream that afternoon, she\u2019d have laughed herself into a cramp. There were few things I despised or avoided as much as dressmakers, and now I had to enter the establishment of one Madam Desiree Duluc, the grandest of the gowners, the incomparable Arachne who dressed the wives, daughters, sisters, and mothers of the most important men in Rumsen.</p><p>I\u2019d never been inside the shop during business hours, not that I could ever afford to shop there. Nothing I owned, not even the very fine burnout silk shawl Rina had given me for my last birthday, could equal in quality the simplest pair of gloves under Madam Duluc\u2019s roof. Nor did I care to put on the airs or dress of a fashionable lady; even if I had the coin to buy such creations and wear them, I\u2019d have betrayed myself the moment I spoke in my Middy accent or removed the gloves from my unpampered hands.</p><p>No one came to the front room to toss me out on the street; I was left to stand between two semicircles of gown forms draped with the latest fashions. From the number of pure-white frills and bows and draped sashes adorning Madam\u2019s goods, the latest fashion for ladies appeared to be swishing about in as much frippery as possible, like marriage cakes with legs.</p><p>A thin, sharp-nosed woman in a dove-gray gown minced her way across the front room to join me. \u201cGood afternoon, miss,\u201d she said in a low, soft tone. \u201cHow may we serve you?\u201d</p><p>Not the reception I\u2019d been expecting. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Lady Walsh. She asked me to meet her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I ask your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKittredge.\u201d I found a card in my reticule and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cLady Walsh has not yet arrived for her fitting, Miss Kittredge.\u201d The seamstress tucked my card under her cuff and gestured toward the back rooms. \u201cWould you care to wait?\u201d</p><p>I had nothing better to do, so I nodded and followed her back into a small, elegant private room already set up with a tea cart and a waiting maid.</p><p>\u201cSarah will serve you today, Miss Kittredge,\u201d the seamstress said. \u201cI will return when Lady Walsh has arrived.\u201d She curtseyed deeply and withdrew.</p><p>Sarah and I exchanged a look. \u201cIs she always that nice?\u201d I asked on impulse.</p><p>The gel nodded. \u201cAll Madam\u2019s ladies are.\u201d She grinned. \u201cThe tea is first-brewed, miss, and the crumpets come straight out of the oven.\u201d</p><p>I gave the gleaming cart, something I could never afford even if I tripled my rates, a wistful look. \u201cOf course they do.\u201d</p><p>I let Sarah serve me tea and would have slipped her a crumpet for herself if another lady had not stepped in. This one was dressed in an emerald satin ball gown and had her silver-streaked red hair bundled untidily atop her head. At least twenty glass-headed pins pierced the edge of her bodice, and from her sash dangled a marked length of measuring tape. The esteemed proprietor herself.</p><p>\u201cSo this is what one might make from the flour sacks,\u201d Madam Duluc said in a frightfully snooty French accent as she stared at my skirts. \u201cBonjour, mademoiselle. I fear you have made a tragic mistake to come here. Are there even three pounds in your reticule?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTwo and six,\u201d I told her, rattling my coins. \u201cHad three when I left the house this morning, but I bought a sticky bun for my breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you will please not to touch anything.\u201d Madam Duluc glanced at her assistant. \u201cI will deal with this one, Sarah. Go and assist Madam Nancy.\u201d</p><p>After the maid bobbed and left, Madam Duluc came to stand over me. \u201cSo? Did you enjoy my tea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely.\u201d I smiled. \u201cIn fact, I may start coming here instead of the bakery. The crumpets practically floated into my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re croissants, not crumpets, you greedy goose,\u201d she said, this time in the broad, musical accent of the Rumsen working class as she abandoned her pretense and dropped down on the settee beside me. \u201cNow, what brings you here? Lady Walsh\u2019s maid, is it? What does the gel think, my gowns are bespelled to prevent her mistress from conceiving? Does she suspect I\u2019ve cast the evil eye over the lady\u2019s corset strings?\u201d Her expression brightened. \u201cCan you cast an evil eye on corset strings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, and of course not.\u201d I poured her a cup and handed it to her. \u201cI\u2019ve personal business with the lady herself, Bridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Personal?\u201d She frowned at me. \u201cI thought you quit working the Hill, you silly cow. Never say this is about that bloody great mage wanting to bed you. Isn\u2019t he the reason you quit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about Dredmore, and I did quit. I have quit. I will quit. After this.\u201d I wiped my fingers on a napkin before I touched a fold of her ball gown. \u201cGrand fine stuff. Green\u2019s your color.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d She slapped my hand away. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so busy with the mayor\u2019s ball next week, I ran out of forms. This is going to be worn by the mayor\u2019s wife. Then I have to create something even costlier for his mistress to wear when she makes an appearance with the poor sod she\u2019s cuckolding.\u201d She knocked back half her tea before borrowing my napkin to wipe her lips. \u201cMy Nancy would have genteelly tossed you out the door if I hadn\u2019t spotted you from the workroom.\u201d She eyed my gown again. \u201cGod blind me. Don\u2019t you have anything decent to wear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecent by my standards, yes.\u201d I smiled. \u201cHow are Charles and the children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlie\u2019s getting fat, the kids are sprouting like beans, and you are terribly missed.\u201d She nudged me with her elbow. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come round the castle more often, Kit? It\u2019s been months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadam Duluc must keep up appearances,\u201d I reminded her. \u201cI\u2019ll drop in before Christmas, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Charles Duluc, peerless textile importer and youngest son of an immensely wealthy, extremely titled French family, had come over to Toriana to look after his father\u2019s business interests and buy up more land to add to the family coffers. He was scheduled to return to France after a month, and four days before his ship was set to sail, he\u2019d gone for a walk in the park. There he\u2019d sat down on a bench next to two gels taking a break from work to sit in the sunshine and gossip while they ate their sack lunches.</p><p>The lass from the loomworks had offered Charles half of her sandwich, which he\u2019d accepted with astonished pleasure, and they\u2019d begun talking. Three hours later the Honorable Charles Duluc and Bridget Mary Sullivan had been married by special license.</p> <p>It had been the stuff of every working gel\u2019s fantasies. Charles had bought the loomworks where his new bride had worked twelve hours every day since her tenth birthday, and had transferred the title and property over to her family as her bride price. Old Sully, Bridget\u2019s da, had taken over the managing and running of it while his daughter and new son-in-law had gone to the mountains for their honeymoon. By the time they\u2019d returned, Old Sully had fired the rest of the mill managers, had cut the workers\u2019 hours in half and doubled their pay. Within two months the loomworks had increased quality and production so much that Old Sully had begun looking at expanding.</p><p>There had been some tense moments when the widowed Madam Duluc and her daughters sailed over from France to meet Charles\u2019s commoner Torian bride (even the French themselves admitted to being terrible snobs). Charles\u2019s love for Bridget, however, had been absolute and unshakable. Since his father\u2019s death had given him full control over the family fortunes, the ladies of the family had had to accept the marriage. (The fact that Charles and Bridget intended to remain in Toriana also weighed heavily in their favor.)</p><p>Charles hadn\u2019t wanted his wife to work another moment in her life, but after giving him two sons and a daughter, Bridget had grown bored with the life of a titled lady and asked her husband if she might open a shop of her own. Weaving since childhood had given Bridget an extensive understanding of fine cloth, and growing up in the shadow of the Hill had taught her that gowning the wives of the rich was the most lucrative way to use that knowledge.</p><p>I knew all this because I\u2019d been the other lass sitting on the bench that day, and I\u2019d gone with them to the magistrate to stand witness to their marriage. Charles and Bridget were the reason I didn\u2019t trifle with men: if I couldn\u2019t have what they\u2019d found in each other, I\u2019d go without.</p><p>Bridget filled me in on how the children were getting on with their tutors and how Charles had taken an undignified dunking at the beach trying to rescue their youngest\u2019s new bonnet when the wind had snatched it away. I listened and laughed, but my thoughts kept straying to Lady Diana.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he got for not tying her ribbons before setting off from the house, I told him,\u201d Bridget said, and then she abruptly changed the subject. \u201cNow, what\u2019s this business with you and the Walshes? Come on, out with it. You look like you did when you were renting that closet at the boardinghouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy good intentions got the better of me,\u201d I admitted. \u201cThis time I might have to pay dearly for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Kit.\u201d Bridget\u2019s smile faded. \u201cIf you need Charlie to step in, you\u2019ve only to say\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Bridge. This is something not even Charles could make vanish.\u201d Next to Rina, Bridget was my oldest mate, and I wanted to confide in her, but something held me back. I didn\u2019t have that many friends that I could risk losing one. Bridget would keep my secrets, but she\u2019d never abandoned her working-class ideals. Knowing I was the granddaughter of an agent to the Crown would forever change her opinion of me. \u201cI\u2019ll conclude my business with the lady, and then hopefully it\u2019ll be done with.\u201d</p><p>Bridget glanced up at a soft knock on the door. \u201cDo come in,\u201d she said in her beautifully fake French accent.</p><p>Sarah stepped in and bobbed. \u201cIf you please, Madam, Lady Walsh has arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow her to the Rose Room, if you would, Sarah.\u201d When the gel left, Bridget turned to me. \u201cI can start her fitting while you talk with her. They always treat me like I\u2019m invisible when they\u2019re standing in their drawers.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cShe won\u2019t talk if you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re taking on with this one, Kit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d After today I intended to steer clear of all the Walshes.</p><p>\u201cWell, then I\u2019ll let you get on with it.\u201d Bridget stood and brushed some crumbs from the emerald satin. \u201cRose Room\u2019s at the end of the hall on the left. Take as long as you like, but Kit\u201d\u2014she caught my arm as I went past her, and tugged me close for a careful hug so neither of us would be stuck by the pinned bodice\u2014\u201cwhatever this personal business is between you and the lady, finish it now. You don\u2019t want the Hill coming down on your heels or your head. That deathmage, either.\u201d</p><p>I walked down to the Rose Room, where Betsy stood on guard outside the door. She ignored me entirely, so I did the same and stepped inside, where I found Lady Walsh pacing back and forth, her gait rapid and jerky.</p><p>\u201cMilady,\u201d I said, closing the door but not moving too far from it. \u201cYou asked to meet with me?\u201d</p><p>She came to an abrupt halt, moved toward me, and stopped again to take a deep breath. I could almost hear her governess talking inside her head: A lady does not rush. A lady does not lunge. A lady does not throttle.</p><p>\u201cMiss Kittredge, your advice to me has resulted in the unhappiest of situations.\u201d She spoke as if she couldn\u2019t unclench her teeth. \u201cI followed your suggestion to entice my husband to discover the panel under my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dropped your ring, and he found it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded tightly. \u201cWhen Nolan discovered the panel, he became quite furious. In truth, I have never seen my husband so angry.\u201d</p><p>She had called me here to tell me that it had worked? \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll see to your protection, Lady Walsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed he will not.\u201d Her stiff expression began to waver. \u201cHe accused me of being disloyal to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisloyal?\u201d I echoed. \u201cFor getting cut up in your sleep by some intruder? Has he gone off, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan believes I am responsible for the passage,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThat I am using it to commit adultery. He even accused me of drugging him each night to prevent him from discovering my infidelity.\u201d She straightened her spine and looked down her nose. \u201cBecause I took your advice, he is now threatening to divorce me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when you showed him the cuts on your hands, didn\u2019t he . . .\u201d As she shook her head, I groaned. \u201cFor the love of Jesu, milady, you have to show him your wounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to shake her until her pearly teeth rattled. \u201cThey\u2019re the only proof you\u2019ve got of what\u2019s being done to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no more proof.\u201d She stripped off her gloves and thrust both hands at me.</p><p>Lady Diana didn\u2019t have a mark on her. The ugly words had vanished, as if they\u2019d never been cut into her skin. I took hold of her hands, checking them to see if she\u2019d somehow disguised them with face paint, but all I felt was smooth skin. She didn\u2019t even have scars. \u201cThis is not possible.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut it is, as you see.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cNow do you believe it\u2019s a curse, Miss Kittredge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I held on to one hand as she tried to pull away. \u201cBe still.\u201d I took my magnifying glass out of my reticule and held it just above the skin. Examining one hand turned up nothing, but on the other I discovered a tiny fragment of dark red clinging to one of the fine hairs of her skin. When I gently nudged the fragment with my fingernail, she made a pained sound. When I plucked it off, the hair came with it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lady Diana demanded.</p> <p>I carefully transferred the fragment to a bit of paper and folded it up. \u201cCollecting evidence.\u201d I pointed to one of the padded benches. \u201cI have to go and consult with someone on this. If you want to know the truth, you\u2019ll wait here for me.\u201d</p><p>Bridget generously provided me with her carri, which I drove back to my office building. I left it parked at the curb and dashed down to the Dungeon, making my way through clouds of steam as I shouted for Docket.</p><p>\u201cHold on to your hatpins, gel.\u201d The old man emerged from the steam, wearing but a towel wrapped around his skinny hips. \u201cCome back later, Kit. I\u2019m having a soak.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the contraption behind him, which resembled a giant teakettle. \u201cA soak, or a boil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the collection chamber.\u201d He pointed to some hastily rigged pipes hanging over it. \u201cSteam comes down from there, and the gap between me and the pipes cools it enough to make it tolerable. It\u2019s a heathen practice. I\u2019m calling it the Waterless Bathe.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cHaven\u2019t worked out what to do about soap, though.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cGet some clothes on, mate. I need you to look at something under the scope.\u201d</p><p>Once he was decent, Doc brought me over to one of his workbenches fitted with a large vertical tube standing in an adjusted bracket. \u201cLet\u2019s have it.\u201d When I gave him the folded paper containing the fragment I\u2019d removed from Lady Diana\u2019s hand, he opened it and gently placed it under the tube.</p><p>As he looked through the gogs he\u2019d fitted to the magnifying tube, I explained where I\u2019d found the fragment, and what had been done to Lady Diana. \u201cShe claimed the cuts didn\u2019t hurt, and she never found any blood on her nightdresses or linens.\u201d</p><p>Doc grunted. \u201cI\u2019ll wager all the wounds vanished within a day of her finding them as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t cut, love.\u201d He moved away from the scope, searched through some jars on a nearby shelf, and then handed me a jar of thick, dark-red liquid. \u201cWound paste. They made it out of animal blood mixed with a strong resin. My guess is someone used this to paint the words on her and scored the lines as they dried to make them appear like real cuts. You need a solvent to remove it or it acts like a new scab. If she tried to pull it off herself, she\u2019d bleed.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d never heard of such a thing. \u201cWho uses this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone with the know-how, I suppose,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s an old soldier\u2019s trick. Cowards resort to it to prevent being sent into battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I need an extra week or two to pull together the rent.\u201d He ducked his head. \u201cMe showing the landlord a wound that\u2019s temporarily laid me up usually does the trick.\u201d</p><p>And here all this time I\u2019d been bartering with him. \u201cCan I borrow this?\u201d When he nodded, I took the jar and gave his shoulder a squeeze. \u201cThe next time you need help with the rent, mate, you come to me.\u201d</p><p>By the time I got back to Bridget\u2019s, Lady Diana had worked herself into a frazzle.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she snapped as soon as she saw me. \u201cHow could you leave like that? Nolan expected me home an hour ago. He\u2019ll be furious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang Nolan,\u201d I said, and held up the jar of wound paste. \u201cThis is what was used on you.\u201d</p> <p>I repeated everything Doc had told me, and with every word Lady Diana\u2019s face grew pinker. Once I\u2019d detailed how the paste simulated wounds, I told her the rest of what I\u2019d worked out.</p><p>\u201cYour assailant assumed you would hide the wounds from your family and deliberately placed them on portions of your body that could be easily covered. By removing them the next night, he could make you think you were under the influence of a malignant spell. Or perhaps . . .\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to complete my other thought.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she urged.</p><p>I chose my words carefully. \u201cPerhaps to tamper with your wits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one could be that evil.\u201d She pulled on her gloves. \u201cI am a devoted wife and stepmother. I treat our servants well. I have never inflicted harm on another person in my life. Why would anyone take such horrible vengeance against me? I\u2019ve done nothing.\u201d</p><p>I thought of the words that had been written on her skin. \u201cYou and your family profited by your marriage to Lord Walsh, which was arranged so that he might obtain another heir. To someone in your household, that makes you a greedy slut.\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up. \u201cYou will not speak those words to me,\u201d she said through white lips.</p><p>Oh, now she was putting on airs. \u201cWould you rather your husband say them in open court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will not, if you would come to dinner on Friday and tell my husband how you discovered the panel.\u201d</p><p>I stepped back. \u201cYou\u2019d do better to take the wound paste with you, milady. That will explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan will think only that I used it on myself. You, on the other hand, can attest to my true motives, and how you were the one to discover the panel under the bed.\u201d Tears sparkled in her eyes. \u201cYou are my only hope now.\u201d</p><p>She really had no idea of how much trouble she was in. \u201cI\u2019m a commoner, milady. As such he\u2019ll believe I was paid by you to lie to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you no one to vouch for your personal integrity?\u201d Before I could answer, her expression brightened. \u201cYou are acquainted with Lucien Dredmore, are you not? He has much influence.\u201d</p><p>I could imagine what Dredmore would demand in return for such a favor. My body and spirit on a silver platter, at the very least. \u201cThe gentleman and I are not the best of friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Nolan is granted a divorce on grounds of adultery, do you know what will happen to me?\u201d Her voice was rising to a shriek. \u201cTo my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would I, milady? I\u2019m just a gel who works for her living,\u201d I reminded her. \u201cOne your butler reported to the police as a blackmailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother of mercy.\u201d She closed her eyes and then pulled out her skirts.</p><p>Watching her drop to her knees turned my stomach. \u201cLady Walsh, please, don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this is what I am reduced to, so be it.\u201d She bowed her head. \u201cI humbly beg you to take pity on me, Miss Kittredge. I beseech you to come to speak to my husband and save me from the ruin of my life.\u201d</p><p>As I looked down at her, I thought of the day I\u2019d left Middleway. I\u2019d never begged anything from the men who had stolen my life. I\u2019d known what they would have done to me if I had.</p><p>I took Lady Diana by the arms and pulled her up from her knees. \u201cBetsy.\u201d</p><p>The chambermaid darted inside. \u201cYes, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your lady home.\u201d I looked into hopeless eyes and managed a smile. \u201cI have much to do if I am to dine with her and Lord Walsh on Friday.\u201d</p><p>Lady Walsh threw her arms around me and held me like a beloved sister. \u201cYou are the kindest creature in all of Rumsen.\u201d</p><p>The kindest, or the daftest. \u201cHe\u2019s likely having you watched, so I\u2019ll go out the back. Have Betsy sleep in your chamber until Friday, and then we\u2019ll sort all this out at dinner.\u201d</p><p>Betsy cloaked her lady before whisking her away, while I went to the workroom to bid my friend farewell.</p><p>\u201cLady Walsh will be unable to have her fitting today,\u201d I told Bridget, who was undressing behind a screen. \u201cWhat does one wear to dinner on the Hill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing in your wardrobe.\u201d She handed the emerald ballgown off to Nance and pulled on a simpler dress styled to resemble the gray uniforms her ladies wore, but made of pure silver silk. (Charles had vowed she would never wear anything else.) \u201cOr what you\u2019d find in the collection of a professional lady\u2019s, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan one rent a dress for two and six?\u201d I wondered out loud.</p><p>\u201cFrom the rag pile at the tin shop, perhaps.\u201d Bridget muttered something rude as she came out from behind the screen. \u201cLouise, has Lady Richmond settled her account with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Madam,\u201d a gel hemming purple taffeta skirts said through a mouthful of pins. \u201cShe offered a bracelet in trade, but it proved to be paste.\u201d</p><p>Bridget gave me a critical look. \u201cSet aside the blue evening for mademoiselle. She will be back on Friday in time for us to dress her for her dinner with Lord and Lady Walsh.\u201d Before I could protest, she tapped my cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy birthday isn\u2019t until January, Madam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas, then.\u201d She gave me a steely look, leaned close, and whispered, \u201cOr I can sew your stubborn ass into that emerald satin, if you like.\u201d</p><p>I gave in gracefully. \u201cMadam is most generous. Now, can someone direct me to the back door?\u201d</p><p>Bridget personally escorted me to the trade entrance, but she didn\u2019t lecture me along the way. She only stopped me at the door. \u201cCharlie\u2019s mother told me that she\u2019d had a mage enchant all his suits to ward off women before he left France. She was afraid of him picking up something nasty from a strumpet.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cYou can\u2019t make suits female-proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you? He never looked at another woman, that whole trip, until he sat down next to us in the park. No, truly, I asked him. Said he never felt a spot of interest.\u201d She took my hand. \u201cI know how you feel about magic, Kit, but there is something about you. I don\u2019t know what, but I feel it. Everyone does. If you hadn\u2019t been with me that day . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t let the Walshes take advantage. You\u2019re too good for them.\u201d She kissed my cheek. \u201cNow be off with you. I\u2019ll see you here Friday noon, not a minute later.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I left the Silken Dream, I thought of Dredmore, and how I might convince him to accompany me to the Walshes. I\u2019d definitely have to lie. Or perhaps hire some muscle to kidnap and drug him.</p><p>Suddenly, something flew past my face and burst against a nearby stack of crates. I smothered a shriek as I flattened myself against the brick wall and looked from one end of the alley to the other. \u201cWhat the bloody hell?\u201d</p><p>Two men appeared, both wearing hooded capes, shirts, and trousers of dark red. They marched toward me in unison, one hefting a sparkling glass globe filled with swirling darkness.</p> <p>My heart wanted to depart my chest, and my knees shook, but I had no time for hysteria. The all-red garments identified the pair to me as a particularly illegal class of magic-wielding scum; they were unlicensed hired killers, known as snuffmages.</p><p>I ducked as one threw the second globe at me, covering my head with my arms as I was showered with glass and filth. What they were throwing had to be snuffballs, another magical farce. The globes, I\u2019d heard, were filled with some sort of black dust bespelled to kill anything it touched.</p><p>Naturally I was still breathing, and once I shook off the debris, I found the courage to smile at them. \u201cI think your balls are on the blink today, boys,\u201d I said breathlessly. \u201cGot anything else?\u201d</p><p>Both men drew long, sharp-edged daggers with rune-carved blades.</p><p>\u201cThat might work.\u201d I turned, hoisted up my skirts, and ran.</p> <p>I almost made it to the end of the alley before a clawing hand latched onto my collar. He tried to haul my back against him so he could cut my throat, but I dropped out from under his encircling arm and rammed the top of my head into his groin. That doubled him over in time to protect me from most of the slash of the second one\u2019s blade.</p><p>I rolled onto my hands, tucked my head under, and flipped over, which freed my legs from my skirts. One of my slippers went flying as I drove the heel of my foot into the second assassin\u2019s elbow, knocking the blade from his grasp. Then the first one recovered enough to hurl himself on top of me and we both collapsed.</p><p>He was too heavy to dislodge, and I was facedown against the paving stones, probably the worst position to defend myself. His hand clamped across my mouth before I could let out a scream, and he used it to pull my head back and expose my throat.</p><p>I knew then I was done for, so I closed my eyes and waited for it. Instead of feeling the blade at my neck, I heard a nasty, bone-crunching thump, and the crushing weight slid off me to one side. I crawled out from under his limp arm and leg and staggered to my feet to watch a third man in a black hooded cloak striding out of the alley.</p><p>A strong arm came round me as Tom Doyle caught my fist. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Kit. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>So he did.</p> <p>Inspector Doyle left his beater with the body of the snuffmage whose skull had been bashed in while he took me to his carri and got me out of there.</p><p>\u201cThat was nice of you,\u201d I said when I\u2019d caught my breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a nice chap, most days.\u201d He draped his jacket around me. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to the women\u2019s hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve only bruises and scratches.\u201d I pushed my arms into his sleeves and tried not to shake. \u201cA ride home is all I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go to the station first, clean you up,\u201d he said, and started the engine.</p><p>I was too rattled by what had happened to argue, so I kept my head down on the way to Rumsen Main and ignored the stares as Doyle took me in past the desk sergeant and several dozen citizens in trouble or complaining of it. The whispers that erupted in our wake made me glance down. My skirts were stained and torn, my bodice soaked with filth. I smelled as good as I looked.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d Doyle said, guiding me through rows of desks where property clerks and secretaries ogled me like I was a naked strumpet.</p><p>I noted the stark black lettering on the door glass of the office he ushered me into. \u201cChief Inspector Doyle, is it? Very impressive.\u201d I watched him draw the curtains so that no one in the station could look in. \u201cWorking the Hill\u2019s done great things for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPity I can\u2019t say the same about the dispelling business for you.\u201d He led me over to an old leather-covered armchair and sat me down before retrieving a care kit from his desk and a ewer of water from the adjoining lavatory. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look, then.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged out of the jacket and held out the rent, bloodstained sleeve on my right arm.</p><p>He scowled. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were cut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a scratch. One of them caught me with the tip of a blade as I went down.\u201d I tore the remnants of the sleeve away from the wound and inspected it. \u201cSee? It\u2019s not too deep.\u201d</p><p>He dampened a cloth in the ewer and gently cleaned the cut. \u201cWhat were you doing on that side of town, Kit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed a dress for a dinner engagement.\u201d I winced as he took a pair of tweezers from the kit and plucked a bit of gravel from the wound. \u201cWhy were you out following me?\u201d</p><p>He met my gaze. \u201cHow do you know I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen generally stay out of the high fashion district.\u201d I saw him take out a small brown bottle marked with a marigold label. \u201cNo, Tommy, not calendula,\u201d I begged. \u201cIt\u2019ll sting like blazes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only thing to keep it from infecting and help it heal,\u201d he told me as he soaked another cloth with the tincture. \u201cSo stop whining.\u201d He ignored my hiss and began cleaning the gash. \u201cI wasn\u2019t following you. I was following Lady Walsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally\u2014\u201d I let out the breath I\u2019d been holding. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>He set aside the cloth and took out a roll of bandaging cotton. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d He straightened my arm before he began winding the bandage over the cut. \u201cWhy would someone send two snuffmages after you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t especially attached to their money?\u201d I grimaced as he pulled the bandage tight. \u201cAre you cleaning me up or torturing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m questioning your involvement in a violent public altercation.\u201d When I didn\u2019t respond, he added, \u201cA man died in that alley, Kit. It\u2019s my job to find out why.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders sagged. \u201cI don\u2019t know who they were, other than snuffmages,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cThey were waiting outside the dressmaker\u2019s for me. They heaved a couple of their ridiculous snuffballs my way, and when that didn\u2019t work, they came after me with their blades.\u201d I would not mention the man in the black cloak. \u201cThat\u2019s everything I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumsen snuffmages like to use bloodbane in those silly snuffballs,\u201d he informed me. \u201cIt\u2019s enchanted to kill anything it touches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were filled with black powder.\u201d I picked up a fold of my skirt spattered with the stuff, smeared it on my fingers, and held it up in front of him. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not dying. Praise heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou turned it into that.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cSure I did. Right after I pulled a hare out of my hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic has no effect on you,\u201d Doyle continued smoothly. \u201cMy grandfather remarked on it several times before we left Middy.\u201d He tied off the bandage and gave me a hard look. \u201cSaid your mother had the same gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow lucky for me.\u201d Panic surged through me as I checked my battered brooch watch, which fell from a tear in my bodice into my hand. \u201cOh, look at the time. How dreadfully late it is. I must be off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving,\u201d he said, standing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve answered your questions, Tommy. I\u2019m in desperate need of a bath and new clothes, and I don\u2019t think you have either tucked away in your kit.\u201d I tried to stand, felt my knees wobble, and sat back down. \u201cDamn me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel better after you have a rest.\u201d He nodded toward the wide couch on one side of the office. \u201cIt\u2019s more comfortable than it looks.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t imagine sleeping in a police station, even one supervised by my handsome savior. \u201cSo is my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending our staff warder over to your flat to have a look.\u201d He held up a hand to stop my protest. \u201cThe snuffmage who got away has his reputation to mend. He\u2019s likely already set a trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said that magic doesn\u2019t work on me,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>\u201cOn you directly, no,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut he can get to your boiler, your ceilings, or your walls. They like to make it look like a tragic accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather and Son, Tommy, that\u2019s all magic ever is\u2014\u201d I stopped myself. \u201cYou can\u2019t enter my flat without my permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still under suspicion of extortion, and you\u2019re a woman.\u201d He leaned down. \u201cWhich we both know means I can fair burn the place to the ground if I wish.\u201d</p><p>He smelled of wool and soap, and I wanted to bury my face against his broad chest. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that to me.\u201d</p><p>His stern expression thawed to something gentler. \u201cKit, you\u2019ve no idea what I might do.\u201d</p><p>The door to his office opened, and a sweet-faced elderly woman wearing a feminine version of a beater\u2019s uniform and carrying a cup and saucer came in.</p><p>\u201cHot and sweet, my dear,\u201d she said, as she put the cup in my hands. She frowned at the bandage on my arm. \u201cShouldn\u2019t she be in hospital, Tommy?\u201d</p><p>He made a disgusted sound.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t let him take you, dear? Can\u2019t say as I blame you.\u201d She began tidying up around us. \u201cDreadful places, they are. Whenever I go to visit one of the lads, it sucks all the energy out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stench doesn\u2019t help, either.\u201d I spotted the embroidered symbols on the lapel of her dark-blue jacket. \u201cYou\u2019re a mage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaff warder,\u201d she corrected, beaming. \u201cMrs. Mary Harris, at your service.\u201d</p><p>I turned to Doyle. \u201cYou send sweet old ladies into potential crime scenes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe has more arrests than any three men in the station,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd trust me, you wouldn\u2019t want to go up against our Mary in some dark alley. Last time someone did, we needed three whitecarts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that, Tommy, you\u2019ll frighten the lass,\u201d the warder scolded. To me she said, \u201cI\u2019ve had some scuffles with snuffmages, and they\u2019re not a pretty bunch. What can you tell me about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t kill me,\u201d I said.</p> <p>She chuckled. \u201cI meant, what did you notice about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were two, a bruiser and a dink,\u201d I said. \u201cDressed head to toe in dark red. They threw snuffballs filled with dirt at me, and then went for their daggers. Neither said a single word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t put dirt in snuffballs.\u201d Mrs. Harris thought for a moment. \u201cSounds like rogue partners\u2014ex\u2013guild members who hire out their services to very bad men,\u201d she tacked on when she caught Tommy\u2019s frown. \u201cThey work in pairs to insure the killing\u2019s done. The one who escaped, was he the dink?\u201d At my nod she sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s the little ones you always have to mind; they develop their spellcraft a bit more to make up for their lack of stature and muscle. The local guild master\u2019s a head shorter than me.\u201d She glanced at Doyle. \u201cSpeaking of the little pest, he\u2019s waiting for a word with you, Tom. Expect he wants to protect the guild by disavowing this lot.\u201d</p><p>Tom took my keys from my reticule and handed them to the warder as he gave her my address. \u201cShe\u2019ll need a full sweep, Mary. Do take Caldwell and Nelams with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholson as well, I think. Lovely to meet you, dear.\u201d Mary left before I could reply.</p> <p>\u201cYou know where I live?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cI know where you live, and that you bought the entire building for a pittance,\u201d he said. \u201cI also know you live there alone, that you are very good friends with Madams Eagle and Duluc, and that you\u2019ve banked a modest sum, some of which you use now and then for home improvements.\u201d</p><p>I coughed. \u201cYou have been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour business has also made you a fair number of enemies among the magic community.\u201d He cocked his head. \u201cWould you like to know what they say about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a demoness sent from hell to plague them,\u201d I said dutifully. \u201cAn evil harpy who feeds on magic. Satan\u2019s strumpet, Beelzebub\u2019s bawd, Houdini\u2019s whore . . .\u201d I stopped and sighed. \u201cThe names change occasionally, but the whining never ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of them might have sent those snuffmages after you,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cOr perhaps it was someone from the Hill.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMagical assassination. You\u2019d think they\u2019d save a few quid and simply have me run down in the street.\u201d I sipped the tea, which was horribly sweet but settled my stomach. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to go to all this fuss. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an unprotected woman operating a dangerous business, tramping about the Hill and offending the tonners right and left, and now someone\u2019s tried to snuff you.\u201d He folded his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s not anyone\u2019s definition of fine, Kit.\u201d</p><p>I tried to stare him down, but it was impossible. \u201cI hate being female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rather like that you are.\u201d He astounded me by bending down and pressing a quick kiss to my dirty brow. \u201cNow be a good gel and have a nap.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Inspector Tom Doyle hadn\u2019t charged me with murder (a great relief) but had treated me like a wayward younger sister (a great pity)\u2014and he didn\u2019t trust me. I discovered that as soon as I tried the door and found it locked. Bars covered his window from the inside, and they were padlocked.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going anywhere until the canny sod released me, so I trudged over to his leather couch. The stiff-looking cushions felt like clouds under my weight, and I curled up on one end, propping my hurt arm against my side.</p><p>I\u2019d made enemies of any number of charlatans, but they\u2019d never attacked me. The few I\u2019d confronted had muttered uncomplimentary things about my virtue and my supposed allegiance with the forces of darkness, but for the most part I\u2019d scared them off. Gert was the only persistent one, but she couldn\u2019t afford a half sack of bruised fruit, never mind snuffmages. I\u2019d always thought my disbelief in their nonsense had frightened most of the magic peddlers; this because they depended so heavily on faith in their abilities to pull off their tricks. That and I\u2019d exposed too many of them too easily.</p> <p>Magic has no effect on you.</p><p>It had no effect on me because it had no effect, period. It was all daft words and colored rocks, harmless powders, useless runes, and worthless . . . something. Despite the fact that I never napped, I was suddenly so tired I couldn\u2019t even open my mouth to yawn. My eyes closed on their own, my body went lax, and then I was out like a wick in high wind, drifting into a memory of the last man I wished to think of.</p><p>I\u2019d met Dredmore at the home of a merchant named Wiggins, one of Rina\u2019s regulars. She\u2019d brought me to the nice old gent\u2019s to look at a collection of bacco boxes, which Wiggins claimed had been bespelled. I\u2019d just begun my examination when Dredmore had swept in.</p><p>I\u2019d taken in the swirling greatcoat, mirror-polished boots, and impossibly intricate weave of his cravat before I resisted the urge to bob and looked directly into his dark eyes. I expected to see the languid contempt of a tonner, but he showed no emotion at all. I might have been gazing into silverblacked mirrors. The experience should have left me cold, but I made the mistake of looking at his mouth, which had been fashioned for all manner of intimate sin. My mouth went dry, and when I met his gaze a second time, I saw something fierce and hungry looking back.</p><p>Mr. Wiggins\u2019s voice shook as he performed the quickest of introductions. \u201cSuch an honor to have you here, milord,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to get acquainted with Miss Kittredge and Mrs. Eagle, then.\u201d He scurried out of the room.</p><p>\u201cLadies.\u201d Dredmore made it sound like an insult. \u201cI am here on behalf of Mr. Wiggins\u2019s business partner.\u201d He looked down his nose at me. \u201cDoubtless you have little real experience in dispelling enchantments, Miss Kittredge, but you and your friend may remain and observe.\u201d</p><p>Normally I didn\u2019t mind being patronized by a member of the ton. They were raised from birth to believe anyone without money or connections was beneath their notice. He likely assumed I\u2019d feel flattered to be personally addressed by him, theatrical arrogant ponce that he was.</p><p>But something about the man put my teeth on edge, and I reacted accordingly.</p><p>\u201cHow generous of you.\u201d I set down the box I was holding so I wouldn\u2019t chuck it at his head. \u201cAs it happens, milord, I have a vast amount of experience in exposing charlatans who convince the ignorant to believe in enchantments. Perhaps you should leave.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cAre you calling me a fraud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear me.\u201d I feigned dismay. \u201cDid that shoe fit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go, Kit,\u201d I heard Rina say.</p><p>She sounded nervous, and since no man ever made her that, I eyed the intruder again. \u201cWhy? We were here first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a deathmage, Miss Kittredge,\u201d he informed me, his voice all midnight and silk. \u201cThose who cross me do not live to regret it.\u201d</p><p>All manner of mages swindled the cits of Rumsen\u2014heartmages hawking love potions and marriage spells, birthmages who chanted over new mothers and infants, even painmages who pretended to cure headaches, sore backs, and the like\u2014but none trifled in the business of death. I\u2019d heard only a handful had ever been licensed to practice the blackest of the dark arts, and then only under very specific circumstances.</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re billing yourself as a thoughtful, magical killer.\u201d I ignored the strangled sound Rina made as I nodded agreeably. \u201cThriving market for death curses these days, what with the economy waffling about and so many pockets to let. Do you scare old tonners to the grave exclusively, or are you chasing after whitecarts as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKit,\u201d Rina almost shrieked.</p><p>\u201cYou have said quite enough, madam.\u201d Dredmore took a step toward me and held up a stone. \u201cYou will be silent and do exactly as I say.\u201d</p><p>Now Rina looked ready to murder. \u201cYou leave her alone.\u201d</p><p>I eyed the blue pebble he held in his hand, clutched the front of my throat, and made a strangled sound. As the first glimmer of triumph appeared on his face, I dropped my hand and laughed. \u201cOh, dear, that didn\u2019t work out very well, did it? Bad luck. Want to give it another go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesu, Kit.\u201d Rina dropped into a chair and covered her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still speaking.\u201d Dredmore peered down at me as if I\u2019d grown a second head. \u201cWhat manner of protection do you carry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA brain, you dolt.\u201d I went back to the bacco boxes. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in magic, charms, curses, or any other supernatural power, which is why you can\u2019t scare me into holding my tongue. So leave off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might cut it out, though,\u201d Rina muttered, before grimacing at Dredmore. \u201cNot a suggestion, milord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet now, both of you.\u201d I turned over one of the boxes, produced my magnifying lens, and closely examined the felt. \u201cInteresting. Mr. Wiggins said these boxes are solid silver and as old as he is, which should make them all at least a hundred years old. Yet this felt appears to be quite new.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore came to stand beside me. \u201cI sense no spell at work here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brilliant.\u201d Carefully I peeled back one corner of the felt, revealing the metal base. Although the top and inside of the box were dull silver with a very convincing patina, the base was a bright, rosy color. \u201cAs I expected. Made of copper.\u201d</p><p>Rina joined us. \u201cIt\u2019s a fake, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and not a very good one.\u201d I went to the door and called for Mr. Wiggins. When he came in, I brought the box to him. \u201cIs this one of the boxes that popped in and out of your collection?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded. \u201cIt belonged to Lord Cornwall, and I always display it next to Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s. It disappeared that night and reappeared in the afternoon on Friday.\u201d His eyes bulged as I turned it over to show him the copper bottom. \u201cGood heavens. That\u2019s not my box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a replica of the one that was stolen from your collection.\u201d I set it down. \u201cA counterfeiter would need about two days to make a mold from the original, cast the copper, and silverplate it.\u201d I rubbed my finger against one blackened whorl on the lid and showed the streaked tip to Wiggins. \u201cBoot polish, not tarnish. They use it to dull the new plating, make it look old.\u201d</p><p>Wiggins looked at the rest of his boxes. \u201cBut that means . . . more than half of my boxes . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave been stolen and replaced with fakes.\u201d I took out my kerchief and wiped the polish from my finger. \u201cWho dusts your collection, Mr. Wiggins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that would be Bertha.\u201d</p><p>He turned and shouted the name, and a few moments later a plump maid strolled in.</p><p>\u201cBertha, someone has been stealing my bacco boxes and replacing them with counterfeits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone like you,\u201d Rina guessed.</p> <p>The maid paled. \u201cPlease, sir, I didn\u2019t want to. It\u2019s me husband. He gambles, you see, and he lost his position, and he said you have so much, and we so little . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off as she removed a cloth-wrapped bundle from her apron and held it out. \u201cI can put this one back. I won\u2019t do it again, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d spend twenty years at hard labor, all for a worthless sod.\u201d Rina shook her head as she opened her reticule.</p><p>Wiggins looked down at the large handful of coin Rina gave him. \u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPawnshops,\u201d she said. \u201cTo avoid suspicion she\u2019ll have sold them to several, so have her take you round to each one. Tell them the boxes are stolen goods, mention the Yard, and they should sell them back to you for whatever pittance they gave her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, miss,\u201d Bertha gushed. \u201cI promise, I\u2019ll never steal again, no matter what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd once you\u2019ve gotten your things back,\u201d Rina said to Wiggins, \u201csend this stupid, thieving cow to me. I\u2019ll take her round to see some of the gels that have gone to prison for their men. Maybe that\u2019ll make her more honest in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Dredmore came up behind me. \u201cThat was exceedingly clever of you, Miss Kittredge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as impressive as your waving a wand about and muttering incantations, I\u2019ll wager.\u201d I felt the hand he\u2019d dropped on my shoulder. \u201cIs this another attempt at a spell? If it\u2019s to make my skin crawl, I think this time it\u2019s actually working.\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened. \u201cYou want to come away with me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a bathe.\u201d I walked away from him, ignored the way my shoulder tingled, and collected Rina.</p><p>We\u2019d been enemies ever since that first meeting, and nothing would ever change that. But while Dredmore could be vastly annoying, he\u2019d never been able to do anything to harm me or my business.</p><p>The memory faded to a shadow as a shape hovered over me, large and dark and at first indistinct. I made out a black cloak, and under the cloak, a man\u2014the man from the alley, the one who had saved my life, I realized. His eyes glowed like two stars in an empty midnight, cool and distant, but his hands felt warm and soothing on my face.</p><p>\u201cDid they touch you?\u201d a deep, utterly furious voice demanded.</p><p>\u201cOf course they touched me,\u201d I whispered against his palm. \u201cThey squashed me. They cut me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid they violate you?\u201d the voice insisted.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d I frowned. \u201cThey only tried to kill me. With \u2018magic\u2019 balls, if you can believe it. The dolts.\u201d</p><p>My body floated off the cushions onto something harder and less cozy. This fantasy was becoming damnably uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cYou live because magic cannot harm you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI can reach you only through your dreams.\u201d His arm supported my shoulders and my knees. I felt his groin against my hip, and his thighs beneath my buttocks. He traced the edges of my bandage and pressed my cheek against his chest, which filled me with a sense of drowsy well-being.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d I snuggled. \u201cStay with me . . .\u201d</p><p>His soft voice chilled. \u201cWhat have you taken, Charmian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I drank some tea. It was awfully sweet. Like the old lady who brought it.\u201d I breathed in the scent of burnt herbs and the sea and found the rest of my voice. \u201cDo put me down, Dredmore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been drugged.\u201d</p><p>That made more sense of what was happening to me. \u201cBy you.\u201d I batted him with a useless hand.</p><p>\u201cNot by me.\u201d He caught my fingers and brought them to his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t have to employ drugs. If I\u2019d wanted you, I\u2019d have carried you out of that alley. Now, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here with you, idiot.\u201d I wanted to scratch his eyes out, but I couldn\u2019t feel my fingernails. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have asked myself the same question each day for five years,\u201d he assured me. \u201cThe problem is, I don\u2019t wish to know the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Somehow that made me feel a little better, and I relaxed against him. \u201cThank you for saving my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a very bad man. You do know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharmian.\u201d Lips touched the end of my nose. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not to kiss me when I\u2019m drugged and helpless.\u201d I glared at him. \u201cI don\u2019t want your kisses. I don\u2019t want you. I don\u2019t even like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like it, my sweet,\u201d he said, and this time kissed my mouth. \u201cYou have only to stop fighting me. Allow me to release you.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not under arrest. I\u2019m drugged. I\u2019m dreaming. Why haven\u2019t you put me down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He wrapped a hand around my neck. \u201cThis is the dream, the drug. The prison you\u2019ve lived in your entire life. It\u2019s time you rid yourself of it.\u201d His starlit eyes glittered down at me. \u201cI will free you, my gel, very soon, and then you will be mine.\u201d</p><p>His fingers bit into my neck, so tight that I couldn\u2019t speak or breathe. I latched on to his wrist and pulled, but I had no strength. Then a blue light blinded me, and he swore and hurled me away.</p><p>I woke up as I hit hard wood face-first. I yelped and then pushed myself up onto my elbows. I was on the floor beside Doyle\u2019s couch. My head wobbled as I looked around me, but the office was empty.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d My belly heaved, and I crawled over to a rubbish can just in time.</p><p>\u201cSteady, Kit.\u201d Rina knelt beside me and supported my head with kid-gloved hands. \u201cGo on, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>The heaves continued until I couldn\u2019t bring anything else up, and then a little longer as my belly refused to be convinced it was empty.</p><p>Once the final spasm passed, Rina wiped my mouth with one corner of her black fichu. \u201cThere now, that\u2019s better.\u201d She helped me up and held me steady. \u201cWhere\u2019s the bloody lav?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough there,\u201d I heard Doyle say.</p><p>I let Rina tend to me, rinsing out my mouth with the water she held to my lips and blowing into the handkerchief she placed over my nose.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a look now.\u201d She tipped my head back and peered into my eyes, and swore softly. \u201cBugger me, you\u2019ve been dosed.\u201d</p><p>I saw Doyle in the doorway at the same time I became aware of my painfully heavy bladder. \u201cLoo.\u201d</p><p>Rina turned to the inspector. \u201cOut.\u201d She pushed the door closed after him and helped me with my skirts.</p><p>I hissed as my bare bottom touched the cold porcelain. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went round your place this morning, saw the copper wardlings, and came here,\u201d she said. \u201cWho rolled you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo snuffmages waiting outside Bridget\u2019s.\u201d I finished and put my clothes to rights. \u201cWhy did you go to the flat? You know I\u2019m never there after seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were here, and all night, too.\u201d She grabbed my chin and looked into my eyes again. \u201cThe swine in charge said when they couldn\u2019t rouse you, they brought in a physick. Sweet Mary, look at your eyes.\u201d</p><p>All I remembered was the dream of being strangled by Dredmore. \u201cA little nap never hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little?\u201d Her brows rose. \u201cLove, you\u2019ve been out cold for the last eighteen hours.\u201d</p><p>Rina ushered me back into the office, where Doyle was waiting for us. \u201cI\u2019m taking her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He took out a notebook. \u201cI need some answers from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really like him,\u201d I confided to Rina. \u201cToo bad he\u2019s the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Kit.\u201d To Doyle, Rina said, \u201cHas she been charged with an offense? No? You lot too busy dosing her with ruddy joy, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy?\u201d I tried to wave a hand and nearly smacked myself in the eye. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do that. He likes me too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Kit.\u201d Doyle snapped his notebook closed and regarded Rina. \u201cI did nothing of the sort to her. What kind of man do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike all the others in the world. Stupid. Did you really think it would make her talk?\u201d She tightened her arm around me. \u201cThe poor gel\u2019s never had it, you dolt. Much as you dosed her, I\u2019m surprised she woke up at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t drug suspects,\u201d Doyle said between clenched teeth. \u201cShe ran afoul of some snuffmages; maybe they added more than killing powder to bespell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBespelled my ass.\u201d Rina thrust me toward him. \u201cLook at her eyes. You know what poppy dust does to the whites. Go on, look. Red as roses, they are.\u201d She brought a fold of my skirt up to her nose and sniffed it. \u201cNothing but charcoal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Doyle looked and muttered words unbecoming an officer of the Yard. \u201cSomeone must have slipped it to her another way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn here?\u201d Rina made a rude sound. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my tea,\u201d I offered dully. \u201cTasted funny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe guild master.\u201d The inspector swore softly.</p><p>\u201cSodding bastards tried to get at her again, right under your noses.

I knew Doyle couldn\u2019t have been involved; he wouldn\u2019t have saved my life to attack me in a police station. If for any reason Dredmore wanted me dead, he could have stood by in the alley and watched the snuffmage cut my throat. I was less sure of Mary Harris, but I couldn\u2019t imagine why a nice old lady who believed she protected people with her idiot spells would get mixed up with hired killers.</p><p>Drugging me helpless was too similar to what had been done to Diana Walsh. It stank of the same combination of cunning and cowardice.</p><p>As the last of the joy\u2019s effects faded, I began to feel wretched. I wanted to go home and barricade myself in my flat. But even there I wouldn\u2019t be safe, not from someone who could doctor my tea in a police station, or assault me in my sleep.</p><p>Dredmore.</p><p>Physicks believed that dreams were the mind\u2019s suppressed desires and fears. Across the pond, there were new types of phsyicks who even studied dreams in hopes of connecting them to body ailments. I\u2019d never thought much about it\u2014I hardly ever remembered my dreams\u2014but Lucien Dredmore kissing and then trying to choke me to death in my mind could be nothing more than a garden-variety nightmare.</p><p>Besides, why would he try to kill me in my dreams when he\u2019d saved me in the alley?</p> <p>When we reached the Lily, I was able to climb down out of the carri without assistance. Rina still took my arm as if she was afraid I\u2019d run away.</p><p>\u201cTwo for the works,\u201d she told the gel at the desk inside, who gave me a single scandalized glance before accepting Rina\u2019s payment.</p><p>\u201cWill you be having a massage today, madam?\u201d the desklass asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, and we don\u2019t need maids; we\u2019ll see to ourselves.\u201d Rina took the key the gel handed her and glanced back at Wrecker. \u201cGo back to the house and ask Almira to give you a complete change for Miss Kit. Tell her something light and warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away, milady.\u201d Wrecker touched his cap and took off.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t throw away my skirts,\u201d I told Rina as she walked me back to the private bathing room. \u201cI need them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs what? Cleaning rags? \u2019Sall they\u2019re good for now.\u201d She unlocked the door and gave me a little push. \u201cCome on, the stink of you is about to make me puke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need the skirts\u201d\u2014I paused as Rina pulled my bodice out of my waister and over my head\u2014\u201cto test the powder on them from the snuffmages\u2019 balls\u201d\u2014I turned so she could unknot the mangle of my fasteners\u2014\u201cand see if it contains poppy dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already checked it; it\u2019s charcoal, nothing more.\u201d She pulled out a fold on my skirt and bent over to examine the stain. \u201cNo one would toss this much red joy at you, Kit. It\u2019d cost the earth. The coppers were the ones that dosed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve no motive,\u201d I reminded her as I tried to unlace the front of my chemise. My fingers felt thick and I fumbled until she pushed my hands aside. \u201cDoyle thinks I\u2019m in on some extortion scheme. You don\u2019t try to kill someone you think is nicking coin from the tonners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you\u2019ve forgotten, my gel, Doyle works for the Hill,\u201d she snapped. \u201cIf they told him to dress you like a performing ape, put you on a leash, and take you for a walk, he\u2019d be trotting you round Central Square right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I set my jaw. \u201cNot Tommy. He\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor bleeding Christ\u2019s sake, Kit, he\u2019s little more than a nobber in fancy dress. Get over him.\u201d She helped me out of my drawers and pointed to the slats. \u201cUse the hot,\u201d she said as she began undressing, \u201cor you\u2019ll never work that dried muck out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>I stood naked on the spaced slats and reached up for the red shower pull. The water that gushed over me was almost too hot to bear, but I stood under the wide stream and let it soak me thoroughly. Once my hair was plastered to my skull, I reached for a handful of scented soap mash and began working it into my snarled, filthy locks.</p><p>Rina came over with a handled sponge but set it aside to peek under the bandage on my arm. \u201cShit. That sod have the decency to clean this?\u201d</p><p>I felt like yanking on the blue pull. \u201cHe\u2019s not a sod, and yes, he did, quite nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicely my ass.\u201d She dipped the end of the sponge into the bowl on the soap stand, coating it well before going to work on my back. \u201cNo such thing as a nice copper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met all of them at Rumsen Main, I suppose.\u201d I picked up another handle and went to work on my front.</p><p>Once I was properly soaped up, I tugged on the purple pull and lifted my face into the warm stream. I might have stood there for a year, it felt so good, but once I\u2019d washed all the soap away, I released the pull and wiped my hands up my face and over my head.</p><p>\u201cGet in and soak,\u201d Rina told me before she went to another slat stand to wash herself.</p><p>I climbed down the short steps into the pool, letting my cooled skin grow accustomed to the heat before I slipped down and let the water close over my head briefly. Once I\u2019d soaked enough, I straightened and went to sit on one of the submerged benches, where Rina joined me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come stay with me until they nail the bastards after you,\u201d she decided as she reclined back against the tile rest. \u201cYou can have poor Liv\u2019s rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d I told her. \u201cI have to go back to Walsh\u2019s on Friday for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Dinner at Walsh\u2019s?\u201d She sat up and stared at me. \u201cYou fancy a trip to the loonhouse? I can save us all a lot of grief and have Wrecker take you there directly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have me.\u201d I splashed her a little. \u201cI promised the lady I\u2019d save her marriage. She\u2019s in a bad way, Rina, and some of it\u2019s my doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and she\u2019s seen to it that you\u2019re covered in diamonds, has she?\u201d she demanded. \u201cKit, someone just tried to kill you. Twice. If you\u2019re lucky and lay low, maybe they won\u2019t try a third time and succeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful.\u201d I turned to her. \u201cYou can help me.\u201d</p><p>She smacked the side of my head. \u201cThere. Did that help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I rubbed the sore spot. \u201cYou know enough dusters to find out if someone\u2019s been buying red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone like?\u201d</p><p>Mentioning the dream would only get me smacked again. \u201cI think it could have been Dredmore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucien Dredmore\u2019s mixed up in this?\u201d She groaned as she fell back. \u201cOf course he is. I suppose you accidentally ran afoul of him. How many times does this make it? Forty? Fifty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe nabbed me on the Hill after I had tea at Walsh\u2019s,\u201d I admitted. \u201cHe warned me off them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely.\u201d She made a contemptuous sound. \u201cI\u2019ll send him some posies to express my gratitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDredmore knows something about Nolan Walsh and his financial business,\u201d I said thoughtfully. \u201cAnd he never dirties his hands with paltry scams. Has to be something much bigger to tempt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat black-eyed beast wants only one thing,\u201d Rina snapped. \u201cYou. And he\u2019ll tell you whatever he likes if it means having you.\u201d</p><p>I sank down. \u201cI won\u2019t let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never made a real effort, you daft twit.\u201d Rina turned on me. \u201cCome on, Kit. You know the man\u2019s got more funds than three governors. His servants are nothing more than a gang of kneecappers and necktwisters. If he decides to pluck you off the street like a bun from a corner cart and take you to that tomb of his on the cliffs, who\u2019s to stop him? Who\u2019s to care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBridget. Docket.\u201d I gave her a hopeful look. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. A loomgel, a nutty mech, and a pissed strumpet.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cWhy am I worried? You\u2019re safe as houses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe honorable wife of Lord Duluc, the cleverest of disgraced mechs, and Queen of the Night,\u201d I corrected her softly. \u201cMy dearest mates in all the world, who would never let Dredmore take me from them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you like my own sister, you know.\u201d Rina took hold of my hair and used it to wriggle my head. \u201cI\u2019d march down to the garden gates of hell for you, if that\u2019s what it takes. But, Kit, it\u2019s Dredmore after you now. Even the devil himself would have enough sense to step out of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t have me,\u201d I insisted. \u201cNothing bad is going to happen. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll know for certain.\u201d Rina climbed out of the pool and went to ring the bell. When one of the bathhouse maids appeared, she said, \u201cSend for my man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are we leaving?\u201d I asked when she returned. \u201cWe just got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut with you.\u201d She tossed a towel at me. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see the Eye.\u201d</p><p>I slogged up the steps. \u201cWhose eye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides yours, the only honest one in the city,\u201d she said, her expression grim. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see my teller.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p> <p>I argued with Rina from the bathhouse to the front steps of a quiet, sober-looking redstone in the heart of the bookmakers\u2019 district.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been letting this charlatan take your coin?\u201d I said as she rang the bell. \u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you ever tell me you were buying portents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t pay the Eye in coin. We have an evening together now and then to settle our accounts.\u201d She turned as a houseman answered the bell. \u201cMadam Eagle and a friend to see the master.\u201d</p><p>We were shown into a dark hall lit only by candles and made to wait there as the houseman went to the back of the house. I noted the marks marching along the wainscot railing. They weren\u2019t runes, but something like them. \u201cFor pity\u2019s sake, Rina. I thought you were smarter than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Eye is very dear to me,\u201d she said, wagging a finger under my nose. \u201cIf you care to remain in my good graces, then you\u2019ll hold your tongue and let him do his work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork.\u201d I felt like spitting. \u201cSwindling you out of sex for nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo shut up, love.\u201d Rina smiled as a small man in an oddly cut white robe emerged. The lack of light made it impossible to make out his features. \u201cMaster Harvison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadam Eagle.\u201d He bowed low before turning to me. \u201cMadam\u2019s friend.\u201d He did not bow to me but glanced at Rina. \u201cShe is not a believer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither was I when I first came to you, Harvi.\u201d Rina put a hand on my shoulder. \u201cBut my dear friend is in desperate need of your wisdom.\u201d When I opened my mouth to disagree, she stomped on my foot. \u201cI would consider it a personal favor if you would see for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Harvison said, gesturing down the hall. \u201cJoin me for tea.\u201d</p><p>We followed him into a shabby but comfortable little den. I\u2019d never seen such furnishings, all made of gleaming lacquered woods and delicate little cushions. A table that sat too low to the ground had a brazier set in its center and a tray with tiny cups. A bowl of dark herbs and some twisted brown roots waited to be used, probably to poison someone.</p><p>He lived among the best bookmakers in the city, but I didn\u2019t see one book. There were plenty of scrolls, however, each tied with twines of various colors and stacked on end in big porcelain pots. Magic spells were usually written on much smaller rolls, but perhaps his handwriting required more paper for his nonsense.</p><p>\u201cPlease, be seated.\u201d Harvison went around the room lighting oil lamps, until they shed enough light for me to clearly see his face. One dark eye gleamed, sharp and bright, but where the other should have been was only a smooth stretch of skin.</p><p>I leaned toward Rina. \u201cHe\u2019s only got one eye,\u201d I whispered.</p> <p>\u201cNo, young miss. I have two,\u201d Harvison answered for her. \u201cThe other lies beneath the flesh you see. So it has been since I first drew breath.\u201d</p><p>I watched him fill two cups with his brew, but when he reached for a third I spoke up. \u201cNone for me, thank you. I\u2019m a little off tea right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insulting my friend,\u201d Rina hissed.</p><p>\u201cShe is being only cautious,\u201d Harvison said. \u201cSomething experience teaches us, but fear strips away.\u201d He gave me his full attention. \u201cYou have been crossed by magic many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so I\u2019ve noticed,\u201d I told him. I made out the peculiar shape of his eye, but it wasn\u2019t the droop I was accustomed to seeing. \u201cWhere are you from, teller?\u201d</p><p>He bowed again. \u201cHere. My father bought my mother from Hokkaid\u014d before the Imperial Family instituted the blockade.\u201d</p><p>Now the odd-looking runes in his hall made sense. \u201cYou\u2019re half Nihon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd half Torian,\u201d Rina put in.</p><p>I\u2019d deal with her later. \u201cEvery Nihon, pureblood or not, was deported after the blockade. The Crown has denied them residency ever since. So how did you manage to stay in Rumsen, Mr. Harvison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother was property, not wife,\u201d he said simply. \u201cMy father claimed me as the same, until he discovered he could sire no children with his wife.\u201d</p><p>Keeping slaves had been banned before my birth. \u201cDid he have you declared his heir?\u201d When he nodded, I relaxed a little. \u201cSo you\u2019re a freedman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never been anything else.\u201d He gestured to the cushion on the floor opposite his own. \u201cNow I will see for you, madam\u2019s friend.\u201d</p><p>I thought of the teller who had tried to chase me out of her shop, and climbed down awkwardly to sit on the cushion. \u201cWhat do you want? Hair? Fingernails? Spit? Blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hands, please.\u201d He stretched out his own, palms up.</p><p>I\u2019d never touched a slave, declared or not, and Nihon universally despised Torians. I might not get my hands back.</p><p>I will free you, my gel, very soon, Dredmore said behind my eyes, and then you will be mine.</p><p>I clapped my hands over Harvison\u2019s. The moment I touched him, he went stiff and still. I watched his face, but I didn\u2019t see him twitch or take a breath.</p><p>Slowly he withdrew his hands. \u201cI am blinded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t touch his good eye,\u201d I assured Rina. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean to say is that I cannot see for you, young miss,\u201d Harvison said faintly. \u201cYou are like the ward, and the warded.\u201d He stared at my neck. \u201cYou wear a talisman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA necklace, with a pendant,\u201d I corrected. \u201cMost women wear them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I see it?\u201d</p><p>My first impulse was to say no, but then I thought of what Harry had said about my pendant. \u201cAll right.\u201d I reached back for the clasp.</p><p>Harvison remained silent for a long time as he studied my pendant. Only when Rina cleared her throat did he seem to remember we were in the room. \u201cForgive me, dear ladies. This is something of a puzzle.\u201d He regarded me. \u201cThis was given to you, was it not? When you were very young.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIt was a gift from my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stone is powerful. Or perhaps I should say, it contains power.\u201d He placed the pendant gently on the table, and I noticed his hand shook as he drew it back. \u201cYou must wear it at all times, or you will be in grave danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanger she\u2019s got aplenty. Lucien Dredmore\u2019s after her,\u201d Rina said tightly. \u201cCan\u2019t you see how that right bastard will try to take her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cannot.\u201d Harvison gave me a sad smile. \u201cIf the onmyouji is to possess her, she must give herself freely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, then, that\u2019ll never happen.\u201d I stood. \u201cThank you for not pretending to see something. Rina, we should go.\u201d</p><p>My friend ignored me. \u201cShe\u2019s been cursed. Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>Harvison made a helpless gesture. \u201cShe is beyond me, dear one. I believe she is beyond all who see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen see for me.\u201d Rina dropped down and put her hands in his. \u201cSee if I lose her to that conniving devil.\u201d</p><p>Harvison nodded toward me. \u201cShe must leave the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she will be glad to.\u201d I stalked out, brushed past his houseman and through the front entry. I was more angry with myself than Rina for allowing her to involve me in this rubbish. She did it out of love; I knew better.</p><p>Wrecker eyed me from the carri. \u201cHad enough of One Eye, then, Miss Kit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I have. Be a sport and turn your head.\u201d As soon as he did, I waved down a horse-drawn cab. \u201cI\u2019m going home. Rina will be furious, but tell her I said to tough it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be careful, miss,\u201d Wrecker suggested. \u201cHer won\u2019t like knowing something bad\u2019s happened to you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and let the driver help me into the cab. Once I was shut in, I wrapped my hand around my pendant, holding it so tight it cut into my palm. What Harvison had said about it containing power was nonsense, of course . . . but I kept remembering how his hand shook. Before I could think better of it, I reached back and thumbed the clasp, releasing it so I could pull the chain from my neck. I thrust the pendant into my reticule and dropped it on the bench beside me.</p><p>Harry White appeared on the rear-facing seat. \u201cTook you long enough. What were you waiting for, lass? Her Majesty\u2019s Diamond Jube?\u201d</p><p>I curled my hands into fists. \u201cMy mother wore only two pieces of jewelry when she was alive,\u201d I told him. \u201cOne was her wedding ring. What was the other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gold chain round her left ankle,\u201d he replied at once. \u201cOn the chain hung a silver ring set with seven stones in the shape of a star. Three rubies, three sapphires, and a black diamond.\u201d</p><p>No one knew about my mother\u2019s anklet but my father and me. \u201cYou gave it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, no. When she came to the morgue to identify me, she took the ring from my body.\u201d He showed me his left hand, and the pale circle left around the base of his fourth finger. \u201cYour father had the ankle chain made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she could hide it under her skirts,\u201d I guessed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded. \u201cAnyone who saw it would have treated her very badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were a spy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the star was my mark.

The greatest mage who ever lived. The supreme master of all the arts, shadow and light.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head.</p><p>I thumped the carri\u2019s side panel three times with my fist and called out, \u201cStopping here.\u201d</p><p>The cab came to a halt, and the driver jumped down and opened the door. \u201cCan\u2019t stop here, miss. \u2019Tis yet near a mile.\u201d</p> <p>I reached for my reticule. \u201cI\u2019m tired of riding with a lying jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d the driver demanded.</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d I said, gesturing at Harry. \u201cHim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should have mentioned before,\u201d my grandfather put in, \u201cthat no one but you can see or hear me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I turned on him. \u201cSo now you\u2019re only haunting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he agreed.</p> <p>I regarded the driver. \u201cYou see the man sitting in the seat across from me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He ducked his head in. \u201cI don\u2019t see no man, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right there. Right in front of your nose.\u201d</p><p>The driver pushed his cap back to scratch his pate. \u201cI don\u2019t drive them what been bespelled, miss. Naught but trouble they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologize and tell him to drive on before he shouts for a beater,\u201d Harry suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so very sorry,\u201d I said to the driver. \u201cI had a bit of a bump earlier, and now I\u2019m seeing things that aren\u2019t there.\u201d I rested my head against the cushions. \u201cIf you would be so kind as to drive on, I\u2019d be eternally grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you will, miss.\u201d He shut the door and scrambled up top.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou get that from your grandmother, you know.\u201d</p> <p>I closed my eyes. \u201cAccording to the documents I found in the city\u2019s protected archives, I have no grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, you\u2019re named after my Charmian.\u201d He crossed over and sat beside me. \u201cHow did you get into the archives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI turned into a specter and walked right past the guards; got that one from you.\u201d I looked at him. This close he seemed as solid and real as a living, breathing man. \u201cWhy are you haunting me, Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your guardian.\u201d He waited until I stopped laughing before he added, \u201cWell, I would have been if your father hadn\u2019t meddled in things he didn\u2019t understand. Nevertheless, I am most definitely not your enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the other way round, dear gel. You have only to call on me, and I will rush to your side.\u201d He pulled down the window shade. \u201cUnless it\u2019s daylight outside, or course.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand his aversion to sunlight. \u201cBut if you can\u2019t go outside during the day, then where do you go?\u201d</p><p>He gave me an inscrutable smile. \u201cBeyond this realm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you spend all your days in the netherside, is that it?\u201d I should have known he\u2019d lie to me. \u201cDo you perform there as the Great Houdini for all the other spirits, or do you just lie about doing nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care for where I go.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cI would stay here if I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, then.\u201d I picked up my reticule. \u201cI\u2019ve had more than enough nonsense for one night, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy birth name was Ehrich Weiss,\u201d he said quickly, \u201cand I was not an agent for the Crown.\u201d</p><p>I loosened the ribbons and reached inside. \u201cYour papers say differently.\u201d As soon as my fingers touched my pendant, Harry promptly vanished.</p><p>Perhaps this was what Harvison meant; perhaps my pendant contained the power to chase off bloody stupid men who annoyed me beyond all measure.</p><p>\u201cI need a few more of you,\u201d I told the pendant, before I refastened its chain around my neck.</p><p>Once the driver reached my flat, he brought the cab to a stop, but he didn\u2019t climb down to help me out. He also drove off before I could pay him, and the last thing I heard before he turned the corner were the protective curses he was chanting.</p><p>At noon on Friday I took a cab to the Silken Dream, where Bridget came to whisk me back to her private workroom and dress me herself.</p><p>\u201cYou look awful.\u201d Bridget, dressed in a lavender gown that should have clashed with her red hair and somehow didn\u2019t, looked marvelous. \u201cBurning the candle in the middle as well as at both ends, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe nice to me,\u201d I said. \u201cLast time I was here, someone tried to cut my throat in your alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the beaters told me.\u201d She encircled my waist with a measuring lace. \u201cTwo snuffmages, and you without a scratch. Why am I not surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know they gave me a very nasty cut.\u201d I held up my arm. \u201cThe chief inspector personally bandaged it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRina said he did quite a bit more.\u201d She propped her hands on her hips. \u201cWas the bandaging before or after he let someone try to poison you with joy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know they\u2019d try again at the Yard, or he would have stopped them. He\u2019s a friend.\u201d I wound my good arm through hers. \u201cJust like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t toss you in the gaol,\u201d she chided. \u201cMuch as I want to these days . . .\u201d</p><p>Bridget not only dressed me in the heavenly blue gown intended for the empty-pursed Lady Richmond, she had Sarah brush out the rat\u2019s nest on my head and arranged it into a crown of shining, interlaced coils. I only protested when Bridget brought a jeweler\u2019s case into the dressing room.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t bedeck me in baubles,\u201d I told her. \u201cWalsh believes I\u2019m poor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are poor,\u201d Bridget said flatly. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to dine with one of the finest families on the Hill, so it will be assumed that you have enough connections to borrow something decent. Which you do. Now shut up.\u201d She took out a small waterfall of liquid silver strands and draped them around my neck. \u201cThese are spun quicksilver. Don\u2019t fuss with them or they\u2019ll tangle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t breathe.\u201d The slippery weight of the cool silver made me shiver, then I winced as she snapped two heavy clips on my earlobes. \u201cI don\u2019t like earbaubs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne does not call perfectly matched snow pearls \u2018earbaubs,\u2019\u201d she corrected, coming around to inspect my face. \u201cYes, that will do. Now a wristlet.\u201d</p><p>Instead of more pearls or quicksilver she wound a snake made of small sapphires around my wrist. Its eyes had been fashioned from tiny clear globes, each containing an even tinier red glowworm.</p><p>I held my arm away. \u201cThis is too much. I\u2019ll only smash it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s warded, and you\u2019ll wear it for me.\u201d She cupped my face between my hands. \u201cOr I\u2019ll tell Charlie everything, and he\u2019ll have his men whisk you onto a yacht bound for Bali before you can sneeze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Of course she would, and Charles would do anything to make her happy, even if it meant shipping my ass round the world ten times. \u201cI can deal with the Walshes one more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d she warned, \u201cbecause after tonight, Rina won\u2019t let you go within a mile of the Hill.\u201d She kissed my cheek. \u201cNor will I.\u201d</p><p>Once Bridget had sprayed me with a little of the outrageously dear French perfume she wore, she sent me off to the Hill in her own coach. I\u2019d ridden in the crystal-sided coach once before, when she and Charlie had sent me home from their castle in it, but this time it felt different. Since real wealth was forever out of my reach, I\u2019d never considered what it felt like to be treated like royalty on a regular basis. It was a bit like strolling about in a dream where nothing could touch or harm you.</p><p>My dream evaporated when I passed Dredmore\u2019s coach coming from Walsh\u2019s Folly. A terrible panic seized me at the thought of seeing him again, until I forced myself to breathe and relax. It had been a dream, nothing more, and he couldn\u2019t assault me in front of the family.</p><p>A footman in tails and gloves leapt off the back of the coach and helped me down. He glanced at the house and murmured something in French about waiting for me.</p><p>Delightful as the ride had been, it had to end, so I smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, thank you.\u201d</p><p>This time the butler was waiting outside the door for me. He watched Bridget\u2019s coach depart and then gave me a somewhat creak-kneed, respectfully low bow.</p><p>\u201cMistress Kittredge, you are very welcome.\u201d</p><p>It had to hurt the old winge to say that, so I merely nodded and let him usher me along like the fine lady I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>The family had assembled this time in a larger reception room adjacent to the formal dining hall. The butler announced me at the door before discreetly withdrawing.</p><p>Lady Diana pounced on me, clamping her hands on mine. \u201cIt is so good of you to come,\u201d she said, her voice as tight as her eyes were reddened and puffy from weeping. She turned to the side and beamed at her husband. \u201cDarling, you remember Miss Kittredge.\u201d</p><p>Nolan Sr. ignored me and glared at his wife. \u201cI thought I\u2019d made myself clear about visitors, Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Miss Kittredge to dine with us before we had that conversation, my dear,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has been most helpful to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs what?\u201d Montrose said. \u201cYour procurer of men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive my brother, Miss Kittredge.\u201d An older woman sitting beside Miranda rose. She had a narrow face and frizzled hair but kind eyes. \u201cStepmama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ah, Miss Kittredge, this is Lady Laurana Walsh, my elder stepdaughter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laurana didn\u2019t curtsey but held out her hand, which I shook reflexively. \u201cI\u2019m the spinster who does good works,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen last you called I was working with the wretched foundlings at the school my mother founded in Scoursie. We try to teach them to read and write, even if it\u2019s simply their names. Keeps them from being claimed by farm overseers as runaway pickers.\u201d</p><p>Miranda uttered a squeak of dismay. \u201cLaury, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Laurana\u2019s efforts on the behalf of the poor are highly admirable.\u201d A sixth figure emerged from the shadows by the fireplace. \u201cGood evening, Charmian.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDredmore.\u201d I turned to Lady Diana so I wouldn\u2019t have to look at him for longer than a blink. \u201cI hope you were able to rest undisturbed the last few nights,\u201d I said in a lower voice.</p><p>\u201cI was, to some extent.\u201d She looked as if she wanted to say more, and then a footman stepped in from the dining hall and announced that dinner was served. \u201cI hope you enjoy pheasant, Miss Kittredge.\u201d She went from me to Nolan, and when the Walsh siblings followed them into the other room, I was left alone with Dredmore.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a winter sylph,\u201d he said as he came to take my arm. As soon as he did, he bent down. \u201cI told you to stay away from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, here I am,\u201d I replied, starting forward to follow the others.</p><p>He pulled me back round to face him, but he didn\u2019t look at me. He watched the dining hall and talked over my head. \u201cMake an excuse during the meal to leave, and go.\u201d</p> <p>I raised my brows. \u201cAny suggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA migraine. Your monthlies. A sudden eruption of boils on your ass,\u201d he grated. \u201cI don\u2019t care, just get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo suck a tube,\u201d I suggested gently before leading him in to dine.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>A dining table of glossy cherrywood parted the hall, ready to serve fifty comfortably, but fortunately the servants had set three facing three on either side of the master\u2019s chair, or we would have had to shout our remarks to each other.</p><p>Lady Diana sat at her husband\u2019s right, Laurana at his left, with Montrose and Miranda seated by their sister and me between Dredmore and Diana. The candlelit centerpiece, a small, frothy volcano of porcelain and gold flowers, cast a warm glow over the exquisitely set table.</p> <p>As the footmen placed small urns with some sort of pinkish-gray shellfish on ice, I counted the utensils. Accustomed to three, I had to now manage twelve, and Lady Diana was politely waiting for me to start. I glanced at Dredmore, who was no help, and then Lord Walsh, who employed the smallest two-pronged fork to stab one of the shellfish. Leashing in a sigh of relief, I did the same and gingerly tasted what turned out to be half-cooked clams.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you reside, Miss Kittredge?\u201d Laurana asked before she sampled her cocktail.</p><p>\u201cI keep a flat on Estarlin,\u201d I said. \u201cNear the fruit market, if you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shop there several times a week,\u201d she said, grimacing as she set down her fork and gestured for the footman to take away the little urn. \u201cThey always have the best apples and nuts in Rumsen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister delights in playing the servant,\u201d Montrose drawled. \u201cI fully expect to come round some day and find her scrubbing out the loos.\u201d</p><p>Miranda choked and buried her face in her napkin as she tried to control her blush as well as her coughing.</p><p>\u201cDo you play kitchen maid, Cousin Kit?\u201d Montrose continued. \u201cI should dearly like to watch you turn a spit or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cooking is dreadful, sir,\u201d I admitted freely. \u201cYou\u2019d do better by bucket.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed, too long and too loud, until his father snapped something low and harsh at him. Montrose didn\u2019t show an ounce of remorse. \u201cShe\u2019s got a quick tongue, Dad, why not let her employ it for our amusement?\u201d</p><p>I felt something touch the top of my thigh and looked down as Dredmore spread his hand over it and dug his fingers in. I slipped a knife from the collection by my plate into my hand, taking care to let only him see it. Before I could stab him, however, he took his hand away.</p><p>To avoid eating the rest of the clams, I engaged Lady Diana in another meaningless discussion of the weather, turning now and then to include Dredmore in the conversation. The second course, a steaming shallow bowl of green turtle soup, proved slightly more edible, although I picked out the blanched fernheads floating on the top and pushed them out of sight on the plate under my bowl. Baby fernheads were said to be delicious, but if picked too late in the season they could be poisonous.</p><p>Dredmore reached for his wine and murmured to me, \u201cThey\u2019re too young to make you ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I muttered back. \u201cI have you for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Lord Dredmore are acquainted, I understand,\u201d Nolan said.</p><p>As soon as I realized he was speaking to me, I set down my spoon. \u201cYes, milord. We\u2019ve met several times in the course of our business.\u201d</p><p>Miranda had gotten over her coughing attack, for I heard her ask, \u201cHave you no family to look after your concerns, Miss Kittredge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDi\u2019s family hasn\u2019t two coins to rub together,\u201d Montrose said, handing his empty wineglass to the footman and holding his hand aloft until it was refilled. \u201cWhat of your mother\u2019s people, cousin? Isn\u2019t there some broad-backed farmer among them who would take you to bed?\u201d</p><p>Following the family\u2019s example and ignoring the little skink grew harder by the moment. \u201cMy mother was an orphan,\u201d I answered Miranda. \u201cShe passed away while I was still in school.\u201d</p><p>The footmen presented the third course, a golden fillet of flounder trimmed and garnished to look as if it were ready to jump off the platter and wriggle its way back to the sea. No one else seemed especially impressed by the presentation but me. Nolan dissected his fillet with stiff displeasure; the Walsh sisters picked daintily at the delicate flesh with their forks, and Montrose simply drank. Lady Diana made a brave show of appetite but I never saw her actually eat more than a single sliver or quarter spoon of any dish served.</p><p>I\u2019d seen too many forms of mold in the tunnels under the city to have any desire for the fourth course, an assortment of mushrooms poached in sherry. The fifth course actually made me angry, as the men were served braised slices of tomatoes swimming in pinked cream, while the Walsh ladies and I were instead served creamed beets cut out to resemble tomatoes. I despised beets, but objecting would have been rude, so I just pushed them around with the right fork.</p><p>\u201cMiss Kittredge seems unhappy with her lady\u2019s dish,\u201d Montrose observed aloud. \u201cDoubtless the working class allow their females to consume vast quantities of lord-apples.\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head to look at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s believed that tomatoes invigorate the male humors,\u201d Laurana said, her expression as serene as her words were shocking. \u201cThey are never served to ladies in good society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLest they drive you to uncontrollable lust, Miss Kittredge,\u201d Montrose tacked on sweetly.</p><p>That remark finally undid Miranda, whose fork clattered on the table. \u201cFather, I\u2019m not feeling at all well. May I be excused?\u201d At his nod she slipped out of her chair and hurried out of the hall.</p><p>\u201cMy younger sister is a widow,\u201d Montrose told me. \u201cShe dislikes being reminded that she is no longer free to indulge in nightly congress. Ouch, damn you, Laury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to eat more and drink less, Monty.\u201d Laurana, who had rapped his hand with the handle of her fork, took his nearly empty goblet and handed it to her footman. \u201cNo more wine for you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her brother scowled as he jerked to his feet. \u201cTo the devil with all of you.\u201d He stomped out of the hall.</p><p>Nolan said nothing but watched the footman clear Montrose\u2019s setting. I glanced down at my beets and saw my plate half-filled with tomatoes. I turned my head to see Dredmore calmly eating my beets.</p><p>\u201cClear for Miss Kittredge,\u201d Lady Diana, who must have seen the switch, said quickly to her footman.</p><p>The cook, a stout little man in immaculate chef\u2019s whites, brought in the fifth and main course, a fully dressed pheasant with feathers intact, perched on a lifelike branch made of bread. Glowing dark-red roses, sculpted from what appeared to be jellied cranberries, clustered around the bird, along with sprigs of dark chocolate twigs with candied violets. The bird\u2019s long brown-and-black-striped tail feathers rose at a steep angle and shifted along with the cook\u2019s movements, making it seem as if the pheasant were about to launch itself from the platter and take flight.</p><p>After receiving a nod from Nolan, the cook carried the bird to a side carving table and skillfully removed the feathered sham from the carcass before beginning to carve it to pieces.</p><p>The scent should have made my mouth water, for I dearly loved roasted fowl of any variety, but what was left of my appetite deserted me. Seeing the exotic bird dressed to appear as it had been in life made me feel like a murderer instead of a dinner guest. Fortunately I was served only a small slice, which I forced down and complimented as best I could.</p><p>I ate a few buttered peas from the seventh, mixed vegetable course and drained my water glass to ease my tight throat while Diana told a long and relatively dull anecdote about the new fashion of wearing flounce-brimmed hats. Then the eighth course arrived, an aromatic potato-herb tartlet flavored by slivers of black truffle and topped with a layer of toasted bleu Cheshire.</p><p>The pheasant had likely been the most expensive dish I would ever eat in my life, but the tartlet was surely humble pie.</p><p>I\u2019d only tasted bleu Cheshire once, when my father had spent an inordinate amount of coin to purchase a small wedge of it for my mother, whose secret vice was exotic cheese.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether to eat it,\u201d Mum had teased, \u201cor have it encased in glass and carted over to the art museum.\u201d</p><p>In the end Mum had insisted we each have a bite of the precious stuff, and I\u2019d fallen in love, probably because I\u2019d known I\u2019d never taste it again. Now and then when I had a few extra coins I\u2019d buy a little half round of Danish blue, but it was nothing by comparison. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It would have been criminal to send it back to the kitchen untouched, I told myself as I began eating it. The first taste almost brought a moan from my throat, and sent tears to sting my eyes. I rested my hands against the table, mainly to keep from shoving the tartlet by the handfuls into my mouth.</p><p>Dredmore\u2019s fingers brushed over mine, sending a jolt of pleasure up my arm and into my chest. As he reached for his goblet, he murmured, \u201cDon\u2019t weep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop dead,\u201d I whispered back, furious with him and myself for lowering my guard.</p> <p>The final, cold courses were frozen puree of cress and maple-almond iced cream, both of which I ate in hopes of cooling off. Like the other ladies I abstained from drinking the coffee offered at the end of the meal and commented as favorably as I could on the cook\u2019s menu.</p><p>Nolan didn\u2019t excuse himself or Dredmore to his study for the gentlemen\u2019s after-dinner ritual of bourbon and cigars but stood and spoke to his remaining child. \u201cYou must be very tired, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Father.\u201d Laurana gave him and Diana a sharp look. \u201cHowever, I do have some letters to write. Miss Kittredge, I hope someday to bump shoulders with you at the fruit market. Dredmore, Stepmama.\u201d She nodded to the others before departing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go to my study now,\u201d Nolan said, taking his wife\u2019s arm in a decidedly unaffectionate grip.</p><p>Dredmore had a hand on me before I could dodge him, and he used it to guide me out of the hall behind the Walshes. \u201cYou should have left when you could, Charmian. This will not be pleasant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew that the moment I saw you by the fire.\u201d I drew my arm from his, but he only put his hand at the small of my back. \u201cStop touching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d When I would have walked ahead, he hooked his fingers in my waister and tugged me back beside him. \u201cListen to me, you stubborn wench. Whatever accusations Walsh makes, say nothing. I will do the talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day I need you to speak for me,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll cut out your tongue.\u201d</p><p>As soon as we were gathered in the study, Nolan closed the doors and went to stand with his back to the painting of an Elizabethan Walsh whose weak chin had been disguised by his black goatee and wide white ruff. Both Lord Walshes regarded me with expressions of haughty disgust, but the one who was still breathing had a decidedly ugly gleam in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMiss Kittredge, while I\u2019m sure your behavior goes unnoticed among the commoners, I find your involvement in our private family matters entirely intolerable,\u201d Nolan announced. \u201cWhatever promises of remuneration my wife has given you, I will not abide your interference for another moment.\u201d</p><p>My lack of breeding had nothing on his rudeness. \u201cI came to speak on your lady wife\u2019s behalf, milord,\u201d I said stiffly. \u201cThat is the only reason I came.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no interest in anything you might say to me,\u201d Nolan snapped before he regarded Dredmore. \u201cLucien, I will have the truth of the matter. Tonight.\u201d</p><p>Before my nemesis could employ his trickery to make matters worse, I said, \u201cYou will hear what I have to say, Lord Walsh. Your wife hired me to dispel a curse she believed had been put on her. I am the one who first discovered the panel under her bed, along with evidence that someone in this household has been assaulting her person. It is possible that both of you are being drugged each night as well.\u201d</p><p>Nolan whirled on his wife. \u201cHow much did you pay her to lie for you this time? Fifty pounds? A hundred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been paid nothing,\u201d I told his back. \u201cYour wife is the victim here, sir, not the transgressor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe victim.\u201d He strode over to me. \u201cMy wife is nothing but a lying, cheating whore who smuggles her lover into the house under my very nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she bring this imaginary lover to the house, when it would be far more prudent to meet him in town on one of her shopping excursions?\u201d I pointed out. \u201cShe could have a dozen lovers in town, and you\u2019d never know it.\u201d</p><p>Diana uttered a distressed sound.</p><p>\u201cWherever she conducts her affairs, my wife hasn\u2019t the wits to conceal them,\u201d Nolan assured me.</p> <p>\u201cI have seen the evidence with my own eyes, milord, and it is inarguable. Your wife is being tormented.\u201d I went to Diana and put my arm around her. \u201cSomeone in this house has been stealing into her bedchamber, painting terrible words on her body, and then removing them a day later. When she came to me, she truly believed the words were being cut into her skin.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore stepped between us. \u201cThat is enough, Charmian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho in this household would do such nonsense?\u201d Walsh bellowed over Dredmore\u2019s shoulder, his face mottling dark red. \u201cNo one, I say. No one but this whore, my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be someone who has theatrical or military experience,\u201d I said tightly. \u201cProbably military, as it\u2019s a soldier\u2019s trick. The assailant wishes you to believe that your wife is greedy and promiscuous. Someone who wants to drive her out of her wits with terror and give you just cause to divorce her.\u201d As Diana sagged with my words, I led her over to an armchair. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s working, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Dredmore stared at me. \u201cWhat do you mean, soldier\u2019s trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been using wound paste on her,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhen it dries it looks like the real thing, and if you try to remove it, it tears the skin, like a fresh scab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not listen to another moment of this!\u201d Nolan said, sweeping his arm toward the mage. \u201cDo your work now, Dredmore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do nothing with Miss Kittredge present,\u201d Dredmore replied. \u201cShe must be removed from the house.\u201d</p><p>Diana suddenly revived and latched on to my arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave, Kit. Not before you make him understand what\u2019s been done to me. Please, I beg you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived at a stalemate, milords,\u201d I told the men. I pried Diana\u2019s fingers away and went to Lord Walsh. \u201cDredmore will not perform for you in front of me because he knows I will expose him for the fraud he is. Your lady wife desires me to stay and prove her innocence.\u201d</p><p>The red patches on Lord Walsh\u2019s face turned purple. \u201cYou dare challenge my authority, in my own house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy only wish is to investigate the matter further, milord,\u201d I pushed on. \u201cAllow me to speak with your servants; one of them has surely witnessed something to lead us to the\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t expect him to backhand me, but once I was on the floor, my face throbbing, I saw Walsh draw back his boot and suddenly understood Diana\u2019s bruises and why Dredmore had wanted me to go. I brought up my arms to protect my face and waited for the next blow, which never came.</p><p>\u201cAllow me, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The kick never landed; instead two strong arms snatched me from the floor and carried me away. By the time I dropped my hands from my face, Dredmore had me through the front entry and halfway to his coach.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I twisted and nearly freed myself before he shifted me up and over his shoulder. \u201cI can\u2019t leave her like this. He\u2019ll kill her.\u201d I pounded my fists against his back. \u201cPut me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t risk beating her now, not when she can use her injuries against him in court. You, however, will not get off so lightly.\u201d Dredmore tossed me in the coach and slammed the door, securing it from the outside. When I tried to dart out the other door, I found it locked. The windows were too small for me to crawl through, so I sat and watched as Dredmore walked back to speak with Nolan Walsh, who had come out of the house after us.</p><p>Walsh blustered while Dredmore soothed, and while I couldn\u2019t hear what they said, it was obvious it was about me. Then Walsh did a curious thing; he gestured for the butler, who handed Dredmore a large satchel. Dredmore nodded before he returned to the coach and handed off the satchel to his driver before climbing in with me.</p><p>\u201cMy turn, is it?\u201d I lunged at him only to be pinned against his body. I maneuvered my arms between us and pushed at his chest. \u201cI can still scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can still have you gagged.\u201d He ducked my fist and jerked me closer to pin my arms between us. \u201cAnd bound, if you like.\u201d</p><p>Being an inch from his face brought on all sorts of ugly feelings and ideas, but he grabbed my hair and held me in place.</p><p>\u201cIf you wish to bite me, Charmian,\u201d he said softly, \u201cthere are far better spots than my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you like it rough.\u201d I changed tactics and moved a breath closer. \u201cHow will it be, Lucien? You tied naked between the posts, me in leathers, snapping a little whip? Is that what it takes to brick your chimney?\u201d</p><p>Instead of being offended, the cold bastard smiled at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve been spending too much time among strumpets, my sweet.\u201d He wrenched me around so that my back was pressed to his front. \u201cSit still, or I will show you exactly what I like.\u201d</p><p>I sat still. Not because he ordered me to, but to give myself time to think. From what I saw through the coach window, it was obvious that he was taking me out of the city. We left behind the dark streets and alleyways, rode through the pasturelands, and started up the cliff roads. Since Dredmore owned most of the coastal property beyond Rumsen, that meant our destination was his lair.</p><p>Castle Travallian, or so it had been before Dredmore had been disowned.</p><p>I\u2019d seen it once when I\u2019d gone atop one of the taller buildings downtown and looked over toward the sea. From there the manor had looked like little more than a pile of rubble. It came into view as the coach left the road and started up a long, winding path between two rows of black iron gaslamp poles. The cessation of jolting made me look down at the smooth pavers of obsidian rock, cut and fitted together so perfectly, I barely made out the seams.</p><p>\u201cI had the stone shipped in from the islands,\u201d he said. \u201cThe masons called it the road to hell.\u201d</p><p>Was it to be mine? \u201cI suppose Torian granite wasn\u2019t dark or dramatic enough for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe islanders worship a fire god who they believe dwells in their volcano,\u201d he said instead of answering. \u201cEvery year before planting season they take a young virgin up to the edge of the crater and toss her in. Her sacrifice pleases the god, who then provides a bountiful harvest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor burning a gel to death.\u201d I tried to sit up. \u201cHow delightful. How do they celebrate the harvest? By setting little babies on fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey feast on the fruits of their labors.\u201d He tugged me back, tucking my head against his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s not as grim as it sounds. According to legend, courageous virgins are given eternal life as the god\u2019s handmaidens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bloody fabulous reward for you.\u201d I felt him touching my hair and snapped my head away. \u201cTrapped to serve forever the bastard who killed them. Where do I sign up for the next sacrifice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they love their god so much that they don\u2019t mind,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d . . . stop . . .\u201d My voice died and my neck cricked as the coach came to a stop.</p><p>The cliffside manor was not a heap of rubble but a magnificent edifice that seemed to be growing out of the very ground. This effect came from the cliff stones, which had originally been an enormous pile of black and white granite boulders hewn and squared at the topmost peaks to form the great house\u2019s foundation. Other, identical stones had been quarried and brought to build atop them, creating a manor that soared some five stories above the cliff\u2019s edge.</p><p>Dredmore\u2019s driver opened the door, blocking it when I tried to scramble out.</p> <p>\u201cI have her, Connell.\u201d</p><p>Somehow Dredmore managed to hoist me under his arm as he maneuvered me out of the coach, and he carried me like that across the drive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a sack of turnips. Put me down.\u201d I struggled to get my head up to see where he was taking me. \u201cDredmore.\u201d</p><p>He flipped me over so that he held me like a new husband about to cross the threshold with his bride. \u201cWelcome to Morehaven, Charmian.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Dredmore carried me into his lair as if it were my new home, and for a moment I wondered if it would be. As solitary and standoffish as Dredmore was, he wouldn\u2019t have brought me here for a nightcap or a friendly chat. No, I had the feeling I was headed straight for some underground torture chamber or filthy cage.</p> <p>Dredmore had no enemies, it was said, because he disposed of them before they could become known as such. As a licensed deathmage, he had the Crown\u2019s blessing to kill whomever he deemed needed to die, but I\u2019d always thought the threat a better deterrent. Why would anyone cross a man who could legally murder you?</p><p>Other than me, naturally.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked as he carried me over to a dimly lit staircase and began ascending. \u201cThe dungeon is downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no dungeon.\u201d He turned and went up another flight before stepping into a hall. \u201cI have guest rooms.\u201d</p><p>I tried not to gawk at the magnificent paintings we passed, but the place was like a bloody national museum. \u201cYou are obliged to kidnap people in order to have gues\u2014My God, is that an original Raphael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do what I must, and yes, it is.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over the railing to see Connell carrying the satchel into one of the rooms downstairs. \u201cWhat did Walsh put in the bag? Some leftover pheasant? Can I have some? I\u2019m feeling peckish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are.\u201d He stopped in front of a door, and a valet opened it from the inside.</p> <p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d I told the manservant in my best terrified, helpless tone. \u201cI\u2019ve been brought here against my will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will be all for tonight, Winslow,\u201d Dredmore said as he carried me into the chamber.</p><p>\u201cYes, milord.\u201d The valet bowed and left.</p><p>I listened for the latch of the lock but heard nothing.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem too worried about me,\u201d I said as Dredmore halted in front of a roaring fire. \u201cHave you trained your servants to ignore your captives? How do you go about that, by making threats on their lives, or dropping a few more coins in their monthly wage packets?\u201d</p><p>Dredmore held on to me. \u201cI\u2019m going to put you down now, Charmian, so that we may talk. Don\u2019t run.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cReally, Lucien, you must stop reading so many romantic novels. I\u2019m very happy that you abducted me. I\u2019ve wanted to see the inside of this place for ages. You should really allow the tour companies to put you on their rounds. They\u2019d pay you heaps to let a few nosy old ladies shuffle through here every week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorehaven is not a curiosity shop.\u201d He lowered one arm and set me down on my feet. \u201cDon\u2019t run.\u201d</p><p>I held on to him until I found my balance, and smiled up at him. \u201cWhy would I run from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hate me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want me dead. If I walked in front of your carri, you\u2019d run me down in the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you\u2019ve said you\u2019d do,\u201d he reminded me, \u201calong with shoving a spell scroll down my throat, using a rusted blade to relieve me of my manhood, setting my coach alight with me locked in it, and oh, yes, my personal favorite, hiring a thug to toss me over my own cliffs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucien, Lucien.\u201d I kept beaming as I stroked my hand up his arm and curled it around his neck. \u201cHave you no understanding of women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me show you exactly what I\u2019ve always dreamed of doing to you.\u201d I pulled his head down toward mine, and as soon as his eyelids drooped and his mouth parted, I clutched his neck and rammed my knee into his groin.</p><p>Dredmore shifted to deflect my blow with his hip, which I had expected, and tried to shove me to the floor, which I had not. I curled over under his weight, spun on my heel, and got out from under it at the last possible moment. He landed on the floor; I ran.</p><p>Connell, who was standing guard at the end of the hall, ran toward me and tried to seize me, but I dropped to my knees and slid between his legs, leaping up on the other side to hurl myself at the banister. I hoisted up my skirts, put a leg over, and took a long, perilous slide down to the next landing, where I jumped off and took the steps to the first floor two at a time.</p><p>I saw the front entry and knew I was going to make it. I was going to best Lucien Dredmore, and I was never going to let him forget it, either.</p><p>A figure stepped out of the shadows to block my path to the door, and I gaped at Dredmore\u2019s face.</p><p>I whipped my head back to glance at the stairs. He hadn\u2019t followed me down; I was sure of it. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d</p><p>He smiled a little. \u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>The only thing that could have gotten him downstairs so instantly was magic. What if he could do all that they said he could? Cast spells, exorcise spirits . . . kill with a touch . . .</p><p>I whirled, hauled up my skirts, and ran in the opposite direction. I didn\u2019t hear Dredmore shout or footsteps behind me and looked frantically for the chute or tube he had used to get to the first floor ahead of me. I found nothing, not even a bucket-waiter. All the windows and doors I stopped at to try wouldn\u2019t open.</p><p>I made it to the kitchen and hurried toward the first weapon I saw, a thin-bladed boning knife left sitting on a cutting block. Did I want to stab Dredmore in the heart? Many times. But could I actually do that? As I reached for the blade, my hand trembled, and I stared at it, suddenly and completely terrified out of my wits.</p><p>Not yet, something whispered inside my head. Hang on.</p><p>\u201cAre you finished?\u201d Dredmore asked me from where he stood, just inside the kitchen. \u201cOr would you like to scamper around the house a bit more?\u201d</p><p>I drew my hand back from the knife, and glanced at a cook\u2019s stool sitting by the banked hearth. Every door in the kitchen was locked, but the one leading out to the garden had a long panel of glass in the center.</p><p>I grabbed the blade, turned, and threw it at a spot on the wall beside Dredmore, who instinctively ducked. That gave me enough time to get to the stool, pick it up, and hurl it through the doorglass.</p><p>Jagged shards tore at my arms and hips as I stepped through the opening and out onto a pavilion. I shook bits of glass from my sleeves as I hurried down the steps, looking this way and that for a path leading away from the manor.</p><p>\u201cCharmian.\u201d Dredmore sounded angry now.</p><p>No path appeared, but a formal garden formed neat beds of flowers around a dark spiral maze of rose hedges almost twice my height. I trampled innumerable posies, violets, and zinnias as I rushed into the maze.</p><p>There were no helpful gaslamps and no way to navigate through the fragrant darkness; the only way I knew I\u2019d taken a wrong turn was when I ran into a thorny wall of canes, too densely packed to let me squeeze through them. I stopped to catch my breath, think, and listen.</p><p>\u201cStay where you are,\u201d I heard Dredmore say from some point in the maze to my right.</p><p>\u201cEat dirt,\u201d I called back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wounded,\u201d he said. \u201cI can smell your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeeches always can.\u201d I went left and nearly knocked over a pedestal bearing a marble bust of, who else, Lucien Dredmore.</p><p>The cold stone chilled my hands as I tried to lift and toss it, but it was too heavy to move. I settled for picking up a handful of the ornamental pebbles surrounding the base of the pedestal. They weren\u2019t large enough to inflict any serious damage, but with a good hard throw one might blacken his eye or knock out a tooth.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see the tops of the rose hedges, so I had no idea if I was heading in the right direction. The tonners loved hedge mazes, as did Rina, who always regretted that living in the city had prevented her from planting one.</p><p>\u201cNot one of those dull old branching mazes, either,\u201d she\u2019d told me once. \u201cI like these new island mazes. There are so many wrong turns and corner traps that you can send someone into them and not see them again for days.\u201d</p><p>Travallian Castle had been built by one of Lucien\u2019s ancestors at the turn of the last century; it would be safe to assume the maze was branching. That meant that there was only one path to the center, and one path out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I emptied my reticule on the ground and used it to wrap my hand, then followed the hedge by touch to the next gap, which I ducked in. I kept my hand on the hedge as I followed it to the next dead end, and then around until I found another gap. The rose thorns snagged and tore at the fabric, but I kept going until the hedge became smooth black stone.</p><p>I stepped into the center of the maze and saw a gazebo by a small pool of water. The reflecting pool was being fed from a black-and-white stone fountain. As hot and tired as I was, I didn\u2019t go near the water but circled around it, looking for a place to hide. I had to go round four full-size marble statues of Lucien Dredmore. I stopped by the fifth to unwrap my scratched, painful hand.</p><p>The statue reached out and clamped its stone hand over my wrist, making me scream.</p> <p>\u201cRelease,\u201d Dredmore said from the gap in the black stone wall, and the statue\u2019s fingers uncurled.</p><p>\u201cSweet Mary.\u201d I backed away from the thing and heard gears turning as the arm lowered. \u201cWhat is that thing? A mechanized statue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe property is protected by movement-triggered sentinels.\u201d He started toward me. \u201cThey\u2019re too heavy to knock over, invulnerable to injury, and utterly impossible to escape. Quite efficient in detaining uninvited, unsuspecting guests.\u201d</p><p>I backed away. \u201cWell, then, since I wasn\u2019t invited, I should go.\u201d I darted to the gap opposite the one I\u2019d used to find the center, only to come up against another of the mechanized statues standing in it. I dodged its stone hands and ran smack into Dredmore.</p><p>\u201cHello again.\u201d I offered a smile. \u201cLovely maze. What\u2019s the forfeit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He dragged me over to the pool, holding my hand under the gaslight to examine it. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking . . . run away, escape, call the authorities, have you arrested and charged with assault, see you imprisoned for several decades.\u201d I yanked my arm, but he wouldn\u2019t let go of me. \u201cYou know. The usual things.\u201d</p><p>He forced me to kneel down on the pool\u2019s narrow ledge and immersed my wounded hand in the icy water.</p><p>I yelped. \u201cDamn you, Lucien, it\u2019s freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will stop the bleeding.\u201d He tore his cravat from his throat and used it to blot my palm, examining it again before wrapping the neckcloth around it. \u201cWalsh might have beaten you to death tonight.\u201d</p><p>I pretended interest. \u201cFor standing up for his wife? Does that generally merit a death sentence?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with Lady Diana.\u201d Dredmore tied off the cravat. \u201cWalsh is involved in some sort of conspiracy against the Crown. He\u2019s been seen with Talians, and they\u2019ve not come here for the fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalians? Then why are they here?\u201d I demanded. When he didn\u2019t reply, I yanked my hand away. \u201cAll right. Why would he want me dead if I know nothing about this business of his?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know something. You simply don\u2019t know what it means to Walsh and his plans, and neither do I.\u201d He gave me a long look. \u201cBut he does.\u201d</p><p>Kneeling there as we were, him tending to my wounds, me wanting to pummel him, and the two of us exchanging confidences, felt a bit too romantic for my tastes. \u201cI would like to go home now. I keep early hours and if I don\u2019t get my rest, I\u2019m an absolute hag in the morning.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head. \u201cDon\u2019t run from me again, Charmian.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like what I saw in his eyes. \u201cOh, is this when you confess your deep and abiding affection for helpless, wounded females, and declare that you would never, ever do anything to hurt one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity.\u201d I balled up my good fist and punched him in the face.</p> <p>My knuckles crunched against his chin, which was apparently made of iron, and then the world turned sideways, and cool, soft grass filled my face. Dredmore straddled me, using his weight to keep me pinned under him as he hauled my arms up over my head and kneed my skirts to keep me from kicking.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have several matters to settle, my sweet.\u201d He bunched his fist in the back of my bodice and pulled it out of my waister. \u201cAt the moment, this is the most pressing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I kept my tone calm as I lifted my face out of the grass. \u201cIf you do, I swear, you\u2019ll regret it for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>He lifted, rolling me over before he yanked at the front of my bodice and pulled it up over my head. \u201cThat would be nothing new, Charmian.\u201d</p><p>Once he had exposed my chemise, I waited for the ravishment to begin. Society held that seeing a female in her undergarments stimulated a male beyond any hope of self-control, and a woman who disrobed in the presence of a man\u2014voluntarily or not\u2014had only herself to blame for the inevitable inflammation of his passions. So even if I got away from him later and went to the police, they would tell me only that it was all my fault.</p><p>Instead, Dredmore lifted me up in a curious position, my skirts bunched around my waist, my bare legs draped over his. He used his fist to bring my hands down between us, and then tore open his shirt before inserting them and pressing them flat against his chest.</p><p>I felt the incredible heat of his skin, the hammering of his heart, and the hard bulges of his muscles beneath my palms. Touching a man in such an intimate fashion was not within my scope of experience. This was the work of strumpets, mistresses, and wives. Unmarried females were supposed to keep their hands to themselves.</p><p>I glanced up, and in that moment Dredmore looked more remote and aloof than I\u2019d ever seen him. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d he said.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t going to take it, I knew that now, and the realization smashed through me, harder than a fist, more painful than finding my way through ten thousand mazes of thorns. He was not the monster I\u2019d always hoped he\u2019d be. He was only a man, and in his arms, I could be simply a woman.</p><p>If I chose to be.</p><p>I could face his wrath without flinching. He could beat me black-and-blue and I\u2019d still taunt him. But this, this tenderness, this self-denial on my behalf, it infuriated me. I could not fight an enemy who would not attack. I would not give myself to a man whose downfall I had dreamt of causing and whose ruination I had dearly anticipated celebrating. I might as well offer myself from a street corner to anyone with two coins to rub together.</p><p>\u201cIt will end here and now,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAll you need say is no, and I will take you back to the house.\u201d</p><p>He was ravishing me by not ravishing me, the evil bastard. In that moment I had never hated him more. \u201cYou think you know me, Dredmore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he said politely. \u201cBut I can feel you, Charmian. Your loneliness. Your silent longing.\u201d</p><p>As he gathered me close, I closed my eyes and made my choice. \u201cGoddamn you, Lucien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already has,\u201d he murmured against my hair.</p><p>I tucked my face against his throat, opening my lips and using the flat of my tongue against his skin. He tasted salty and smoky, and stiffened when I dragged the edge of my teeth up to his jaw. There I followed the strong bone with my open mouth, turning my face into the silken locks of his black hair, letting them soothe my hot face. He bore it a few more moments before he worked his fingers into my hair and turned my mouth to his.</p><p>His breath blended with mine, and then we kissed, not with unsure pecks or tentative brushes of lips, but mouth to open mouth, capturing each other for the thrust and glide of tongues, the gasps of pleasure, the explosion of tastes. The raw intimacy of it astounded me, as did the way it stole the air right out of my lungs. That two people could do such a thing to each other and not have their chests collapse or their hearts explode seemed impossible.</p><p>I heard myself making the oddest sound, and then I went deaf to myself and the rest of the world as he slanted his head and took me deeper.</p><p>Things became rather frantic after that. I tore at his shirt, and he ripped my chemise apart, thrusting my bare breasts against the bruising plane of his chest. I rubbed myself shamelessly against him, eager to relieve the heavy aches and sharp tightness all over plaguing me. Like water on a lamp fire, I only caused it to spread.</p><p>His hands kept moving and adjusting me, a supreme annoyance until I felt more cloth tearing and the night air on my bare thighs. The shock and delight of it sent me up on my knees, my spine arching as his mouth attacked my breasts and he shoved his hands between my legs.</p><p>I felt the smooth bulb protruding from his fist the moment it touched the astonished, slick folds of my body; after a moment I understood he was positioning himself, and gazed down at him as I curled an arm around his neck.</p><p>\u201cLucien.\u201d I took in a quick breath as he pressed up, seating that heavy, full plum of flesh against me. \u201cA certain confession is perhaps in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I feel.\u201d He already knew, but he didn\u2019t cast me away or shove through the thin membrane that kept him at bay. He held me suspended, watching my face. \u201cI want it, Charmian.\u201d</p><p>Rina had educated me about the gift I was only supposed to give a husband. Among other things, the giving often caused discomfort and sometimes bleeding. She firmly believed a woman should see to it herself before taking her first lover and had often scolded me to do the same.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t, and now\u2014perversely\u2014I was glad. \u201cThen have it.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore\u2019s entire body tightened as he laid me down in the grass and came up over me. At the same time, his body pressed into mine, and I felt a burning, tearing sensation.</p><p>Prepared as Rina had made me, I still bit into my lip to keep from yelping as he worked himself deeply inside a place Rina swore was made for just such a reason. I was beginning to have serious doubts. \u201cTell me this is the worst of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He seemed to be in as much pain as I was.</p><p>\u201cJust . . . be . . . still.\u201d</p><p>Skewered as I was, I couldn\u2019t seem to do that. My insides clenched around him, and there was some quivering involved. My body wanted up and I wanted him out, and my hips rose under his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He withdrew, leaving behind a hot, wet emptiness, but that was no good, either. I clutched at his waist, not knowing how to make it right, and then he filled me again with a force that was only slightly less painful than his initial foray.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re suited,\u201d I told him once I felt the full length of him throbbing within me. \u201cBut I did like the touching, very much. Could we do that\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut me off with another of his open-mouthed, completely indecent kisses, which distracted me from the other things he did for a time. Only gradually did I become aware of his hands on my breasts and his shaft in my body, and how he was using them with steady, deliberate intent.</p> <p>I wanted it to stop. The way he worked inside my body, dragging the heaviness of himself out before driving it back in again, created a new degree of discomfort, not as injurious but just as unbearable.</p><p>He kissed my eyelids. \u201cLook at me, Charmian.\u201d When I did he moved faster, driving deeper. \u201cYou can feel it now.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, pushing at him. \u201cLeave off. I gave you what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did. Now this is what you will have in return.\u201d He propped himself up higher, spreading my legs wider so that the top of my sex lay open and exposed to the thrust of his. The knot of nerves there seemed to swell, and my body went liquid as the intolerable ache grew to a silent, wrenching agony.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t stop, he was never going to stop, and then something caught me, a dark and furious engine of pleasure and pain. I couldn\u2019t fight or think or free myself, and suddenly I didn\u2019t want to. Some terrible, glorious beast came to life inside me, one that roared in my ears and laved my skin, and wrapped around me, a demon from hell torching me alive; an angel enfolding me with the softest, silkiest of wings.</p> <p>Dredmore held me as I convulsed and murmured to me, words I didn\u2019t understand. His body became a merciless mech, hammering at me without stopping. Only when he went very still and said my name did I understand that his own beast was having at him.</p><p>I was convinced I couldn\u2019t move after that and felt grateful that he could as he turned on his side, his hand latched against my body to keep our parts meshed.</p><p>When he kissed my brow I actually stiffened, thinking there might be more and convinced it would be the end of me. But he only held me and stroked my hair back from my face.</p><p>He looked all over my face before he smiled. \u201cThank you, Charmian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, Lucien.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p> <p>\u201cIs it always like that?\u201d I asked him a little later as I let some strands of his hair sift through my fingers. \u201cOr are you insanely talented in this area?\u201d</p><p>His chest rumbled with a chuckle. \u201cNo, not insanely, and it is never like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to disagree.\u201d I snuggled closer to him. \u201cIf you\u2019d done this the first time we\u2019d met, I\u2019d have liked you much more.\u201d</p><p>He thought about it for a minute. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough room in the coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLust at first sight?\u201d I lifted my head. \u201cOn the Hill? For shame, Lucien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t on the Hill. You were standing in the fruit market. It was a Tuesday morning.\u201d His expression grew as distant and detached as his tone. \u201cConnell stopped to allow some goatherd to cross the street, I looked out, and there you were, haggling with an old woman over the price of peaches.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t recall the day, but it sounded like me. \u201cI haggle with everyone.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to hear me. \u201cThe sun was very bright that morning, so much so that I could see the motes of dust in the air, and the blemishes on every face. Except yours. Your hair seemed to soak up its radiance and pour it back out through your eyes and skin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou noticed me because I was glowing?\u201d I didn\u2019t know how to feel about that. \u201cMaybe you mistook me for a lamppost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a man of this world, Charmian. I know how relentless its indifference is. I solved all the mysteries of navigating through it long ago.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cOr I thought I had, until that moment I first saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were after my peaches,\u201d I tried to joke.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you\u2019d smell of them, or sunshine.\u201d He put his face in my hair and breathed in. \u201cTonight you\u2019re all over moonlight and roses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a rose hedge maze,\u201d I reminded him, \u201cunder a full moon. What were you thinking anyway, spying on me like that? Surely you had better things to do.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThat day I thought of very little, except the manner with which I could persuade you to get into my coach so that I might take you away with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have had Connell snatch me off the street.\u201d Then I remembered the time he had sent his driver after me, and reared up. \u201cThat\u2019s why you had him chase me down and gag me that day? So you could make off with me? You bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn that day I had every expectation of success,\u201d he said, \u201cuntil Connell informed me that the rear wheel rim that he\u2019d repaired with a mending spell that morning had for no apparent reason split in two.\u201d</p><p>A dim memory of hearing a sharp crack came back to me. \u201cThat\u2019s why you let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was when I realized what you might be. What I discovered you are.\u201d He ran his hand along my arm from shoulder to elbow and back again in a smooth, soothing caress. \u201cIt was maddening to watch you and know I could do nothing. A hundred years ago I could have claimed you that day in the market.\u201d</p><p>He referred to the old practice of freeclaiming, something caused by the shortage of women among the original colonies. In those days, any man could take an unprotected or abandoned woman from wherever he found her and with or without her permission put her into his household, where she would be subject to his will until such time as she married. No decent man wanted to take a freeclaimed woman to wife, however, so the abducted women were helpless to escape their captors. Fortunately, after the Uprising the Crown had discovered men keeping as many as two dozen freeclaimed women in their households. After hurriedly getting them married off, the authorities had promptly outlawed the polygamous practice.</p><p>\u201cHow romantic.\u201d That killed my mood as effectively as an ice bath, and I pushed his hand away.</p><p>He caught my arm again as I tried to rise, his touch less gentle. \u201cYou are not leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you know, keeping women against their will is now illegal, Dredmore. So is slavery.\u201d I reached for the remains of my chemise, examined it, and then tossed it aside. \u201cWhere the devil is my bodice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no longer safe for you in Rumsen.\u201d He fastened his trousers and stood, scanning the ground around us. \u201cI can only protect you from Walsh here at Morehaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Well, aside from the obvious.\u201d I shook down my skirts, straightened my waister, and spotted my bodice hanging from a lilac bush. \u201cWalsh can\u2019t have me arrested for being criminally cheeky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d Dredmore retrieved my bodice and held it out of reach. \u201cHe\u2019ll shut down your business, seize your property, and leave you penniless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forgot ruining my name,\u201d I said as I grabbed at my bodice. \u201cCome on, now, that\u2019s not fair. You\u2019re at least a foot taller than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything Walsh said and did tonight was only for show. There is something seriously wrong with the man.\u201d Dredmore held out the bodice like a nurse dressing a child, and I let him help me into it. \u201cHe knows exactly why his wife is being assaulted, but he hasn\u2019t put a stop to it for reasons I can\u2019t fathom. But if you\u2019re liable to stumble onto the truth, that makes you a liability he cannot afford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never stumble.\u201d I turned my back on him so I could fasten my own buttons. \u201cI investigate. The lady deserves to know why she\u2019s being tormented like this, especially with Walsh threatening to divorce her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen in Walsh\u2019s position do not take their wives to court.\u201d He picked up his cloak and wrapped it around me. \u201cThey arrange an unfortunate accident and, after an appropriate period of mourning, they remarry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t choose to marry him.\u201d I saw his expression and lost my temper. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Lucien. Diana Walsh is barely out of the schoolroom. She\u2019s shallow and brainless, but she\u2019s still an innocent person. Her people are all up near Settle. There\u2019s no one else to look after her.\u201d</p><p>He started walking me toward the gap in the stone wall. \u201cYou can\u2019t help her, Charmian. She was doomed from the moment she knocked on your door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you kidnap her and bring her up here, then?\u201d I strode ahead of him. \u201cWalsh has her well trained. She\u2019s lovely. Maybe you could teach her to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going in the wrong direction,\u201d he said, and waited until I came back to him. \u201cStay here with me, Charmian. It\u2019s the only way I can keep you alive.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore could be a deceptive, theatrical jackass, but he didn\u2019t fear anything. Now he looked afraid . . . for me.</p><p>I considered what I could do to protect myself. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the police. The chief inspector is the grandson of an old friend of my family\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou no longer have family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did once, but . . .\u201d I peered at him. \u201cWhy, you nosy sod. You had me investigated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral times,\u201d he said without a shred of remorse. \u201cAll my men discovered was that you are an orphan without money, people, or connections.\u201d His tone changed. \u201cI assumed that it would make things simpler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, you thought you could carry me off and no one would give a bloody damn.\u201d I was starting to hate him again, and as soon as we emerged from the maze, I turned on him. \u201cAll this talk of freeclaiming and kidnapping, as if I\u2019m some prized cow instead of a person. How do you sleep at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d He hauled me into his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re going to change that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>The kiss he gave me caused me to temporarily forget the various aches and pains afflicting me, and for a moment I allowed myself the luxury of imagining a life where I could have such kisses whenever I wanted them.
