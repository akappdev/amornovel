It didn\u2019t help; every muscle remained clenched. If there was another fucking way . . . But there wasn\u2019t, and he knew it. This was it.</p><p>His heart pounded as he pushed into the room. The fragrant, humid air wrapped around him. Everything smelled like her: spicy amber, sweet lilies. Beyond arousing. Like always, he turned hard and aching in an instant.</p> <p>God, he loved this woman.</p><p>Seeing him, she gasped and scrambled for her towel on the basin. He grabbed the damp terry cloth first, loving the hell out of her in nothing but a lacy, baby blue thong. Her smooth olive skin and lush breasts with those tight, rosy brown nipples tempted him like nothing ever had. The dark ropes of her wet hair dripped down her back, framing her freshly scrubbed face. He couldn\u2019t wait to get back inside her, to hold her again. Yesterday, she\u2019d been dealing with too much, so he\u2019d backed off, hadn\u2019t pressed his way into the snug, silken clasp of her pussy.</p><p>Tonight, all bets were off.</p><p>Realizing that he wasn\u2019t going to give her the towel and that he blocked the path to her clothes, Kata faced him squarely, chin raised. \u201cWhat now? I\u2019ve told you how I feel and what needs to happen. If you\u2019re here to stop me from leaving, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ah, that stubborn streak of hers that intrigued him so much. Normally, he\u2019d argue until he wore Kata down or seduce her until she gave in with a well-sated cry. This situation was far from normal. Until dawn, his most important role was to keep her safe. Nothing mattered more. Hunter had only one way left to do that . . . and give her what she wanted.</p> <p>It was going to tear his fucking heart out.</p><p>He had no illusions; he\u2019d never be the same. He\u2019d be every inch the miserable bastard his father had been for the last fifteen lonely years, that Logan was now. Hunter had always sworn he\u2019d do whatever it took to hang onto the one woman meant for him.</p><p>Goddamn it; in a handful of hours he\u2019d have no choice but to let her go.</p><p>Hunter crossed his arms over his chest, restraining the urge to embrace Kata, stroke her tempting flesh\u2014and never stop. \u201cFirst, if you go home, you\u2019re not only putting yourself in danger, but your family, too. You might not know everything about this asshole threatening you, but he knows you. Why wouldn\u2019t he come after those you love?\u201d</p><p>Kata\u2019s stubborn chin rose, but she nodded. Though she didn\u2019t want to, she saw his point. Now he had to put all his cards on the table, even though he had the losing hand.</p><p>\u201cI have a proposition, honey: Today, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to neutralize the threat against you. Tomorrow, you\u2019ll be free in every way.\u201d He clenched his fists. \u201cI\u2019ll sign the fucking divorce papers.\u201d</p> <p>As soon as he choked out the words, Hunter wished he could take them back. For him, she was it\u2014had been since the moment he laid eyes on her. He wished he could make her understand, but unless she came to love him in return, accept his needs and her own, they were doomed.</p><p>Surprise flashed across her face, along with something else\u2014regret, maybe . . . or was that his own wishful thinking?</p><p>She smoothed out her expression. \u201cTh-thank you for finally being reasonable.\u201d</p><p>Reasonable? In five seconds, she wouldn\u2019t think so. \u201cI\u2019ll do that, if you spend tonight with me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Saturday, six days earlier</p><p>THE first thing Hunter Edgington thought when he saw the laughing brunette across the crowded Vegas hotel suite, champagne in hand, was that he couldn\u2019t wait to fuck her.</p><p>His next thought was that it was a damn shame the curvaceous bombshell belonged to his former boot camp buddy, Ben.</p> <p>\u201cDoes she know?\u201d</p><p>Ben leaned against the wall and took the last swig of beer from his bottle, then yelled over the deafening party tunes. \u201cNope. Big surprise. She wanted to come to Vegas for her birthday and have her fantasy fulfilled. After the shit she\u2019s been through lately, when she requested . . .\u201d He let loose a beer belch, tossing his brown hair from his unfocused eyes. \u201cI delivered.\u201d</p><p>Maybe, but Hunter suspected Ben hadn\u2019t spilled the whole story. He\u2019d spent the last half-dozen years as a Navy SEAL and was still alive because he always listened to his gut. \u201cYou\u2019re okay with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ben slurred. \u201cFuck, she\u2019s hot in bed. Passionate. All that Latina blood.\u201d He leaned in and grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s a screamer and scratcher.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s words created a visual that had Hunter stone hard: himself with her, naked, slick with sweat. Her fuck-me mouth gasping his name. Her red manicured nails digging into his shoulders as he nuzzled her lush breasts. While pounding her swollen pussy relentlessly deep with his cock.</p><p>He wanted that\u2014and would do whatever necessary to make it happen.</p><p>The brunette was deep in conversation with a slightly older Hispanic woman and two twentysomething twigs in stilettos with fake blond hair and equally fake breasts. They made him yawn. But she . . .</p><p>As if sensing his stare, the gorgeous woman looked up. Their gazes locked. Oh, yeah. She exuded sex appeal with all the subtlety of a flashing red light.</p><p>Instinct jabbed his gut with a full-throttle attraction that raced through his veins. Damn, she was beautiful. Tangling his hands in her dark silk hair as he claimed her mouth and body\u2014all while cuffing her helplessly to his bed\u2014would be worth whatever it took to get her there. Even twenty feet apart, they generated combustible heat that singed him down to his balls. It was beyond chemistry. At thirty-two, Hunter knew the difference. He didn\u2019t merely want her; he wanted to unravel her, figure her out, possess her.</p><p>Why was that?</p><p>She looked at her companions briefly, then back to him. Hazel, mossy green laced with deep brown. Stunning against her hint-of-olive complexion. Another shock of awareness blasted through him. Her wide smile fell slowly. She held his stare, drew in a trembling breath. Her pulse fluttered at her neck. Her pink tongue peeked out, swiping across her plump lips.</p><p>Everything about her breathless expression told him that she felt the heat between them. Good. Because this goddamn searing lust made him wonder if he could ever sate his hunger for her, much less in a single night.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d He had to know, ached to.</p><p>\u201cKata.\u201d Ben slurred. \u201cShort for Katalina, but she hates it. I call her that when she pisses me off, but then she calls me Benjamin and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Hunter didn\u2019t need to know the ins and outs of Ben and Kata\u2019s relationship. He already envied the bastard like mad. \u201cBoundaries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, man. Whatever she wants.\u201d</p><p>Idly, Hunter wondered if Ben realized that, without limits, he was going to be fucking lethal. Requesting leave from his team after being shot, Hunter had nothing more to do for a week than rehab his shoulder and devote himself to seducing Kata. But since he and Ben hadn\u2019t spoken much in the last few years, it was clear the guy had forgotten his ruthless side.</p><p>And why warn the competition? Hunter suspected he might lose a buddy over this girl. Poaching wasn\u2019t his style, but for her, he\u2019d bend the rules.</p><p>He gazed across the room again at Kata, who sneaked another glance at him from beneath a thick fringe of lashes. Her nipples beaded as she held his stare. Satisfaction rippled through him.</p><p>Last warning ... \u201cYou\u2019re a very generous boyfriend. Are you sure you want to share?\u201d</p><p>Ben reared back in surprise, staggering drunkenly. \u201cKata\u2019s not my girlfriend, dude. She\u2019s just a friend with benefits. She knows I fuck other girls.\u201d</p><p>Evil glee wound through Hunter\u2019s system. Just a friend? Hunter vowed those benefits Ben received now would be very short-lived. He would be more than happy to start scratching Kata\u2019s itch.</p><p>\u201cShe fuck other guys?\u201d</p><p>Lurching over to the six-pack on the nearby bar, Ben grabbed another brew and pried it open. \u201cNot lately. Too busy.\u201d</p><p>This just got better and better. \u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a probation officer for Lafayette Parish. Works fuckin\u2019 terrible hours with the dregs of society. Been dealing with death threats lately, she thinks from a foot soldier in the Gangster Disciples. He got probation for a first-time drug trafficking charge, and she reported him for not checking in.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s gut clenched. Hearing about anyone being unduly threatened pissed him off, and it took a special kind of chickenshit to threaten a female. This particular asswipe made every combat-trained cell in Hunter\u2019s body want blood. \u201cThey arrest the motherfucker?\u201d</p><p>Ben shook his head. \u201cThey got a warrant out. Kata\u2019s tough.\u201d Ben sent him a lopsided grin. \u201cAnd she looks hot in a business suit with all that long hair in a prissy twist . . . Hmm.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Hunter could picture peeling away a hip-hugging skirt and a papery-thin blouse, working his fingers through her hair until it hung thick and wavy as it did now. Tearing away her exterior until all she wore were stockings, stilettos, and a welcoming smile.</p><p>But before he indulged, he had to ask the question that bothered him all the way to Vegas. \u201cWhy ask me to join you?\u201d</p><p>Ben actually looked surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re like ice, man. Slick. You always fuck and leave. Perfect for a m\u00e9nage.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that had always been his MO in the past. Now? He suspected things had changed\u2014in the last five minutes. His gut was telling him that he wanted more from Kata than a good fuck. Figuring out what, exactly, was Hunter\u2019s first goal. Making sure she wanted far more than a single night was his second.</p><p>\u201cM\u00e9nage is her fantasy, huh?\u201d He smiled. \u201cGame on.\u201d</p><p>At least until he changed the rules.</p><p>\u201cWHO is that?\u201d Marisol asked, raising a dark brow as she stared at the tall, hard-bodied stranger Ben talked to.</p><p>The stranger who kept staring.</p><p>Katalina Mu\u00f1oz had wanted the answer to her sister\u2019s question since he walked in the door as dinner ended a few minutes ago.</p><p>Nervously twisting her silver ring on her finger, she tore her gaze away, back to her older sister. \u201cYou don\u2019t know? You didn\u2019t invite him?\u201d</p><p>Marisol shook her head. \u201cThe only person I invited myself was Mam\u00e1.\u201d</p><p>And they both knew that their stepfather, Gordon, would never allow their mother to leave the house merely to have fun. Why wouldn\u2019t she divorce the controlling son of a bitch?</p><p>\u201cThe way that blond guy looks at you, I can tell he\u2019d like to know you much better,\u201d her friend Chloe murmured. \u201cDamn, he\u2019s hot. He looks built, like he could kick even a pro wrestler\u2019s ass.\u201d</p><p>In total agreement, Kata stared at him some more.</p><p>Guys like him\u2014gorgeous, well built, carrying an aura of danger that made her shiver\u2014rarely went for girls like her, a little tall, a little on the plus side. But he\u2019d hardly looked at anything or anyone else since stepping into the room.</p><p>\u201cWill Ben be angry?\u201d her sister asked in worried tones.</p><p>How did one tell her conservative, very married older sister that she and Ben were merely fuck buddies? Nope, not going there. \u201cWe aren\u2019t exclusive, Mari.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to get to know that guy.\u201d Chloe sighed. \u201cBut clearly, you\u2019re the only woman he\u2019s interested in tonight. Happy birthday to you, chica!\u201d</p><p>Amen. Almost twenty-five, single, and happy, why shouldn\u2019t she enjoy a few hours with a guy like him? Sure, Ben was here, but given all the girls he nailed, he would understand. And have no problem finding companionship for the night.</p><p>Unless Ben had invited this stranger to her party for . . . Oh dear God.</p><p>Even the possibility made her heart pound and everything below her waist want to tango.</p><p>\u201cSo no one knows who he is? This is my specialty. I\u2019ll get deets,\u201d her other friend, Hallie, promised with a sly grin. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>Kata downed the last of her champagne and met the stranger\u2019s blue stare again, repressing a shiver. She knew just by looking at him that, whatever his reason for being here, he had sin on his mind.</p><p>As promised, minutes later, Hallie returned after working the room, and she looked ready to burst. \u201cOMG! You will not believe this.\u201d</p><p>Kata\u2019s stomach danced with anticipation. Was he married? A male stripper? \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s here. Still working that angle. Apparently, he met Ben in boot camp eons ago. His name is Hunter. He\u2019s from Texas, and he\u2019s a Navy SEAL on leave after being recently injured. A real badass, by all accounts.\u201d</p><p>She had no trouble believing that. His don\u2019t-fuck-with-me air reached across the room. He had sharp eyes and an unforgiving chin, made more rugged by two days\u2019 worth of stubble. Dark blond hair cut military short, harsh jawline, corded neck, veined forearms and wrists. Everything about him conveyed stark power.</p><p>Damn, he filled out the shoulders of his gray T-shirt like nobody\u2019s business. The bulges of his pectorals and the ridges of his abdomen stood out, tempting her to tear the shirt off and run her fingers, her tongue, all over that amazing flesh. Jeans hugged his narrow hips and long, lean thighs. And in between . . . She swallowed. Even across the room she could tell he was hard. And still staring at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah? I\u2019m feeling pretty badass myself.\u201d She tossed him a flirty gaze.</p><p>Chloe handed her the untouched glass in her hand. \u201cTake this. And go get him.\u201d</p><p>Kata knocked it back in a few swallows. Here goes nothing. \u201cThanks. I will.\u201d</p><p>As she approached, Hunter\u2019s blue eyes heated, focused on her like a laser. Ben turned and looked at her with an unfocused stare. Her friend was shitfaced? Damn, he was always a sloppy drunk.</p> <p>Hunter\u2019s hands were empty, and she picked up a beer from the cooler as she sauntered closer on her high heels, accentuating the sway of her hips\u2014and never taking her eyes off him.</p><p>\u201cThis is the birthday girl,\u201d Ben slurred.</p><p>\u201cKata, is that right?\u201d Hunter asked.</p><p>Even his voice made her quiver. Beyond deep, husky, with a bit of a snap, demanding an answer. He looked even bigger up close.</p><p>Kata forced herself to stop all the wicked thoughts in her head\u2014at least long enough to reply. \u201cYes. And you\u2019re Hunter?\u201d</p> <p>His mouth curled into a grin. \u201cCurious enough about me to learn my name?\u201d</p><p>Of course. And if he wanted to flirt, she was all in. If he wanted more . . . she was definitely entertaining the notion. The thought of all that barely leashed power plunging into her made her hot and shivery.</p><p>Kata just smiled. \u201cSo what were you two talking about?\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s crooked smile split his all-American boyish face. \u201cThat we\u2019re going to fuck you, Kata. And that you want it.\u201d</p><p>Heat detonated right between her legs. Ben was right; she\u2019d had this m\u00e9nage fantasy for years. The thought of a lover and a stranger of his choosing touching her with their hands, pleasuring her with their cocks, drove her out of her mind. Ben, a good friend since he\u2019d moved into her apartment complex two years ago, had promised to help fulfill her fantasy. As he\u2019d said, what were friends for?</p><p>She could have been embarrassed at Ben\u2019s drunken bluntness, but at least tonight\u2019s agenda was out in the open. Why cower behind false modesty? But Kata was desperately interested in Hunter\u2019s opinion on the matter. From beneath dark lashes, she saw that he looked supremely pleased. And a sweeping gaze down told her that his cock was still like granite. No reason she wouldn\u2019t finally get her wish tonight.</p> <p>\u201cHappy birthday to me.\u201d Kata winked and handed Hunter the beer. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a drink. Will this do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I have a bottle of water somewhere.\u201d He looked at Ben\u2019s bottle. \u201cYours is empty. Here you go, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He ripped off the cap, guzzled half the bottle, then burped loudly. \u201cI gotta pee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d Hunter suggested with a repressed smile, then sent her a hot, lingering stare. \u201cI\u2019d like to dance with the birthday girl. Get to know you.\u201d</p><p>God, every time this man opened his mouth, her stomach fluttered. Stupid teenagerish reaction, given her very adult thoughts about him. But Hunter totally did it for her.</p><p>Before she could say a word, he curled an arm around her, his palm at the small of her back. That small touch was a jolt, and her entire body lit up like a supernova. She bit her lip to hold in a gasp as he led her to the corner where the amazing views of the Vegas Strip at sunset went on forever. A few nearby partygoers swayed in time with the sultry music. Then Hunter stepped closer, an olfactory aphrodisiac of musk, wood, summer rain, and pure male all mixed. He pressed his body flush to hers and left her no doubt how badly he wanted her.</p><p>Kata sensed he\u2019d have no trouble delivering everything she\u2019d ever yearned for . . . and more.</p><p>Chapter Two</p> <p>HUNTER pulled Kata closer. As the crevices and swells of their bodies slid perfectly together, his every muscle tightened with need. Pillowy breasts on his chest, her slightly curved belly warm against his own, and lush hips filling his hands. It didn\u2019t seem possible, but being this near her made him even harder.</p><p>Something about this woman flipped his every switch, and now that he had her close, desire detonated inside him with all the explosiveness of a megaton of TNT. He wanted to strip her bare, taste every inch of her skin, lay his scent on her. But he didn\u2019t just want to fuck her. He also wanted to know Kata, build her trust. Seduce her until she submitted completely.</p><p>For years, he\u2019d known submissive females willing to succumb to his any and every dominant desire. He\u2019d known intelligent, vibrant, multilayered women with whom he connected intellectually. Unfortunately, he\u2019d never found both in the same person. He sensed that, in Kata, he finally had.</p><p>With her, his usual rules of engagement didn\u2019t apply, and his normal disinterest in something that lasted more than a few hours didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>The moment he\u2019d touched her, something inside him had jarred, then settled in place. He\u2019d known she would be his.</p><p>Hunter blew out a deep breath. Wow, he\u2019d never felt this way, not even remotely, for any woman. He\u2019d never imagined feeling this instant certainty. But just like his gut feeling about tangos on a mission, he wasn\u2019t questioning himself. It just was.</p><p>In case Kata didn\u2019t feel the same urge for something long-term just yet, he\u2019d keep that under his hat, but already he was fascinated. He couldn\u2019t wait to figure out exactly why he was going to love her. No doubt, he would have to scramble fast to hook her as deeply as she\u2019d already sunk her claws into him. No way was he letting her go.</p><p>Suddenly, Hunter couldn\u2019t wipe the smile off his face. Despite his recent hell, life was looking up.</p><p>Across the room, Ben emerged from one of the suite\u2019s bathrooms, grabbed another bottle of beer, and watched them with a glassy, puzzled stare. Yeah, he supposed Ben wasn\u2019t used to seeing him dance or chat with women he took to bed. Usually, Hunter made time with them because they understood the score, so there was nothing left to do but drop clothes and get busy. Vaguely, he wondered if Ben would be pissed that Kata was different for him . . . but the possibility didn\u2019t bother Hunter enough to change course.</p><p>Another group of friends clapped Ben on the back, distracting him. Hunter relaxed. Now, Kata\u2019s attention would be all his.</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re a SEAL,\u201d she murmured, her voice low, a little husky. \u201cRecently injured?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced at the memory of a bullet ripping through him three weeks ago, in nearly the same spot he\u2019d suffered a similar gunshot wound only a few months prior. That night still bothered him . . . It almost seemed as though that fucking Venezuelan arms dealer, V\u00edctor Sotillo, and his hit men had known of his prior injury and had aimed accordingly.</p><p>\u201cYes. He put a bullet in my shoulder, but I planted mine in his chest, so I think I got the better end of the deal.\u201d</p><p>Kata gaped. \u201cDid he . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDie?\u201d Hunter nodded. \u201cAs we were extracting, his pals were performing CPR, but intel was that he didn\u2019t make it. Good riddance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally bad guy. Sadistic and out for a buck, no matter how many died in the process.\u201d Or how much it destroyed what little peace the world possessed.</p><p>\u201cWow. And you were on a mission? Where?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, ignoring the twinge in his sore shoulder. \u201cI can\u2019t say. Classified. But mission accomplished. The bastard played a mean game of hide-and-seek. Too bad for him I\u2019m very persistent. And patient.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, and Hunter wondered if she was getting the clue that those behaviors would apply to her as needed. If not, she\u2019d figure it out soon.</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be Stateside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother week. You might be able to motivate me to stay longer.\u201d Nothing coy about the sexy grin that broke out across Kata\u2019s face. She stared from beneath thick lashes, her teeth biting into her lush lower lip. He could imagine how she\u2019d look cradling the width of his dick in that very spot.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . . If you decided to stay, what makes you think I\u2019d be motivated to spend more time with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, if you aren\u2019t, then I\u2019m doing something wrong, and I expect you to kick me to the curb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . .\u201d She shivered and ran her hands up his arms, then clasped her hands together behind his neck. \u201cA pleaser. I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to please you.\u201d He bent and nuzzled her neck, his mouth a whisper from her ear. \u201cIf you like that idea, we\u2019ll get along real well.\u201d</p><p>Against his chest, Hunter felt her nipples harden even more, and he\u2019d bet every dime he had in the bank that she was wet. Ready. Still, he waited. Need tightened in his balls, and he forced back his impatience. What he wanted from her would take time and trust. This was too delicious to rush.</p><p>He fell back on small talk. \u201cYou\u2019re a probation officer, according to Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, for the last two years. I love working with the people who have misstepped and genuinely want to change their lives. Some have just made a wrong choice and need the right tools or a little self-confidence. It\u2019s great to make a difference.\u201d</p><p>Hunter liked her all the more for wanting to. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re damn good at it, too. You\u2019ve got a no-nonsense way about you, but I\u2019ll bet you make it go down smooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, a pleaser and a charmer. This might be my lucky night.\u201d Her kittenish laugh made him sizzle.</p><p>Hunter had to bite the inside of his lip to stop himself from kissing her here and now. Her lips, so red and glossy, were only inches away. Pouty. Sweet. He wanted that mouth under his, wrapped around his dick, open as she screamed through the orgasms he gave her.</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019ve had some work-related trouble lately.\u201d</p><p>Kata wrinkled her nose. \u201cCortez Villarreal is a piss-ass street thug who assumes that, because I\u2019m female, I\u2019ll be easily cowed or bend to his threats. Not gonna happen. I\u2019ve learned how to fend for myself, and there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to scare me from doing my job just because he tosses out some nasty threats.\u201d She snorted. \u201cThe prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe do anything more than threaten?\u201d He had to suppress the growl from his voice.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but his warrant has only been out for a week. As the police and bounty hunters start closing in, he\u2019ll send some of his lowlifes to do his dirty work. Whatever. In both my purse and my apartment, I\u2019m packing. So I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Though Hunter didn\u2019t like the idea of Kata having to defend herself, the fact she was hell on wheels and didn\u2019t show fear turned him on even more. He hadn\u2019t expected this tough attitude from such a soft, curvy woman, but it made him even more eager to cement something with her. And confirmed his suspicion that there was more to this woman beneath her very pretty surface.</p><p>\u201cSomeone teach you to shoot?\u201d He curled his hand around her hip, enjoying the hell out of touching her curves.</p><p>She rubbed against him, settling closer. \u201cMy older brother. He used to be a New Orleans cop before Katrina. He lives in Houston now, doing undercover work. We haven\u2019t heard from him in nearly a year, but last time he blew through town, he made me brush up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about hand-to-hand?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cI need to work on that. So far, I\u2019ve relied on knees to the groin and a few pressure points that will take a man down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me never to piss you off.\u201d He palmed his way down her ass and copped a quick feel.</p><p>Lush. Perfect. Taking her from behind was going to be a sweet visual treat. Getting deep inside her there would be even sweeter.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that to you?\u201d</p><p>Kata circled her hips against him. A rush of tingles spiked down his cock and spread all through his body. Her stare singed him with sexual challenge. And damn if he wasn\u2019t going to take her up on that ASAP. Christ, he wanted to eat her up. Hunger clawed at him, relentless, so much deeper than anything he\u2019d ever known. This mattered because, already, she mattered.</p><p>\u201cWell, I suspect you\u2019re a vixen, and I\u2019m not always the easiest guy to get along with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I kneed all that great equipment . . .\u201d She trailed her fingernails right down the line of his spine, and goose bumps broke out over his skin. \u201cWouldn\u2019t I be cutting off my nose to spite my face?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI like the way you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me more about you.\u201d</p><p>Hunter wasn\u2019t convinced her mind was on the small talk. He was certainly making a concerted effort to concentrate. Getting to know her was important. She was no meaningless fuck, and he wanted her to know it from the start. As hard as he was for her right now, he liked her. Respected her moxie.</p><p>\u201cMy father, whom we affectionately call the Colonel, retired from the army, so he was pissed when my younger brother and I both joined the navy and became SEALs. Logan will be on leave soon, too. I\u2019ve also got a younger sister who lives with her husband in Lafayette and is expecting her first baby soon. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLafayette? I live there. My mother and stepfather still live in the same house I grew up in. My older sister\u2014the one glaring at us\u2014that\u2019s Marisol. She lives a few blocks from my folks with her husband and boys. I already told you about my older brother. I\u2019m the baby.\u201d Her head cocked to the side, and her sinful fa\u00e7ade aside, intelligence gleamed in her hazel eyes. \u201cWhat about your mom?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The one subject he didn\u2019t discuss with anyone. Ever. Her question had merely been an attempt to be polite, so he didn\u2019t feel obligated to answer.</p><p>He swayed against her, palming her nape, brushing his lips over her cheek\u2014all the way to her ear. \u201cIs that what you really want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>Kata sighed and slipped her hand under his T-shirt, and she scratched her nails lightly down his back, lighting him up like a Fourth of July fireworks show. Impatience to touch her, to spread her out and please her, flayed him.</p><p>He whispered his lips across her neck, a slow tease. Almost a kiss . . . but not quite. She gasped and tilted her head back, exposing the graceful arch of her throat to him. A sign of surrender that had his dick tightening, weeping for more.</p> <p>With a growl, he rocked his erection directly against her pussy. She went utterly boneless against him. Her lips parted on a moan.</p><p>\u201cOr do you want to talk about how I\u2019m going to fuck you, Kata?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you and Ben?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for him. But I know what I\u2019m going to do to you.\u201d</p><p>She met his stare again, now growing bolder. \u201cNice that you have plans. But you should be wondering what mine are.\u201d</p> <p>Boldly, Kata pressed her mouth over his, kissing him. Her pouty lips molded to his, incredibly soft yet demanding, a hard brush. Then she eased back, a tease\u2014there and gone\u2014leaving behind a hint of her flavor, hot and intoxicating and impossible to pin down. Instantly, fire raged through his body, and he grabbed her tighter.</p><p>She ended the kiss with a husky laugh that scraped down his spine.</p><p>\u201cKata,\u201d he breathed in warning.</p><p>A brazen smile flitted across her mouth. She knew she was stringing him out, grabbing him by the dick and not letting go. He liked this playful side of her, so he let her lead\u2014for now.</p><p>She rose on her tiptoes, closer, as she feathered her mouth over his again. Grabbing his arms, she deepened the kiss, her tongue like a butterfly, fleeting, flitting, elusive. She tasted like cherries, a hint of tequila, and pure sin. She made him so fucking hard.</p><p>When she broke away, Hunter looked up. Kata\u2019s sister frowned, but her girlfriends were smiling from ear to ear. Ben, still surrounded by buddies and nursing another beer, looked at them with an uncertain scowl. Hunter danced her farther away from them all, closer to the windows with the stunning views of the Strip just lighting up for the night.</p> <p>Shoving all the bystanders out of his mind, Hunter thrust both hands into that dark, silky hair twisting down Kata\u2019s back and tugged gently until her neck arched for him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing dangerous games with me.\u201d</p><p>A smug, sexy smile curled her fuckable lips. \u201cI can handle you.\u201d \u201cYou should find out what games I like before you get too confident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He stared right into her dilated eyes, took in the pulse beating at her neck. And he smiled. \u201cI\u2019d rather show you.\u201d</p><p>Hunter took control and unleashed the force of his kiss on her, past her lips, into that cherry-tequila mouth, to tangle his tongue with hers in a sensuous dance. He demanded. Took. Followed the clues she gave him, those little gasps and shivers that told him what she wanted. Then he delivered.</p><p>Still eating at her mouth, Hunter grabbed her wrists and clasped them together with one unyielding hand at the small of her back. He bracketed her thighs with his own and pressed against her\u2014chest, belly, hips. He urged her back to the wall, holding her completely immobile.</p><p>She gasped, and he swallowed the sound with another kiss. Fuck, yeah.</p> <p>His body shook with the need to strip her bare, fuck her mindless, master her utterly. As brutally sexy images flooded his mind and her flavor intoxicated him, she wiggled one hand free and slipped it between them, wrapping her fingers around his cock. And then she gripped. Need tore through Hunter. He gritted his teeth, swallowing back a hiss\u2014and shoved her hand behind her back once more.</p><p>Kata was accustomed to taking charge. She wouldn\u2019t cede control to him easily, but he was determined and patient. He relished a good challenge. And he wasn\u2019t going to quit until she surrendered completely.</p><p>AFTER blowing out her candles, Kata set in to celebrate. Evening turned to night as she chatted, danced, and burned with the knowledge of the pleasure yet to come.</p><p>Two hours later, the cake was decimated, and most of the revelers had gone back to their rooms or out to gamble. Kata swallowed back her fourth margarita of the night, feeling more than a bit euphoric. But since a girl didn\u2019t turn twenty-five every day, tipsy was okay in her book.</p><p>Behind her, Hunter still stood very close, his hand slung on her hip. His body heat permeated her sweater and little black skirt\u2014 while his stiff cock pressed into her ass. Everything about his stance screamed possession, and she kind of liked the thought that he wouldn\u2019t let her go until he was satisfied that he\u2019d taken her as thoroughly as a man could. With Ben\u2019s help, of course.</p><p>Since their dance, Kata had found it difficult to focus on anything other than getting the clothes off Hunter\u2019s hard body and finding out just how capable he was of making her feel good. So why the hell had he cheered Ben on when her friend with benefits had suggested a drinking contest with another one of her neighbors?</p><p>For that matter, what was Ben thinking? This frat boy shit bored her. She\u2019d never seen him down a six-pack like this. Why tonight?</p><p>\u201cGo, go, go!\u201d the small crowd surrounding them chanted, comprised of Ben\u2019s opponent\u2019s girlfriend and brother. Hunter remained silent.</p><p>Four minutes into the challenge, both opponents ripped open a new beer, Tim his fourth, Ben his fifth. They guzzled.</p><p>Two long minutes later, Ben belched and held up his sixth empty beer. \u201cDid it!\u201d</p><p>That, coupled with the copious amounts of beer and vodka he\u2019d been drinking for the past few hours, made Ben a very drunk guy. His speech was slurred, and his limbs moved like wet noodles. Kata sighed and got up to make coffee. If he was going to be useful in helping fulfill her fantasy, she had to sober him up now.</p><p>His opponent, Tim, slammed his half-full bottle down. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m getting too old to drink anyone under the table.\u201d He sighed, then turned to his girlfriend with a scowl. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>After Tim grabbed his girlfriend\u2019s arm and stomped out the door, his brother, Trey, hugged her. \u201cHappy birthday, Kata. I hope it\u2019s a great night.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the thirtysomething cop. \u201cThanks for coming to Vegas to celebrate with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd miss a kick-ass weekend? Never!\u201d He flicked a gaze over at Hunter. \u201cYou okay for the rest of the night, or you need me to stay with you?\u201d</p><p>Translation: Are you okay with this stranger?</p><p>No one knew Hunter much except Ben, who had assured her that Hunter was a great guy with a boatload of medals. But even if the sexy soldier hadn\u2019t been a SEAL, Kata sensed that, while tough, he was good people. With his power play of a kiss earlier, he\u2019d proven he had an uncompromising side. Then again, so did she.</p><p>Kata smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Go enjoy the rest of your night.\u201d</p><p>Trey shrugged. \u201cI got a hundred-dollar chip from Caesars burning a hole in my pocket.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and waved the trio out, then locked the door behind her and made her way to the suite\u2019s little kitchen. Hallie and Chloe had left a few minutes ago to seek out single, gorgeous males for the night. She\u2019d catch up with them on their flight home tomorrow morning. Marisol had gone back to her room shortly after Kata had blown out her candles. The mommy of two rambunctious school-age boys wasn\u2019t used to late-night parties anymore.</p><p>So she, Ben, and Hunter were finally alone in the suite. Now the real fun could begin. After coffee.</p><p>She started the brew, then fished around the cabinets for mugs. Suddenly, she turned, and Hunter stood right there. She yelped. \u201cOh . . . You scared me. Don\u2019t sneak up on me like that!\u201d</p><p>A ghost of a smile played across his mouth. \u201cSorry. Can I help you with something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thanks. You want a cup?\u201d She gestured to the coffee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good for now. You need one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t actually drink it.\u201d She looked out into the suite\u2019s living room at her slouching friend. His eyes were at half-mast. \u201cBut Ben looks like he could use it.\u201d</p><p>Ben sat up and barked, \u201cI don\u2019 want no fuckin\u2019 coffee. I\u2019ve just been waitin\u2019 for ev\u2019rone to leave so we could fuck. You still game, Kata?\u201d</p><p>God knew she\u2019d wanted a m\u00e9nage forever. People did it and enjoyed it, from what she\u2019d heard. She knew she\u2019d feel the same.</p><p>But Ben was flat drunk. She\u2019d never known his equipment to stop working, short of deep slumber, true. And she liked him, even if it was more as a friend than a lover. No denying that he was good in bed.</p><p>Hunter? Just being near the man made her tremble all over. Over the last few hours, she\u2019d begun to sense that he was more than intense. That he crossed the line into forceful, maybe even controlling. That should send her running fast and hard. Given her family history, the idea of putting herself in the path of a domineering jackass terrified her. But Hunter just made her embarrassingly wet.</p><p>If she passed on this opportunity now because the situation wasn\u2019t perfect, would this chance\u2014or a man like Hunter\u2014ever come her way again?</p><p>In a few dozen steps, Kata could be face-to-face with her biggest fantasy, if she just walked down the hall to the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game.\u201d She drew in a shaking breath and met Hunter\u2019s blue gaze. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Every time she looked at him, she went a bit more breathless. He was gorgeous, but she didn\u2019t feel this way with every gorgeous guy she met. It was him. He rolled up like a quiet storm, all cool and collected, but inside, barely leashed power filled him. Kata wanted to be the one to undo all that.</p><p>\u201cI came here for you. I\u2019m nothing but game, honey,\u201d Hunter drawled.</p><p>\u201cThen . . . I guess we should go to the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight!\u201d Ben rose to his feet, stumbled.</p><p>Hunter caught and steadied him, while gesturing down the hall. Ben lurched, walking unsteadily forward. Still, he managed to bounce from one wall to the other like a pinball on the boards. She watched, biting her lip.</p><p>Hunter approached her, his hot palm at the small of her back. \u201cSecond thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m worried about Ben.\u201d</p><p>He gripped her shoulder, squeezed. \u201cIt\u2019ll all work out. C\u2019mon.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, figuring she was wasting time worrying about what might happen. Right now, she had two hotties willing to fulfill her fantasy. Why worry about anything?</p><p>Exhaling away her tension, Kata sauntered toward the bedroom, anticipation simmering inside her. And not just from the fantasy itself. She was familiar with Ben; they\u2019d fallen into a twice weekly routine, so she knew exactly what to expect from him. But Hunter . . .</p><p>She cast a glance at him, and her breathing hitched. He sent her a slow smile that dripped sex. Kata looked forward to him. He\u2019d likely drive her insane with the sort of pleasure she\u2019d only ever imagined. She couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>\u201cIf you move that pretty ass faster,\u201d Hunter drawled, \u201cI\u2019ll get my mouth on your pussy faster.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach flipped over, and their gazes connected. Her breath caught. Oh, holy shit. He meant that.</p><p>She nearly ran the rest of the way to the bedroom.</p><p>Inside, against the backdrop of glittering Vegas night sky, Ben was already shedding his clothes, shirt half unbuttoned, one shoe on, the other off. The fly of his jeans and his eyes were both partially open.</p><p>After she drew shut the heavy hotel drapes along the south side of the room, Hunter took her cue and closed those along the east wall, shrouding the room in almost total darkness. Which brought her a measure of comfort. As a plus-sized girl, she liked her curves, but if her lover didn\u2019t, she didn\u2019t want to know. She preferred to leave the lights off. Ben had never minded.</p><p>Hunter flipped on the bedside lamp, and a white glow encircled the bedroom\u2019s huge king-sized bed. She hesitated, then crossed the room and switched it off, leaving them in shadow. \u201cI\u2019d feel better . . .\u201d</p><p>Even in the semidarkness, she sensed his displeasure. Kata found herself regretting that. Why should she care what he thought? He\u2019d be gone by morning. And she\u2019d always been determined to please no one but herself. The minute a guy showed any sign of trying to pull controlling macho bullshit, she got out quick. Hunter hadn\u2019t said a word, but somehow, she knew that he wanted to see her exposed to his gaze. Vulnerable. The thought terrified and aroused her at once.</p><p>\u201cKata, I need help,\u201d Ben called.</p><p>Relieved to have something else to focus on, she dashed to his side, helping him off with his other shoe. \u201cYou really tied one on tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, don\u2019 be pissed off. The guys challenged me, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you weren\u2019t smart enough to turn them down, even when you knew you\u2019d win? Seriously, Ben.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019m a dipshit.\u201d Pulling off his shirt, he sent her a lopsided grin.</p><p>Kata couldn\u2019t help but smile. Even drunk, he was self-deprecating and funny. And true-blue. Impossible to hate, even if he wasn\u2019t showing his good side tonight.</p><p>\u201cYou are. You\u2019d better not ruin my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, didn\u2019 I bring you someone?\u201d He gestured vaguely in Hunter\u2019s direction as he pushed his jeans around his ankles. \u201cHe\u2019s done this before. And the girls who worked the bars near the RTC where we went to boot usta ooh and aah about him. I brought you the best. Happy birt\u2019day.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter had experienced a m\u00e9nage before? Her gaze zipped across the room to him. What little she could see of Hunter\u2019s expression neither confirmed nor denied Ben\u2019s claim . . . but she didn\u2019t imagine for an instant that he\u2019d been a choirboy.</p><p>So \u201cyes\u201d was a safe assumption.</p><p>His experience should have made her feel better. He\u2019d know what to do, how to minimize any awkwardness and maximize the pleasure. But instead of feeling relief, the truth irritated her. Of course she wasn\u2019t special to him. He hardly knew her.</p><p>But logical or not, she wanted to be special. Or maybe she simply wanted the event to be special. Yeah, that made more sense.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about this?\u201d Hunter asked, approaching her, his hand brushing over her hip\u2014and sending tingles down her spine.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I asked for a m\u00e9nage because I wanted it. Nothing has changed.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cSo let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy kinda girl!\u201d Slivers of moonlight peeked through the drapes, enough to see Ben leer as he shoved the bedspread aside and kicked off his boxers. He bounced onto the bed, then lay flat across the mattress. In quick work, he started stroking his cock. \u201cI\u2019m waitin\u2019 . . . Why don\u2019t you strip for us?\u201d</p><p>Strip for them? Even if it was mostly dark in the room, she was a little self-conscious. Ben knew that. Why the hell was he pulling this shit? Because Mr. Budweiser was doing his talking for him.</p><p>Kata opened her mouth to call him on it when Hunter leaned in and whispered, \u201cWant help?\u201d</p><p>Impossible to pass that up. Anticipation gripped her stomach in a vise. \u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p><p>God, she sounded every bit as breathless and eager as she felt.</p> <p>\u201cVery happy to,\u201d he murmured against her neck.</p><p>His voice vibrated inside her, and she quivered as every syllable crashed through her system. Damn, this man was potent. He knew just what to say, what to do, how to make her crave his next move. She wasn\u2019t sure she liked being so unbalanced around him. Sexually, yes, more than she wanted to admit. But being independent to the core, she refused to do anything but meet him on equal footing.</p><p>Smiling, Kata reached behind her and folded her palm over his hand. With her other, she pushed her red sweater up a bit, then guided his palm right over her breast. Even through the lace of her cups, his touch was electric. His fingers scorched her. With a catching little gasp, she melted against him.</p><p>Hunter cupped her breast, testing its weight, thumbing her nipple through the lace. Her head fell back on his shoulder, and she let out a full-fledged moan.</p><p>\u201cFrom the bit I can see, that\u2019s hot. Get her clothes off, man,\u201d Ben barked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking it easy here. Going slow . . .\u201d Hunter soothed Ben\u2019s belligerent demand. Then he turned his attention back to her.</p><p>He kissed his way across her shoulder, one hand cradling her hip. She barely had time to process how good his touch felt before he smoothed his palm up her waist, swept across her back, then pushed her sweater over her head. He threw it at Ben.</p><p>A moment later, her friend let out a drunken holler. \u201cWhowee! That\u2019s it. Get her bare. My dick is aching.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter didn\u2019t say a word. Instead, he caressed her shoulders, then lower, before easing her bra from her body. Her large breasts hung heavy, aching, tips tight and sensitive. Then Hunter\u2019s palms were beneath them, lifting, thumbing, creating a new scatter of tingles everywhere. The ache between her legs had been a dull throb since their dance, but now? It had become a needy, demanding pang, made worse as Hunter pinched her nipples.</p><p>\u201cI would love to see you bare for me. Panting. Wet. Eager. Even the thought of it turns me on more than I can tell you. You\u2019ll let me leave the light on and see you that way?\u201d</p><p>It was a question . . . yet not. The command was subtle, but there. Normally, she balked when told what to do, but hearing the hunger in Hunter\u2019s voice made her yearn to arouse him more, whatever it took. \u201cMaybe . . . if you admit that I\u2019m making your dick ache, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you have no idea.\u201d She felt him smile against her neck, just as he raked his thumbs across her nipples again. \u201cBut I\u2019ll do my best to show you.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her wrist and led it behind her, right over his cock. What she\u2019d suspected from her earlier stolen grope confirmed her suspicion. He was both very hard and sizeable\u2014and surpassed her expectations. Taking every inch of him would be a tight fit, and Kata wanted him inside her so badly, she was nearly ready to beg.</p><p>Her stomach tightened, rolled. He was good. Really good. Had she ever wanted it so badly, even though he\u2019d done nothing more than kiss and pet her? No.</p><p>Kata moaned. \u201cHunter . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff with this skirt,\u201d he murmured against her skin.</p><p>She nearly protested when he nudged her hand from his cock, but he set to work on her zipper. The light rasp of the little teeth filled the room, along with the sound of her own rapid breathing.</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Ben hollered. \u201cShe\u2019s got gorgeous thighs. I want them wrapped around my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience,\u201d Hunter scolded. \u201cShe\u2019s not even undressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need help hurryin\u2019 that up?\u201d Ben raised himself from the bed.</p><p>\u201cNo. Stay there.\u201d</p><p>The sharp command, though not directed at her, made Kata snap to attention ... and caused her to ache in a way she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>With a little tap on each leg, Hunter prompted her to step out of her skirt, then threw it at Ben, who caught the little leather garment\u2014her silly birthday indulgence. \u201cOh, this feels good on my dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mess up my skirt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen hurry, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what color panties you have on,\u201d Hunter whispered in her ear as he felt his way across her hip. \u201cI can feel that they\u2019re lace, but innocent white? Black, to match your skirt? Red, because you\u2019re daring and naughty?\u201d</p><p>His fingers crept slowly, ever closer, to the juncture of her thighs. Kata\u2019s knees went weak. Dear God, please let him touch me there . . .</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting . . .\u201d Hunter\u2019s fingers hovered a fraction above her mound, the heat from his flesh burning\u2014but the absence of his caress was killing her.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d She pressed her hips forward, but he evaded her, giving her the promise of a touch but never delivering.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>His demand pinged through her like a live wire. A jolt. A flash of desire. \u201cHot pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d In reward, Hunter slid his fingers under the elastic of her little panties and brushed his fingers over her clit.</p><p>Her breath stopped, literally, and her heart drummed madly as he rubbed a teasing circle at the top of her pussy, right where she needed him\u2014but not hard enough to send her over the edge. Her clit swelled. She sucked in a hard breath as the ache gouged her belly.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear you beg when you really mean it.\u201d His fingers feathered over her clit again. \u201cAnd you will.\u201d</p><p>Something about Hunter\u2019s tone told Kata that he wasn\u2019t just playing dominant games. He wanted to control her tonight. Kata bit her lip at the realization. Warning bells rang in her head . . . even as she melted against him. She gasped at the sensation that washed over her like hot rain. Looking for an anchor in a sea of drowning desire, she reached out for him, clung to his thighs, her back tight against his chest.</p><p>This was insane. She didn\u2019t give this much of herself or her control away\u2014ever. Kata knew painfully well exactly where allowing a man to control her would end. She had to find the voice to tell him her limitations now. Equals all the way or she didn\u2019t play. But his touch on the hard, swollen nub, delving deep into her moist folds, was blinding, magical, as damn necessary as her next breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet. Perfect,\u201d he purred.</p><p>\u201cHunter,\u201d she panted. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014ooh!\u2014beg. I\u2014I\u2014\u201d She gasped. \u201cI don\u2019t submit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t,\u201d Ben slurred.</p><p>Her flesh tingled, burned. Orgasm was right there, and the only thing standing between her and it were his fingers. Still, she couldn\u2019t let this slide.</p><p>Gritting her teeth against the pleasure, she reached for her stern voice. \u201cNo man commands me. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me time,\u201d he murmured against her ear, making her shiver again. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Before she could protest, he lifted her, cradling her in his arms. Shock tumbled through Kata. Carrying a plus-sized girl to bed? Hell, no! Hunter could feel the effect of every tamale, every bite of chocolate, every day she\u2019d overworked and been too late to hit the gym. . . .</p><p>\u201cPut me down!\u201d</p><p>Instead of complying, he raised her higher until his lips hovered over her own. \u201cTrust me, Kata. I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Hunter snorted. \u201cNot likely, honey.\u201d</p><p>Before she could argue, he covered her lips with a hard kiss. Kata linked her hands around his neck and clung for dear life, expecting to have her ass meet the carpet at any moment. Instead, he sauntered across the room like he didn\u2019t have a care. Soon, she felt the mattress and slightly stiff hotel sheets against her back.</p><p>\u201cAll better?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo. You didn\u2019t listen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>Ben crawled across the bed to them. \u201cFinally!\u201d</p><p>Kata felt a hand slap down on her stomach and flinched. Was it terrible to admit that she almost didn\u2019t want Ben here? Not in his current state, anyway. Normally, they had fun and laughs, but tonight . . .</p><p>\u201cGimme those luscious tits,\u201d her friend demanded, his hand working up until he grabbed a breast and used it as a guide to pull himself closer. His mouth drifted across her shoulder, teeth slightly nipping. \u201cYou always taste good.\u201d</p><p>Ben licked his way to her nipple, and she settled into the bed, trying to relax. She was naked, he was there, and . . . where was Hunter?</p><p>No sooner had she wondered than she felt the bed dip at her feet. Two hot hands clutched her panties and dragged them down her legs. Then his fingers curled around her ankles and urged them wide apart.</p><p>As it had every time Hunter came near, Kata\u2019s stomach tightened and her heart galloped like a herd of wild horses. She offered no resistance as he crawled between her thighs and breathed right over her slick folds.</p><p>He brushed his thumb over her clit, and she sucked in a huge draft of air, fisting the sheets. Ben took that as a cue to suck the other nipple into his mouth, and before she could process the feeling and the rough slide of his teeth, Hunter dragged two fingers through her slick valley, then pressed them inside her deep. Almost instantly, he found a magically sensitive spot and rubbed. Arousal soared through her. She gushed, cried out, spread her legs wider, and lifted her hips in a silent plea for more.</p><p>\u201cYa likin\u2019 this, Kata?\u201d Ben asked, dragging his tongue over her nipple.</p><p>Before she could answer, Hunter rubbed that one spot again, unmercifully, and settled his tongue over her clit, slow and sweet, like he had all day.</p><p>Kata couldn\u2019t find her voice except to whimper as pleasure bombarded her and the need grew from an ache to desperation.</p><p>\u201cGuess that\u2019s a yes.\u201d Ben\u2019s laughter rumbled as he kissed a wet trail down her neck and flicked her wet nipple.</p><p>She barely noticed. She was too busy drowning in pleasure as Hunter\u2019s lips wrapped around her little bundle of nerves and pulled it into the heat of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cFuck, where\u2019re the condoms? Shit, left \u2019em in the john,\u201d Ben groused as he got off the bed, crashed against the wall, and stumbled to the adjoining bathroom.</p><p>Kata felt a guilty relief that she and Hunter would be alone for a few moments, and she sank back into the unending pleasure of his touch. He toyed and explored, wringing gasps and whimpers from her, driving her up higher . . . but always dangling her orgasm out of reach.</p><p>Seconds\u2014minutes?\u2014later, she heard a soft buzz and stiffened. What was that noise? Everything was still close to dark. Kata frowned. Had Ben never turned on the bathroom light?</p><p>Kata felt around on the bed beside her, but the mattress was empty. Was he still in the bathroom? Was that noise him . . . snoring? It sounded again, a light sawing, followed by a harsh exhalation. Ben had freaking passed out? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hunter never missed a lick.</p><p>\u201cWait! Ben . . . Do you\u2014? Ohh . . . oh God, that\u2019s good.\u201d She fisted the blankets. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>Instead of granting the orgasm shimmering just beyond her reach, he pulled back, teasing her.</p><p>Ben snored once more, and Kata tried to pull away. But Hunter held firm, his huge, hot palms holding her thighs open, wedging his shoulders between, his mouth hovering right over her pussy, silently promising ecstasy.</p> <p>She tried to block it out. \u201cStop. I\u2019m telling you that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen is snoring?\u201d</p><p>On cue, her friend\u2019s buzzing sounded again, this time deeper, longer.</p><p>\u201cYeah. We should wake him and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not necessary tonight, Kata. Want me to prove it?\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>HUNTER didn\u2019t have to prove anything. He merely whispered in that sinful voice what she already knew: She wanted him far more than she\u2019d ever wanted Ben. She\u2019d had this fantasy of being touched by both her lover and a stranger forever and a day. But here, now, her panting breaths mingled with Hunter\u2019s, his unrelenting stare reached through the shadows, promising searing pleasure. Despite her misgivings about his bent for control, Kata wanted him. Badly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she whispered, raising her hips.</p><p>He hesitated, then levered himself up to shut the bathroom door\u2014blocking out Ben\u2019s soft snores. He lowered himself to the mattress again, hovering over her, his stare drilling into her in the shadows. \u201cI\u2019m going to take you alone tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRepeatedly,\u201d he vowed.</p> <p>Her breath caught. Desire branded his masculine face as his hot palm caressed her breast, the curve of her waist, before settling inside her thigh\u2014skating heart-stoppingly close to her pussy. And then he stopped. As she strained toward him, her ache ratcheted up.</p><p>He seemed to know exactly what drove her mad.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking to me.\u201d His husky murmur whispered across her skin.</p><p>\u201cTell you what I want in bed?\u201d Kata had no doubt he was capable of giving it to her.</p><p>\u201cThat, and more. I want you to be completely open to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexually?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn every way.\u201d His eyes were solemn, startlingly direct.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat. Kata pulled her lip through her teeth and peered up at the hard, shadowed angles of his face. \u201cWhat is it you want, exactly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll you\u2019re willing to give me.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cAnd probably more.\u201d</p><p>Those murmured words raised all of her red flags. What did he want beyond passion? Surely not more than a night of pleasure with no regrets. They\u2019d been ridiculously in sync so far.</p><p>Maybe hinting at possessiveness was his shtick. Maybe he thought women dug it. Whatever . . .</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll agree to everything, but if you do something I don\u2019t like, we\u2019ll talk it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His fingers tightened on her thighs. He pried them apart a bit wider, then wriggled down her body. His mouth loomed closer to the ache she desperately needed him to sate. \u201cKata, I will push you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the bedside light?\u201d Kata frowned. Would he still want her if he actually saw all her curves?</p><p>\u201cFor starters.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cHunter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, honey.\u201d</p><p>The way he called her \u201choney\u201d made Kata shiver. Usually, she hated that endearment, but the way he said it . . . hmm. Then the rest of his words registered in her lust-ridden brain. Trust him . . . with what? Was he trying to tell her that he was into some freaky shit? He\u2019d done m\u00e9nages before. What else did he have in his repertoire?</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know how your preferences run, but I have a few boundaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d He breathed against her stomach, pressing mindstealing kisses to her skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really afraid of knives.\u201d</p><p>His husky laugh warmed her. \u201cNo knives. I\u2019m hard-core, not weird.\u201d</p><p>Kata relaxed. Maybe she was overthinking this. \u201cI don\u2019t like pain.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shrugged and trailed his fingers through her very wet pussy. \u201cYou\u2019ll only get the good kind from me. The last thing I want to do is hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cLook, in case you didn\u2019t get it earlier, I won\u2019t be dominated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>His voice reassured her more than his words, but he hadn\u2019t done anything to give her pause, other than put out a dominant vibe. She\u2019d run across that before and walked away unscathed. She could handle Hunter, too.</p><p>Kata shot him a cocky grin and let her knees relax to the sides, widening her thighs. \u201cOkay, then. Do your worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d he chided, his gaze fused on hers. \u201cDon\u2019t doubt me. I will.\u201d</p><p>Before she could reply, Hunter bent to her again. He slid those long, still-slick fingers inside her, thumb grazing her clit just before his mouth took over. He sucked her slowly, a nuzzle, a gentle lick. A tease. She tensed, stared at him.</p><p>Hunter oozed confidence\u2014and not just in bed. The man was clearly intelligent. Interesting. Dangerous. His touch gliding over her skin felt gentle . . . but his stare told her that he wasn\u2019t going to go easy on her tonight. Even the thought made her quiver.</p><p>He pressed firm fingers to her G-spot, and the question dissipated. Any cool perspective she\u2019d gained in the past few moments . . . gone. His bold licks made her dizzy, and he savored her swollen bundle of nerves\u2014and sent her reeling.</p><p>God, he was good at this. Really good. If she tightened or gasped, he did more of whatever drove her mad, then found unpredictable ways to make it even better. A light scrape of fingernails into the nerve-laden tissue in her channel, teeth tenderly grazing her ultrasensitive clit, sliding the pad of his thumb through her slick flesh, down, until he pressed in at her back entrance.</p><p>\u201cNo. Hunter, I\u2014oh. Ah . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about whether you should like it,\u201d he whispered against her inner thigh. \u201cThink only about whether you actually do.\u201d</p><p>Deeper, deeper, he eased his thumb into her backside, parting her flesh in a sting of pleasure that made her gasp. No one had ever touched her there. Ben had talked about wanting anal sex once or twice, and she\u2019d always shied away. But now . . . A million tingles she\u2019d never felt leapt to sizzling life, coupling with the quivering, begging sensations in her pussy.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>Kata gave him a shaky nod. \u201cBut I don\u2019t understand . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust feel.\u201d</p><p>With that, he settled his mouth back over her clit, dragged his fingers relentlessly over the responsive spot inside her, and swiveled his thumb in her depths.</p><p>Hunter touched her as if he had already figured her out and now sought to use that knowledge to blow her mind. Maybe maintaining control wouldn\u2019t be as easy as it had always been . . . Her heart pounded, galloping so hard and loud, she couldn\u2019t hear anything but its roar. Her own moans rang in her ears. How could he both thrill and terrify her at once?</p><p>Her fingernails dug into her palms as the pleasure he gave rushed toward her like a towering tsunami. Kata had no doubt it would drown her. But she couldn\u2019t stop wanting it, crying out for it. Time stood still as she held her breath and waited.</p><p>Pressure tightened and burned under his fingers, multiplying, then rocketing until she felt as if her body would burst. Kata\u2019s back arched, her hips lifted, with the body-bending force of the orgasm. She screamed his name. Stars burst across her vision as ecstasy crashed over her. And Hunter\u2019s unrelenting focus on her with every touch of his fingers, every flick of his tongue, drove her deeper into the abyss of a pleasure so overwhelming, Kata wondered if she\u2019d ever be the same.</p><p>Finally, her breathing evened, her heartbeat slowed. Only then did Hunter rise from the bed. Before she could stop herself, Kata whimpered at his loss. But when he took a step, she knew his destination.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t turn on the light. I don\u2019t like . . .\u201d God, even finishing that statement was too revealing.</p><p>\u201cBeing seen?\u201d He flipped on the lamp as if she hadn\u2019t spoken.</p><p>Kata blinked against the harsh light. Apprehension seized her. He could see how thoroughly he\u2019d devastated her by the flush that must surely be reddening her cheeks, by her swollen nipples and so-wet pussy. A look of dazed satisfaction, no doubt, filled her face. His blue, laser-focused stare peeled back her layers to see deeper still. She closed her eyes, but it was too late to hide.</p><p>In that suspended moment, Kata\u2019s stomach tightened. How had Hunter reached inside her, stripped the veneer of confidence from her, and dug down so quickly to the vulnerable woman beneath? The fact that he had, it terrified her. She didn\u2019t reveal that inner person to anyone, especially someone she barely knew.</p><p>With a curse, Kata rolled away, turning her back to him.</p><p>Hunter clamped a hand down on her thigh, another on her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t hide.\u201d</p><p>Before she could argue, he braced himself over her thighs . . . and fixed his gaze on the heavy curves of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stare.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest and looked away.</p><p>Moving his weight onto his knees, he clasped her wrists and imprisoned them above her head gently\u2014but firmly. \u201cThat\u2019s like telling me to stop breathing. Impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I didn\u2019t want the light on. I don\u2019t want your eyes taking a walk all over me. Now get the hell off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want me to see you?\u201d</p><p>How pushy was this guy going to get? \u201cGoing down on me doesn\u2019t entitle you to an answer. Turn off the fucking light. I don\u2019t like being stared at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. If you didn\u2019t want men to look, you wouldn\u2019t have been wearing a black leather miniskirt or that attention-getting red sweater that was like a second skin. You wouldn\u2019t have that luscious gloss on your lips or the bright polish on your toes. You wanted to be seen at your party. But you\u2019re afraid for me to see you naked. Why?\u201d</p><p>Kata blanched, her heart stuttering. He had noticed way too much.</p><p>She tried to calm herself with logic. So far, he\u2019d made observations, asked a few questions, pressed a little\u2014not behaved like a world-class asshole. He wasn\u2019t as loudmouthed as her stepfather, Gordon. That calmed her some. Taking back control would do the rest. Because whatever he was trying to pull, she wouldn\u2019t be playing. \u201cEither turn the lights off or let me up.\u201d</p><p>He made no move to comply. \u201cDid some prick criticize your body?\u201d</p><p>Only her whole life. It wasn\u2019t any one prick in particular. Starting with Sean Lampke in the second grade and moving right up to football jock Mike McKindle in high school. Not that any of them had seen her naked, but all the teasing, especially after her breasts had developed in the fifth grade . . . Their opinions didn\u2019t matter. She was proud of herself. Fuck them if they didn\u2019t like her. But opening herself up to Hunter? She didn\u2019t do that for anyone.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you after?\u201d she challenged. \u201cThis is a one-night stand, and you don\u2019t need to know my innermost secrets for that. If you want me, then turn out the damn light and let\u2019s fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKata, I need to see you. All of you. I want to watch your face as I slide in deep. I want to see your lashes flutter closed and your skin flush as your arousal surges, right before your pretty hazel eyes flash wide open and orgasm slams through your body.\u201d His eyes darkened with arousal. \u201cI won\u2019t let you hide from me, honey.\u201d</p><p>There it was again: honey. The way he spoke to her made her sizzle. She shouldn\u2019t like that dominant tone of voice that went with it, shouldn\u2019t feel tingles down to her toes. Damn if he wasn\u2019t everything she shouldn\u2019t want.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t let me?\u201d she parried. \u201cYou came here to share me with Ben, then encouraged him to drink until he was too wasted to participate. Now you\u2019re trying to strip me of far more than my clothes. I barely know you. This control freak routine you\u2019re pulling? It\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>His lips curled up, and it couldn\u2019t exactly be called a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re tough on the outside. But inside, there\u2019s a vulnerable woman. And there are times, like now, that you hate it. You don\u2019t want anyone to see anything but your independent fa\u00e7ade. You\u2019re adventurous\u2014when it suits you. You have a lot of friends but aren\u2019t really close to anyone. You don\u2019t like being told what to do, especially by a lover. Kata, I\u2019m going to be the man who changes your mind. About everything.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped, even as goose bumps broke out all over her skin. God, Hunter had read her perfectly. He was clearly used to sucking in the universe, examining it, then bending it to his will. She\u2019d bet he did it as naturally as breathing.</p><p>Anyone like that wasn\u2019t for her, no matter how big a thrill he gave her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s arrogant. I won\u2019t just . . . roll over and play dead. You\u2019re not dictating to me. You know what?\u201d She pushed against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m done here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t budge, just held her still and sent her a considering look. \u201cThe last thing I want you to do is roll over and play dead, honey. Where would be the challenge in that?\u201d</p><p>Her temper surged. He wanted to bring her to heel with his wit and his body for some sick thrill?</p><p>Kata bucked and wriggled, trying to displace him, to no avail. \u201cGoddamn it, get off me. I\u2019m not a fucking prize to win or some mountain to conquer so you can prove to yourself that you\u2019re the man. I told you I\u2019m done.\u201d She shoved at his chest. \u201cGet the hell off!\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s face softened. He trailed the back of his fingers down her cheek, his stare disturbingly intimate. \u201cI don\u2019t want to win you like some cheap prize at a county fair to prove my masculinity. I want to be with you\u2014all of you. Just like I want you to be with all of me. I\u2019m stripping myself bare, too.\u201d As if to prove his point, he ripped that torso-hugging charcoal T-shirt over his head.</p><p>A hard ripple of mouthwatering abs gave way to pecs that made her fingers itch to touch him, followed by imposing shoulders that would eclipse a room the second he mounted her. That fact made a twisted part of her tremble with a secret thrill\u2014and it bothered her more.</p><p>\u201cTaking your shirt off is nothing compared to the way you\u2019re trying to bare my soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a first step, honey. Believe me, I want you to know me inside out, too. Feel comfortable with me.\u201d</p><p>Kata frowned as she turned the words over in her head. \u201cThat . . . takes time. Don\u2019t you get the meaning of \u2018one-night stand\u2019? It\u2019s just tonight, so none of this getting-to-know-you shit matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. I want you to want me, trust me. And for you to give me every part of you that you\u2019ve never given any other man.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind\u2014because clearly, he had. \u201cYou don\u2019t want much, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m asking for a lot. Give me a little tonight, Kata. I\u2019ll earn the rest.\u201d</p><p>His every word boggled her mind. Earn the rest, like he wanted not only to control her, but to own her? \u201cI don\u2019t get you. I\u2019m willing to fuck you. For most guys, that\u2019s enough. A little mutual pleasure and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I met you, yeah. Now?\u201d Hunter shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m going to be totally straight up. I\u2019m not willing to settle for less than everything.\u201d</p><p>His gaze told her that he was dead serious. She swallowed, her mind racing. They\u2019d just met. This made no sense. Whatever. Just because he wanted something didn\u2019t mean it was going to happen. No way was she allowing him control of this situation or her.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t roll that way. A simple romp between the sheets, great. But this . . . wanting me to give you permission to own me, or whatever . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m no man\u2019s possession.\u201d</p><p>He considered her for a long while as the light from the bedside lamp burned over her shoulders, breasts, and nipples. Hunter stared fixedly, and Kata knew he could read her anger, uncertainty, and arousal simmering under her skin. The mix was a powerful cocktail of emotions.</p><p>She really wanted to look away, but damn if she\u2019d give him the satisfaction of flinching first. But the longer their gazes clashed, the more her insecurities rose. Tears\u2014honest to freaking goodness tears\u2014burned her eyes, damn it. She had no idea where they\u2019d come from, other than this horrible sense of exposure, of vulnerability, but no way she would reveal how much he rattled her.</p><p>Kata didn\u2019t know him well, but she suspected he was formulating some plan designed to have her eating out of his hand. Since he\u2019d zeroed in on domination, one of her most potent fantasies\u2014and her biggest fears\u2014Hunter was off to a frighteningly good start.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve asked for a lot,\u201d he murmured roughly, making her hormones weep with need. \u201cI\u2019m willing to spend the time to earn your trust and show you what I\u2019m made of. I\u2019ll be totally honest about who I am and what I want. Can you?\u201d</p><p>Everything inside her clenched with desire. \u201cI\u2019m just here to scratch our mutual itch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what? We\u2019ll just go our separate ways? That\u2019s what you really want?\u201d</p><p>Kata opened her mouth to say yes . . . then realized that, despite everything, the idea of their paths never crossing again disturbed her\u2014far more than it should. Why? He was urging her to surrender more than her passion, cross a line she\u2019d refused to ever go near, no matter how tempting. And part of her fantasized about things she could never endure. If she admitted half so much aloud, Hunter would engulf her\u2014and right now, she was too raw, too needy to stop him.</p><p>But she\u2019d offered to fuck him the simple way multiple times and he hadn\u2019t taken her up on it yet. If she wanted him\u2014and she did, desperately\u2014she must pretend to play his game.</p> <p>As much as she hated to admit it, he intrigued her, sucked her into a drowning pool of desire. Walking away right now wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>\u201cHow about this? For the next hour, I\u2019ll be honest.\u201d She gritted her teeth and forced the words out. \u201cBut if I say stop, you stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour?\u201d He didn\u2019t sound pleased.</p><p>Kata nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019re getting from me. Maybe, after that, we\u2019ll both be done, and it won\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t hang your hat on that, honey.\u201d</p><p>For a long moment, he said nothing, and she stared up into his unwavering blue stare. Earlier his eyes had been shutters that allowed fleeting glimpses of the real man to peek through, veneered by challenge and hunger. Now he\u2019d opened up. The desire was still there, but she read something almost profound on his face. This was important to him. Why? A guy like Hunter would\u2014and probably did\u2014have anyone he wanted. Why would she matter when they\u2019d just met?</p><p>Whatever . . . He was a birthday fling she\u2019d forget tomorrow. She hoped.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAn hour, for starters. I want you to see me.\u201d Hunter stood and reached for the button of his jeans, slid his zipper down, toed off his boots, then shoved everything off to the thick carpet in a pile. And Kata got her first look at him naked.</p><p>\u201cOh, holy shit.\u201d The words slipped from her mouth before she could stop them.</p><p>Hunter was, in a word, gorgeous. Every inch of him solid, hard, imposing. Big . . . everywhere. She swallowed.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cGlad you approve. I\u2019m going to make this so good for you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t doubt for an instant that he could.</p><p>Hunter slid back onto the bed, over her body, balancing most of his weight on his knees and elbows. Then he settled right between her thighs, chest to chest, belly to belly, lips inches apart. As she\u2019d suspected, he eclipsed the rest of the room, leaving her nowhere to look but at him. His stare melted into hers. He wasn\u2019t yet inside her, but already Kata felt breathless, overwhelmed.</p><p>With a dip of his head, he covered her mouth with his own, a firm press, a gentle demand. She opened to him, and Hunter sank in with a groan that lit her up and sizzled all the way to her toes. His tongue curled around hers, holding her a willing captive to his seduction.</p><p>Just as she opened wider, he edged away, nipped at her lip, drizzled kisses down her neck so sweetly that she moaned and shuddered, clung to him and arched.</p><p>Suddenly, Kata realized Hunter was far more dangerous than she\u2019d believed. He would use his knowledge of her body and her pleasure to lure her deeper under his spell. Control her. Apprehension burned a hole in her belly.</p><p>\u201cWait, Hunter, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour.\u201d The intensity in his gaze made her tremble. \u201cI\u2019m not wasting another minute of it arguing.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do a damn thing without breaking her word. As much as he alarmed her, she refused to show fear.</p><p>Another part of her couldn\u2019t stand for him to stop touching her. He rubbed the pad of his thumb over her lip. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking gorgeous, honey. It\u2019s going to be my pleasure to prove to you that an hour isn\u2019t nearly enough.\u201d</p><p>A mix of thrill and foreboding zipped through her. God, he made her shiver.</p><p>Hunter eased down her body and latched onto her nipples. Kata gasped. They\u2019d always been sensitive, but now? He nipped, sucked, licked, scraped, laved until she threaded her hands over his head, frustrated that his hair was too short to grab in her fists. She wailed, the sound high-pitched and desperate. Hunter didn\u2019t stop, just worked his palms farther down her body as his mouth worshipped one nipple, then the other, over and over.</p><p>The ache between her legs ramped up again. She arched toward him as more moisture seeped from her core. He must know how wet she was. Surely, he could feel it. But he merely continued his single-minded, voracious devouring of her nipples. They swelled, turned tingly-sore, felt so, so hard that it was a pleasure in itself. Still, he didn\u2019t let up, didn\u2019t veer.</p><p>With every lick and nuzzle she fell a bit more under his spell. \u201cOh God. Damn! Hunter . . .\u201d She clamped onto his bulging biceps, her nails digging into his skin.</p><p>He shuddered and sucked harder. \u201cThese are incredible.\u201d He lapped at the stiff points, taking turns making them even more rigid, more sensitive. \u201cI\u2019m never going to get enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you like it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question; he knew. \u201cThey will be sore tomorrow,\u201d he murmured like that pleased him. \u201cBut every time your shirt brushes these beautiful, swollen nipples, you\u2019ll think of me.\u201d</p><p>Shit, she would. And given how devoted he\u2019d been to the two little buds, she would be thinking of him often. That gave him a whole new level of power over her. Still, she didn\u2019t want him to stop. Foolishly, she bowed her back in offering, settling her nipple deeper into his mouth . . . knowing she\u2019d pay for her weakness tomorrow.</p><p>Hunter smiled against her skin and cradled the mound in his hand, thumbed its side in a slow stroke. Then he bit down tenderly on the rigid tip. And her arousal surged, so close to the edge . . .</p><p>Kata panted as lightning pulsed between her legs, leaving her on the edge of orgasm. \u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking a good first impression.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>She wanted to hate him for forcing this surrender on her, but she needed this climax more. He\u2019d made sure of that, pressed and pushed and tempted her until she had nowhere to hide, nothing to do but beg with her body and incoherent words.</p><p>Lips parted, breath held, she waited for Hunter to suck her nipple into his mouth again. But he didn\u2019t. He stared instead, his eyes gleaming like a predator about to move in for the kill.</p><p>Apprehension jammed in her throat. No matter how much her body wanted this, she couldn\u2019t lie back helplessly and allow him to call all the shots. He\u2019d overwhelm her. Consume her.</p><p>Kata swallowed down her need and reached out to him, wrapped her fingers around his thick cock. His whole body jolted as if he\u2019d been shocked. But surprise charged through her as well. He was so big and alive in her hand, full of life, pulsing. Velvety hard. Addicting.</p><p>He gritted his teeth. His shoulders tensed, fists clenched. Oh, yeah. She\u2019d put him on the edge, and a thrill shivered through her. But damn, driving him to the brink was driving her closer to her own.</p><p>\u201cKata . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me, feel me. I want to do the same to you.\u201d Slowly, she stroked her hand up and down the long shaft, thumb brushing the slightly slick tip, then cascading down the sensitive underside.</p><p>His strong jaw worked, as if trying to speak was beyond him. She smiled. This was more like it. Now she was in control. After all, why should she be the only one undone tonight?</p><p>\u201cThat feel good to you?\u201d She sat up and purred against his chest. Then she slid her free hand under his testicles, cupping, rubbing, gently kneading. She definitely had his attention, especially when she spread kisses across his collarbones, down his pectorals. He tensed. Kata tongued his nipple, turning up the heat. \u201cYeah. It does, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>In her hand, his cock stiffened even more\u2014along with his whole body. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Kata gave him a throaty laugh and pumped him faster in her hand, licked furiously at his nipple, reveling in sweet victory rippling through her. But it was short-lived.</p><p>Hunter grabbed her wrist and thrust it away from his cock, then drew in a shuddering breath. Threading his fingers through her hair, he wrapped the thick strands in his fist, tugging just hard enough to snap her head back\u2014and force her to take his heavy stare. His expression was nothing short of a silent, sensual warning.</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>Hunter reached to the floor and grabbed something that disappeared into his hand. A second later, he ripped open a small foil packet with his teeth. Single-handedly, he rolled a condom on, starting at the angry tip of his heavy cock prodding at his belly insistently, all the way down to the root surrounded by dark hair.</p><p>Anticipation and anxiety lanced through Kata, tightening her stomach. God knew how far Hunter was going to push her. Yet she was beyond aroused, ready to feel him stretching her, getting deep, stroking slow, giving them both mind-bending pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a growl, he pushed her on her back. She bounced against the mattress once before he was on her, sliding against her wet folds, his lips at her ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to get so deep inside you, honey. You\u2019ll give me all of you, and I\u2019ll give you everything you need.\u201d</p><p>His words made Kata fear he\u2019d settle for nothing less than her soul.</p><p>She looked him in the eyes and shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll fuck me. I\u2019ll let you. End of story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he said cryptically.</p> <p>Then her thoughts scattered as Hunter began to penetrate her, scraping along every one of her throbbing nerve endings with a molasses stroke in, designed to devastate. No way she could stop herself from lifting her hips greedily to him. She threw her arms around his neck, biting her lip to hold in her moan. She knew it would sound like surrender.</p><p>They\u2019d barely started, and it already felt too much like surrender.</p><p>Hunter stopped his endless glide into her suddenly, and her entire body tensed in denial. Kata lifted her gaze to him, questioning, hoping like hell that he couldn\u2019t see her silent begging.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding back. Open that pretty mouth. Give me that moan, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fuck me.\u201d</p> <p>He eased out of her weeping entrance. \u201cAre we going to have this conversation again? You know what I\u2019m going to say.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she did. And she already knew he was patient and controlled enough to withhold his own pleasure to prove a point. Damn it.</p><p>\u201cYou promised you\u2019d give me everything for an hour,\u201d he reminded. \u201cYou\u2019ve got forty-four minutes left.\u201d</p><p>Hell, she had promised, and she wasn\u2019t the kind of person to renege. She always let it all hang out with Ben, never had an issue if he wanted to take the lead. But Hunter? He was more potent. A frightening thrill. He got to her, and she wanted the pleasure he gave her so desperately. The decision to give in should be easy.</p><p>But in the back of her mind, she kept wondering . . . If she surrendered, could he take some part of her that she\u2019d never get back? No way was she walking a mile in her mother\u2019s shoes.</p><p>Hunter stared, waiting for her response. Either she had to shut up and put out or walk away now.</p> <p>She\u2019d split as soon as it was over. No after play, no cuddling or conversation or round two. She\u2019d get up, get dressed, and get out\u2014before he could do more damage.</p><p>With a sigh, she trailed kisses along his hard shoulder, nipping at its bulging cap, dragging her nails down his back.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d With a fist in her hair, he brought her face within inches of his and fused their gazes together. \u201cI\u2019m done talking now. I\u2019m just going to show you what I want from you.\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t he been doing that already with his lips, his fingers, his molten touch?</p><p>Kata drew in a shaky breath as Hunter lowered himself to her again and began sliding his cock inside her, one torturous, hard inch at a time, reigniting her need.</p><p>Her fingers tightened on him. A little gasp escaped her as he pushed his way in slowly, awakening more tingles. They shivered down her spine, boiled her blood.</p><p>When Hunter shoved the last few inches into her ruthlessly, reaching deeper into her than any man ever had, her gasp became a moan\u2014in the sound of his name.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, honey. Feel me.\u201d</p> <p>As if she could do anything else . . .</p><p>He swiveled, rotating and flexing his hips, catching a bevy of sensitive spots inside her, connected like a chain. Touching one ignited the others, and suddenly, she was on fire. Unable to stop herself, her fingers curled into his flesh, nails digging. He tossed his head back with a groan she felt all the way to her pussy.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d He bit the sensitive spot where her neck and shoulder joined, nipped her lobe, kissed his way to her mouth, and devoured her.</p><p>Even as her mind railed against it, her body unfurled to him. Her lips parted further to taste him again, her back arched up to invite him closer, her legs spread wider to welcome him deeper. He took her up on every unspoken invitation, cementing the connection of their mouths until she knew his intrinsic taste, until he flexed his hips and her nails dug urgently into his back, until he gripped her hips so he forged even deeper.</p><p>Hunter was everywhere, every sight she could see, every scent filling her nose, every flavor on her tongue. And as he tunneled down again to the hilt and he filled all her empty space, he became every sensation she felt. He was everything she\u2019d ever thought of, ever fantasized about.</p><p>Like a force of nature, he overwhelmed.</p><p>With a hot palm, he caressed her face, his lips pressing with finessed demand. Mindlessly, she opened, and he captured her mouth. Hiding was no longer an option, so she threw herself completely into the kiss, into meeting each spine-melting stroke into her aching pussy.</p><p>\u201cHunter,\u201d she panted.</p><p>Sweat broke out along his forehead, at his temples, across his back. His body tensed, his cock hardened. And still he consumed her at that controlled pace that drove her mad.</p><p>\u201cYou feel perfect, Kata. So slick and tight. I\u2019m never going to want to leave.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, she could never imagine being without him. That fact would scare the hell out of her at some point, she was sure. But now, she just drowned in pleasure . . . and wondered how she\u2019d ever forget a man who\u2019d so thoroughly jacked up her pleasure\u2014and gotten inside her head. After her earlier killer orgasm, she\u2019d expected to find reaching climax again somewhere between difficult and impossible. Losing control once was hard enough for her, but twice? With Hunter, that wasn\u2019t a problem. Already need clawed through her until all she knew was that little spot he prodded over and over with the tip of his cock and her own impulse to hold him closer.</p><p>God, everything inside her was awake and attuned to him. The salty-musky taste of his skin coated her tongue as she laved his shoulder. His husky murmurs filled her head as he encouraged her every response. But the most potent? The way he looked at her as if she was the only woman in the world while he filled her to burning capacity stroke after slow stroke.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d she demanded, almost not recognizing her own voice.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>His pace didn\u2019t change. He continued to slide his way in, angled against the spot guaranteed to send her reeling. Her mind fought it even as she craved it, until she didn\u2019t know what to want. Until her body took over.</p><p>She bucked under him, doing her best to take him deeper, faster, harder. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not controlling this, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you, as soon as you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Ready? How could she be more ready? She was breathing fire, her heart pumping lava. Right behind her clit an inferno of an ache burst, threatening to singe her alive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready now!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, balancing his forehead on hers so that she had nowhere to look except into his eyes. \u201cNo, honey. Put yourself in my hands. I\u2019m going to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>With her flat on her back and Hunter covering her completely, her anchor to the bed, it wasn\u2019t as if she had much choice. Kata bit her lip as both anger and arousal surged wildly.</p><p>The head of his cock scraped just the right spot again and again and again. The storm brewing in her body became a hurricane. Vicious need rushed through her. She clamped down on him. And the friction only grew more mind-boggling as he fought his way deep with every plunge.</p><p>As she gasped, her world spun out of control. Her stare clung to his. She knew he could read the panicked need in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Hunter turned on the jets, his thrusts into her a rapid rush of fire deep over her skin. Her body jolted, tightened, bucked. And the pleasure multiplied exponentially, zipping fire through her entire body. She clawed, screamed, begged.</p><p>And orgasm was still beyond her reach. Still in his hands.</p><p>Panting, Kata dug in her nails, desperately clutching what little she had left of her composure. She was giving Hunter too much, and he was eating it up\u2014and with every stroke demanding still more. Yes, she\u2019d promised him an hour of candor, never imagining he\u2019d work this deeply into her body and her psyche and take over. Her mistake.</p><p>Now it was too late.</p><p>He hammered into her, shoulders flexed, concentration fierce. And still his gaze locked on hers, forcing her to connect with him, to show him exactly how he affected her stroke for stroke.</p><p>Inside her, pleasure pummeled her. A tingle built on a shiver, deepening the unrelenting ache between her legs. He capitalized on that ruthlessly, pounding, pounding her most sensitive spot.</p><p>The pleasure was like a chain reaction as it built, fed on itself, then took on a life of its own. Suddenly, the need for release swallowed her whole, and Kata feared how far under it would drag her. How far under Hunter\u2019s spell it would put her.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, honey. Let it happen. I\u2019ll be here to catch you.\u201d</p><p>Wildly, she shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s too\u2014oh . . .\u201d she whimpered, throbbing everywhere. \u201cToo much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s perfect. Come for me, Kata.\u201d</p><p>As if her body had only needed that last stroke and his rough encouragement, the restraints around her pleasure sprang free. She screamed his name again as her entire body clenched with unrivaled pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYes! That\u2019s it,\u201d he chanted. \u201cWatching you let go makes me so . . . Fuck!\u201d</p><p>As the climax exploded, fracturing her, his entire body tensed, broad hands clutching her hips, keeping her suspended in the sort of ecstasy she\u2019d never believed existed. Until Hunter. He shuttled deep and emptied into her, delving so far inside her, she\u2019d never be able to look at him again and not think of how thoroughly he had controlled her body. The supernova he\u2019d detonated inside flashed her even hotter\u2014with no end in sight. The wrenching pleasure had her crying out until she lost her breath, her voice.</p><p>As soon as the climax slowed, leaving behind languid, liquid satisfaction and his addicting male scent, his gaze locked in on her, steady, open, letting her see forever into his psyche to glimpse his grit, his determination\u2014and the fact that he only wanted her more.</p><p>A moment later, the aftermath of her orgasm split her wide apart, ripping her open from the inside out. Vulnerability crashed over her. A hot splash of moisture filled her eyes, burning like acid as her throat closed up. Tears were coming. There was no goddamn way she would expose her raw feelings to anyone, least of all the man who\u2019d just stripped her down to her soul. Being with him when they\u2019d talked and danced, fine. They\u2019d simply been having fun. But now ... he\u2019d affected her emotionally, controlled her in a way that made it impossible for her to control herself. Shades of Mam\u00e1 and Gordon. Game over.</p><p>For her sanity, there was no way she could ever lay eyes on him again.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>BENEATH Hunter, Kata shoved, trying frantically to dislodge him. She pushed with an intensity that hinted at panic. Her whole body shook. Was she sick? Had he, God forbid, hurt her somehow?</p><p>Frowning, he rolled aside, zeroing in on her. \u201cKata?\u201d</p><p>But she was already off the bed, grabbing her clothes, refusing to turn his way.</p><p>Kata slipped on her sexy hot pink panties. The visual of her in naughty lace and nothing else made him instantly hard again. He tore off the condom and trashed it, restraining the urge to drag her back to bed and tie her to it.</p><p>Instead, he watched as she threw her sweater over her head, every movement rapid and stuttering. She was upset. Hunter scowled. Her mood wasn\u2019t about the lamp. She hadn\u2019t been thrilled, but whatever bothered her now went deeper. She reached back to the foot of the bed for her leather mini. The silent treatment had gone on long enough.</p><p>He clamped a hand around her wrist. \u201cKata, talk to me. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>In silence, she tossed her head back, and her dark tresses brushed that sexy back, making him want to get her flat on it again. But not until he knew what the hell was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done here.\u201d Her voice cracked as she yanked her wrist from his grasp, then ran out of the bedroom, picking up her bra and shoes as she went.</p><p>The hell they were.</p><p>Getting deep inside her had been the most singularly amazing experience of his life. For him, sex had always been just that. Kata reached him on a chemical level he couldn\u2019t explain and didn\u2019t bother to try. Coming deep inside her while staring even deeper into her eyes, he\u2019d known for the first time in his life what it was to feel something beyond desire. No way was he letting her walk out of his life without a fight. He wouldn\u2019t be the same brokenhearted fool as the Colonel, who had no one to blame but himself for his misery. Hunter knew Kata didn\u2019t feel the same devotion right now, but he damn sure hadn\u2019t thought she would dart out of his bed like her ass was on fire.</p><p>Stark naked, Hunter vaulted out of bed and raced down the hall after her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, just kept running until she disappeared into the kitchenette. He followed her around the corner to find her slipping her shoes on, her purse perched on her shoulder. She splashed water on her face\u2014and her hands trembled. She still refused to look at him, but he knew she\u2019d felt the connection between them. Then he understood: He\u2019d reached her on a level that disturbed her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shoving down his triumph, he approached her on silent footfalls. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey.\u201d</p><p>Finally, she turned to face him. Her eyes were red, slightly puffy. She\u2019d been crying. Shit.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is.\u201d She flipped her hair over her shoulder. \u201cIt was fun. Thanks. But now it\u2019s over, and I\u2019m still in the mood to party. See you around.\u201d She shouldered past him, focused on the suite\u2019s front door.</p><p>Hunter hooked an unyielding arm around her waist and reeled her close again. He didn\u2019t believe her for a second. \u201cTell me what I did to upset you.\u201d</p> <p>Kata hesitated, then tossed him a stare full of mock confusion. \u201cNo idea what you\u2019re talking about. I had to get you off of me. You were heavy, I couldn\u2019t breathe, and time is wasting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to party with who? Ben is passed out, your girlfriends are out on the prowl, and your sister is asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, an interrogation? You may be used to calling the shots when you go on your missions, but I told you, no one controls me. I\u2019m ready to leave, so unless you want me to scream down the entire floor of this hotel, take your fucking hand off me.\u201d</p><p>Everything she\u2019d said since crawling out of bed made his bullshit meter ring. What she didn\u2019t say was even more interesting. Her entire body was taut. She tried damn hard to repress a shiver as she licked her lips, looked at his. Definitely, he\u2019d reached her on a level she hadn\u2019t expected. That connection between them had her panicking. Even if he couldn\u2019t get the why out of her now, he\u2019d be god-damned if he was going to let her leave this suite alone wearing that curve-hugging sweater sans bra and those fuck-me shoes.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute, and I\u2019ll get dressed. We\u2019ll find a party and have all the fun you want.\u201d</p> <p>She leveled a stare at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind. \u201cLook, thanks for the bedroom tango. But I\u2019d rather spend my birthday with people I know. No offense.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his arm around her waist. \u201cWe\u2019ve been as close as two people can get. Why don\u2019t you get to know me better? I want to know everything about you.\u201d</p><p>Kata shoved at his hold. \u201cThere you go again with your \u2018everything\u2019 talk, like this is some meaningful relationship. We fucked. It was nice. Now go away.\u201d</p><p>Nice? He snorted. \u201cWalks on a sunny day are nice. Orgasms so powerful they incite tears aren\u2019t. We both know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you may have overestimated your prowess.\u201d She raised a dark brow.</p><p>\u201cYeah? So all the gasping, clawing, and screaming were you just stroking my ego? Okay . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI think you\u2019re lying, but I\u2019m more than willing to fuck you again if you\u2019d like to prove me wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth pursed with fury\u2014then suddenly she went limp. Had she fainted? He nearly stumbled at the unexpected shift in weight but found his balance and brought her upright.</p><p>As he lifted her hair aside and whispered her name, she elbowed him in the belly. He released her to clutch his middle. The tricky woman darted out of the suite.</p><p>Vixen. Damn, he was used to fighting enemy combatants, not sexy females.</p><p>But by the time Hunter worked into his clothes and hit the door at a run, Kata was nowhere to be seen. He charged down the hall and made his way to the elevator, but all of the cars had moved to lower floors. He watched the indicators as one of the cars descended to the lobby. The ugly certainty that she was on that one sliced through him.</p><p>No way he could leave her upset. He\u2019d come on strong, he knew. He was a soldier, and subtlety wasn\u2019t his forte. But once he found her, he could let her breathe a little. He just needed to know exactly what had spooked her so they could work through it. And he couldn\u2019t know that without getting her to open up.</p><p>Glancing at his watch, Hunter wondered where the hell she would go at this time of night, even in Vegas, alone and on her birthday. She\u2019d said that she wanted to party. Pounding on the elevator\u2019s down button, he waited. Finally, a ding announced its arrival. Empty. He prowled inside, hit the button for the lobby, then scanned all the hotel\u2019s advertisements for its many bars and restaurants. In short order, he found one for a club that looked trendy and loud, with pretty people dancing and lots of alcohol. His money was on that place.</p><p>After picking up another person or two on the way to the bottom floor, the doors opened. Hunter surged outside, scanned the area, and cursed. Fucking people everywhere, milling around the lobby, checking in, flooding the casinos that flanked the bank of elevators.</p><p>As a bellman stepped past, Hunter waylaid him for directions. In less than thirty seconds, he was jogging through a casino, up a flight of stairs.</p> <p>As he reached the top, the electronica music throbbed through his body. Ahead stood a set of frosted double doors. The club\u2019s name sparkled across them in glittery paint: SIN</p><p>Hunter stepped inside, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness, then scanned the area for Kata. Thirty seconds later, he spotted her at the bar, drink in hand, tossing clear liquid back with one swallow, then sucking a lime.</p><p>Shit, what exactly had he done to fuck with her head? He flipped through their encounter mentally, but nothing stood out except the explosive connection and earth-shattering orgasm that had obliterated any in his memory. She hadn\u2019t gotten her m\u00e9nage, didn\u2019t like the lamp on. She hadn\u2019t seemed this disturbed about anything until the sex was over. But something about their connection had made her cry.</p><p>She\u2019d panicked a little when he\u2019d gotten possessive. That, Kata was going to have to learn to live with, because it wasn\u2019t going to go away.</p><p>Slowly, Hunter circled the room. He watched her push her glass forward, order another, then suck it down immediately, chasing with a lime. She repeated the process. Thank God for one small favor: She\u2019d paused somewhere to put on her bra. Not that it kept guys from leering.</p><p>A tall punk in a baseball cap and baggy-ass jeans approached her, a come-on based on his body language. Hunter was close enough to read her lips and bit back a chuckle. His Kata knew creative ways to say no.</p><p>Then his smile fell. He couldn\u2019t let her use those creative ways on him. He wanted her again, bare skin sliding against his as he slid as deeply into her body as possible. In fact, \u201cwant\u201d was a weak word. He itched, craved, needed.</p><p>When the would-be Romeo stalked off, and Kata was sucking down her next drink, Hunter approached. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to get trashed, you\u2019re doing a great job.\u201d</p><p>She snapped around to meet his stare. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I get rid of you?\u201d</p><p>Hunter considered his possible answers, then went for the one least likely to cause more conflict. \u201cYou can\u2019t party alone, honey. And you just pissed off the last guy who approached you. Looks like you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, Hunter. I told you we\u2019re done. Stop stalking me.\u201d</p><p>So she preferred straightforward? Fine by him. \u201cI got to you enough to make you cry. What did I do to bother you so damn much?\u201d</p><p>She ordered another drink from the bartender, refusing to look at him. \u201cJust because we spent an hour between the sheets doesn\u2019t mean I owe you any answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a little common courtesy, then? I won\u2019t leave until you tell me what the hell is wrong.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the bartender set down her drink, she tossed it back in one long swallow, following with another lime that made her wince. \u201cThat, right there. You demand and push. You try to control me. I told you I don\u2019t roll that way. Now fuck off.\u201d</p><p>An independent woman like Kata? No surprise she\u2019d feel that way. But her body had said something totally different. When he\u2019d taken control of her orgasm and granted it on his terms, she\u2019d been afraid ... right before she\u2019d gone off like a killer fireworks display. She might not want to be controlled, but a big part of her got off on it.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me to fuck off all you want, but I\u2019m not leaving you. First, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re drunk. Second, you\u2019re alone, which makes you a target for any predator looking for an easy victim tonight. Third\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThird, I\u2019m a grown woman and I won\u2019t put up with this shit.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI moved out of my childhood home the day I turned eighteen and lived in terrible rat traps to avoid more of the kind of shitty mind games you\u2019re playing with me. I don\u2019t need a carbon copy of my stepfather.\u201d</p><p>Her stepfather? Damn. She had family issues. Ugly ones, from the sound of it. That changed everything\u2014including his tactics.</p><p>He softened, coming closer, encouraging her with a caress. \u201cTell me about him, honey.\u201d</p><p>At her signal, the bartender handed her another drink. With a toss of her head, she poured the shot down her throat. \u201cTell me where to find your off button.\u201d</p><p>Stubborn, independent, funny. She\u2019d be pissed off if he told her how adorable she was right now. Not that she wasn\u2019t frustrating the fuck out of him. But no matter how grouchy she was . . . well, he\u2019d been called a mean motherfucker more than once because he\u2019d earned it.</p><p>\u201cDid your stepfather hit you? Because I\u2019d never lift a finger to you, ever. I\u2019ll beat the shit out of anyone who tries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family is messed up, but we\u2019re not an episode of Cops in the making. You\u2019re loco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the first time I\u2019ve heard that I\u2019m crazy. I\u2019m also persistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her mock surprise dripped sarcasm. \u201cI would have never guessed!\u201d</p><p>When it came to defense mechanisms, she had an arsenal. Good thing he had his own weapons.</p><p>As she signaled for yet another drink, he grabbed her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make yourself damn sick if you keep that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my choice.\u201d</p><p>Hunter couldn\u2019t dispute that. Stupid choice, but hers. \u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>She slanted him a suspicious stare. \u201cPatr\u00f3n.\u201d</p><p>He held in a wince. Very soon, she would be feeling no pain. Tomorrow, it would hit her like a ton of bricks.</p><p>\u201cHey, pal,\u201d the bartender called. \u201cWant something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClub soda with a twist of lime.\u201d</p><p>The beefy bartender, who could have been Mr. Clean\u2019s double, raised an amused brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you can\u2019t handle Patr\u00f3n?\u201d Kata sneered, the effects of the alcohol beginning to show in her heavy-lidded eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, lost her balance for a second, and grabbed him to stabilize. Whether she knew it or not, some part of her trusted him.</p><p>\u201cRecovering alcoholic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I just refuse to engage in something so obviously selfdestructive.\u201d</p><p>With a roll of her eyes, Kata reached for the shot glass and lime the bartender set in front of her. \u201cAre you determined to crawl on my every last nerve tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I am determined to make sure you stay safe.\u201d</p><p>The bartender with the shaved head slammed the glass on the bar. \u201cFour dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to close out her tab, too.\u201d</p><p>In the middle of tossing back her latest shot, she choked. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>The other guy shrugged. \u201cShe handed me a hundred bucks when she walked in and told me to keep the tequila flowing until her money ran out. She\u2019s got a bit less than half her tab left.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d have alcohol poisoning by then, too. Fuck. Hunter reached into his wallet and pulled out another hundred. \u201cClose it out. Now.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Clean shrugged. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Kata slurred at the bartender, who ignored her. Then she swayed on her feet and scowled at Hunter. \u201cGoddamn it! There you go, trying to control me again. Why the hell did I ever let you fuck me?\u201d</p><p>The bartender repressed a smile. Hunter cursed under his breath. Kata had definitely had too much to drink, and he had to get her out of here quickly. For a girl who wanted to retain control, she\u2019d certainly drunk enough to ensure that she lost it. The tequila was to mask fear and pain; he got that. Now he had to figure out her issue before she erected permanent barriers between them.</p><p>The conflict with her stepfather, whatever the cause, was something bigger than he could deal with here with the music pulsing, artificial smoke pumping, and her blood alcohol way over the legal limit. Because while she might have been disturbed by the way he controlled her body, she\u2019d loved it. So had he. If he pointed that out again, he\u2019d only drive her farther away. Likely, Kata\u2019s stepfather had used his position in the family to somehow abuse her trust, so he must tread carefully.</p><p>She turned, staggering away. He grabbed her arm and pulled her against his body. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Kata looked at him with shocked, slightly unfocused eyes. \u201cFor what exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking so much of the control without talking to you first. I tend to be dominant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTend to be?\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cThank you, Captain Obvious.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I had known how much it would bother you, we would have had more conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you fucked me into the mattress? Yeah, how would that conversation have gone?\u201d</p><p>Hunter sighed. They weren\u2019t going to solve anything with the Black Eyed Peas making the walls shake.</p><p>He cupped her shoulder, caressed it. \u201cHoney, if you don\u2019t get some food and coffee into you, you\u2019re going to be sick.\u201d Her face tightened, and fury cascaded over her features. He held up his hands in self-defense. \u201cI\u2019m not ordering you to sober up; I\u2019m suggesting. You\u2019ll be in the same state as Ben, passed out on the bathroom floor and destined for a hangover, if you don\u2019t take care of yourself. Now, if you think drinking away great sex is worth the headache tomorrow, by all means, I\u2019ll stay while you get sloppy drunk and tuck you into bed safely. But if you want to be human when the sun comes up and you fly home . . .\u201d</p> <p>Kata didn\u2019t say anything for long moments. \u201cWhy is it when you claim you\u2019re trying not to control me, you still sound like you\u2019re trying damn hard to do just that?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cSeriously, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re still here or why the hell what I do matters to you.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer, wrapped an arm around her waist, and pulled her flush against him. Her eyes widened, and he knew she could feel exactly how disinterested he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOh, it matters, honey.\u201d</p><p>Actions spoke louder anyway, so he captured her lips under his in a taking both ferocious and absolute. Against him, she stiffened and gasped. But seconds after he found her fruity-tart tongue with his own, she threw her arms around him and dove into the kiss with her entire body. She lit him on fire . . . but it was more.</p><p>That something he\u2019d felt the moment they\u2019d met plowed through him with a vengeance. It drove him to possess her. It wasn\u2019t enough to say he\u2019d fucked her. It wouldn\u2019t be enough to fuck her again. Not nearly enough. He wanted the right to see her whenever he wanted, touch her whenever\u2014and however\u2014he wanted. Protect her, care for her. Call her his\u2014always.</p> <p>There it was, the truth that had been simmering in his consciousness, the reason he was pursuing her so hard. Suddenly, it was crystal. He wanted her permanently.</p><p>Reeling back in shock, Hunter ended the kiss, stared down into Kata\u2019s flushed face, her half-closed eyes, her swollen mouth, at the sensual siren that lived under her skin.</p><p>No question, he wanted her forever. And right now, she wanted almost nothing to do with him. He had eight days before he\u2019d be returned to active duty. With the flare-up of clandestine activity all around Iran and their race to acquire nuclear weapons, along with the Venezuelan government\u2019s perfect willingness to lend an illegal hand, he had no doubt missions were piling up. If he left without figuring out how to make Kata his . . . she might become Ben\u2019s\u2014or someone else\u2019s\u2014before he could step foot on U.S. soil again.</p><p>Unacceptable.</p><p>\u201cWhat is with you?\u201d Kata pushed against him. \u201cYou annoy me, start to make up for it with that killer kiss, then pull away? And then you try to pretend that you\u2019re not a control freak? Whatever.\u201d</p><p>She turned and blended into a nearby crowd. After a moment of observation, Hunter realized it was a small party. Given one woman\u2019s short white dress and little bouquet of flowers, he\u2019d guess they were preparing for a midnight wedding.</p> <p>He watched them and smiled. He might be losing the battle right now . . . but the war wasn\u2019t over.</p><p>Lunging for her, Hunter grabbed Kata\u2019s arm and spun her around. \u201cI have two questions. Will you answer that much?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she looked as if she was concentrating hard through the alcohol buzz. Hunter thanked her momentary infatuation with Patr\u00f3n; she\u2019d be more likely to tell him the truth now.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The slightly confused, crestfallen expression gave him hope. \u201cOkay. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sex between us . . . Help me understand why it made you cry.\u201d When she looked ready to object, he leaned forward and whispered softly, \u201cI won\u2019t judge or give you a hard time. I need to know if I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, her shoulders sagging in defeat as she slurred her reply. \u201cFine. You win. You were right. It was too powerful. I don\u2019t like feeling weak or needy. Happy?\u201d</p> <p>Very. Hunter kept his smile to himself. Good to know that his instincts weren\u2019t wrong. \u201cNot weak, honey, human. Last question.\u201d And the more important one. \u201cAre you against long-term relationships? Did you ever picture settling down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of question is that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, pretending nonchalance. \u201cCuriosity.\u201d</p><p>Kata sighed and shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be alone for the rest of my life, and I love my nephews. I see them . . . and want kids of my own someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable. Most people want kids at some point, even me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just . . .\u201d She scrubbed a hand across her face. \u201cI keep looking for someone to share life with, someone patient. Not afraid of a mop or the stove. Even-tempered, understanding, not allergic to emotion.\u201d She closed her eyes momentarily. \u201cSomeone sweet.\u201d</p><p>Hunter stifled a grimace. She was describing a female with a penis. He\u2019d make sure she figured out soon that wasn\u2019t what she needed.</p><p>\u201cOne who likes antiquing and long walks on the beach?\u201d he said, tongue in cheek.</p><p>\u201cYeah! Instead, I keep running into the party animals. Or, ugh, the ones who think farting contests are good entertainment. I once dated a guy who loved his gaming console way more than he\u2019d ever love a woman. And then there are all the heavy-handed, demanding bastards.\u201d She glared at him.</p><p>Hunter held in a laugh, feeling euphorically optimistic. Once she got to know him, she\u2019d see they fit perfectly. He just needed more time with Kata and a way to keep them together. Letting her leave without a fight\u2014taking his heart with her\u2014just wasn\u2019t an option. His father hadn\u2019t had the balls to fight for his woman. After failing to man up, he\u2019d curdled up into a surly, workaholic recluse. Hunter refused to follow in the Colonel\u2019s footsteps.</p><p>\u201cYou still want to party? There\u2019s a group who looks like they\u2019re having way too much fun to pass up.\u201d He pointed behind her.</p><p>Clutching his shoulder to steady herself, Kata glanced around and saw all the laughter, the embracing, the clinking glasses, the festivity. She flashed him a bright smile. \u201cThat looks fun!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>SUNLIGHT slanted across Kata\u2019s face like an ax. She grimaced and flung a hand over her eyes, squinting against the bright pain exploding through her skull.</p><p>What the hell had she done last night to earn this monster hangover?</p><p>With a groan, she rolled over\u2014and encountered a solid chest, a heavy thigh draped over her own. Her eyes flew open wide. Hard, male, dangerous.</p><p>Hunter.</p><p>Had she slept with him again? Given that she was completely naked and even small movement strained muscles she hadn\u2019t known she possessed, she guessed yes. Worse, merely sliding her bare skin against his hair-roughened flesh made her hot and wet. Again.</p><p>Despite the fact that Hunter was as subtle as a sledgehammer, and she usually refused to come within ten feet of such men, some part of her wanted to stay curled up next to him with his strong arms around her, and hear that deep voice rasp her name again.</p><p>Many men shied away from her big mouth and attitude. But Hunter? No matter how many times she\u2019d told him to fuck off last night, he\u2019d continued his pursuit. Their verbal sparring roused her, and he\u2019d thoroughly proven he had as much upstairs as down. No matter what she\u2019d said to him, he\u2019d stayed with her and ensured that she remained safe. Kata remembered flashes of his brutal hunger and, oddly, his tenderness that, even now, made her shiver.</p><p>In every way, he made her feel more desirable than any man ever had. She\u2019d be lying if she said she didn\u2019t crave more.</p><p>Not a good development. He was controlling, could clearly catch any female he wanted, and was shipping out soon\u2014everything she didn\u2019t need.</p><p>Kata stretched, and her head started to pound in earnest. She winced again. What the hell had happened last night?</p><p>She scanned her memory but couldn\u2019t piece everything together past the black spots. She recalled her party and Ben passing out . . . and, oh, the incredible sex with Hunter before running out on him. There\u2019d been a club with lots of tequila, and Hunter had tracked her down. She\u2019d revealed more to him about her family and her fears than she should have. Kata cringed. What had possessed her to bring up a bottomless-pit-of-shit topic like Gordon?</p><p>Grimacing, she rolled carefully away from Hunter, sliding out from under his thigh. Kata ignored the fresh ache in her head\u2014and the flesh between her legs that still throbbed\u2014then stood on wobbly legs.</p><p>Clutching her rolling stomach, she kept sifting through her memories as she tiptoed around the room for her clothes. At the club, she and Hunter had eventually joined a happy group, who\u2019d soon left the hotel. She had a vague recollection of passing all the bright Vegas lights situated on Hunter\u2019s lap, his lips whispering over her neck, his fingers swirling lazy circles on her clit under the cover of her skirt, as they squeezed into a cab with their new acquaintances. Everyone had been excited about going downtown, but she could only remember the orgasm she\u2019d screamed into Hunter\u2019s kiss, not why their destination had been important. Was there a better casino down there? A show?</p><p>Everything after the car ride was a total blank.</p><p>Kata bent, still feeling around the hotel room in the semidarkness for her clothing. Her panties were toast, literally now in three pieces. She could only imagine Hunter had done that in his haste to fuck her again. The thought shouldn\u2019t make her wet, but . . . Kata cursed quietly. She had to focus.</p><p>Her skirt hung on the doorknob, her shoes just beneath. Her sweater strewn in the hall two paces into the room. Her bra? Missing altogether.</p><p>She had a vague recollection of Hunter stripping her down to her skin seconds after closing the door behind them, and she\u2019d let him have his wicked way with her again. The wisps of memory made her hot all over.</p><p>Turning back to the bed, she watched the steady rise and fall of Hunter\u2019s powerful chest. Most people looked softer or more vulnerable in sleep. He looked every bit as formidable as he did awake. And given his occupation, if she didn\u2019t sneak out quietly, he\u2019d wake before she could make a clean exit.</p><p>Running out on him seemed cowardly, but with attraction still tugging at her and her odd reluctance to leave him, she\u2019d best find the door pronto. Besides, they\u2019d shared a whole night, and her slightly achy throat told her that she\u2019d screamed for him over and over. Hunter had to be satisfied with that. His oddly possessive behavior aside, what more could he want?</p><p>Kata glanced around for her purse, resisting the urge to take another peek at him. She didn\u2019t dare wake him, or he might be motivated to start round . . . what, fifteen? No. Her need to pee would have to wait.</p><p>Finally, she spotted her bag on the floor near the closet, grabbed it, and scampered for the door. It took forever to undo all the locks quietly. Hunter grunted, his breathing paused as she flipped the door\u2019s main lock. But she paused, letting silence slide over the room again. Within moments, his breathing became deep and even once more.</p><p>Kata opened the door and closed it behind her with a soft, final snick. Most likely, she\u2019d never see him again.</p><p>As the thought hit her, she stopped dead in the hall. That was a good thing, right? Yes, their killer chemistry made her shudder even now, but he was a one-night stand. His job was pure danger. He dominated, pushing her, challenging her. Granted, when she\u2019d been really furious, he\u2019d listened. He wasn\u2019t a jerk. But when she considered spending more time with him, icy panic rolled through her. Foreboding churned. Being with Hunter could change her life. Change her.</p><p>It hit her then that she feared for her heart. What had passed between her and Hunter hadn\u2019t felt like a one-night stand. Despite her panic, something inside her screamed that she was making a terrible mistake sneaking out on him.</p><p>That feeling was so, so dangerous . . . but undeniable.</p><p>Kata spun around for his door again, then looked out the huge window near the bank of elevators. The sun was high in the sky. Crap, what time was it?</p><p>Pulling her cell from her purse, she nearly choked at the clock\u2019s display. Her plane left in less than two hours!</p><p>Okay, so she\u2019d have to deal with her feelings for Hunter once she returned to Lafayette. Maybe some space was good. They could both cool down, decide what, if anything, should happen next. If she was still thinking about Hunter in a few days, she\u2019d ask Ben for his number. If not . . . maybe leaving now would be for the best. Besides, now that they\u2019d had lots of sex, maybe Hunter was done with her.</p><p>The possibility depressed her.</p><p>Kata dashed to the elevator and raced in, pounding the button to go up to her suite. At the door, she wrestled out her little plastic key and slid it in. Ben stood there in a towel, staring at her as if Medusa had just walked in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrinking a lot and not remembering much.\u201d</p><p>He grunted, then held his head with a wince. \u201cI hear that. I woke up on the fucking bathroom floor. What happened last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean after you got me half-naked with Hunter, then passed out?\u201d She arched a playful brow at him.</p> <p>\u201cFuck! I did?\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kata. I ruined everything.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, he really hadn\u2019t. She smiled. \u201cYou had good intentions.\u201d</p><p>He sauntered closer, a lock of his wavy brown hair brushing across his forehead. \u201cWe might have time for a quickie now. What do you say, babe? I\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>No. Her reaction was immediate and confusing. Normally, she enjoyed quickies with Ben. He was at his best when he only had a few minutes and poured everything into making it good. But she pictured Hunter\u2019s face hovering over hers during the darkest part of the night, focused and intent, as he held her wrists above her head and drove hard inside her. She shivered.</p><p>Kata shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late if we don\u2019t get out of here. I need a shower, and I still haven\u2019t packed up.\u201d</p> <p>Ben sighed and backed away. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Damn it. I\u2019ll finish getting ready and arrange for a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready in fifteen,\u201d she promised, as she grabbed a pair of denim capri pants, a T-shirt, and fresh undergarments from her suitcase, then darted for the bathroom and shut the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cChloe, Hallie, and Mari already left for the airport. Your sister called, looking for you. You were supposed to ride with them?\u201d Ben called through the bathroom door.</p><p>Kata winced. \u201cSorry. I... overslept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith who? \u2019Cause looking at you, I have no doubt you didn\u2019t give yourself that whisker burn on your neck.\u201d</p><p>Turning, she peered in the mirror and pressed her lips together to stifle a shriek. Ben had looked at her as if Medusa had come through the door, because she had. Her hair was a rumpled mess, her mascara smudged, her lips incredibly swollen. Kata stripped off her clothes as if they were on fire and bit back a gasp at all the marks on her body. Whisker burns, love bites, faint bruises in the shape of Hunter\u2019s fingers on her thighs, hips, and ass. What the hell had they done last night? And God, she was still wet just thinking about him.</p> <p>\u201cKata . . . Who? Were you with Hunter?\u201d</p><p>No way in hell was she answering that now. She stuck her head in the shower and flipped it on, the sound of the water running drowning out Ben\u2019s inquiries.</p><p>Twelve minutes later, she stepped out of the bathroom with wet hair, a freshly scrubbed face, clean clothes, and sunglasses to find Ben, fully dressed, setting down the hotel room\u2019s phone.</p><p>\u201cHunter is looking for you. He\u2019s pissed that you left him.\u201d</p><p>Against her better judgment, excitement cramped in her belly, made her ridiculously giddy. Gathering the contents of her suitcase, Kata checked herself. Yeah, they had great sex, but no way in hell was she volunteering to be with a man like that. Too bad everything about Hunter flipped her switch. It was insane but . . . she missed him already.</p><p>Speculation flitted across Ben\u2019s face. \u201cYou fucked him. And you liked it. Gotta say, I didn\u2019t picture you going for his tie-\u2019em-down-fuck-\u2019em-hard sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTie \u2019em down?\u201d Her heart stuttered just asking the question.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Ben crossed his arms over his chest and stared like he was looking forward to imparting news that would totally shake her. \u201cHunter\u2019s a well-versed Dominant. That means he\u2019s into BDSM. From what I understand, when he takes a submissive, he insists on taking complete control.\u201d</p> <p>Kata sucked in a breath. She\u2019d been around enough to hear bits and pieces about people into bondage, mind games, and pain. She was no expert, but everything she\u2019d heard scared the shit out of her.</p><p>Puzzle pieces snapped into place\u2014Hunter\u2019s behavior. And, God, her reaction. Did he think that he could make her some submissive plaything, willing to bend backward and inside out just to earn his approval and a smile? Likely so, because she\u2019d stupidly given him every indication that she ate that shit up. Kata shuddered.</p><p>Ben watched her carefully. She smoothed out her expression. He was the last person with whom Kata wanted to discuss her feelings for Hunter.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better get out of here.\u201d Before Hunter came pounding on the door, looking for her. And he would, Kata suddenly had no doubt.</p><p>With a practiced shrug, she closed up her suitcase, grabbed her purse, then reached out for Ben\u2019s hand. \u201cC\u2019mon. We have a plane to catch.\u201d</p><p>THE minute Kata hit her seat, she buckled up and closed her eyes. In the window seat on her left, Ben did the same and started snoring almost immediately. Hallie and Chloe were two rows behind her, looking every bit as hungover as she felt, but the smile on Hallie\u2019s face told her they\u2019d gotten lucky last night. Kata didn\u2019t ask, though. She didn\u2019t want to answer in turn.</p><p>What happened in Vegas . . .</p><p>Yes, it should stay here, but Hunter had proven last night that he took intense to a whole new level. He\u2019d find her if he wanted to.</p><p>Shoving the thought aside, Kata tried to sleep, but she couldn\u2019t nod off. She couldn\u2019t put Hunter out of her mind.</p><p>While Kata pored through her lost memories of the previous night, something tugged at her again and again, as if she\u2019d forgotten an important fact. But that something proved as elusive as smoke. She could only latch on to bits of things that made no sense\u2014an overbright government office with bored clerks, flashbulbs, strangers laughing, a moonlit garden. Vividly, she recalled Hunter pressing her into an elevator and kissing hungrily on the way up to his room. He\u2019d called her his, the word emphatic, as solemn as a bond.</p><p>Kata opened her eyes to find the flight attendant standing beside her row with the drink cart. \u201cSomething to drink, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee, cream and sugar.\u201d</p><p>The fortysomething blonde nodded efficiently as she poured. \u201cAnd your husband?\u201d</p><p>Kata frowned. Why the hell would the woman think . . . Then she felt Ben\u2019s hand, warm and big, as he tangled his fingers with hers.</p><p>\u201cNothing for him,\u201d she whispered to the other woman so she didn\u2019t wake him.</p><p>With a polite smile, the flight attendant moved away.</p><p>A few minutes later, Ben stirred at her side. \u201cDamn, did I miss the coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have some of mine.\u201d She offered the cup to him with her free hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, but thanks. I\u2019ll get some when we lay over in Dallas.\u201d He squeezed her hand affectionately.</p><p>Discomfort wound through Kata. She\u2019d never had a problem with Ben\u2019s touch, so why now? She still considered him a friend\u2014hell, he\u2019d helped Mari throw her a great birthday party\u2014but the idea of sex with him again didn\u2019t appeal. In fact, it turned her way off.</p><p>Ben was good in bed, but she didn\u2019t have romantic feelings for him. Kata had long viewed that as a blessing, hoping that after all she\u2019d seen with Mam\u00e1 and Gordon over the last decade that her heart had scabbed over\u2014and permanently put her off anything too deep.</p><p>In a few short hours, Hunter had challenged all that. The thought of blazing up the sheets with him once more . . . even allowing him to tie her up. Instant arousal. God, how was it possible that, in a single night, he\u2019d hardwired her body to respond so thoroughly to him? Her thoughts to revolve around him?</p><p>What the hell was she going to do about her comfortable arrangement with Ben? She searched his face, lax in sleep once more. Last night\u2019s doofus drunken behavior aside, he really was funny and kind. Attractive. Dependable. He\u2019d make someone a great husband someday. But not her.</p><p>The pilot announced their initial descent into Dallas/Ft. Worth, where she and her friends would change planes before going on to Lafayette. She loved where she lived, but the lack of direct flights anywhere really sucked.</p><p>Carefully, she extracted her hand from Ben\u2019s\u2014and the streak of sunlight shimmering through the little window\u2019s shade glinted off something unexpected. It wasn\u2019t the eclectic silver swirl ring she always wore. The weight was similar, but . . . this was an unfamiliar, endless band of gold.</p><p>Her stomach dropped to her toes. Suddenly, the obvious smacked her in the face. She gasped.</p><p>The sound jarred Ben awake. \u201cWhat?</p><p>Kata stared at the ring in horror, puzzle pieces from the night before snapping into place.</p><p>They\u2019d gone with the strangers in the bar to the county clerk\u2019s office because Christi and . . . what was his name? Nick, maybe. They\u2019d wanted to get married, despite only knowing each other for two weeks. So they\u2019d run off to Vegas. She and Hunter had tagged along, lured by the promise of a big post-wedding celebration.</p><p>At the county offices, Kata had remarked that her stepfather would freak if she married someone she\u2019d only met two weeks ago. Hunter had sent her a sly look and asked, \u201cYeah, what about someone you met four hours ago?\u201d</p><p>Since she always looked for ways to spit in Gordon\u2019s face and hadn\u2019t seen a reason to stop, especially with the alcohol giving her liquid courage, Hunter\u2019s words had given her a very bad idea ... and Hunter hadn\u2019t objected.</p><p>\u201cKata?\u201d Ben\u2019s voice shook as he stared warily at her left hand. \u201cWhat is that on your finger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s . . .\u201d She closed her eyes, withdrawing from Ben\u2019s grip. \u201cA wedding ring.\u201d</p><p>Oh, holy shit. She was Hunter\u2019s wife.</p><p>THREE hours later, Hunter touched down at the Dallas/Ft. Worth airport, turned on his phone immediately, and called Kata. Voice mail\u2014again.</p><p>His new wife had sneaked out of his room this morning. Granted, her plane had left before his, and she\u2019d had to catch it. But he didn\u2019t have a good feeling about the fact that they hadn\u2019t talked since sacking out.</p><p>Would she regret last night\u2019s hasty decision today?</p><p>Kata ought to be in Lafayette now. He tried her number again. Nothing but her recorded voice telling him to leave a message. Anxiety balled in his gut as he made his way to the nearest airline representative to change his final destination. Once he caught up with her, no doubt, he would have to do a lot of fast talking to calm her down and keep her from running scared again.</p><p>How the hell had he slept through her leaving his room? Hunter mentally kicked himself for that. A three a.m. turn in, followed by another hour of the most hedonistic, extravagant sex ever, had wiped him out. Still, failing to hear her leave had been both sloppy and lazy, and he\u2019d never allow it again. For his fuckup, he was paying the price, being separated from Kata during what he feared was a critical time in their new marriage.</p><p>He had to do everything in his power to keep that distance from becoming permanent.</p><p>After settling his plane ticket, Hunter searched for a decent cup of coffee. He reached Kata\u2019s voice mail once more with a curse, then he made another call he\u2019d rather not . . . but one that might help his cause.</p><p>\u201cRaptor,\u201d Hunter\u2019s pal and commanding officer, Andy Barnes, barked into the phone after the first ring. \u201cAren\u2019t you on leave, Lieutenant?\u201d</p><p>Since being promoted a few months back, Andy had become like a label-conscious shopaholic, only his addiction of choice was rank. He was still in the phase where he liked to remind himself\u2014 and everyone else\u2014that he\u2019d moved up to lieutenant commander, as if he was verbally pinching himself.</p><p>Hunter rolled his eyes. Andy had worked hard for the promotion, overcome his family\u2019s less-than-stellar reputation in the navy to earn it. The promotion had first come Hunter\u2019s way, and Andy had been completely mind-boggled when Hunter had turned it down. But desking it wasn\u2019t his speed. He\u2019d rather take an M-1 Tactical blade to both wrists before subjecting himself to a shitload of paperwork. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that shoulder? Healing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty well. I\u2019m following doctor\u2019s orders and continuing my strength training regimen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever doubted that. So why are you calling? The world isn\u2019t falling apart without you. At least not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. I called to request permission to extend my leave, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t report until oh five hundred next Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that, but I have a situation that requires more time.\u201d</p><p>Andy paused. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me? Shoot straight.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Not that it was any of Andy\u2019s business, but if he was going to hook Kata up with all the benefits of being a SEAL\u2019s wife, the news would come out. \u201cI got married yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got married?\u201d He whistled. \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s something I thought I\u2019d never see. You\u2019ve been married to your team for nearly half a dozen years. Is she pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Hunter gritted his teeth against Andy\u2019s implication. \u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs she navy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCivilian.\u201d And Hunter itched to end this conversation so he could find her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were seeing anyone that seriously.\u201d</p><p>Hunter hesitated, and Andy drew out the silence. Damn, if Hunter wanted this leave, he was going to have to spill his guts. \u201cI wasn\u2019t. I met Kata yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you met and married her on the same day?\u201d Andy\u2019s question sounded calm, but Hunter knew it was a fa\u00e7ade. Barnes didn\u2019t like outside interference in his SEALs\u2019 lives, and this likely had him broiling inside.</p><p>Ah, hell. \u201cI\u2019m crazy about her, Andy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always knew you were decisive, but damn.\u201d His buddy blew out a long breath. \u201cI\u2019ll need some info on her so she\u2019ll be eligible for your benefits. I can start the ball rolling while you\u2019re on leave, save you the time.\u201d</p><p>Nice of him, but Hunter supposed Barnes was softening the blow in case his leave couldn\u2019t be extended. \u201cKatalina, maiden name Mu\u00f1oz. She turned twenty-five yesterday.\u201d Thanking God he\u2019d had the foresight to look at her driver\u2019s license and memorize her address, just in case, he rattled it off to Barnes.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook, I need extra leave to settle this situation so I can return rested and focused.\u201d</p><p>Andy scoffed. \u201cYou want extra leave to fuck her brains out. Damn it, Raptor. I don\u2019t suppose it would do any good to tell you this is irresponsible and stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sir,\u201d he added quickly.</p><p>Hunter sometimes forgot to treat Andy like his CO. But ol\u2019 Barnes liked hearing it, and this was one situation in which following protocol might help.</p><p>A gate agent in a nearby lounge made an announcement over the loudspeaker, and Andy pounced. \u201cYou\u2019re in the airport. Pretty sure of that leave, huh? Where you headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLafayette, my wife\u2019s hometown. I need to meet her parents.\u201d Discern the problem with her stepfather so he could figure out exactly what not to do if he wanted to keep Kata and earn her trust.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do about your leave. But, to be honest, things aren\u2019t good here. Word is that V\u00edctor Sotillo\u2019s former troops are rallying around his brother, Adan.\u201d</p><p>Hunter frowned. \u201cThe salsa dancer? That brother? He\u2019s all about parties and finding his next lover, by all accounts. Not the kind of guy to take over a bloodthirsty cartel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still a family business. Always has been. So after V\u00edctor\u2019s death, Adan stepped in. Intel is that they\u2019re regrouping and planning.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Even if Adan was ineffectual, this development didn\u2019t bode well for an extended leave. The situation would need monitoring . . . but he must cement things with Kata, too.</p><p>Hunter sighed. \u201cEven a few extra days here would really help me. Then I\u2019ll be ready to roll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, the line went dead. Hunter pressed the end button and shook his head. Well, that had been a clusterfuck. And the conversation with his father would, no doubt, be worse, though he\u2019d bring Kata with him to see the Colonel.</p><p>As soon as he found her.</p> <p>Originally, he\u2019d planned to stay in Dallas with his brother, Logan. Now, he was focused on Kata, and the three-hour layover was chafing. He paced, picked at some lunch\u2014and tried to call his bride a dozen times.</p><p>Finally, as he was boarding his flight, his phone rang. Kata\u2019s name and number appeared on his screen. Bingo! A bit of the tension in his gut eased . . . then ramped up again. What would she say about last night?</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney?\u201d she screeched. \u201cWhat the hell did you do last night, besides put your number in my phone?\u201d</p><p>He froze. \u201cIt\u2019s what we did. You don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d</p><p>Surprise and disappointment stabbed him. That changed a lot of things. Yes, she\u2019d been drunk, but not incoherent. He\u2019d assumed ... Fuck. He\u2019d assumed wrong and now had to deal.</p><p>\u201cBut I think it\u2019s coming back to me.\u201d Her voice shook. \u201cTell me I\u2019m wrong. This is crazy. Impossible. We couldn\u2019t possibly have . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotten married? The keepsake certificate is in your purse. The officiant said we can write away to the county clerk\u2019s office for the real thing in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Kata gasped, choked in panic. \u201cYou sound pretty damn calm. Why aren\u2019t you freaked?\u201d</p><p>Because he had no reason to be. If he showed the slightest bit of uncertainty, she would only panic more. Best for all concerned if he remained firmly in control.</p><p>\u201cListen, we\u2019re going to be fine. Our sudden marriage is unconventional, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy!\u201d Kata drew in a horrified gasp. \u201cYou sound . . . happy about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. I want you, Kata, and my gut tells me we\u2019re right for each other. Give yourself some time to get used to the idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat my family is going to kill me? That I just did the most irresponsible thing of my life? Or that you went way beyond taking advantage of a drunk woman?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she\u2019d see it like that\u2014and maybe she was right. All he knew is that, unless Andy came through, he\u2019d be going back on active duty too soon to resolve this. His time to make Kata fall in love with him was ticking away. It might be six months or more before his feet touched U.S. soil again. Last night, he\u2019d known that if he didn\u2019t find some way to tie her to him quickly, she\u2019d be gone. The decision had been simple strategy, like securing the bunker. Or in this case, marrying the woman.</p><p>If there\u2019d been another way, Hunter would have chosen it, but time and her fears weren\u2019t on his side. Last night, he\u2019d never expected to meet someone he connected with on every level, then marry her almost immediately, but things happened; he dealt. That was the nature of his job.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t his most noble moment, but if being a SEAL had taught him anything, it was that sometimes you had to fight dirty to complete the mission. And if his father had taught him anything, it was that a man must be ready to do whatever necessary to hold on to his woman or lose her forever. Unlike the Colonel, Hunter wasn\u2019t a quitter.</p><p>Resisting the urge to point out the fact their marriage had, in fact, been her idea, Hunter played along, using his calmest voice. \u201cWe need to talk this out. I know this is sudden, but I want this to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe barely know each other!\u201d</p><p>He sighed, pressing down his frustration. He wanted to howl that, while true, that wasn\u2019t the point. What they had now wasn\u2019t nearly as important as what they could have. But she was scared, and he didn\u2019t want to come off like a stalker. Nor did he want her unhappy. He wouldn\u2019t pursue this marriage and her so relentlessly if he didn\u2019t believe in his gut that they belonged together. But he had to ease up now, find the right strategy to help her to see the possibilities.</p><p>\u201cKata, we can fix that\u2014and anything if we set our minds to it. Give me a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter, I . . . Why? I know I have to take responsibility for my part, drunk or not, and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the one who suggested we get married like Christi and Nick\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. You were the sober one. Good sex wasn\u2019t a reason to get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust good?\u201d he countered archly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she conceded. \u201cGreat sex. But still . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve both been round the block enough to know that this is something more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut normal people spend more time getting to know each other. They talk. They date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do those things, Kata. In fact, I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should have started there.\u201d</p><p>Hunter tried to grab on to his patience. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t wearing that ring around your finger this morning and I\u2019d called you to ask you out, what would you have said?\u201d</p><p>Her silence told him everything. The emotional intensity between them still scared her. Most likely, she would have tucked tail and run. Only time would help her see that they could work.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t drunk. Why did you marry me?\u201d</p><p>That question was easy to answer. \u201cBecause I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>Her sigh shivered down his back as he took his seat and buckled his belt. \u201cUgh, just when I think you\u2019re a pushy, dominating prick, you say something nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a pushy, dominating prick.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBut honey, I\u2019m always honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m not a screechy head case with a bad credit score?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. But what I do know is how I feel about you. Trusting my gut has kept me alive more than once. I believe it\u2019s steering me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so much, so fast. I need time to sort through it.\u201d</p><p>Hunter gritted his teeth. He could afford to give her latitude on a lot of things, but not about spending time with him before he went back on active duty. If he didn\u2019t, Kata would be gone.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you, honey? I think we should talk as soon as I hit Lafayette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLafayette? Your plane ticket said Dallas/Ft. Worth.\u201d</p><p>So she\u2019d looked. Interesting . . . \u201cEasy change.\u201d</p><p>He regretted that he wouldn\u2019t get to spend time with Logan so he could straighten his brother out. That would have to wait for now.</p><p>\u201cY-you can\u2019t come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you are, honey. I\u2019ll come straight to your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m not there right now. I had to leave. Ben . . .\u201d</p><p>Probably wanted to pick up where he\u2019d left off last night. Hunter would have to set him straight or kill him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop! I don\u2019t want you to take care of anything.\u201d</p><p>Hunter swallowed against sudden fury, his voice very low. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife. You\u2019re not going to fuck him again.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYou thought . . . oh, that\u2019s just fucking perfect. Why the hell do you want to be married to me if you think I\u2019m going to step out on you the minute you turn your back?\u201d</p><p>It was a fair question, and Hunter grappled for a fair answer. \u201cI don\u2019t know what your feelings for him are. And I know that a piece of paper between us probably wouldn\u2019t make a damn bit of difference to him. But let me be clear: It means something to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend and he\u2019s been convenient, yeah. But he\u2019s not jealous, just pissed that I won\u2019t have sex with him anymore. I couldn\u2019t stay and listen to him rant. It was making my head hurt like a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Hunter repressed a smile. Poor baby was hungover. It pleased him even more that she didn\u2019t want to be intimate with Ben.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood. Sorry if I upset you. No insult intended.\u201d He gripped the phone tighter. \u201cTell me where you are, honey. I\u2019ll come to you, and we\u2019ll have a thorough conversation. I don\u2019t want to change your life; I just want to be a part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou change everything just by being you, the same way Gordon does.\u201d Her voice wobbled with tears, and she sniffed. \u201cUgh, I need to shut up.\u201d</p><p>Who the hell was Gordon? \u201cGive us a chance to work this out. Are you with your sister?\u201d</p><p>She laughed through her tears. \u201cYou think I\u2019d go near two rambunctious boys when my head is throbbing like a broken toe? Or sign up for the lecture from hell? No way. I came to my office. It\u2019s almost empty on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStreet address?\u201d</p><p>Kata paused a long time, and Hunter bet she was weighing the intelligence of giving him an inch versus the sheer futility of running. In the end, she sighed. \u201cYou win.\u201d</p><p>He memorized the address as she rattled it off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this marriage thing is a train wreck waiting to happen?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOr the adventure of our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, he heard a blast on the other end of the line. It was unmistakably gunfire.</p><p>Kata screamed. Then the line went dead.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>HUNTER knew his fingers shook as he dialed Kata again. Four rings, then voice mail. The result didn\u2019t change when he tried once more.</p><p>Who the hell would be shooting inside her office building? He couldn\u2019t let himself think that she couldn\u2019t answer the phone because something terrible had happened.</p><p>Pushing down his fear, he fell back on his training. Stuck on a fucking plane, he could only reach out for help. And he had to do it before the plane pushed away from the gate and the flight attendants forced him to turn off his cell phone.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate to hit one of the numbers on his speed dial. Thankfully, Deke had elected to move to Lafayette, closer to work and his cousin Luc, a few months back. His brother-in-law answered right away. \u201cHey, Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a situation. There\u2019s a female probation officer, Kata Mu\u00f1oz, who\u2019s been either shot or shot at.\u201d He rattled off the address. \u201cShe\u2019s had some run-ins with a local gangster who\u2019s been threatening her. Get to her, man. Now. I\u2019ll be there as soon as I get off this damn plane.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Deke could have asked a lot of questions and probably would later, but the soldier in him responded to the urgency of Hunter\u2019s tone. \u201cDone. I\u2019ll text you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, you have to turn off your phone.\u201d The flight attendant hovering in the aisle scowled.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Deke.\u201d He ended the call, moving restlessly in his seat, praying like hell that help wouldn\u2019t be too late for Kata.</p><p>He\u2019d known her less than twenty-four hours, and already she was perilously close to being the most important person in his life. He\u2019d never sought love, but now that it was breathing down his neck, anyone who wanted to steal his possible happily-ever-after would have to pry it out of his cold, dead hands.</p> <p>Despite the fact that it chafed him raw, Hunter powered the phone down and tucked it into his jeans pocket. He had no idea how he was going to survive this flight without losing his mind. Scrubbing a harsh hand down his face, he tried not to picture Kata hurt, bleeding, alone. Dying. Goddamn it, he should be there to save her.</p><p>He swore that if she lived, he\u2019d never leave her unprotected again\u2014not for a single second.</p><p>THE sharp report of gunfire startled Kata, echoing through the office. She jumped and lost her grip on her phone. It skittered across the floor, under a colleague\u2019s chair about fifteen feet away as she hit the tile floor on her hands and knees, diving under her heavy metal desk.</p><p>Where had the gunfire come from? Given the deafening sound, inside the building, maybe even inside the room. She was the only person in the office, since it was Sunday. But God, who would shoot at her? Had Cortez Villarreal or his goons caught up to her?</p><p>Heart beating until she feared it would burst, Kata mentally raced through her options. Her phone had fallen in the intruder\u2019s direction. It was too far away to safely retrieve. Instead of retrieving it, she had to focus on escape. The main exit lay in the direction from which the shot had come. The emergency exit was to her right, on the far side of the room, a good twenty feet away. How the hell could she reach either door before this thug\u2019s bullet struck her? She had to try.</p> <p>Her phone rang again, a jarring clatter in the thick, empty room. Hunter. God knew what he was thinking now. The ringing stopped, started again.</p><p>Then the phone fell eerily silent. Quiet, methodical footsteps echoed off the tile floors in the utilitarian room. There was no one here to rescue her\u2014and they both knew it. If she was going to live, she had to save herself.</p><p>Clutching the leg of the desk, she peeked around the corner to see if she could get a bead on the shooter\u2019s exact location or any other possible escape routes. All she saw were rows of empty desks, piled high with outdated computers and paperwork. Then another blast ripped through the room, followed by a metallic ping an inch from her ear. She jerked back in time to see a dent shaped like a bullet in the side of the desk.</p><p>The shooter knew precisely where she was. Kata suspected the bastard was toying with her. Next time, he wouldn\u2019t miss.</p><p>She cursed the fact that her purse, with her gun inside, was in the top drawer of her desk. If she reached up to get it, she\u2019d make an easy target of herself. But better to die trying than to sit and wait for the fatal bullet.</p><p>Slithering out from under the desk on her belly, she curled up in front of the drawers and reached for the handle of the top one, opening it slowly. It creaked, and the sound exploded through the still office. She\u2019d already alerted him; better to finish and be quick.</p> <p>After opening the drawer, Kata reached up and groped for her purse.</p><p>Another shot rang out, closer. With a sharp gasp, Kata jerked her hand down. She\u2019d felt the bullet whiz just over her wrist and had to cover her mouth to hold in her scream.</p><p>Then she got mad. This unseen fucker was screwing with her head before he took her life. She\u2019d be damned if she was going to let him do it without a fight.</p><p>Again, she reached up into the drawer. From her first foray, she knew exactly where to grope, and jerked the little Coach bag free.</p><p>It landed with a thump between her feet\u2014just as she heard more whisper-light footsteps in aisles between the desks mere feet away.</p><p>He was coming closer.</p><p>Ripping into her bag, she pulled out the little semiautomatic, unlocked the safety, and popped off a round in the shooter\u2019s general direction as she ran, crouching behind the next desk over, one closer to the emergency exit.</p><p>She listened for his footsteps again, wondered where he was, how close. But she heard only her own panting, terrifyingly loud in the thin silence.</p> <p>Biting her lip, Kata peeked above the desk. Her assailant was nowhere in sight.</p><p>A fresh wave of fear overtook her. He hadn\u2019t left; she could feel him plotting, creeping steadily closer. Her thoughts spun again. Sit tight for a better opportunity, or run?</p><p>A better opportunity might never come.</p><p>Sucking in a breath, she darted past a desk. No shots rang out. Holding her weapon in one hand and covering her mouth with the other, she listened. Waited. Though Kata couldn\u2019t hear this murderer, she knew he was coming for her.</p><p>Gasping a silent breath, she ran, crouching, to the next desk. Only one to go before she reached the emergency exit. Kata pressed her back against the cold metal, handles digging into her back. Oddly, the pain reminded her that she was alive. At least for now. She gripped her gun tightly, determined to stay that way.</p><p>Hunter crossed her mind.</p><p>Despite the fact that he hadn\u2019t called again, she had no doubt he was worried. If she didn\u2019t escape, somehow she knew he\u2019d mourn her. For some reason, he cared, way more than she would have expected. Kata regretted like hell that she might never see him again.</p><p>God, she was in the most terrifying situation in her life, and yet she worried about a man she\u2019d met less than twenty-four hours ago. Where was her head?</p><p>Kata paused, straining to hear the shooter\u2019s breath or footsteps, but she heard nothing. This asshole, whoever he was, was good. Where the hell was he? Kata knew all too well that he hadn\u2019t gone. He likely had her cornered. He knew it . . . and so did she.</p><p>She leaned around the far edge of the desk, until she could glimpse the right half of the room, including the path to the emergency exit. No visual, no movement, no sound.</p><p>Kata took a chance, scurrying over to the next desk on her knees. The emergency exit was about four feet away, but once she left the relative safety of the desk, she had no cover between her and the exit. She\u2019d have to run in the open, pause to push the heavy door open, wait for it to part enough to let her through\u2014plenty of time for a killer to do his job.</p><p>But she had no other escape.</p><p>Drawing in a shuddering breath, Kata began counting in her head. One . . . two . . . th\u2014</p><p>Behind her, she heard a gun cock\u2014not more than a handful of inches away. She froze, her entire body turning to ice.</p><p>\u201cStay on your knees,\u201d he demanded. \u201cBow your head.\u201d</p><p>No! She had read enough about crime scenes over the years, seen plenty of gut-turning photos. Her guess was that he planned to kill her execution style. Kata tamped down her panic.</p><p>\u201cWhat is Villarreal giving you to kill me? I\u2019ll pay you cash to walk away.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, except to press the cold barrel of his gun at the base of her skull. Her heart pounded as terror and fight crept in. If he was one of Villarreal\u2019s gangster thugs, he wouldn\u2019t betray his colors. They were each other\u2019s family, often not having much of a real one. They sought power, were willing to kill for respect. Murdering a woman to help his \u201cbrother\u201d was nothing, and no amount of money she could afford to offer him would make a damn bit of difference.</p><p>\u201cSay good-bye,\u201d he growled, his Hispanic accent very pronounced.</p><p>Like hell.</p><p>Kata dove forward and flattened her belly to the floor at the same time she kicked out with all her might and struck her assailant\u2019s shin. A loud rattle of metal and a curse told Kata that she\u2019d knocked him into the desk. Then she heard the clang of a weapon, whirled to find his gun skating across the tile.</p><p>Leaping to her feet, she lunged between him and his weapon, pointing her own gun in his face. She\u2019d never seen him in her life. Hispanic male, average height and build, around thirty, shaved head, cold brown eyes. He possessed no visible tattoos but his black, long-sleeved shirt would cover most. His jeans were baggy, puddling over the tops of his high-end sneakers.</p><p>Suddenly, he smiled as if the joke was on her. \u201cYou won\u2019t pull the trigger.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit! Before Kata could mutter a word, he lunged at her, hand outstretched for her gun. She tried to get a shot off, but there was no time. She scrambled back to prevent him from tackling her, but he managed to grab her wrist. If he got his hands on her weapon, she was as good as dead. Yeah, she\u2019d love to corner this bastard and call the police so he\u2019d serve time. But she wanted to live more.</p><p>Hauling her free arm back, she let it loose and punched his face with every bit of her strength. After an audible crack, pain shot up her hand, but he stumbled. Kata ran for the emergency exit as if she were on fire, looking behind to see if her assailant followed.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t cleared the door before she felt a man\u2019s chest, hard as a brick wall, block her. Steely arms closed around her. She screamed at the unfamiliar man holding her. Tall. Sandy hair, green eyes. Gorgeous. Clearly, the guy was intimately familiar with the gym, and wore a look that said he meant business.</p><p>God, had Villarreal sent a damn hit squad to kill her?</p><p>Panicked, she struggled to reach the daylight beyond him, but she could not pass or move him. She yelled as loudly as she could, hoping someone nearby would hear, even though this business district was largely deserted on Sundays.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d The big guy pulled her away from the open door, into the alley, his voice oddly gentle for such a big man. \u201cHunter sent me.\u201d</p><p>Those words ricocheted inside her, and relief blanketed Kata, warming her cold panic. She was safe. No one in her life knew of her connection to Hunter except Ben, who\u2019d come to her apartment and cursed a blue streak when she\u2019d refused his advances and said she\u2019d wanted to be alone. No one Villarreal had sent to kill her could possibly know that by uttering those three words, she\u2019d instantly trust him. With a shaky sigh, she stared up into the stranger\u2019s calm green eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>The blond guy cast her a reassuring stare and set her behind him, then turned back through the open door, looking into her department\u2019s office space.</p><p>At the sounds of a scuffle, Kata peered around her rescuer to see another beefy blond guy with a military haircut and a grim smile holding her attacker to the ground with a large, veined hand around his neck.</p><p>Who were these guys? How had they found her so quickly?</p><p>\u201cGive me a reason to kill you,\u201d her second rescuer said. \u201cEven a small one will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, cabr\u00f3n!\u201d The thug was all bravado. He was outgunned and outmanned\u2014and from the panic in his eyes, her assailant knew it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m married, and you\u2019re not my type,\u201d said the buzz-cutted hulk. \u201cGet on your feet, scumbag.\u201d</p><p>Her would-be killer resisted, and the big stranger manhandling him looked positively gleeful when he jerked the shooter up by the arm\u2014in a way designed to dislocate his shoulder.</p><p>Suddenly, the thug screamed like a little girl.</p><p>\u201cOne more good tug will do it,\u201d the stranger warned. \u201cYou going to cooperate?\u201d</p><p>The vicious bastard who had done his best to kill her gave a jerky nod.</p><p>His captor smiled. \u201cTyler, call nine-one-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready on it.\u201d</p><p>Kata glanced as Tyler, the man who had caught her coming out the door, looped a protective arm around her waist. He had a cell phone jammed to his ear and glared at her assailant as if he\u2019d love to rip the guy in half.</p><p>Standing so close to the phone, she heard dispatch answer. He responded with all the pertinent information, his voice low and controlled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Mr. Buzz-cut asked her attacker.</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say to you,\u201d he spat out.</p><p>\u201cNot going to cooperate? You get that\u2019s going to be bad for your health, right?\u201d</p><p>His dead brown eyes narrowed. \u201cYou are not the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Which means I have no rules to follow. And if the cops get here before I can finish fucking you up as much as I\u2019d like ... well, I can make sure when you go to county lockup, you have a very horny cell mate, if you don\u2019t start talking. Now, why did you try to kill her?\u201d He pointed to Kata.</p><p>Her attacker hesitated. \u201cJust doing a job.\u201d</p><p>Kata\u2019s gut balled tightly at the answer. As she\u2019d feared, someone, probably Villarreal, wanted her dead, enough to hire the job done. A quick glance at her rescuers\u2019 faces told her that both men were blazingly pissed.</p><p>\u201cWho hired you?\u201d</p><p>Her assailant pursed his lips and looked away from his captor, his refusal to talk evident.</p><p>Tyler pocketed his phone. \u201cPolice are on their way.\u201d</p><p>The big man holding her attacker grunted. \u201cThat means I\u2019ve got about five minutes to make your face look like hamburger. No sweat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The criminal flinched, then put on his tough-guy face.

I hate pricks who threaten women. Cowardly motherfuckers.\u201d He grabbed her attacker by the hair and bunched up his fist, clearly ready to smash in his face.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d she called.</p> <p>Deke hesitated, glaring her way.</p><p>\u201cIf you hurt him too bad, they\u2019ll arrest you.

He\u2019s my brother-in-law, so when he called, I came.\u201d He secured the criminal\u2019s wrists behind his back and lowered the guy on his belly like a snake.</p> <p>Just hearing that confirmation made something in her flutter. Even hundreds of miles away, Hunter had protected her.</p><p>That sent shards of both delight and anxiety through her. She was beyond grateful that he\u2019d sent reinforcements, but clearly he had no intention of letting her go anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She heard the trembling in her own voice.</p><p>Deke planted his big combat-booted foot in the middle of her attacker\u2019s back, then grimaced. \u201cShit, you look wiped out. She\u2019s about to do a header, Tyler.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he said the words, her knees began to give way. The residual adrenaline that juiced her system bled out, turning her legs to Jell-O. She stumbled, but Tyler caught her and swept her up in his arms.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby,\u201d he murmured as he lifted her.</p> <p>Kata didn\u2019t like this shaky, overwrought feeling, how vulnerable Hunter\u2019s pursuit and the assassin\u2019s attack made her feel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she choked. \u201cPut me down.\u201d</p><p>Tyler rolled his eyes and kept walking. \u201cLet\u2019s sit to be on the safe side. Hunter would tear me a new one if I let you faint and you hit your head.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. Yeah, she could picture that. Even this poster child for bodybuilding didn\u2019t want to displease her\u2014gulp\u2014husband? Was this how everything had started for her mother, with a bit of flattering attentiveness and overprotection?</p><p>\u201cAnd you know him . . . how?\u201d</p><p>Deke and Tyler exchanged a glance. Then Tyler set her in a chair and knelt in front of her. He shrugged and hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ve . . . um, worked some with Deke\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>At that, Deke barked out laughter. \u201cMy cousin Luc would take issue with that description. He would describe it as trying hard to get in his wife\u2019s panties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could kiss my fucking ass, too.\u201d</p> <p>Leveling a considering stare at her, Deke ventured, \u201cHow do you know Hunter?\u201d</p><p>Kata froze. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t exactly time. He barked at me to protect you. I figured there\u2019d be opportunity for questions at some point. Spill.\u201d</p><p>Damn, she didn\u2019t want to be the one to tell Hunter\u2019s family they were married. And why should she? Hunter may not have any intention of ending this impulsive relationship, but Kata was having second thoughts about this marriage. And third and fourth. Not that she wasn\u2019t grateful to him for sending the cavalry, but . . .</p><p>Hunter\u2019s a total Dominant. Very into BDSM. Insists on taking complete control.</p><p>\u201cWe met in Vegas last night.\u201d A simple, safe response that didn\u2019t invite more questions.</p><p>Deke\u2019s sharp expression told her that he was mulling her answer. \u201cIt was your birthday party he flew out for. So, did he . . . make good on that favor for your mutual friend, Ben?\u201d</p><p>Kata gasped. Deke knew that Hunter had flown out to participate in her birthday m\u00e9nage? The sparkle in Deke\u2019s blue eyes said yes.</p><p>A flush crawled up her face. Why couldn\u2019t the concrete open up and swallow her whole? \u201cHunter told you about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Deke shook his head. \u201cTyler and I happened to be with him when he got the call from Ben. Otherwise, we\u2019d still be wondering where the hell he went last night and why. So, did you get your birthday wish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot . . . exactly,\u201d she hedged.</p><p>Deke frowned. \u201cDid Ben change his mind?\u201d</p><p>Tyler looked her up and down and snorted. \u201cIf Kata was my girl, I would have changed my mind. Of course, I wouldn\u2019t have invited some other schmuck to help me fuck her in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Both men turned to her expectantly.</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d Kata hesitated, mortification rolling through her. And more molten anger. Damn, who didn\u2019t know her business? And what the hell did she say now?</p><p>Deke\u2019s gaze zeroed in on her left hand, then he asked softly. \u201cShiny new ring. Did Ben marry you instead of share you last night?\u201d</p><p>Kata swallowed, trying to figure out how to derail this train wreck of a conversation. \u201cNot . . . exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Deke tensed, then pinned her with a hard stare that made Kata feel as if he could see straight through her. \u201cNow I know what I heard in Hunter\u2019s voice, besides apprehension. I heard possession. Ben didn\u2019t marry you. Hunter did.\u201d</p><p>TO all outward appearances, Hunter looked as calm as a lake on a windless day. He exercised great mental control to not pace the aisle of the plane, not imagine that, even now, Kata could be dead. But inside, the waiting, the not knowing, was fucking killing him.</p><p>How she\u2019d become everything to him in one night was a mystery to Hunter. Their eyes had connected. They\u2019d danced and kissed, then poof. That quickly, he was completely taken. He didn\u2019t love Kata . . . yet. But that was coming, his gut told him. Soon.</p><p>If she survived.</p><p>Biting back a curse, Hunter palmed his phone, already turning it on as the plane landed. The flight attendant could kiss his ass.</p><p>As soon as the little device lit up, he saw a text from Deke. They\u2019d found Kata at her office. She was fine. Attacker in custody. Detectives on scene. Thank God! Profound relief poured through him, and he sagged into his seat.</p><p>As soon as the gate opened, he strapped on his backpack and ran into the terminal to grab a taxi. Perched stiffly in the backseat of the musty-smelling vehicle, the need to hold her battling with an urge to kill the gunman, Hunter barely saw the Lafayette landscape whiz by.</p><p>Someone had tried to kill his Kata, probably for no other reason than she\u2019d done her job and reported a criminal who\u2019d failed to live up to the terms of his probation. Goddamn scum had fucked with the wrong man\u2019s woman. If the bastard tried to touch one hair on Kata\u2019s head again, Hunter swore he\u2019d bypass the police and demonstrate to the asshole every way he\u2019d ever learned to kill painfully.</p><p>The ten-minute ride to her office seemed to take two hours. Finally, the taxi pulled up in front of a nondescript office building crawling with myriad police cruisers, a pair of unmarkeds, and an ambulance. Hunter threw money at the taxi driver and bailed out at record speed.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sir.\u201d A uniformed officer stopped him at the perimeter. \u201cThis is a police investigation. You\u2019ll have to stay behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone tried to kill my wife. I\u2019d like to see her.\u201d</p><p>The youngish cop frowned. \u201cI know Kata. She\u2019s not married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is as of last night, and I\u2019m not playing this game with you anymore.\u201d Hunter dipped under the tape, dropped his backpack, and jogged off in search of Kata.</p><p>There. In a chair, she sat with her head between her legs, trying not to faint. The late afternoon sunlight glinted off the rich red and brown strands of her hair. Tyler knelt beside her, hand on her knee, pressing a bottle of water into her grip. A detective barked questions at her. Everything about the scene set Hunter\u2019s protective instincts off.</p><p>He jogged his way to Kata and cupped her shoulders, dragging her against him. She lifted her face, and he tried not to curse. She looked pale, shocked, exhausted, her mouth set in a grim line. Her eyes said she\u2019d endured too much for one day.</p><p>\u201cHunter.\u201d</p><p>Even her voice shook.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, honey. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to back away, sir. I\u2019m questioning the witness,\u201d the detective insisted.</p><p>Hunter got up in the idiot\u2019s impassive face. \u201cMy wife is in no position to be questioned right now. Have you goddamn looked at her? She\u2019s either going to faint or give out. She may be in shock. I don\u2019t want you saying another word to her until medical has checked her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, Hunter.\u201d She looked annoyed. \u201cI can speak for myself.\u201d</p><p>The steel in her tone surprised him, though he guessed it shouldn\u2019t. That combination of strength and softness was one of the things that made him so hard for her. He would find other qualities that drew him to her, and once he knew her better, he\u2019d add those to the list and fall deeper. For better or for worse . . .</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d he offered softly.</p><p>\u201cI want to. And I refused medical. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Was she fucking serious? One look at her, and he knew better. \u201cExcept that you\u2019re having trouble staying upright.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him, clearly not liking his sarcasm. \u201cLook, it\u2019s been a really eventful twenty-four hours. I\u2019m grateful that you sent Tyler and Deke. But I don\u2019t need you in my face, barking at me. I just want to finish up here, so I can go home and get some sleep. It\u2019s already stressful enough that this stranger won\u2019t admit why he tried to kill me or who hired him.\u201d</p><p>Hunter froze. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Villarreal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that he\u2019ll admit.\u201d Kata shrugged. \u201cThe police will figure it out. I\u2019ll be fine. I just need rest. I know work is going to be a bitch tomorrow, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork?\u201d Oh, hell no. \u201cIf you\u2019re on someone\u2019s hit list, then you\u2019re not coming here or going anywhere out of my sight until I figure out how to put a stop to this shit.\u201d</p><p>Kata bolted to her feet\u2014and immediately had to brace herself on the chair.</p><p>Beside her, Tyler stood quietly, shaking his head. \u201cShit\u2019s gonna hit the fan now . . .\u201d</p><p>Hunter and Kata both ignored him.</p><p>Drawing in a sharp, steadying breath, she looked her husband in the eye as she pulled herself to her full height\u2014which meant the underside of his chin. But she didn\u2019t let that deter her.</p><p>\u201cBen told me what you\u2019re into, but I\u2019m never going to be the meek little woman. That should have been clear in Vegas. I won\u2019t ask anyone\u2019s permission to do what I want, Hunter, especially not to go to work. One incident won\u2019t keep me from a job I love. As soon as I get some sleep, I\u2019ll be fine. I get that you\u2019re worried about me. That\u2019s sweet, but I\u2019ve been trained to defend myself. This office will be full of people tomorrow, and I have folks I can call for backup, if necessary. But I fought this thug off today by myself. I got away with my brains, my gut, and my determination to fight back.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s gut tightened. She was a stubborn thing. Strong. That would only make her surrender all the sweeter. But for now, he needed to talk her off the ledge.</p><p>He gentled his voice. \u201cI\u2019m proud that you fought him off all on your own. I feel better knowing that you can. But I\u2019m here to take care of you. I\u2019ve defended people for Uncle Sam for the past decade. This prick won\u2019t even get in the same zip code until I catch him. I\u2019ll keep you safe; I promise.\u201d He held out his hand.</p><p>Kata backed away. \u201cI appreciate your concern, but I\u2019m a grown woman. I\u2019ve lived alone and paid my own way for the last seven years. I make my own decisions. Don\u2019t pull this high-handed heman crap on me.\u201d She raked fingers through her long hair, looking exhausted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough of it to last me a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>Damn, the stepfather again, he\u2019d guess. Frustration pressed in on Hunter. Gritting his teeth, he pushed it down. Kata wasn\u2019t thinking with the right fear, hadn\u2019t realized that he wasn\u2019t the enemy. But he\u2019d make sure she got some rest\u2014and some peace. Then she\u2019d realize he was right.</p><p>He snagged her hand, bracketed his thumb and forefinger around her new wedding band, wiggling it just enough to remind her that he\u2019d put it there. \u201cI spoke vows to love, honor, and cherish you. That includes protecting you.\u201d He leaned closer, spoke softly in her ear. \u201cSo if I have to tie you to my goddamn bed and keep you naked and busy until we catch this guy, don\u2019t think that will bother me one bit.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cHUNTER, what the hell is going on?\u201d a familiar feminine voice called from behind him.</p><p>Stifling a scowl, he turned to find Deke standing in the doorway with his arm curled around his wife, Kimber. Hunter\u2019s gaze swept over his sister. She looked happy, healthy\u2014and very pregnant. He hadn\u2019t been Stateside in months. Seeing his baby sister preparing to have a baby of her own was a shock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wondering how much Kimber had heard of the speech he\u2019d just given Kata made him wince.</p><p>\u201cHi, little sister. You look great! When did you say your due date is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello to you. Next week. Don\u2019t change the subject.\u201d She glowered, pulling away from Deke to approach him\u2014and cutting a sidelong glance at Kata. \u201cTell me what\u2019s up, or I\u2019ll beat it out of you. Pregnancy hormones can make a woman vicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit\u2019s really going to hit the fan now,\u201d Tyler predicted with a laugh in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cHer temper is short these days,\u201d Deke confirmed.</p><p>\u201cCan it, both of you,\u201d she tossed over her shoulder at the men.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Deke shot Hunter a look that warned him to cooperate.</p><p>If the situation had been less serious, he might have laughed. Instead, he glared at Deke. \u201cWhy is she here? No pregnant woman, especially my sister, should be anywhere near the scene of an attempted murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if either of you could stop me from coming.\u201d Kimber snorted. \u201cNow, cut the macho crap, and start explaining why I\u2019m hearing about your marriage from Deke, and not you.\u201d She stopped before Kata and held out a hand. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Kimber Trenton, by the way. Can I get you something?\u201d</p> <p>Kata, looking both weary and rattled, shook her head and extended a shaky hand. \u201cKata Mu\u00f1oz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdgington,\u201d Hunter reminded, teeth gritted.</p><p>Kata looked away, and fresh dread sliced through his gut.</p><p>\u201cSo it is true that you got married? When?\u201d Kimber demanded.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the right time, but nothing was going to stop Kimber from digging for information except the truth. \u201cLast night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you have steel balls. You got married without first telling your family? Did it ever occur to you that maybe we\u2019d want to be there? In fact, not only was your family not invited, we\u2019ve never heard the merest mention of Kata. How long have you two been dating?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t dated at all,\u201d Kata piped up. \u201cThe marriage was a stupid impulse. A drunken mistake in Vegas. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve caused your family any trouble.\u201d</p><p>Those words cut like a knife. Marrying Kata was dead-on right. Even seeing her now, shaken and skittish, he knew that. Since she still wore her wedding ring, he\u2019d hoped that, somewhere deep down, she sensed that they belonged together, too. She just hadn\u2019t\u2014or couldn\u2019t\u2014admit it. Yet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a mistake,\u201d he bit out, facing her with challenge in his eyes.</p><p>The women ignored him.</p><p>\u201cKata, I\u2019m not yelling at you,\u201d Kimber assured, then she turned to Hunter. \u201cBut you . . . I don\u2019t even know where to start.\u201d</p><p>The wedding hadn\u2019t exactly been planned, damn it, and he wouldn\u2019t let Kimber rake him over the coals for not telling her in advance. But God knows, she\u2019d try.</p><p>\u201cRemember when you criticized me for my . . . unconventional relationship with Deke before my marriage? I could say, \u2018Pot, meet Kettle,\u2019 since you barely know Kata\u2014pretty name, by the way. But I realize it\u2019s your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he growled.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. But it\u2019s clear you know shit about being married. A year hasn\u2019t made me a huge expert, but one thing I can tell you is that if Deke ever threatened me the way you just did her, we\u2019d be doing ten rounds of verbal smackdown in the parking lot.\u201d</p><p>Kimber had heard that? Damn . . .</p><p>Tyler coughed to smother a laugh. Deke pressed his lips together and turned away in a futile attempt not to burst out laughing. Hunter threw them both a killing glare.</p><p>Maybe Kimber was right, but Kata was independent, stubborn. She\u2019d never admit to needing his help to stay safe. Begging her to accept his protection would likely fall on deaf ears, even though she could have been killed tonight. Besides, as Hunter glanced around at the crime scene, he got a bad feeling. Things weren\u2019t adding up.</p><p>\u201cKitten,\u201d Deke said to Kimber. \u201cKata\u2019s been shot at, and you know how we men are about protecting our wives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally familiar with testosterone overload. But if Kata\u2019s just been attacked, she needs comfort and kindness, not someone threatening to tie her to the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the tactic I would have taken,\u201d Deke admitted. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Tyler chimed in. \u201cYou\u2019d tie Kimber to the bed for just about any reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough.\u201d Deke repressed a smile as he met his wife\u2019s stare, then sobered again. \u201cKata thinks she\u2019s going back to work before we know why someone is trying to kill her and, in Hunter\u2019s shoes, I\u2019d do whatever necessary to keep my wife safe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause threatening her after she\u2019s just been threatened makes so much sense.\u201d Kimber rolled her eyes, looking like her patience was about to unravel. \u201cCan I talk to you for a minute, Hunter? Alone?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. Kimber\u2019s question was code for: Can I chew your ass out in private? But he figured he\u2019d either pay now or pay in spades later. Whatever his and Kimber\u2019s differences had been in the past, he loved his sister. If she wanted to talk, hell, he\u2019d listen.</p><p>\u201cYou going to be okay for a minute?\u201d he asked Kata, smoothing a gentle palm down her back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been insisting for a while now that I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Kata braced her hands on her hips and raised her chin.</p><p>Even her pose didn\u2019t mitigate how vulnerable and afraid she looked. Shaky. Rattled. Worry torqued his gut. Why was the woman being so stubborn? She said she\u2019d seen enough of controlling men to last her a lifetime and likened him to her stepfather. But he couldn\u2019t afford to ease up now, not with such a short time line before he returned to active duty and with a killer on the loose.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSit down, honey. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as Detective Montrose is done with me, I\u2019m going home and going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot alone. And not before you know whether someone dangerous might be at your place, too, waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Kata hesitated, and Hunter knew that possibility hadn\u2019t crossed her mind. That fact alone told him that keeping her close, safe, protected, was the right move\u2014even if she didn\u2019t like it. Without someone able to watch her back, she could be dead.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a random attack,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWhy would some killer assume there\u2019d be anyone to target in the probation office on a Sunday? Your car is the only one in the employee lot, honey. He knew you were here and alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how? You were the only person who knew I was here.\u201d</p><p>Hunter reared back. The implied accusation was far worse than a slap. \u201cI was on a plane,\u201d he ground out, \u201ctalking to you from the moment you told me the address to your office until I heard gunfire over the line. How the hell would I have told anyone besides Deke and Tyler where to find you in those, what? Two minutes? Why would I call them to save you if I wanted you dead?\u201d</p><p>God, he was pissed. Blazingly, furiously pissed. Not necessarily at Kata\u2014though he couldn\u2019t claim to be thrilled, either\u2014but at the situation. If she thought for a second that he\u2019d be capable of sending a killer after her, they had bigger trust issues than he\u2019d thought.</p><p>Regret tightened Kata\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re right. That doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just . . .\u201d She bit her lip, fighting tears. \u201cI\u2019m a little scared.\u201d</p><p>Hunter didn\u2019t want to scare her more, but he did want her to see reason. \u201cI know. My theory is that this guy followed you from your apartment. Whoever wants you dead knows where you live. I want to make you safe again.\u201d He turned to the other men for backup. \u201cTyler, Deke, you know she can\u2019t go home alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chance in hell.\u201d Tyler crossed his arms over his chest and stood in front of Kata, effectively blocking her path to the parking lot. \u201cHunter\u2019s right, baby.\u201d</p><p>Hunter didn\u2019t like the other man\u2019s endearment directed at his wife. But before he could take Tyler\u2019s head off, Kimber grabbed Hunter by the arm and dragged him about twenty feet away.</p><p>\u201cAre you hearing yourself?\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I stated a fact. She can\u2019t go home alone until we know it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but it\u2019s the way you said it.\u201d Kimber smacked her forehead with her palm. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re thickheaded, Hunter. But I know you would have never married anyone, much less a virtual stranger, unless you were sure she was the one.\u201d</p><p>Kimber\u2019s insight shouldn\u2019t have surprised him. His sister was a smart cookie. \u201cExactly. So I\u2019m going to protect Kata.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that\u2019s how you feel.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cBut you have to tread a bit more carefully. You heard her, right? She already thinks the marriage was a mistake and doesn\u2019t want to be bullied by you or anyone.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, it wasn\u2019t a surprise. Kata had been fighting him since just after they\u2019d hit the sheets. She needed to know him better, be reassured, fall for him. Their first full day of marriage had begun inauspiciously, given that Kata hadn\u2019t remembered they\u2019d married at all. Since then, everything had become a shit storm. Knowing she was in danger made him really edgy.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to keep her happy and keep her in this marriage, you can\u2019t run her over like a semi,\u201d Kimber argued. \u201cDad did that for years to Mom. Look where that landed them.\u201d</p><p>Hunter recoiled. \u201cAmanda and the Colonel have nothing to do with Kata and me. I\u2019m not giving up on this marriage without a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a goddamned idiot. Mom and Dad\u2019s breakup has everything to do with your behavior. Get a clue. All this pushiness is going to bite you in the ass. Unless you want to watch Kata walk out the door, back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDO you know anyone who would want to kill you?\u201d</p><p>Detective Montrose\u2019s voice jerked Kata\u2019s attention away from Hunter. What were he and his sister bickering about, while Deke and Tyler tried to edge close enough to hear? She was chewing Hunter a new one\u2014and predictably, he wasn\u2019t backing down. Kimber hadn\u2019t given any indication that she disapproved of Hunter\u2019s choice of a wife, but ...</p><p>Kata looked away. It didn\u2019t matter if his family didn\u2019t like her. She and Hunter weren\u2019t going to be married long enough for her to care about their opinion. But Kata had to admit that she already liked Kimber. And the sight of Hunter taking a verbal lashing from his very pregnant baby sister made her smile. That he\u2019d stand still and listen said something good about him. Certainly, Gordon would have never tolerated this kind of dressing down from any female.</p><p>The fortyish detective pushed his sunglasses up his nose, looking both fried in the hot late May humidity and annoyed at her lack of attention. \u201cMs. Mu\u00f1oz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. You asked about people wanting to kill me? Yeah. Like I said, I\u2019m a probation officer, so there\u2019s probably a list. I think you already wrote down Cortez Villarreal\u2019s name. He\u2019s my top suspect and one of the Gangster Disciples. There\u2019s a warrant out for him already.\u201d</p><p>He flipped back through his notes. \u201cRight. I\u2019ll see if we\u2019ve picked him up.\u201d The detective jerked his cell phone from his waist and punched a few buttons. \u201cBoudreaux there? I\u2019ll wait.\u201d Then he looked at her again. \u201cAnyone else who might want you dead?\u201d</p><p>She mentally scanned through her caseload. No one else stood out. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA family member? A frenemy?\u201d</p><p>No doubt, her stepfather disliked her, but Gordon had never been violent, just a manipulative jackass with a coal chip for a heart. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cFormer lover?\u201d</p><p>The only one who had any reason to be pissed at her was Ben, but he hadn\u2019t been jealous that she\u2019d married Hunter, just annoyed that she\u2019d refused him more sex. He\u2019d apologize in a day or two, as he always did when they fought. Despite having been a soldier, Ben wasn\u2019t much of a fighter. \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d</p><p>Montrose jotted a note. \u201cYou said you\u2019d never seen your attacker before. You\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny chance he could be associated with Villarreal?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI guess. When this guy arrives at lockup, they should check him for ink.\u201d</p><p>The detective nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s the easiest way to tell if he has any street affiliations. The suspect should be there now. I\u2019ll ask as soon as\u2014\u201d Suddenly, he turned his attention back to the phone. \u201cHey, Armand. You got a Cortez Villarreal in there? Would have come in on a warrant.\u201d A moment later, he cursed. \u201cYou don\u2019t. Talk to me about that perp who just came in for attempted murder, can you check\u2014\u201d The detective scowled. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Then he flinched in shock. \u201cFuck! When?\u201d The detective closed his eyes and sighed. \u201cKeep me posted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked impatiently, her stomach knotting painfully. \u201cDid he get away?\u201d</p><p>Montrose flipped his phone shut and hesitated. \u201cDo you have anywhere to go? That\u2019s safe, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Home. A hot shower, then a nap in her own bed sounded heavenly . . . but Hunter\u2019s earlier warning and the detective\u2019s sudden jumpiness made Kata rethink that. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man who tried to kill you today was stabbed within ten minutes of hitting his cell. Inside job. Professional.\u201d</p> <p>Kata started to shake. \u201cHe\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Montrose ripped off his sunglasses and stared with grave, dark eyes. \u201cWhoever is after you went to great pains to clean up his loose ends. He means business.\u201d</p><p>Hunter was right; this attack hadn\u2019t been random. In fact, her assailant had admitted that he was doing a job. Someone had hired him\u2014then, once he\u2019d been caught, snuffed him before he could talk to the police.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t ID\u2019d your would-be killer yet. He had no ink linking him to the Gangster Disciples or anyone else. That doesn\u2019t mean anything, but maybe your murder would have been his initiation or . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looked too old to just be hitting the streets.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed. \u201cYeah, who knows? But you need to be careful. Stay someplace safe for a while.\u201d</p><p>No shit. But where? Kata started to shake again, reached out for the chair behind her to steady herself. Someone wanted her cold in a grave\u2014quickly.</p><p>Home was too obvious. She couldn\u2019t go to Marisol\u2019s without putting her sister and nephews in danger. Nor could she risk her mam\u00e1. Gordon would only make her mother\u2019s life worse if she dropped by unannounced and asked to stay. After everything Mam\u00e1 had been through, Kata couldn\u2019t make the woman\u2019s life harder. Besides, the less time Kata had to spend with Gordon, the better.</p><p>Where did that leave her? Driving to her brother, Joaquin? Was he still in Houston? She didn\u2019t know. For the past year, he\u2019d been deep undercover\u2014he\u2019d never say who for. Joaquin was like a ghost to the family, there but not.</p><p>Kata sighed, raked her hand through her hair. Ben didn\u2019t deserve to be in danger, and their friendship had been strictly casual, convenient. Maybe she could grab her gun, withdraw some cash, then run for it, staying off the grid until things cooled down. But if there was a hit out on her, the matter wouldn\u2019t be resolved until whoever had hired the gun called it off or she was dead. Not palatable choices.</p><p>Through bits of conversation over the last few hours, Kata had gleaned that Deke was half owner of a personal protection business, along with some guy named Jack, who was out of town. Tyler, a former homicide detective, helped out from time to time. Could she persuade them to help her for the right price? Possibly . . . but they were Hunter\u2019s friends. They\u2019d defer to him.</p> <p>That left her with her new, unexpected husband. If she asked for his help, would he see that as some sort of implied consent to take over her life? Maybe that sounded paranoid, but she\u2019d seen Gordon in action for too many years, and Ben had already warned her that Hunter liked to dominate. But both appeared to be control freaks with a deafness to the word \u201cno\u201d and a knack for manipulating matters\u2014and women\u2014to their liking.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t fair to lump Hunter and her stepfather together. Kata knew she hadn\u2019t been at her most magnanimous last night. And her husband appeared to lack Gordon\u2019s mean spirit.</p><p>You\u2019re so fucking gorgeous, honey. Hunter\u2019s voice echoed in her head, very different from the way Gordon talked to Mam\u00e1.</p><p>She sneaked a glance at Hunter. He stood tall, focused, his stance and body that of a warrior. He would be totally capable of keeping her out of harm\u2019s way. But haunting memories of his large hands heating her skin, shoving her thighs apart, his threat to tie her to his bed, plagued her. He\u2019d gotten to her on every level, more than any man ever had.</p><p>Even so, avoiding the vulnerability and fear he pushed her to feel wasn\u2019t worth dying for.</p><p>\u201cDo you have someplace to go?\u201d Montrose barked again in low tones, breaking into her thoughts.</p><p>Where she wouldn\u2019t have to sleep with one eye open and a gun under her pillow? \u201cNo. But Hunter will.\u201d</p><p>GRIPPING the steering wheel of Tyler\u2019s truck, Hunter stared at the thin traffic meandering around Lafayette early on a Sunday evening The sun shone, the birds sang. People on the corner ate ice cream. And the fury bubbling inside him tested his composure to its limits.</p> <p>Some asshole wanted his wife dead. His brief but enlightening conversation with Detective Montrose made matters worse.</p><p>Hunter\u2019s only consolation was that she had come to him for protection. Somewhere inside that stubborn woman\u2019s head and heart, she trusted him. He would work with that\u2014as soon as he figured out how to end this threat to her life.</p><p>\u201cYou did the right thing in letting me protect you,\u201d he assured. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Kata shook her head, the inky, long hair brushing her arms, the tops of her breasts he remembered tasting. Her lips still looked swollen, her eyes a bit red and heavy from lack of sleep. The adrenaline crash had to be gnawing away at her energy, but other than one dicey moment earlier, she refused to show weakness.</p><p>Too bad his adrenaline hadn\u2019t come down yet. All he wanted to do was beat the hell out of whoever wanted to hurt Kata. Or fuck her. Preferably both. Didn\u2019t look like either would happen for a while.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your help, but let\u2019s get one thing straight.\u201d She turned to him in the cozy cab with a warning glare. \u201cI turned to you because I\u2019m not sure I can do this alone, but I don\u2019t want you to take over.\u201d</p><p>In his book? Same thing. She had no experience with this kind of shit, and he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let her put herself at risk for the sake of her stubborn pride. She could decorate the house however she wanted, name the pets, choose the vacations. He\u2019d give her a lot of latitude during their married life, but he was in charge when it came to sex and her safety.</p><p>With Kimber\u2019s words ringing in his head and Kata\u2019s desertion this morning playing in an endless loop in his brain, Hunter wished he could afford to back off. He couldn\u2019t, but maybe he could find a gentle way to make her see his logic.</p><p>Hunter nodded in her direction. \u201cAll right. What did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Her expression told him that she hadn\u2019t thought too much about the answer. \u201cI\u2014I guess a safe house somewhere, at least until the police catch Cortez Villarreal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a safe house.\u201d</p><p>Logan probably wouldn\u2019t appreciate the added intrusion of another person on his leave, but tough shit. If Hunter knew one thing, it was that his brother was every bit as cautious as he was. Logan\u2019s bachelor pad was full of military-grade security. Hunter would handle the rest of his brother\u2019s special equipment on an as-needed basis.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She nodded, looking shaky and near her breaking point. \u201cI appreciate that. As soon as I\u2019ve had time to think, I\u2019ll start taking care of myself, but for now, I think you hiding me is the best move. Almost no one knows we\u2019re connected, especially someone on the street like Cortez Villarreal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that . . .\u201d Hunter wished he didn\u2019t have to give her bad news now, but there was too much at stake to withhold the truth. \u201cLet\u2019s think this through. The assassin said he was hired, not that his street boss had told him to roll you over. From what the detective said, he couldn\u2019t see any tattoos that identified the shooter as a Gangster Disciple. For argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say that he isn\u2019t a street thug but a real hired killer.\u201d</p><p>Kata recoiled, looking even paler. Clearly, she hadn\u2019t let herself seriously entertain the notion before now. \u201cB-but if that\u2019s true, why did he miss me when he shot? How did I get away?\u201d</p><p>As much as he hated to burst her bubble, he had to press on. \u201cI\u2019d guess it\u2019s because you gave him more fight than he expected, and you threw him off guard. That he\u2019s a professional fits. When Deke tackled him, the guy was carrying a SIG 232. The barrel was threaded so he could use a silencer, if needed. It was in his pocket, in fact. We\u2019re talking about some of the best equipment. Not impossible to fall into a gangster\u2019s hands\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut unlikely.\u201d Her voice shook, then she closed her eyes, drew in a deep breath. \u201cWhat else? I can hear it in your voice.\u201d</p><p>Smart girl . . . She\u2019d been through a lot in the last twenty-four hours\u2014marathon sex, an unexpected wedding, a hangover, and an attempt on her life. Kata was shaken but not defeated. His respect for her went up another notch.</p><p>Hunter tried to lay this out as gently as possible. \u201cUsually assassins are like ghosts. They\u2019ll just \u2018clean up,\u2019 take out a target with a high-powered scope and sniper rifle at a distance. The closer an assassin is to the target, the greater his risk of being caught or ID\u2019d and jeopardizing the mission. But if the person hiring the assassin wants others to know the target was intentionally iced, then when they hire the killer, they\u2019ll tell him to put on \u2018a show.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cTh-the guy who came after me was putting on a show.\u201d Kata didn\u2019t ask; she knew. Nervously, she swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Why else had he come in such close range, onto the target\u2019s turf, eschewing his silencer, rather than waiting on the high-rise across the street until she walked into the parking lot? Whoever had masterminded this attack wanted to make a public statement. Question was, about what? And to whom?</p><p>This whole episode might be related to a gangster\u2019s revenge or Kata\u2019s temporary disruption of his drug trade. But that didn\u2019t feel right. And if there was already a warrant out for Villarreal\u2019s arrest, why put on a show like this and piss the cops off more? There were a lot of ways to make an example out of someone without spending the time and money to hire an assassin.</p><p>Fuck. \u201cWe need to keep trying to figure out who would do this to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wracked my brains, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry about it now, honey. You\u2019re exhausted. Sleep for a bit. We\u2019ll talk in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHours? My apartment is on the other side of town. I need a few things before we go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Hunter steered the truck onto I-49. \u201cNo stops. We\u2019re going to Dallas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my suitcase? It was in the trunk of my car. Did you get it from Tyler before he drove off in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Getting you away from there quickly was more important.\u201d</p><p>Kata looked lost and frustrated. He understood that she was angry at the situation, not him\u2014but he was the only available outlet for her irritation. He wished she wouldn\u2019t wear herself out unnecessarily . . . but Kata wasn\u2019t a soldier trained to contain her emotions, channel them to something useful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I need my vitamins, a toothbrush\u2014\u201d</p><p>He leveled a stare at her across the cozy truck\u2019s cab. \u201cIs there anything at your place that\u2019s more important than your life?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you replacements once we reach my brother\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to have clean underwear . . .\u201d</p><p>Hunter did his best to distract her with a smoldering smile. \u201cHoney, if I have my way, you\u2019ll never need those again.\u201d</p><p>Kata rolled her eyes and did her best to look annoyed, but he saw the blush crawl up her cheeks. \u201cYou think about sex all the time.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWhen you\u2019re near me, yeah.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest, but not before Hunter noticed that her nipples had tightened. \u201cWe have more important things going on, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I do. Don\u2019t worry, honey.\u201d</p><p>As she closed her eyes for a moment, some of the starch left Kata. \u201cHard not to.\u201d</p><p>Hunter grimaced. Every mission he went on, he figured that he had an enemy who would kill him if he didn\u2019t finish them off first. Hell, he knew a few of those shadowy figures from his past had put hits out on him. In every case, they\u2019d given up or Hunter had made sure they went down instead. Kata had no experience with this, and it had to be scaring the hell out of her.</p><p>Still, he tried not to step on her toes.</p><p>\u201cAny plans beyond tonight? How are you going to rid yourself of the threat?\u201d He didn\u2019t think she had the first idea. He\u2019d love to be proven wrong, but if not . . . well, he needed her to admit that before he moved in and took over. Or she\u2019d be blazingly pissed.</p><p>\u201cI c-can call some of my cop friends, like Trey, see what they might have heard. If this wasn\u2019t Villarreal\u2019s work, I have to figure out who ordered the hit . . .\u201d Kata paused, blinked, then looked up at him with a furrowed brow before wrenching away.</p><p>But not before he saw tears in her eyes.</p><p>Hunter hated seeing his wife, so assertive and sexy, looking ready to crumble. Once he figured out who the motherfucker responsible for this threat was, he\u2019d be lucky to live long enough to take a last breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She exhaled on a shaky sigh. \u201cBut without all that, I can\u2019t hope to have anyone arrested or brought to trial so I can have my life back. Damn it, I\u2019ve never been helpless, and I won\u2019t start now.\u201d</p><p>So fiercely independent. No doubt, she was going to keep his life interesting for the next fifty years.</p><p>He grabbed her hand, squeezed. \u201cYou\u2019re not. Far from it.\u201d</p><p>Kata scoffed. \u201cLook at me. I\u2019m shaking and confused. I don\u2019t know what to do next. I have to figure this out quickly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave any interest in lying down and dying?\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind. \u201cHell, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl. Some people crack and, not knowing how to deal, they give up and wait for the inevitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not inevitable.\u201d</p><p>Hunter smiled. It was good to see her moxie again.</p> <p>\u201cIf you fight, it\u2019s not. You, honey, are a fighter. I needed you to realize that for yourself. I knew it because you fended off a professional today, got a jump on him. I\u2019m proud as hell.\u201d</p><p>A smile crept across her mouth before it fell again. \u201cBut other than fighting constantly, I don\u2019t know any way of dealing with this ... prick who wants to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeke and his business partner, Jack, will help us dig until we figure out who\u2019s behind this. Until we have more information, I don\u2019t want to trust any of the cops you know. I\u2019ll bet some of them were on duty when your attacker was processed today. And he was murdered. Until we know what\u2019s going on, let\u2019s not involve anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re my friends. They would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you willing to bet your life on that?\u201d</p><p>Kata hesitated, chewed on her bottom lip. \u201cNo, but why should I trust Deke and Jack?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re the best.\u201d Hunter reached across the cab and grabbed her hand. \u201cHoney, once we figure out who\u2019s behind all this, we\u2019ll have to act. As long as we wait for this guy to make all the moves, we\u2019re at his mercy. Once we figure out who\u2019s behind this, we\u2019ll take the fight to him, dictate the terms and the tempo, keep him guessing and off guard. He\u2019ll get sloppy, make mistakes. We\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best defense is a good offense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Are you up for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t, and Hunter was proud of her for facing it. A professional hit would send most women into a panicked frenzy. But Kata had done her best to remain calm. She\u2019d acknowledged her shortcomings in tracking down a killer and listened to logic. Even at her most vulnerable, she\u2019d refused to give up the fight.</p><p>Hunter damn sure wasn\u2019t giving up\u2014on keeping her safe or preserving their marriage. He hadn\u2019t chased Kata this far to let her slip through his fingers. He tightened his grip on the wheel. Kata scooted across the bucket seat, closer, then leaned her head on his shoulder. As he wrapped his arm around her, she curled herself even tighter around his heart. This woman was meant for him. Damn. Less than a week\u2014that\u2019s all the time he had to save her life and make her fall in love with him. Failure wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>IT was damn near midnight when Hunter parked Tyler\u2019s truck in front of Logan\u2019s condo on the northeast side of Dallas. Long fucking day after such an eventful night, but he could go many hours without sleep. Days, if he had to.</p> <p>Hunter looked over at Kata, snuggled against his side, sleeping peacefully with her head on his shoulder. He didn\u2019t like the smudges under her eyes or that she\u2019d refused dinner when they\u2019d stopped on the road. During the drive, she\u2019d said almost nothing.</p><p>He\u2019d refused to let her use her cell phone to contact her family, especially to say where she was going and who she was with. After he\u2019d explained that her phone could be monitored, Kata had been frustrated but resigned. She\u2019d used a pay phone to call Mari and assure her that, despite whatever the evening news said, she was just fine, and to let their mother know. Then Kata had called her boss to arrange a week off. Back in the truck, she\u2019d curled her knees to her chest and stared out the windshield, looking shell-shocked. Damn, he\u2019d do anything to wipe that expression off her face. When he caught the son of a bitch threatening her, he\u2019d force-feed the bastard his own balls.</p><p>But first Hunter had to take care of his wife.</p><p>Gently, he shook her awake. \u201cWe\u2019re here, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Her lashes fluttered. Her lips parted.</p><p>In an instant, she made him hard. Stifling his urge to kiss her until she was clinging and wet, then sink deep into her pussy so he could connect deep into her, he settled for a light touch, brushing the hair from her face. \u201cI\u2019ll come around and get you. Gather up your stuff.\u201d</p><p>Finally, his words seemed to register, and she sat up and grabbed her purse.</p><p>Hunter hopped out of the truck, vaguely irritated with the muggy night, then circled around the vehicle to open her door. Before she could protest, he scooped her up in his arms.</p><p>Her eyes flew open. \u201cYou can put me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not taking away my fun.\u201d</p><p>The amusement she tried to hide bled through her exhaustion. \u201cCarrying me can\u2019t be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I like you right here.\u201d He raised his arms, lowered his head, and pressed a soft kiss to her mouth.</p><p>Her kiss was flavored with peppermint and a hint of the vanilla milkshake he\u2019d finally plied her with a hundred miles ago. And sin. She always tasted like it, was made for it, and he wanted to share it with her again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of walking,\u201d she insisted, even as she wound her arms around his neck and rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I love the way you walk, hips swaying, ass swinging. Hmm . . .\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cNice to know that you watch my ass so closely.\u201d</p><p>A moment of sweet harmony flowed between them, and satisfaction settled into Hunter\u2019s belly as he laughed. \u201cI watch your everything closely, honey. Trust me, it\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s front door loomed ahead. On the little porch, Hunter reluctantly lowered Kata to her feet. His younger brother wasn\u2019t due home for at least two days, and Hunter would be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t looking forward to the privacy with his bride. As honeymoons went, this sucked. But on his next leave, he\u2019d make it up to her.</p><p>For now, spending time together here would have to do.</p><p>As he retrieved his key and inserted it in the lock, he hesitated, hoping that Logan\u2019s taste in d\u00e9cor had improved since last year. But Hunter wasn\u2019t betting on it.</p><p>The lock turned, then he entered the code on the keypad that controlled the dead bolt. The second trigger for that catch, a thumbprint scan, was located just under the doorbell. A green laser and a ding later, the door finally opened.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. Is your brother paranoid?\u201d</p><p>He stifled his smile. \u201cHe\u2019s a SEAL, too. In our line of work, honey, you make enemies. It pays to be cautious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess he doesn\u2019t have anyone watering his houseplants while he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Hunter stifled a smile. \u201cLogan doesn\u2019t allow strangers into his domain.\u201d</p><p>Kata shrank back from the door. \u201cThen he won\u2019t appreciate me being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re family now. Inside.\u201d</p><p>Pressing a guiding hand to the small of her back, he ushered her over the threshold into the pitch-black room. One step in, a shrill beeping assaulted his ears. He grabbed her elbow, pressed her to the wall, then locked the door behind them. \u201cStay here. He\u2019s armed the motion sensors.\u201d</p><p>The warning chime of the interior alarm played hell with the headache developing at the base of Hunter\u2019s neck, but he zeroed in on the little backlit pad and punched the appropriate code. The high-pitched screech stopped immediately. Finally, blessed silence.</p><p>\u201cIs there a light in this place?\u201d Her voice trembled.</p><p>Hunter reset the exterior alarm and reached for Kata, wrapping his arm around her waist and leading her through the dark living room. He intentionally left the lights off. She\u2019d see plenty of this place tomorrow. No need to add one more shock to her already-crazy day.</p><p>\u201cNot necessary. Just stay near me. I\u2019ll get you settled.\u201d</p><p>She walked hesitantly, digging in her heels. \u201cWait! I\u2019m going to trip and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to trust me, honey. Do you think I would let anything happen to you?\u201d</p><p>Kata hesitated. Hunter knew the instant she realized that, if he was protecting her from killers, he\u2019d keep her from hurting herself while crossing the dark room.</p><p>She relaxed. \u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he interrupted. It didn\u2019t matter what she planned to say. She needed to know one truth. \u201cI would never let anything happen to you. I should spank your ass red for even thinking I would.\u201d</p><p>Her gasp shot straight to his cock. Sitting next to her for hours, her scent, soft and womanly, filling up in the cab of the truck, while she\u2019d curled trustingly against his side with her hand on his thigh, had revved him up.</p><p>\u201cYou did not say just that. Don\u2019t you dare think you\u2019re going to spank me,\u201d she growled.</p><p>Hunter smiled in the dark. \u201cDare? Honey, I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop trying to keep me off balance and forcing me to rely on you. Just . . . stop.\u201d</p><p>He understood the trepidation in her voice. Last night, he hadn\u2019t expected to take the lead. By all rights, that had been Ben\u2019s honor, who was vanilla all the way. So Hunter hadn\u2019t come prepared for anything more than a good time. Then his buddy\u2019s drunkenness and Hunter\u2019s own possessiveness had changed the plan. He\u2019d been unprepared to lead her in any sort of D/s scene. But here, alone . . . Yeah. He couldn\u2019t wait to show her exactly how much he\u2019d dare.</p><p>A few steps more, and he ushered her into the master suite, setting the motion sensors in the living room, then shutting and locking the bedroom door behind them. He flipped on the overhead light. A bright glow spilled out over the heavy two-toned gray comforter, its pattern thoroughly modern. The black upholstered and brushed nickel headboard sat against the charcoal walls, between two vertical windows with dark blinds drawn tight. A dresser, matching nightstand, and area rug\u2014all black\u2014added to the heavy air in the room. The only shred of warmth was the Brazilian cherry floors and the bridal portrait of Kimber. The rest? Off-putting and impersonal, just the way Logan liked things.</p><p>Idly, Hunter wondered how long it would take her to notice the manacles dangling from chains down from either side of the headboard.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Her gaze skittered almost frenetically around the room. \u201cThis is your brother\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWarm, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least.\u201d</p><p>Logan had been fucked up for years. But instead of his mental state improving over time, it was growing worse. By leaps and bounds. Another reason that he and little brother were going to have a heart-to-heart. Not that Hunter didn\u2019t understand Logan\u2019s dark needs. They had a lot in common there. But lately . . . his brother behaved as if he\u2019d done a belly flop off the mental deep end.</p><p>Rather than giving Kata more time to rubberneck, Hunter pushed her to the sleek adjoining bathroom. At least here, a patterned marble inlay and travertine relieved the black of the walls, cabinets, and trim.</p><p>\u201cHe, um . . . has a real hard-on for contemporary d\u00e9cor.\u201d</p><p>Or black simply matched Logan\u2019s mood. But why debate the subject? \u201cLet me run you a hot bath, honey.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for a reply, he turned the hot water on and placed the stopper in the tub. Beneath the vanity, he found a towel and washcloth and set them on the counter. He rummaged through a few drawers and came up with a toothbrush still in the plastic and a new comb.</p><p>Then he turned to Kata, watching her step away and look at everything but him. Her evasiveness had to end, especially now when he was dying to reconnect with her. Time would help her adjust to marriage and to him\u2014but that was something he didn\u2019t have. So, on to plan B.</p><p>He took a deep breath. Yes, he had to tread carefully, give her a lot of latitude, considering all she\u2019d been through, but . . . he couldn\u2019t allow her to keep walls between them.</p><p>Begin how you mean to go on.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she murmured, stepping toward the door, presumably to see him out.</p><p>Hunter stepped into her path. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now strip.\u201d</p><p>Kata\u2019s hazel eyes went wide. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Her flippant reply didn\u2019t interest Hunter; he\u2019d expected it, would deal with it. But she couldn\u2019t hide when her pupils dilated and her cheeks turned rosy. Kata\u2019s involuntary reactions sliced desire through his belly, shuttling straight down to his cock. He leveled her with a hard stare, raising his head a fraction, stepping far into her personal space.</p><p>In response, her nipples beaded. She swallowed, dropped her stare. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Definitely submissive. Last night, he\u2019d suspected it, even as she\u2019d pushed back again and again. But she hadn\u2019t been his to test or claim. All that had changed. Hunter planned to make sure she understood exactly who and what he was\u2014and uncover the submissive inside her he felt sure she\u2019d never trusted any man enough to let out.</p><p>Kata had some serious hang-ups about control. They\u2019d get to the bottom of those. Yes, the power to refuse always rested with the submissive. But Hunter sensed that she needed reassurance that he\u2019d never want a doormat and didn\u2019t want her to change. He\u2019d help her understand what she secretly yearned for and teach her to ask for what she feared to want.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an order, honey, not a negotiation.\u201d He kept his voice low, deceptively soft. \u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, and Hunter sensed a million thoughts whirling in her head. Desire, anger, and exasperation crossed her gorgeous face. Finally, she raised her chin and crossed her arms over her chest.</p> <p>Submissive ... but not going down without a fight. He held in a smile.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this now, when I\u2019m exhausted and afraid,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI know you want to exert your dominance or whatever, but why over something as inconsequential as a bath?\u201d</p><p>Since Kata didn\u2019t understand him or his ways, that wasn\u2019t an unfair question. His cock was nagging him like a toothache, as was his impatience to reach the woman behind her defense mechanisms and bind her to him, but that was his problem. She deserved answers first.</p><p>\u201cEverything about you concerns me. You\u2019re a smart woman, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve guessed by now that I don\u2019t merely like to dominate; I am a Dominant.\u201d</p><p>JUST like Ben had said. Kata wasn\u2019t exactly sure what that meant. That he was itching to restrain and spank her? That he liked to play Master/slave games?</p> <p>A forbidden ache settled with horrific insistence right under her clit. She tried to ignore it. No damn way was she submitting an inch of her independence, even in the bedroom, just to get her freak on.</p><p>She mentally sorted through escape routes out of this mini Fort Knox. \u201cNot with me. Hell no!\u201d</p><p>Disappointment and anger tightened Hunter\u2019s face, settling in with the exhaustion. A pinprick of guilt pierced her before she checked it. He was bringing this argument on. They could be in bed even now, drifting off to a much-needed night\u2019s sleep. But no, he insisted on pushing her now. No way would she be his doormat, not after everything she\u2019d seen in the last dozen years. She\u2019d rather take a bullet to her brain than endure what Mam\u00e1 had under Gordon\u2019s rule.</p><p>Hunter could tie her into a pretzel if he wanted to restrain her. God knew he had the strength, the intelligence, and the balls. So she had to keep her wits about her. Kata retreated another step.</p><p>He grabbed her hand, his thumb brushing over the top of hers in a soft sweep unexpectedly soothing. \u201cKata, it\u2019s the way I\u2019m wired. Everything I demand is aimed at providing you what you need, while giving me what I crave. Tonight, that\u2019s you relaxing in a hot tub while I massage the tenseness from your muscles so you reach a physical and mental state optimal for sleep.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have the peace of mind that comes with knowing you\u2019re safe and well.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s it? She stared at him suspiciously. This was supposed to be for her benefit? What about the high he got from ordering her around? How much bigger did he feel by having power over another? \u201cWhy not just say that instead of bossing me around?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPart of what I need as a Dom is for you to trust me, so I won\u2019t explain myself unless you\u2019re genuinely concerned or frightened. I need you to put yourself in my hands, submit to me completely, and know that I have your best interest at heart. I understand you\u2019ll find that a challenge. Submission won\u2019t be easy for you.\u201d</p><p>Won\u2019t be easy? Kata would have laughed in his face if her racing thoughts hadn\u2019t been tangling with emotions she barely understood. The kicker was, he seemed so confident that she would eventually comply.</p><p>The fact that he thought she could ever submit proved he didn\u2019t understand her. Maybe he didn\u2019t want to. Maybe she hadn\u2019t made herself clear enough.</p><p>Kata stared, taking in every inch of his gorgeous face. She couldn\u2019t deny the attraction curling through her. Why couldn\u2019t he be more laid back like Ben? Why couldn\u2019t they just enjoy each other without the power trip? She wanted to be with Hunter. He definitely made her feel something no man ever had. Why couldn\u2019t they just have sex without her having to be submissive?</p><p>He sighed as he turned off the faucet. Water steamed from the tub. \u201cYour face is an open book, honey. I get what you\u2019re thinking. We need to talk about what dominance is and isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a power play, pure and simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is about power\u2014but it\u2019s mostly yours. I can only take what you\u2019re able to give. This isn\u2019t to inflate my ego. It\u2019s to form a bond. We\u2019ll test our trust every day. And each time I respect your boundaries, yet push you until you\u2019re satisfied mentally, emotionally, and sexually, our bond deepens.\u201d</p><p>Some part of her wanted to believe him. In fact, she ached for such a relationship. How goddamn dangerous was that? Bonds so deep that Hunter could see into her soul, and vice versa, sounded great\u2014on the surface. But Kata had her doubts that\u2019s how it would actually work. In her experience, a man ordered, a woman complied and cowed, until it broke her self-esteem, and he got some sick kick out of the fact that he could bend her to his will. The next day, he\u2019d bend her more, then still more, until she crumbled. The insides, her self-esteem and spirit he\u2019d carved out, he tossed aside with unrepentant glee.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s crap.\u201d She snatched her hand back and crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cHave a lot of experience with Dominance and submission, do you?\u201d Hunter arched a tawny brow at her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to in order to know I don\u2019t want any of this. So take your chains and ropes and floggers, and go f\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t finish that sentence.\u201d Hunter stepped closer. He didn\u2019t loom over her, but bent until they were eye to eye. \u201cI want tonight to be about comfort and relaxation. But if you finish that sentence, I\u2019m going to smack your ass so red, you won\u2019t sit for days.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cSo now you\u2019re going to abuse me?\u201d</p><p>His smile wasn\u2019t pretty, and it made her belly clench with nothing she could remotely term fear. An answering chord tightened between her legs.</p><p>Slowly, he walked a half circle around her, settled his hands on her hips, and whispered in her ear. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like abuse. You\u2019ll come, more than once. You\u2019re a hellcat, but deep down, I\u2019ll bet you have fantasies you won\u2019t admit to . . . but you want fulfilled. I\u2019ll be the man to do that for you.\u201d</p><p>Hunter caressed his way down her ass. As her skin burned, Kata tensed, sucked in a breath. Her heart careened against her chest in a painful thud. She couldn\u2019t string two words together to sling the tart reply trapped on her tongue.</p><p>He circled around her again, faced her. Then he sent her a long, hot stare. She could feel her thong going from damp to soaked.</p><p>God, was he reading her wayward thoughts? Based on the sex they\u2019d shared the night before, she feared he could\u2014and see all the way down to her soul. She didn\u2019t doubt that he\u2019d be able to satisfy her body completely. But what about her heart? How could a relationship between them work if he demanded more than she could willingly give?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want this.\u201d Her voice shook. Liar.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tolerate dishonesty. That\u2019s your second punishable offense. I\u2019ll let you slide because you\u2019re tired and new to this dynamic. But one more . . .\u201d He reached around and popped her ass once, then he soothed his palm over her warmed flesh.</p><p>Before she could stop herself, Kata gasped\u2014and not in pain. Hunter sent her a satisfied grin.</p><p>A new fear wrapped around her. Why couldn\u2019t she understand\u2014or control\u2014her own traitorous reactions? Suddenly, the thing she\u2019d long feared was the thing she wanted most.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try this again,\u201d he suggested. \u201cStrip.\u201d</p><p>If she complied, he would turn her inside out. She knew it. After everything that had happened in the past twenty-four hours, she already felt raw. Kata couldn\u2019t take more now. \u201cI\u2019d rather bathe alone.\u201d</p><p>Hunter took his time responding. \u201cOkay. But when you\u2019re hot and you need me to ease your ache, I\u2019ll make you wait for an orgasm until you beg. For hours.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s your choice.\u201d</p><p>Kata had no doubt Hunter could\u2014and would\u2014do exactly that. Even the suggestion made her clit pulse.</p><p>He grabbed her shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight about this. Trust me, honey. I won\u2019t hurt you or let you down.\u201d</p><p>The blaze in his eyes sizzled her skin. The deep timbre of his seductive voice resonated through her, settling right between her legs. Hunter, along with his air of power and control, got to her like no man ever had. In his place, someone like Ben would have yelled, thrown a tantrum. Hunter had merely laid his cards on the table and now waited patiently, certain he\u2019d come out victorious eventually.</p><p>Kata swallowed. Maybe she was being paranoid and looking at his demands all wrong. Denying herself a hot guy wasn\u2019t her style. Refusing to try something new wasn\u2019t like her, either. So Hunter played the game differently than Ben or any of her previous lovers. No big deal, right? She couldn\u2019t deny that she\u2019d eaten up everything he\u2019d done to her so far. Yes, he was a lot to handle. But she was strong. No reason to assume that she couldn\u2019t manage.</p><p>\u201cIf ... we try this and I want out?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018No\u2019 isn\u2019t an acceptable safe word. Instead, say \u2018Ben.\u2019 If you do, I\u2019ll know you\u2019re not ready to move past your status quo yet, and I\u2019ll back away until you are.\u201d</p><p>It almost seemed too simple. Where was the loophole? Or did Hunter have so much self-control that stopping at any time wouldn\u2019t be a problem? \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing more complicated than that. You know what I want. I\u2019m waiting, honey.\u201d</p><p>Fine. If he wanted to see her naked because it turned him on, then she was all for it. Kata wasn\u2019t too cowardly to admit that the way he watched her like a predator getting ready to pounce aroused her.</p><p>She grabbed at the bottom of her T-shirt and pulled it over her head, tossed it to the floor. Hunter sucked in a breath, and Kata looked down. Ah, yes. The red bra with lace cups so sheer, he could see through them. His gaze caressed her wide, rosy areola, and she knew he saw her hard nipples almost poking above the delicate, low-slung fabric.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t say a word, but there was no missing the sudden tension in his body or the erection straining the front of his jeans. He\u2019d filled her utterly last night. But now . . . he looked even harder, bigger. He\u2019d have to really work to bury all of that inside her.</p><p>Kata shivered, and her panties turned even wetter at the thought. She reached for the snap of her capris and slowly unfastened them. Her fingers drifted down over the denim . . . until she rubbed at the ache in her pussy. A muscle ticked in Hunter\u2019s jaw.</p><p>Holding in her smile, she slid her hand back up her stomach and found the tab of her zipper. She began tugging it down, torturously slow. A peek at Hunter only proved that he was even more rigid\u2014everywhere.</p><p>When Kata had lowered the zipper, she hooked her thumbs in the waistband and began to shove them past her shimmying hips, over her ass, down her thighs. Finally, they pooled at her ankles, exposing her matching red thong.</p><p>\u201cFuck me, you look hot,\u201d he muttered, his stare harsh, electric. Possessive as hell.</p><p>Her pussy spasmed, clenched.</p><p>As much as it pained her to admit that Hunter was right, in her deepest, darkest fantasies Kata had imagined being overpowered and restrained. Imagining him dominating her, securing his ropes around her wrists and taking her at will, only turned her ache into an unrelenting throb.</p><p>\u201cThe bra, Kata. Now.\u201d</p><p>Strain showed in Hunter\u2019s voice, suddenly husky and gravelfilled. His deep tone, coupled with those electric blue eyes of his, seared her. She was hyperaware of every beat of her heart, every inch of her exposed skin, every long-held fantasy she\u2019d ever repressed.</p><p>She reached behind her and grabbed the band, unhooked the fastenings one at a time. Before the bra slid down her arms, she pressed her palms to her breasts, precariously holding the cups in place.</p><p>\u201cLet go.\u201d Hunter made a fist at his side. \u201cOr I\u2019ll rip it off.\u201d</p><p>Kata had no doubt he meant that . . . but the devil in her prodded her to goad him. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only bra I have with me.\u201d</p><p>A nasty smile curled up the side of his mouth. \u201cOh well.\u201d</p><p>He tensed, reached for her. Kata let the bra fall, exposing her breasts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They felt heavy, swollen. More blood rushed to the already-sensitive tips, and they hardened until the sensation became a pleasure/pain all its own. His stare lashed them like a live wire, a stunning jolt across each nipple.</p><p>God, she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever been more aroused, and Hunter had barely touched her.</p><p>His gaze drifted down her stomach, hesitated on the winking ruby at her pierced navel, then lingered between her thighs. Kata squeezed them together, trying to ease the ache. That only made the desire sharper. She needed relief.</p><p>Kata shifted a hand to the lace shielding her pussy and pressed in, rotating her fingers over her sensitive flesh. She gasped. Euphoria rolled through her as tingles danced under her skin. The ache sweetened. God, she was so close . . .</p><p>Hunter grabbed her wrist, exerting just enough pressure to lift her fingers an inch. \u201cYour orgasms are mine. I say when and how. You don\u2019t have permission to come.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t fit in her fantasies. She jerked against his hold.</p><p>He didn\u2019t let go. \u201cI more than warned you. You\u2019ve got at least one punishment coming. Want more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night changed everything. Own up to the fact that you want this, and take off that wet thong if you want to keep it in one piece.\u201d</p><p>Anger and desire tumbled together, churning and roiling inside her. In that moment, Kata was royally pissed\u2014but she also wanted him like hell.</p><p>With a curse, she grabbed the little thong clinging to her hips and jerked it down ungracefully until she was as bare as the day she was born. \u201cHappy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d That cocky half-smile curled up the corner of his mouth. \u201cSpread your legs shoulder-width apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you going to inspect me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted to, I would. In due time, I will. At some point, I\u2019ll have that pretty cunt waxed from top to bottom so you can feel every lick of my tongue. But right now, I told you to spread your legs. Hesitate again, and that will be punishment number two.\u201d</p><p>Kata gritted her teeth but complied. Not because she was afraid of him but because, despite the anger simmering just under her skin, heaven help her, she wanted to.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d His stare lasered in on her pussy . . . then rose to meet her gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re very wet.\u201d</p><p>It was true, but she hated giving him too much power over her. \u201cMaybe my wetness has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re just racking the spankings up tonight, honey. That\u2019s two punishments. Unless you want a third, I suggest you get your fingers on that pussy and start rubbing. I\u2019ll tell you when to stop.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse jumped. Touching herself for show was one thing, but... \u201cM-masturbate in front of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me. Get busy.\u201d</p><p>The challenge in his tone both made her bristle and ache. She swallowed.</p><p>Kata had never done this for any lover, but she wanted to drive Hunter mad with lust, then hold out on him. Make him regret ever pushing her.</p><p>She smiled coyly. Their gazes met, fused for an electric moment. Then she caressed a line down her stomach slowly, finally reaching the apex of her thighs. She diverted from her clit, slipping lower to press two fingers inside her snug depths.</p> <p>Sensation rolled over her in a hot wave, a delicious pleasure that had her gasping. Somewhere in the back of her head, she marveled at how hot and slick she felt, but the invasion stole her breath, her thoughts.</p><p>Kata tangled her free hand through her hair, pulling her fingers through the silky mass, until she reached her breast. She cupped it, pinched her nipple, and moaned.</p><p>Her head spun. The sugary ache stretched the moment as pleasure buzzed inside her. A wave of dizziness threatened to send her tumbling deep into a chasm of need. Kata groped for the wall beside her and hung on tight as she eased her fingers deeper inside her pussy.</p><p>Hunter tensed. The way he gripped his thighs told her he was exercising superhuman restraint not to throw her to the cold tile and fuck her into next week. \u201cRub your clit.\u201d</p><p>Gladly. The little knot of nerves had swollen to twice its normal size. As she withdrew her fingers and dragged them up and settled them over her clit, a new wave of tingles crashed through her. Knowing that Hunter\u2019s eyes were on her made Kata shudder, gasp. Normally with self-pleasure, it took at least ten minutes to orgasm. Now, after the barest of touches, she felt a heartbeat away from an explosion that would flatten her.</p><p>Kata\u2019s fingers shook as she dragged in a shuddering breath. So damn close. Oh God . . . One more good swipe would do it. Her knees were unstable beneath her, and her heartbeat roared in her ears. She anticipated this orgasm like crazy. Needed it.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Hunter pulled her hand away from her pussy, then moved behind her, until he pinned her wrist at the small of her back.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, no!\u201d she groaned.</p><p>He said nothing, merely grabbed her other hand, then held both together behind her in an unyielding grip that aroused her even more.</p><p>Her breathing accelerated. Even without the stimulation to her clit, she still felt a split second from orgasm. And the heat of his body blanketing her back, his free hand moving her long hair off her neck, just before he kissed his way across her sensitive skin . . . Kata shuddered, her senses on overload.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d God, she hated herself for begging, but she couldn\u2019t stop it.</p><p>He edged to her side, caressed his way down her spine, rough fingertips sliding over her skin. She trembled, arched into his touch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Hunter made her feel that way, like a goddess. She loved the way he seemed crazy with desire for her.</p><p>Suddenly, his touch disappeared. Kata held her breath, expectation thrumming through her. Then thwack! He struck her ass with a solid palm.</p><p>She yelped. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised to punish you, so I am,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Fire began to crawl across the right cheek of her ass, stunning Kata mute. Only the rhythm of Hunter\u2019s hot breaths on her shoulder and his grip on her wrists told her that he remained behind her. Then he slapped her left cheek with equal force.</p><p>He repeated the process again. Then again.</p><p>Her rear began to throb, become a luscious starburst of sensation. That ache joined the one behind her clit. Need escalated. Her heart slammed into her ribs. Her knees buckled.</p><p>Hunter hooked an arm around her waist to hold her upright, his fingers hovering over her pussy. Kata sucked in a breath in anticipation, but he didn\u2019t touch her, leaving her to dangle at the edge of overwhelming need.</p><p>She whimpered. \u201cOh, God. Please . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I reward your disobedience by giving you an orgasm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need it,\u201d Kata admitted with a moan.</p><p>\u201cI needed you to strip, and you refused me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ordered me.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s fingertips drifted down, rubbing light, lazy circles over the hood of her clit, the pressure too light and scattered to do anything but drive her up higher. Kata fisted her hands, trying to thrust her hips against his fingers, praying he\u2019d rub her right into oblivion. But he clutched her hip tightly, controlling her every move.</p><p>\u201cAs I will again and again. Learn to take direction, and you\u2019ll find I can be very generous. If not . . .\u201d</p><p>He let the implication sink in.</p><p>Damn him! He might have her in this moment. No way she was going to comply with him twenty-four/seven. She fully intended to repay Hunter for this. Then he could go to hell.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he barked. \u201cDo not move.\u201d</p><p>Kata tensed at his order, spitting mad and scared. She itched to rebel, find some way to have him eating out of the palm of her hand. But if she tried, he\u2019d only withhold orgasm again. And right now, she needed so badly what only he could give her. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me properly with a \u2018Yes, Sir.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Sir? No way . . . That rubbed her independent streak raw. Seriously, payback was going to be a bitch.</p><p>Silent moments stretched on, and her body ached, screamed for the release she knew he wouldn\u2019t give her until she cooperated.</p><p>Squeezing her eyes shut, she finally choked out, \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was slow, and it lacked sincerity, but I\u2019ll let it pass tonight.\u201d He released her wrists. \u201cTurn and face the shower. Brace your hands on the wall in front of you. Spread your legs wider.\u201d</p><p>Kata froze, her mind racing. Then slowly, she turned, glancing over her shoulder at Hunter.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cEyes forward.\u201d</p><p>What the hell did he have planned? He\u2019d reveal it in time, but if she questioned him now, no doubt he\u2019d just keep withholding this orgasm. The thought made her chest tighten, a sob rise up.</p><p>Resolutely, she looked at the wall, pressed her lips together, and waited.</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s progress,\u201d he praised as he cupped her breast, thumb brushing her aching, beaded nipple.</p><p>She swallowed a gasp. God, every nerve ending was on fire. When his hand skated down her rib cage, her waist, her hip, her butt, she held her breath, so full of need. Then his other hand joined, and he spread her cheeks slightly. She tensed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never had anal sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no.\u201d She\u2019d never wanted it. But with Hunter, it sounded so hot and forbidden. Sexy as hell.</p><p>He traced a finger from the small of her back, down through the hidden crevice, lingering over her back passage. \u201cWhen the time comes, I\u2019ll be gentle. But you\u2019ll take me here.\u201d</p><p>His fingertip teased the little opening, and tingles skittered through her. She gasped. Oh damn . . . The thought of his cock in her ass scared the hell out of her\u2014and yet she was desperate to know what it would be like, if Hunter taking her that way would make her feel utterly dominated. Suddenly, Kata craved that in a way that haunted her.</p><p>\u201cSuch beauty . . . and reluctant obedience.\u201d He caressed the curve of her waist again, his lips drifting across her shoulder\u2014and his naked body pressed to her back, hard cock nestled against her ass. When had he undressed? \u201cWe\u2019ll work on that.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse jumped, and Kata was so ready for anything\u2014everything\u2014Hunter wanted to give her\u2014as long as he let her come.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d She wiggled against him, pleading again.</p><p>She heard a tear, a crinkle. Thank God Hunter was donning a condom. Her entire body clenched in anticipation.</p><p>Hunter found her opening in the center of the slick folds of her pussy. He pressed the tip in\u2014and paused.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come until I give you permission. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>In the past few moments, she\u2019d regained a little control, not quite as high with need. But Kata had no illusions; he could push her to the edge again quickly and leave her hanging. It seemed she\u2019d been achy and desperate for hours, though it had probably been ten minutes. He could likely make it seem like days if he wanted. Why take the risk that he\u2019d deprive her?</p><p>Giving in both scared and thrilled her. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour obedience goes straight to my cock, honey.\u201d He pressed his solid chest over her back and nuzzled her neck with soft kisses. \u201cHmm. I could get used to this.\u201d</p><p>She could, too. That\u2019s what scared her to death. But she was too high on need to think about it now.</p><p>His hands scooped up her breasts, fingers pinching her nipples until the edge of pain had her gasping and her pussy creaming anew. The need to orgasm rose once more, now screaming through her body.</p><p>Hunter grabbed her hips and slammed deep inside her in one savage thrust. \u201cFuck, yes!\u201d</p><p>Kata cried out as pleasure-pain ripped through her. God, he was huge. She rose on her toes to put more space between them as she tried to adjust, but he still pressed inward, deeper and deeper. She hissed, trying to accommodate his girth, take the avalanche of sensation burying her. Climax loomed . . . but she needed just a bit more.</p><p>\u201cHunter, please . . . Fuck me,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>\u201cI will, until you\u2019ve screamed your throat raw,\u201d he vowed. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve done what I asked, when I ask it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>UNDER him, Kata stiffened. No surprise, since he\u2019d intentionally pushed her.</p><p>Hunter grabbed her hips and waited. His little spitfire wanted to give in\u2014he could feel her need\u2014but that independent mind of hers, riddled with whatever scars she carried, kept asserting itself, shutting off trust before she could truly grant it. He understood; she was having difficulty reconciling what she wanted with what she thought she should want. Hunter planned to get to the bottom of that contradiction ASAP.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, don\u2019t keep doing this to me. Put up or shut up.\u201d She wriggled her ass, not in invitation but in challenge. \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>So, she sought to lure him past his control and entice him to fuck her on her terms? Not happening, but damn if giving in and unleashing the full force of his lust on her wasn\u2019t tempting.</p><p>Immediately, he clamped down on the thought, ceased all movement, then whispered in her ear, \u201cWe can do this the easy way. You can be soft and submissive under me, and I\u2019ll make it worth your while. Or we can do this the hard way. I\u2019ll withdraw and tie you to the bed, and jack you up every hour on the hour, withholding your orgasm until I get my point across. But that\u2019s not what I want, honey.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stroked down her abdomen . . . and lower, into the damp curls, grazing over her clit. She mewled. Her pussy tightened on his cock, and Hunter swore. His vicious need for her had sweat beading at his temples, all over his back. Hot blood scalded his veins. He fucking ached to pound Kata to their mutual satisfaction, but establishing control first was nonnegotiable. Once she submitted, they\u2019d both be happier. Proving that to her was going to be a bitch.</p><p>\u201cDamn it! Can\u2019t you just . . .\u201d Whimpering, she thrust back on him, shoving him even deeper in her tight, silken clasp.</p><p>Only by literally biting his tongue did Hunter hold in a groan. Letting her know how good she felt, despite her disobedience, would only encourage her. \u201cDon\u2019t push me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d Her voice was breathy, a heady combination of trepidation and demand, as she curled her hand around his neck, leaned back, and tugged his lips toward hers.</p><p>Hunter turned his head, refused her kiss. He\u2019d answered her question, but she still tested him, trying in her way to top from the bottom. He wouldn\u2019t have it. \u201cSpread your legs wider.\u201d</p><p>A long heartbeat passed before she complied. He breathed out, partially in relief, partially because the sight of her offering her body to him was flat-out one of the sexiest sights ever.</p><p>\u201cHold still. Don\u2019t move your hands. You may moan and scream my name, nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like your orders, damn it,\u201d she panted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like your defiance. Final warning.\u201d</p><p>He held very still inside the hot grip of her cunt, dying to ease back, then slide deep, find that one spot that would send her reeling just for the sublime joy of hearing her shout his name. But he was prepared to punish her again if she disobeyed. She\u2019d more than earned it. He was giving her a lot of latitude because she\u2019d never submitted, and the last twenty-four hours would have exhausted even the hardiest of souls. He\u2019d be lying, though, if he said the ecstasy boiling in his balls and clawing up his cock wasn\u2019t strangling his good intentions.</p><p>She shuddered, hesitated. Then, finally, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. Bow your head.\u201d</p><p>If she refused, he\u2019d already spelled out the or else.</p><p>\u201cBow my\u2014\u201d She sucked in a breath and tossed back her head, dark hair spilling all down her back. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve given some, but that? I won\u2019t relinquish that much. I can\u2019t . . . be subservient.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Slowly, he withdrew from her pussy.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She thrust back, fighting to keep him deep inside her. \u201cHunter.\u201d</p><p>Turning down that temptation almost killed him. He wanted to work deep inside her again, his balls pressed right to her wet pussy, tangle his fingers in the silky mass, inhale her scent as he listened to her whimpers become screams. But he didn\u2019t. Instead, Hunter fought for control as he brushed his knuckles over her clit in a soft, hypnotic slide. He pressed his dick against her ass, grinding.</p><p>Kata glared at him over her shoulder, defiant.</p><p>Hunter lifted his fingers from her clit, stepped back, and crossed his arms over his chest. No matter how much his cock ached, he wasn\u2019t backing down. Her eyes simmered with fury, her lips pursed as if she was dying to spit acid at him. He braced for a long night.</p><p>\u201cApparently we\u2019re going to do this the hard way.\u201d Hunter shook his head and, in one quick stroke, tore off the condom. Damn it to hell.</p><p>She stood straight, her back stiffening. Eyes narrowed, she whirled to face him. He forced himself not to look at her heavy breasts, rosy brown nipples, and her traffic-stopping curves. Distraction now would only be detrimental.</p><p>\u201cBowing my head, are you serious? Why can\u2019t sex be equitable? Why can\u2019t we discuss what we both want, then do it together?\u201d</p><p>Because she wanted his dominance as much as he wanted to give it to her. Her wet pussy proved that. She couldn\u2019t be satisfied until she submitted. Still, he never wanted her to think that he wasn\u2019t listening or didn\u2019t care for her needs.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, sleep. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could have simply complied with my commands\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I? You don\u2019t own me.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, then forced himself to relax. Kata would understand his possession soon enough. She knew the reasons he expected her compliance; he\u2019d explained. Her protestations and questions were merely stall tactics. \u201cAll you had to say to stop me was \u2018Ben,\u2019 but you didn\u2019t. Care to tell me why?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, her shoulders sagging. \u201cI don\u2019t know. If you\u2019ll let me sleep first, maybe I\u2019ll be coherent enough to figure it out and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>Ah, the predictable dodging of the subject. So much easier for Kata than admitting that she was not only afraid to embrace what he ached to give her, but too aroused to turn it down.</p><p>As she bent and reached for her clothes, Hunter grabbed her by the shoulders and brought her body against his. \u201cListen, I will do whatever it takes to help you see who I am, what you are, and how great we\u2019ll be together. Get in the tub.\u201d</p><p>Kata glared at him, then turned to glance at the bathtub. Wisps of steam still rose from the water. He felt the tension leave her shoulders, signaling a modicum of surrender.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she muttered. \u201cBut only because that bath looks heavenly.\u201d</p><p>Yes, and because she was finally learning that he wouldn\u2019t let her derail him. He also suspected that her arousal was beginning to overcome her reluctance. Her pussy was still throbbing; he\u2019d bet money on that.</p><p>Hunter released her, and she made her way to the tub, sinking into the clear water with a sigh that went straight to his cock.</p><p>As she settled into the steaming bath, Hunter climbed in behind her, sitting on the wide ledge above. She stiffened and started to sputter something. Hunter silenced her by laying his palms on her shoulders and massaging away the tension. Seconds later, she turned to butter in his hands. He smiled.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re good at that,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a good girl, you might find out what else I\u2019m good at.\u201d</p><p>Kata shook her head. \u201cYou just don\u2019t let up, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t guessed yet, I\u2019m generally a relentless guy. You have to be, in my line of work.\u201d</p><p>Before she could say another word, he worked at a nasty knot just under her shoulder blade, then pressed his thumbs up either side of her spine until he reached her neck and began releasing the tightness there. Within minutes, she was totally limp under his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou always do something redeeming just when I\u2019m ready to slap you,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>He grinned as he reached for the soap. To his relief, Kata didn\u2019t protest when he lifted and washed each arm top and bottom, or when he gathered all the gloriously soft hair in his grip so he could soap up her back. After a quick rinse, he hopped out of the tub and leaned over her, urging her to lie back, then took hold of each leg and bent them at the knees until her feet rested flat on the bottom of the tub. In fact, she didn\u2019t have a hint of defiance left in her body as he gently smoothed the white bar and his hands across her abdomen, over her shoulders, and lingered on her breasts. Then he edged between her legs. As he\u2019d suspected, she was soaking wet.</p><p>Suddenly, she gasped and pulled at his wrist. \u201cI can do that.\u201d</p><p>Hunter didn\u2019t budge an inch. \u201cLook at me.\u201d And he didn\u2019t say another word until she obeyed. \u201cGet this through your head. I\u2019m going to take care of you. Kata.\u201d</p><p>Biting her lip, she looked at him uncertainly. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want you to touch me, but I\u2019m capable of taking care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never doubted that. Tell me the real problem.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at his hand, still covering her pussy, claiming it. \u201cThat\u2019s so . . . intimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur relationship should be.\u201d</p><p>She looked away, seeming to search for a reply. \u201cHunter, getting comfortable with someone takes time. I can\u2019t just flip a switch inside me and be ready for whatever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime isn\u2019t the real stumbling block. Both people have to be open.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated a long time, then looked down. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cPhysically, no. But you want more than that.\u201d Her gaze was earnest as it met his own. \u201cTrusting someone with your body and trusting someone with your soul are two very different things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. But so far, you haven\u2019t truly trusted me with either. Or really tried.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes slammed shut. Pain pinched her brows. She struggled for a moment. Discomfort etched her face, and a part of him wanted to ease up on her. But he\u2019d be sending the wrong message, and ultimately, not providing what she needed.</p><p>Finally, she let go of his wrist hovering over her parted thighs. Triumph slid through him.</p><p>Gently, he cleaned her slick female flesh. Kata closed her eyes. Her body remained tense, but she let him take over. When he\u2019d finished, he moved back to massaging her neck, shoulders, mid-back until she wilted bonelessly.</p><p>At that moment, he pulled the plug from the tub and urged her to stand. She complied, her head lolling on his shoulder, granting him more trust than she\u2019d ever given. His heart caught as he lifted her into his arms, out of the tub.</p><p>And right on cue, she asserted herself. \u201cHunter, this carrying me thing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it really worth another argument?\u201d</p><p>After a long moment, she sighed and sank back into his arms. A bit more progress. He smiled.</p><p>Hunter angled her through the doorway and back into Logan\u2019s room, dimly lit by one small bedside lamp. \u201cAre you hungry? Thirsty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel safe?\u201d</p><p>Kata\u2019s black lashes fluttered over her pretty hazel eyes, and his heart stuttered again. What was it about this woman? Her independence? That she wouldn\u2019t give all of herself easily, but once she did, it would be so worth the battle? He didn\u2019t exactly know the answer, but he couldn\u2019t wait to find out. But she was, without a doubt, his.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she murmured huskily. \u201cNo one is getting in here, past you. I hate to admit it, but I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to sleep alone at my own place. Thanks for watching over me. Though I don\u2019t appreciate the whole \u2018withholding orgasm\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll rectify that.\u201d He smiled. \u201cEventually. Rest for now.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, she grabbed the sheet and snuggled next to him, then drifted off to sleep. When she closed her eyes, when her brain shut off, she trusted him. Her back nestled against his chest as though she found his touch comforting. They fit together as though they were made for each other, missing puzzle pieces that had finally snapped into place.</p><p>Hunter released a shuddering, exhausted breath. No matter how tired he was, when he felt Kata warm and naked beside him, his cock stood at full staff. Shit. He glanced at the clock. Thirty-eight minutes until the hour. He set a vibrating alarm on his cell phone and closed his eyes.</p><p>No matter how soft and accepting Kata seemed now, this was going to be a damn long night.</p><p>KATA lay across the sheets like a sacrificial virgin, arms and legs spread, in the near dark. She could make out a shadow between her thighs. Male. Stark, intriguing face not quite visible. Tremendously wide shoulders blocked the rest of the room. Powerful hands glided over her thighs, up to her hips. She tingled everywhere he touched. Then he settled his palm there, and sensations converged into an unrelenting ache. He fueled it by rubbing his thumb, hot and relentless, over her clit.</p><p>She shifted restlessly, trying to capture more of the sensation. Desire multiplied, tightened, gathered like a tropical storm, swirling, growing. With a gasp, she reached out for something to anchor her, but found nothing. Certainly, there was no escape. He made sure she felt every skillful, slow touch of his hands . . . but never gave her enough to hurtle her into release.</p><p>More. Please! She moaned, her entire body thrashing in need.</p><p>He stopped, not moving a muscle, not persisting with that perfect attention to her clit. The sweet ache between her legs turned vicious.</p><p>Kata wanted to beg but couldn\u2019t speak. She wailed in frustration. As if he understood, he lavished attention on her clit again, harder, faster\u2014the pressure precisely perfect to launch her into a supernova of an orgasm. Then he added to her sensory overload, slipping something inside her, prodding a spot that sent her careening faster and farther into a drowning pool of need.</p><p>Somewhere in the back of her hazy mind, she knew she was dreaming this unabashedly sexual fantasy, but it was too delicious to force herself to consciousness. Knowing it was all in her head, she opened her mind to the mounting pleasure. God, this dream man knew his way around her body, and wasn\u2019t that heavenly?</p><p>Her back arched, her body lifting and clenching as she thrashed madly, seeking that little bit extra she needed, exactly where she needed it. She was nearly there, so ready to explode. But he eased back, gave her a gentler touch, avoiding her most sensitive spots. A mewled protest rose up in her throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn, she wanted this\u2014bad. For a dream, it was so vivid. She wanted to see her lover, ask him why he tormented her, beg for relief.</p><p>\u201cKata.\u201d</p><p>The whisper was as real as the breath hot against her breast.</p><p>She flung her eyes open. Hunter knelt between her legs, his big body casting a shadow over her, his stare hot, predatory. The buzz cut of his hair made what might have been a pretty face look harshly male, throwing every dip, plane, and jut into stark relief. His washboard abs tightened above his faded jeans. They were zipped but not snapped, giving her a tease of what was behind that bulge in his fly. She nearly swallowed her tongue. Desire bloomed fiercely inside her.</p> <p>With an unrelenting stare, Hunter gripped her thighs, his hands pushing their way up her flesh, back to her very wet sex. His thumb toyed with her clit.</p><p>And Kata knew then that none of what she\u2019d been feeling had been a dream. He\u2019d brought her to the very verge of climax and left her there to ache and twist. Just as he\u2019d vowed that he would.</p><p>She wanted to bite his damn head off, tell him to stop messing with her. But if she said anything of the sort, he\u2019d take her defiance as a personal challenge. There\u2019d be no orgasm in her future\u2014immediate or otherwise. And Hunter had done his job, as she imagined he did all things, capably and well. Thanks to his expert touch, she needed what he could give her . . . if he chose to.</p><p>\u201cHunter?\u201d She raised her hips to him, begging in the only way her pride and apprehension allowed.</p><p>Verbalizing how badly she ached for him left her exposed in a way mere nudity didn\u2019t. Admitting that she yearned to be covered, taken, powerless under his touch, seemed as smart as swimming with chum in shark-infested waters. Hunter was definitely capable of chewing through her resistance and eating her alive.</p> <p>The wicked gleam in his eye, the half smile on his mouth, told her that he knew everything she felt and feared. \u201cWant something, honey?\u201d</p><p>Kata pressed her lips together. She was a big girl who could see to her own orgasm. She\u2019d had plenty of practice.</p><p>But when she tried to lift her arm from above her head and slide it into her wet flesh, she found it cuffed to the bed. Attempting to move the other netted the same result. Fury and panic raced through her.</p><p>\u201cYou tied me to the bed?</p><p>\u201cManacled, actually. They\u2019re fur-lined but made of steel, attached to chains, soldered into steel supports behind the headboard, and anchored into the studs in the wall.\u201d</p><p>In other words, she wasn\u2019t going anywhere until he was good and ready to let her go. Panic surged ahead of fury. But a fresh curl of arousal wasn\u2019t far behind. From the moment they\u2019d met, Hunter had been trying to control her verbally, sexually. But now he was getting really serious. Manacles and chains and steel. Oh my.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready for this,\u201d she choked.</p><p>\u201cYour body is. It\u2019s your mind that\u2019s fighting. We\u2019re going to get past that. And you\u2019ve earned these punishments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve chained me to the bed and you\u2019re going to, what? Refuse to give me an orgasm?\u201d The thought only made her crave it more.</p><p>\u201cEvery hour on the hour, until you cooperate. Just like I promised.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. She already wanted him so badly, she was about to crawl out of her skin. How desperately would she need him by then? She didn\u2019t like being controlled this way. She didn\u2019t like being controlled, period. \u201cPiss off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d Hunter leaned over her, supporting his weight on his elbows. \u201cOr you can learn some compliance. Then you\u2019ll find I can be as accommodating as hell.\u201d</p><p>Kata felt the lethal spread of his chest over hers, his steely six-pack pressing into her belly. He nudged an erection of killer proportions between her spread thighs. Her clit burned with arousal. When she tried to close her legs and squeeze her thighs together, she found them tethered, too.</p><p>A gasp slipped from her lips. Her helplessness excited her even more. God, why did she find that so damn sexy?</p> <p>Above her he smiled, a flash of disconcerting white in the near darkness. \u201cYes, your ankles are manacled, too, attached to chains, set in titanium supports under the floorboards. I helped Logan install them, so I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou plan to keep me tied up until I give in?\u201d Her pussy clenched at the thought.</p><p>\u201cNope. I want to make defiance unpleasant, but I don\u2019t get off on forcing a woman to do anything. Once the punishment is over, I\u2019ll release you. But since this all started with your refusal to cooperate, you can end it now by\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean my refusal to roll over and play dead?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Granted, she wasn\u2019t making a strong case for that orgasm she craved, but his I\u2019m-all-big-and-bad routine, along with his mastery of her body, scared the crap out of her. This power-trip, steamroller shit was beginning to remind her too much of Gordon. If she gave an inch now, Hunter would take a hundred miles later.</p><p>\u201cI want a submissive woman, not a well-trained dog. And my attempt to go slow and put you at ease is getting us nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the hell o\u2014oh!\u201d</p><p>He drowned out her protest by laving her nipple with his tongue in a teasing glide, prodding the hard bud with his thumb. His nip was an electric jolt of pain, teeth to burning flesh, followed by a soothing lick. He paid similar homage to her other breast until both nipples felt swollen, alive with need. Kata wanted to hold out, throw his seduction back in his face . . . but she ended up arching to his mouth with another silent plea.</p><p>Hunter slid down her body, his lips gliding across the sensitive undersides of her breasts, caressing over her rib cage. His tongue dipped into her navel, swirling around as his humongous hands gripped her hips in a way she could only describe as possessive.</p><p>Kata swallowed. This \u201cpunishment\u201d she\u2019d supposedly earned felt more like Hunter wanting to overwhelm her senses to prove that he could command her at will.</p><p>Fear jolted her. \u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d</p><p>He froze, raised his laser-precise gaze to her. \u201cWhat is it you think I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to show me that you\u2019re the man and can bend the little lady to your will, no matter how much you have to trample my independence or self-esteem. You may make me beg for an orgasm because, God knows, you\u2019ve figured out exactly how to put my body in the palm of your hand. But in doing so, you\u2019re trying to steal my soul. And you can kiss my ass. I\u2019m not giving it to you.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up. He looked affronted, then considering. Finally, concern settled into the sharp angles of his face. \u201cHoney, you\u2019re still not getting it. I\u2019m not doing this to you. I\u2019m doing it for us. We can\u2019t really be together until you\u2019re honest with me and with yourself. Your body craves domination, takes to it like surrender is the most natural thing in the world. It\u2019s your head getting in the way. God knows, I\u2019ve made myself clear enough that I want to be the man who grants all your fantasies for the rest of your life. But you persist in thinking that I\u2019m trying to belittle you and break you down, rather than build us up. You couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Explain.\u201d</p><p>He punctuated his demand by nuzzling his lips across her low belly, then followed with another nip of teeth . . . at the same moment he brushed his fingertips across her clit. The combination of pleasure and pain was nothing short of hypnotic, cajoling.</p><p>Panic, anger, and fear collided, compounded by this dangerous arousal. Regardless of his little speech, Kata felt overtaken. Hunter had nearly crushed her free will by hurtling her to the very edge of desire again and again. She bucked, trying to dislodge him. He wasn\u2019t moving an inch.</p><p>Really, she should refuse to bend, keep him in the dark. Except that he was relentless enough to keep her manacled to this bed until she told him everything. If he wanted the shitload of 411, that was his stupid mistake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why. Did I ever mention that my mother isn\u2019t allowed to choose her own clothing every day? Gordon insists on doing it for her.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s brows shot up, and he shrugged. \u201cIf they\u2019re a Dominant/ submissive couple, that\u2019s not uncommon. I don\u2019t want a twenty-four/ seven slave like that, but some Doms\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a Dom. Even if he is, the real problem is that he\u2019s an asshole. Every day for the past dozen years he\u2019s been telling my mother that she could look better. He started by picking her jewelry, because, according to him, he has an innate talent for such things, which she lacked. Then he started choosing her shoes, then shirts, skirts, pants. Now she doesn\u2019t wear a stitch without consulting him because he\u2019s convinced her that she\u2019s a train wreck without him.\u201d</p><p>Even in shadow, she saw the concern deepen on Hunter\u2019s face. \u201cKata, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d How dare he suffer remorse now for pushing her to talk. He wanted this Pandora\u2019s box opened, so he\u2019d better deal. \u201cThat was just the beginning. He cut her off from all her friends, scheduling conflicting events, inventing \u2018crises\u2019 whenever she had plans to go out. Soon, even the friends who\u2019d stood by her after my dad died, fell by the wayside. So Gordon convinced her that he was a better friend than all of them put together. She\u2019d had a great career as an OR nurse, but five years ago, she and the surgeon lost a little boy on the operating table. My mom was crushed. You know what Gordon said? Maybe she wasn\u2019t as talented as she\u2019d thought, and that everyone would be better served if she stayed home. She fucking loved that job. Poof, it was gone. He\u2019s made her too afraid to pursue getting another. Her driver\u2019s license expired, and he\u2019s been dragging his feet for two years to take her to have it renewed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right; he is an asshole,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Kata paused, stared at him in the dark. It wasn\u2019t a line. He sincerely meant that. Somehow, all the jumble of anger, panic, and desire that had been biting her morphed into grief. Tears stung her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGordon calls all the shots. Since about the time I began driving, Mom hasn\u2019t been the same woman I grew up with. She\u2019s afraid to breathe without precious Gordon\u2019s permission. She\u2019s a . . . shell. Then three years a-ago . . .\u201d</p><p>Hot tears rolled down Kata\u2019s face. She tried to wipe them away, then realized the manacles made that impossible. Helplessness and impotent anger infuriated her all over again. God, what her mother must go through . . .</p><p>Kata paused, unable to relive the horror of the night everything had spiraled down the proverbial toilet of life. Hunter had only wanted her to vomit up the painful past so that he could unravel her. But she was already there, feeling a hairsbreadth away from giving in to something that could destroy her.</p><p>Granted, Hunter hadn\u2019t belittled her. She prayed he would see why the amount of control he wanted to exert over her life scared the hell out of her and stop trying to make her surrender her soul.</p><p>\u201cThree years ago . . .?\u201d he prompted, wiping her tears away.</p><p>Kata slammed her eyes shut. As she pictured how that sentence ended, a sob buckled her chest with the horror her family lived with each and every day. The pity, the pain. No way she was sharing that so Hunter could rip her wide-open and make her even more vulnerable to him.</p><p>\u201cStop! God knows that, all trussed up like this, you can do whatever the hell you want with me, and I can\u2019t stop you. You\u2019ll probably even make me like it, but I\u2014I\u2019m done talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Shh.\u201d Hunter kissed her forehead, caressed her cheek. \u201cThank you for sharing your mother\u2019s situation with me. I appreciate the courage and trust that required.\u201d His voice, surprisingly tender, soothed her. \u201cI understand better, I think. You\u2019re afraid that my wanting to control you in bed will spill to the rest of your life. Before me, you\u2019d never spent ten minutes with a Dom. Clearly, you\u2019ve been through a lot with Gordon. Your fear is fair.\u201d</p><p>Of all the things he might have said, that surprised her most. And incited more tears. \u201cYou\u2019re not bullshitting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We married quickly, and you don\u2019t know me well yet. From your perspective, I took advantage of a drunk woman by hustling you to the altar, spent the night with you, and chased you to your hometown when you wanted space. When danger came your way, I ordered you not to return to work, which I\u2019m guessing felt a lot like something Gordon would demand.\u201d He cocked his head in thought. \u201cThen I suppose you think I dragged you to Dallas, away from your family and friends, so I could isolate you. I got in your panties and your head until you gave me the information I needed so I could somehow use it against you. Do I have it right?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes watered over again. She wanted to believe it was nothing more than exhaustion and a decided lack of the orgasm she\u2019d so desperately craved. Or that her damn eyes leaked because she\u2019d dredged up so much stuff about her mom that she usually shoved way down. But mostly, it was Hunter. He was so insightful, actually able to see the situation from a point of view other than his own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wow. She wasn\u2019t used to that.</p><p>\u201cRight now, you don\u2019t seem like the kind of dickhead who makes himself feel better by making others feel worse.\u201d She sniffed, paused, still thinking through her reply. He was trying hard to be fair; she needed to do the same. \u201cI know that, though stupid and drunken, getting married was my idea. I have no doubt after having a bullet whiz a quarter inch from my face that the danger I\u2019m in is real. I\u2019d escaped him, yeah.\u201d It pained her to admit this. \u201cHe would probably have found me again pretty quickly. I know you alpha males can\u2019t fathom not protecting your woman or whatever. I admit that I don\u2019t know the first thing about hiding from an assassin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>Damn if the concern in his prompt didn\u2019t start the tears again. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can deal with you always trying to get in my head. Fun, casual, normal sex\u2014yes. But what you want . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe intense bond of people who fuck not just with their bodies for the sake of orgasm, but with their minds and hearts to share the ultimate pleasure? Who give themselves to each other so completely that you and I become an us that\u2019s so solid, nothing can ever shake it? You don\u2019t want that?\u201d</p><p>Kata couldn\u2019t look away from his solemn, unwavering stare, half-hidden in the gray shadows. She trembled from head to toe. When he described the relationship he saw, it sounded so beautiful. But so not real. Wasn\u2019t that, like, a Hallmark card or a Lifetime movie? \u201cNot when it starts with you ordering me around. I\u2014I can\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the kind of woman who runs from herself. I refuse to believe that, rather than face me and your fears, you\u2019d prefer tepid orgasms with someone like Ben, who will never fulfill you or truly earn your love.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a coward. She already knew she couldn\u2019t go back to Ben. He\u2019d propositioned her three times since she\u2019d breezed into his hotel room\u2014had that been just this morning?\u2014and she hadn\u2019t hesitated to turn him down.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve had that sort of relationship with every woman who\u2019s ever submitted to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He sighed. \u201cYou are the first one. The only one.\u201d</p><p>Those words touched her, despite the danger they represented. And the goddamn tears just wouldn\u2019t stop. Hunter had broken something open inside her. Even last night she\u2019d wanted what he seemed to be offering, but now that he\u2019d laid it out on the table so totally? She wanted it more. Desperately. Even though it terrified her.</p><p>And cue more tears. Damn it.</p><p>\u201cHoney, trust me. I\u2019m not Gordon. When something is bothering you, we\u2019ll talk about it. I want to know how you feel and what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d He sighed and swept the hair back from her face with gentle palms. \u201cToo many Doms want some sweet little sub who won\u2019t give them any challenge. I could pick up the phone now and call any one of the dozens of such subs I know. But your submission is only as good as my dominance. It\u2019s your vitality and your passion I want, and your full life contributes to those. Under normal circumstances, I would never interfere with your job or your friends. If I ever behave like Gordon, you have my permission to string me up by the balls. I want to master your body, not put a lockdown on your life.\u201d</p><p>Really?</p><p>Kata bit her lip as she stared up into his hard male face, his eyes so blue in the semidarkness. He met her, moment for moment, not blinking. Not rushing her. His words bounced around in her head.</p> <p>Hunter had spelled out the situation perfectly. Now she had to decide: return to her casual lovers and sex with them that meant nothing, or submit?</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cALL right.\u201d Releasing a harsh breath, Kata sent him a jerky nod. \u201cIf you don\u2019t overwhelm me too much, I\u2019ll try to submit to you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNot to sound too much like Yoda, but \u2018do or do not; there is no try.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Hunter was an all or nothing guy. And so far, she\u2019d done everything halfway. If she wanted this, wanted to find out if he was really going to fill that empty, aching need in her that had never been quite satisfied, she was going to have to cooperate. Hunter couldn\u2019t give her that elusive, ultimate satisfaction if she didn\u2019t let him.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Satisfaction settled into his stark features. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>That look suffused her with pleasure. Normally, she wouldn\u2019t give a shit what any guy thought. Gordon had rearranged her wiring so that she didn\u2019t go out of her way to please any male. For some reason, Hunter was different. Yes, he was often pushy and unyielding, which sometimes translated to teeth-gritting annoyance. But he didn\u2019t appear to command her simply for the sake of pumping up whatever chest-thumping, knuckle-dragging caveman lived inside him. He had a purpose. And if she wanted more of his smiles, affection, and sugary-perfect touch\u2014and that orgasm he\u2019d been withholding\u2014she was going to have to rein in her temper.</p> <p>He brushed her cheek with a tender caress, settled his mouth over hers. Her thoughts scattered. His kiss drifted over her lips, softer than a whisper but with more impact than a sledgehammer. She drew in a shaky breath. An ache bled through her chest, until her nipples peaked again. This feeling went beyond a mere craving for his touch to an insane desire to be meaningful to him. It speared her heart, the terrifying yearning for all of him to merge with all of her.</p><p>Because she wanted it so badly, Kata realized that Hunter was holding himself back.</p><p>She raised her head, as much as the manacles allowed, and fused their mouths together in another silent plea. She opened to him, arched to him, told him in a thousand subtle ways that he was welcome.</p><p>Instead of taking what she offered, he eased back and stared at her as if she were a puzzle to solve. Lying naked under the muted, grayish light, prisoner to his perceptive gaze, made her so aware of her own skin, of the ceiling fan\u2019s cool breeze brushing her exposed nipples, the swollen, wet flesh between her legs. Manacled, open, she could hide nothing. Instead of squirming with the usual discomfort, more blood swelled her nipples and her clit pulsed under her skin.</p><p>His gaze was intimate. Ravenous. A thick ridge of cock stood behind the fly of his low-slung jeans. The fact that seeing her all spread out revved him up gave Kata a ridiculous thrill. She arched, thrusting her breasts out, silently offering what she so badly needed him to take.</p><p>As if he read her mind, Hunter ran a finger over the hard point of her nipple, down her belly, into her wet pussy. Light, toying, teasing, every touch was designed to take her up higher. A new ripple of pleasure crashed over her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, honey? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>His body on hers, every inch of that erection tenting his jeans deep inside her while they strained together for a mutually amazing climax.</p><p>She lifted her hips to him in silent invitation, hoping he\u2019d get the hint.</p><p>His gaze dipped lower, right between her legs, but he didn\u2019t move toward her.</p><p>\u201cKata,\u201d his tone warned. \u201cAny good Dom/sub relationship starts with clear communication.\u201d His phone dinged with a reminder alarm in the charged room. He leveled a heavy stare her way. \u201cTop of the hour, honey. Time for another punishment. Tell me what you want or brace yourself.\u201d</p><p>That calm, unblinking stare of his unnerved her. How did you tell a man so full of control and command that you wanted him to do his worst, even if it scared you senseless? He knew all this. Why did she have to make herself more vulnerable?</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I . . .\u201d Am so afraid.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Pity.\u201d As he opened the drawers of the nightstand, his jaw clenched. No mistaking his disappointment, edged in anger.</p><p>That didn\u2019t bode well for a quick orgasm. And some part of her really hated to disappoint him.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d she gasped. \u201cIf you want me to admit that I\u2019m hot for you, I am. Totally.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, no longer even looking at her. Instead, he prowled through the drawers of the nightstand. \u201cI can see that by looking at your hard nipples and your wet pussy. I didn\u2019t ask what you felt. I asked what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>Crap. He\u2019d given her another chance, and she\u2019d blown it with her reticence and her big mouth. Why was it so hard to admit her feelings and desires to him? Why did it feel too revealing? Gordon . . . and her mother. Their twisted relationship terrified her. But would Hunter really throw her feelings back in her face, use them against her? Or was she just too afraid to find out because baring her feelings gave him so much power?</p><p>Wincing at the ugly truth, Kata watched his quick, precise movements. The displeasure on his face was like a stab to the heart. And she had an inkling that whatever he was doing in that drawer would light up the ache in her unsatisfied body, quickly eclipsing any mental discomfort she would suffer by being honest.</p><p>\u201cHunter, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. Please.\u201d Kata willed him to look at her. He didn\u2019t. \u201cThis is hard for me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, looked her way. \u201cI know. What\u2019s happening is unfamiliar and uncomfortable. I\u2019ve taken that into account. My problem is, you\u2019re still trying to submit on your terms. I won\u2019t let that happen, honey.\u201d</p><p>He trailed his fingers through her drenched folds. She gasped at the immediate resurgence of pleasure. He could make her want him so easily, so completely. That unnerved her to the core.</p><p>\u201cYour body wants this.\u201d He drilled a serious blue stare into her, as if willing her to understand. \u201cNow your mind must accept it. I see a submissive\u2019s need to be taken and to please on your face, but your fear is in our way.\u201d</p><p>Kata wanted so badly to tell him that he was wrong. But she\u2019d be lying. As his thumb grazed her clit again, need jolted her entire body. She arched to him, trying to increase the pressure on her little bundle of nerves.</p><p>He withdrew his hand from her needy flesh, then began taking items from the nightstand and placing them above her head, just out of her line of sight. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can get you past that.\u201d</p><p>She broke out in a cold sweat. Handing the key to unlock her body\u2014and her heart\u2014to someone as alpha and ruthless as Hunter scared her. But if she didn\u2019t truly submit, what did she have to look forward to when Hunter was gone except more meaningless flings?</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she blurted. \u201cI want you to do anything. Everything . . . even though it terrifies me.\u201d</p><p>A smile eased the harshness from his face. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>He understood. Thank God. She released the breath she\u2019d been holding. \u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Instantly, his stare turned thunderous\u2014and made her shiver. \u201cThat\u2019s for me to decide. And for you to take without comment or complaint. Because you trust me.\u201d</p><p>Kata bit her lip. Her first urge was to tell him to go to hell. She swallowed it. As much as being bound and helpless disturbed her independent nature, she couldn\u2019t deny that her body loved it . . . and craved him.</p><p>What would it be like to give herself completely\u2014no worries, no responsibilities or fears\u2014over to him for a night? If the only thing in the world that mattered was the connection between them? That seductive thought whispered her name, a terrifying pleasure drug waiting to become addictive.</p><p>Hunter stood at the side of the bed and did nothing more than watch and wait as thoughts pinged through her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she finally whispered into the silence. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He sent her a curt nod, then grabbed one of the items he\u2019d placed on the mattress above her head. The crinkle of plastic filled her ears. He drew in a deep breath of anticipation, his chest lifting, looking lethally strong. Kata was dying to know what he planned to do but didn\u2019t ask. It would only prolong an argument her body knew she was going to lose.</p><p>He bent and sucked a nipple into his mouth. Immediately, heat assailed her, and the little bud tightened almost painfully. Moisture gushed from her, slicking her folds even more. Straightening, he lowered his gaze squarely to her pussy and rubbed a pair of fingers right over the slick hood of her clit. Sensation struck her like lightning. She bucked, arched. Moaned.</p><p>\u201cHunter . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho am I in bed?\u201d</p><p>No way she could hold back her reply. \u201cSir. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Ever been clamped, honey?\u201d He set his mouth on her other nipple, still looking her way.</p><p>And she watched his mouth move over her, working her, his cheeks concave, his teeth gently nipping until she moaned.</p><p>Then he nipped harder. \u201cI asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>Since she wasn\u2019t exactly sure what he meant, she figured she had the answer. \u201cNo.\u201d At his raised brow, she added a hasty, \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>A ghost of a grin broke across that gorgeous male mouth. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to this. Remember, if this is too painful, just say \u2018Ben.\u2019 Otherwise, no complaining. No coming.\u201d</p><p>No coming, still? Kata whimpered.</p><p>Hunter ignored her and lifted his hand to her breasts, hovering above her nipple. He pinched something between his fingers then lowered it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh shit. Nipple clamps.</p><p>Tight and vicious, they sank their teeth into her tender flesh, and she cried out. Dizzying pain\u2014at first. It blurred quickly into searing, fiery pleasure.</p><p>Her nipples soon felt swollen to twice their normal size. Her skin tingled, electric and alive, unlike anything she\u2019d ever felt. More moisture seeped from her pussy. She fisted her hands. \u201cHunter!\u201d She gulped. \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he praised as his fingers surrounded the clamps and gave them a light twist. \u201cYou like it?\u201d</p> <p>Yes, yes, yes. Kata couldn\u2019t withhold the truth. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Do you want me to fuck you?\u201d He gave the clamps another pinch and twist.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t imagined that her nipples could throb as badly as her clit, but now they felt connected by an invisible wire, each jumping anytime the others were touched. His every move brought her to the edge of pleasure and pain, and knowing that she couldn\u2019t do a damn thing about it was one of the biggest turn-ons of her life. That had to make her twenty kinds of sick in the head. She\u2019d never thought that she\u2019d get off on being bent to any guy\u2019s will. But somehow, Hunter made that work for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she cried out. \u201cOf course I want you to fuck me!\u201d</p><p>All softness left his face. The arctic was downright balmy compared to this stare. \u201cI would have preferred a polite \u2018Yes, Sir.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>No doubt. And as lousy a job as she was doing curbing her tongue, it could be another decade before he allowed her to get off.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d She swallowed down her impatience . . . at least as much as she could.</p><p>Hunter laughed. \u201cEven when you say the right words, the tone is still so much closer to \u2018fuck off.\u2019 Curbing your sass is going to be a long-term project.\u201d</p><p>And likely one doomed to failure. \u201cDamn it, I\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence.\u201d A moment later, he raised his hand and slapped his fingers down on the pad of her pussy.</p><p>Oh. My. God. Her head told her that she should feel degraded. Infuriated, at least. But no. Fire spread through her. Tingles danced behind her clit. She gasped. Desire grew to a seething, throbbing ache, magnified until every beat of her heart was echoed between her legs.</p> <p>\u201cW-what are you doing to me?\u201d she wailed.</p><p>He swiped a finger through her sopping flesh, then lifted a glistening finger. \u201cAre you going to try to tell me that you didn\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>Now he was taunting her. She bit her lip, holding her response inside.</p><p>Hunter sat at the edge of the bed. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make any progress until you start being honest with me\u2014and yourself. Right now, I have all the patience in the world. How about you?\u201d</p><p>Kata had reached the end of her rope\u2014and he knew it. Hunter wasn\u2019t like Ben or any other guy she\u2019d dated. She couldn\u2019t manipulate him with a pout or a sexy look. Damn it, he\u2019d dug into her psyche and learned all her fears, her darkest secrets and wants. He was arousing her more than any man ever had. Still, she had no doubt he\u2019d hold out on her until she lost the attitude and submitted with honesty.</p><p>Her need only grew worse when he dropped his jeans.</p><p>Oh dear God. Tall, broad, those shoulders nearly as wide as the doorframe behind him. And his cock stood thick, tall, ready. She couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away, wanted him so badly she didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d stand even another ten seconds without him working his way inside her. When he took her, he did it with a single-minded determination that made her feel so desirable and special\u2014something she\u2019d never had before. Something she needed now.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Sir. I can\u2019t take much more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he mused aloud. \u201cWe\u2019re getting closer. But there\u2019s still a lot of starch in your spine.\u201d</p><p>Already, he\u2019d trashed through so much of the electrified barbed wire and GET THE FUCK OUT signs around her defenses. But Hunter had made it perfectly clear that he wasn\u2019t resting until she gave every part of her submission, her soul. She must put her tongue on lockdown in order to relieve this seething, burning desire eating her alive.</p><p>She swallowed her anger. \u201cNo . . . Sir. No starch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been reading submissives for a dozen years. I know your signals. In your head, you\u2019re trying to figure out how you can placate me to get what you want, not how to please me so I give you what you need.\u201d</p><p>Kata felt more exposed than she\u2019d ever been . . . but he was right. One look at his implacable face told her that he wasn\u2019t going to let this go.</p><p>His challenging stare scraped her raw. She closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m doing my best to open up. Sir.\u201d</p><p>Hunter sat at the edge of the bed and rubbed the back of his knuckles over her breasts. \u201cI realize that I\u2019ve breached your comfort zone, and that, given your family dynamic, this isn\u2019t easy for you. You haven\u2019t come close to giving me everything, but you\u2019ve given a lot. Wars aren\u2019t fought in a day.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAt least you\u2019re being honest and polite now. I\u2019ll reward that.\u201d</p><p>Hunter slid his body over hers, everything about him heart-stoppingly male. He kissed her with a desperate edge, under control . . . but just barely. Somehow, that made her feel better. Slightly mollified, she blanked her mind and allowed herself to drown in his kiss.</p><p>It went on forever. He angled his head to deepen the penetration of his mouth, his tongue stealing inside and raiding every bit of her breath and resistance. His hands gripped the sides of her face, keeping her exactly where he wanted her as he took\u2014and gave. His kiss tasted of sweet comfort, even as it overwhelmed her with the spice of desire. His devotion flooded her next, a tangy aphrodisiac that lured her deeper.</p><p>From the first, Hunter had affected her like no other man. Now, he proved over and over that, for her, he was different. Special.</p><p>If they ended this crazy, spontaneous marriage, would any other man ever do again? They\u2019d shared a bed only a few times, and already she felt wrapped up in him, desperate to soak in his determination and the ecstasy he gave her. Aching to give herself utterly to him. She shut out the voice inside her that was still trying to scream in protest and sank into his embrace.</p><p>Hunter lifted his head, looked down at her through the shadows. \u201cBetter.\u201d Firm with demand, his lips took hers again with a dark, lingering insistence. When she responded in kind, without closing anything off from him, he moaned. \u201cIncredible.\u201d</p><p>His praise suffused a glow all through her. Just by being totally in the moment with him, she\u2019d pleased him. After spending so long not giving a shit what anyone but her mother thought, that felt good. Scary still, but sublime.</p><p>He made his way down her body, pausing to lap at her nipples around the clamps. The dizzying pleasure/pain scattered the gentle glow of the last few moments, slamming her with a craving so strong, it seized her breath. Intense. Gripping. Impossible to ignore.</p><p>\u201cHunter . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey. These will come off soon. And you\u2019ll scream like you never have. So fucking sexy. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>His words were an erotic riptide, sucking her under even deeper. Drowning was inevitable, and the anticipation made her shudder.</p><p>Then he eased down her body, his mouth drifting so, so softly over her stomach. A lap here, a nip there, awakening her even more. Kata\u2019s entire body clenched. Her yearning to put her fingers in the short strands of his hair, feel him alive and warm under her hands, assailed her like an addict craving his drug of choice.</p><p>\u201cFree my hands. Please.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head, his thumbs brushing her erect nipples so softly, a breathless madness closed in on her. \u201cThe control is mine. This is you trusting me to give you what you need, to push you farther than you think you can stand and still make you love it.\u201d</p><p>Kata arched, head tossed back, as she tried to endure his torment. But her body had become one giant ache that knew only the need for his possession.</p><p>His hand drifted down her stomach, into the wet curls between her legs. \u201cHmm, so wet and swollen. You might struggle to understand what\u2019s happening between us, but when I touch you, I know your body is on board.\u201d</p><p>He dragged his thumb over her clit again. A second later, he followed with a wicked slide of his tongue over the little bundle. She moaned, and he repeated the motion until her hips thrashed, until she cried out with a constant mewl of need.</p><p>\u201cNo coming until I say so,\u201d he reminded.</p><p>She snapped her head from side to side in a silent scream of denial. After all the kissing, the touching, the repeated ramp-ups and cooldowns, her body was beyond primed. \u201cI . . . can\u2019t stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re strong. You can. I\u2019ll release you at the right time. Just trust me.\u201d</p><p>He pressed two fingers inside her, then dragged fresh moisture over her sensitive little nub, rubbing in an unceasing, endless circle that completely unraveled her. His tongue followed once more, a hot lash that damn near destroyed her. Kata stopped breathing, stopped thinking. Every muscle in her body tensed with effort to stave off the inevitable. But oh . . . holding this orgasm at bay felt like trying to stop an avalanche with a paper plate.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you give me tonight, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d The ache for release screeched under her skin, and she whimpered with need.</p><p>\u201cHow badly do you want to come for me?\u201d</p><p>God, he wanted her to beg. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so . . . on fire. It\u2019s like\u201d\u2014she panted\u2014\u201can exquisite pain. Please, Hunter. Sir. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking gorgeous, honey. Are you on birth control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Please let that mean he intended to fuck her now.</p><p>He paused, his fingers unmoving, and her entire body seized up. No!</p><p>\u201cBecause of Ben?\u201d</p><p>The question slammed across her brain. Was he jealous? Would he punish her again by leaving her to ache and burn even more?</p><p>\u201cThe truth,\u201d he demanded as he shimmied up her body, his hot body pressed against her side, flaying her with heat. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Irregular cycle. Since I was fourteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re clean?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a jerky nod. In truth, she\u2019d never had sex without a condom, but with the broiling heat of his cock hovering like a promise and a threat above her throbbing clit, she found it too hard to speak.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes . . . Sir,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. You\u2019re doing really well, your gorgeous skin all warm and damp and flushed.\u201d His hot breath caressed her ear. A shiver scratched down her spine. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>A dozen smart-ass replies died a fiery death before she whimpered, \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he removed both clamps on her nipples at once. Blood rushed back in, the flood painful and yet . . . She screamed with the cacophony of sensation assailing her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d He eased aside and settled his fingers back on her clit and circled the responsive flesh mercilessly.</p><p>The sting in her nipples converged with the fireball between her legs. Oh God, she couldn\u2019t stop it. The orgasm was headed her way like a freight train with no brakes, a steamroller with no off button, a supernova about to burst across space.</p><p>\u201cCome!\u201d he demanded.</p><p>With that one word, ecstasy climbed even more, a pleasure beyond her every fantasy, exploding across her senses, absorbing her in the earthy musk of cotton and sex, the deep timbre of his command ricocheting inside her, the salty tang of his sweat rolling down his neck, the sight of his demanding gaze electric with approval.</p><p>As the Mount Everest-sized peak broke over her and she struggled for breath, the blistering heat of Hunter\u2019s skin seared the insides of her thighs. Shaking, keening, trying desperately to grab the headboard in her hands, Kata could only watch in helpless thrall as Hunter fit the head of his bare cock to her opening and shoved into her spasming sex.</p><p>She screamed, her back bowing at his entrance\u2014a conquest without mercy, he compelled her surrender. It should have hurt, she thought vaguely. Instead, she welcomed his invasion as his hard flesh scraped along every brilliantly alive nerve ending inside her.</p><p>The climax grew, swelled. Hunter gritted his teeth and planted his elbows on either side of her head, gripping the headboard for leverage as he slammed into her. Then he did it again and again in a rapid rhythm. Every stroke sent her up higher, and she shouted in pleasure\u2014for him.</p><p>\u201cYes, honey. Fuck yes!\u201d He grunted out between gritted teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Every time Kata thought she\u2019d catch her breath, Hunter was there to steal it, his body keeping her rolling between one incredible peak and the next, his mouth slamming down on hers as his tongue took possession and demanded all she had to give.</p><p>She lifted to him, everything inside her reaching for him, meeting him, feeling like . . . one with him. Whatever this was, it in no way resembled mere sex. This transcended pleasure, became pure energy and connection and . . . God, she could barely put words to the dazzling, overwhelming sensations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kata knew in that moment that this man had changed her forever.</p><p>Hunter tore his mouth away, the breakneck speed of his thrusts steady as he fused his stare to hers, his eyes so blue in his flushed male face. Sweat dripped from his temples. Every muscle in his shoulders bunched with the effort of each thrust. The cords in his neck strained with every slide deep against her cervix.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d he demanded. \u201cCome with me now.\u201d</p><p>God, once she\u2019d started climaxing, she\u2019d never stopped. But when he swelled inside her, Kata\u2019s breath caught. He bit her shoulder, groaning against her skin, and shuddered above her. A flood of heat scorched deep inside her, sending her over another cliff with a scream.</p> <p>\u201cHunter!\u201d</p><p>Fire poured through her all over again. As he drove deep, his pace slowed until every measured glide against her wet flesh was a pleasure all its own. Her body convulsed again. She gave a last wail and went limp against him.</p><p>Moments later, he shifted. She heard a snap, then a click. Her wrists were free. He spent a long minute massaging each with strong hands, trailing kisses across her shoulder, her cheeks. Wearily, she closed her eyes and snuggled against him in contentment as he petted her softly.</p><p>\u201cPut your arms around me,\u201d Hunter requested. His voice sounded deeper, gravelly, almost desperate. \u201cWill you?\u201d</p><p>Their gazes met in the shadows. A zing of awareness burst over her. He\u2019d been as affected by their lovemaking as she\u2019d been. Inside, she sang chorus and verse of Hallelujah.</p> <p>Hunter lifted a shaking hand to her face, caressing a stray curl from her cheek. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Wow, after that, no way she could deny him a simple embrace\u2014or anything, she feared.</p><p>Lifting her heavy arms, Kata wound them around his neck, pressing her fingers into his shoulders, her body so close to his. And God, more tears welled up. He\u2019d shaken everything inside her, forever ruined her for anything simple or casual, for anyone other than him.</p><p>\u201cKata,\u201d he murmured, his voice more like a growl. \u201cYou have to know . . . I love you.\u201d</p><p>Those words sent a shock wave through her. She gasped, her eyes going wide. Love? In less than thirty-six hours? Insane. Unheard of.</p><p>Her heart stuttered, lurched. Unfortunately, she feared she wasn\u2019t too far behind.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything right now,\u201d he whispered, his mouth lifting in an exhausted smile. \u201cThat look tells me everything I need to know.\u201d</p><p>Kata knew what he saw\u2014a woman on the precipice of losing her heart. It scared the hell out of her. She\u2019d rather give a public speech to millions just before she jumped off a skyscraper with no safety net. But she didn\u2019t think even fear was going to stop this plunge.</p><p>She swallowed, hid her face in his neck, but even then she was surrounded by his musk, his sweat, his strength. And as he caressed her hair, lips whispering over her temple, she felt his love most of all.</p><p>A shrill ring sliced through the breathless silence. Hunter cursed and leaned toward the nightstand, refusing to withdraw from her body. That meaning wasn\u2019t lost on her.</p><p>He glared at the display. A scowl tightened his face, and he cursed again, longer, uglier. \u201cBarnes. What?\u201d</p><p>This close to Hunter, Kata couldn\u2019t help but overhear the conversation. \u201cI know you\u2019re on leave, buddy, but we just received critical intel. You know that development we discussed about your last mission? We have a problem.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cKATA?\u201d Hunter reached across the cab of the truck to caress her shoulder.</p> <p>She pulled away and looked out the passenger-side window.</p><p>Son. Of. A bitch.</p><p>Jerking his hand back, Hunter wrapped it around the steering wheel of Tyler\u2019s truck as he drove east into the rising sun. The last thing he wanted to do while on leave and this spontaneous \u201choneymoon\u201d was to report for duty, especially after coaxing Kata\u2019s stunning surrender. She\u2019d also revealed sensitive information about her family. Now, with his pending departure, she probably felt abandoned. But he and Barnes and other members of SEAL Team 4 had spent years trying to take down Venezuelan prick V\u00edctor Sotillo and his arms-dealing gang. If there was even a chance that the prick\u2019s brother, Adan, had reorganized the group after V\u00edctor\u2019s demise and was trying to do a big deal with his Iranian contacts in the next twenty-four hours, then Hunter had to do whatever necessary to stop them, hopefully for good.</p><p>So he\u2019d promised Barnes that, after returning his wife to Lafayette, he\u2019d be on a plane to the base in Virginia Beach by noon. No doubt, he\u2019d be out of the country before nightfall.</p><p>Beside him, Kata looked shell-shocked and hurt. All his plans to make her safe, well sated, and head over heels in love had swirled down the toilet with that one call. Fuck.</p><p>His timetable to persuade Kata to fall for him would run even shorter now that he had to take an unexpected detour to a jungle shithole. He heard the damn ticking clock in his head. Worse, he\u2019d blurted out his feelings before she was ready to hear them. And this morning, all her defenses seemed to be back in place. Hunter began to wonder . . . He might be able to compel her body, but her heart? The sinking dread in his gut warned him that this might be one mission he couldn\u2019t complete in time. Her stepfather had fucked up her psyche good. The question was, how could he fly a continent away to fight tangos, then heal her during the precious little time of his remaining leave so she could be free to love? It sounded fucking impossible, but Hunter refused to give up.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, honey?\u201d He reached across the cab of the truck to grab her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d She tensed and tried to tug away.</p><p>Hunter held firm. \u201cBack to Lafayette. I\u2019m hoping to be gone two days, three at most. While you\u2019re there, you\u2019ll be guarded by friends, men I have no doubt will do everything possible to protect you.\u201d</p><p>Kata scowled at him. \u201cYou\u2019re dumping me on your buddies\u2019 doorsteps and asking them to babysit? Hell no. I\u2019ll get some of my cop friends\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already discussed this. With your assassin killed so quickly in jail, we don\u2019t know if we can trust the police. I usually only dominate in the bedroom, but when it comes to your safety, all bets are off. While you showered, I made some phone calls.\u201d This part pissed him off most, and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with Tyler for the first day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler? The flirty beefcake who called me \u2018baby\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Hunter strangled the steering wheel, wishing it were Tyler\u2019s neck. \u201cYes. He\u2019s a former detective who\u2019s done some bodyguard work. He\u2019ll keep you safe. I\u2019d rather leave you with Deke, but my sister went into labor about two this morning.\u201d</p><p>Which was a fucking shame. Not only would he miss the birth of his niece or nephew, but the worry that Tyler was hitting on Kata would be niggling in the back of his mind. His brother-in-law would never touch her. Hunter had no such warm fuzzy about Tyler.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for Kimber, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Cole is due home tomorrow night, so he\u2019ll relieve Tyler of duty. Jack is the best.\u201d And the guy was so deliriously in love with his gorgeous submissive wife that he\u2019d barely notice Kata was female.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re trying to keep me safe, but I don\u2019t know any of these people. I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable camping out at their place and having them hover. There must be another way.\u201d</p><p>He leveled a stern stare her way. \u201cI\u2019m going to be halfway around the world, up to my eyeballs in terrorists and their illegal shit. I\u2019ll be more focused if I know you\u2019re with professionals who can and will do whatever necessary to protect you. I get that it\u2019s awkward, but I need to know that you\u2019re safe while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>She leveled a get-real glare at him. \u201cIn other words, do what I say or I might be so unfocused that I\u2019ll die? That\u2019s blackmail.\u201d</p><p>Hunter flashed her a grin. \u201cIs it working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh! You annoying son of a . . .\u201d She shook her head, glossy black curls skimming her back. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll stay with your pals for a few days.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand, smoothing his thumb over her knuckles. \u201cWhen I come back, I\u2019ll have a bit of leave left. We\u2019ll work on us. I want to meet your parents, help you with your concerns. I want you to feel free to give yourself to me without fears or worries.\u201d</p><p>Kata yanked her hand from his grasp. When Hunter slanted a glance at her tight face and downcast gaze, his guts seized up. Uh-oh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw your brother\u2019s living room, if that\u2019s what you want to call it. That hardly put me at ease. What the hell? Is regular dating just too bland for you guys?\u201d</p><p>Hunter had dreaded this discussion. As he\u2019d led her through the predawn shadows of Logan\u2019s living room, she\u2019d finally gotten a firsthand peek. No sofas or big screens for his younger brother. Instead, a St. Andrew\u2019s cross, a spanking bench, a restraint table, spreader bars, and chains dangling from the ceiling beams filled the space.</p><p>To a woman terrified of giving up control, Logan\u2019s living room would be a nightmare. Hunter\u2019s thoughts whirled as he tried to figure out how the hell he could do damage control.</p><p>\u201cSo Logan and I are both dominant. His d\u00e9cor has nothing to do with you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to try to tell me that you\u2019ve never used any of that equipment?\u201d</p><p>No, he was well versed, and she was too astute not to know it. \u201cI prefer restraint tables and spanking benches. Not as fond of the crosses.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter what I use. I\u2019d never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d just restrain me and do whatever the hell you wanted so you could turn me inside out. Both you and your brother are intent on locking down the women in your lives. What the hell is that about?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already explained his need to protect and sate her . . . yet push her to take all of him in any way he felt necessary to truly connect them. He\u2019d been over this\u2014and over and over it. He definitely wasn\u2019t going to explain that he\u2019d discovered BDSM the summer after his mother\u2019s desertion. Okay, so the two were probably linked, but at this point, why explain it? It was what it was.</p><p>\u201cThat was you screaming in my ear a few hours ago while I restrained and satisfied you, right?\u201d Hunter challenged her. \u201cDid you think, for even one minute, that I was going to force any act on you that your body didn\u2019t fully respond to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but my body and my brain are having one hell of a disagreement about what I need in a man for the long term, and you\u2019re trying to push past my boundaries faster than I\u2019m ready.\u201d She looked out the passenger window.</p><p>That, he believed. If not for this mission, he\u2019d spend more time reassuring her . . . before putting some of the items in Logan\u2019s living room to good use and giving her a darker taste of his dominance. She needed to experience more of the deep, incredible power exchange between them so she could see that she had nothing to fear. His mission put all that on hold. No wonder she felt a little lost.</p><p>\u201cKata, listen to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Hunter, you listen to me. We have awesome chemistry. I won\u2019t deny that, but . . .\u201d She sighed. \u201cI liked last night. I won\u2019t try to say I didn\u2019t. You make me feel adored and aroused in a way I never believed possible. But I don\u2019t think I can handle this. Getting married was a stupid impulse. You want something I can\u2019t give you. We should be smart now and end it, before we both get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Fear sent dread resounding all through him. She wanted a divorce? \u201cI\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe reasonable. We\u2019ve known each other for less than two days.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot happening. I love you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, gaze falling away. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean it. You don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth together, wanting to strangle her \u201clogic\u201d with his bare hands. The only thing running her brain was fear. \u201cHoney, I meant every word.\u201d Hunter had no idea how to explain what he knew in his gut was true. He shook his head, sorting through his thoughts. \u201cWhy did you invite your sister to your party?\u201d</p><p>Kata frowned like he\u2019d lost his mind. \u201cShe\u2019s my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s married and has kids, and this wasn\u2019t her sort of party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah ... but the celebration wouldn\u2019t have felt complete without her.\u201d Her mouth turned down a moment later.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted your mother there, too.\u201d</p><p>Now Kata looked downright unhappy. \u201cFucking Gordon wouldn\u2019t let her come.\u201d</p><p>Another strike against the asshole in Hunter\u2019s book. Little wonder Kata hated him. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you called your brother as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoaquin didn\u2019t answer,\u201d she shrugged glumly. \u201cGuess he\u2019s undercover.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hunter put his arm around her. \u201cYou knew he might not, but you still tried. You\u2019ll always try because you care. You\u2019re the glue holding your family together, aren\u2019t you? That\u2019s one reason I love you. Honey, you\u2019re smart and sexy as hell, and even when you\u2019re pissed at me, your razor-sharp humor makes me smile. I know underneath that is a scared girl, and I want to show her that she\u2019s loved and doesn\u2019t always have to be in control.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like not being in control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome part of you does, at least in the bedroom. You found that out last night, and the depth of your submission scared you.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since he\u2019d met Kata, she didn\u2019t have a cheeky comeback on the tip of her tongue. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>He cradled her cheek in his palm. \u201cOur marriage was no mistake. And when I come back from this mission, we\u2019re going to spend a lot of quality time together, until you\u2019re comfortable with me. I\u2019ll keep doing whatever it takes to earn your submission and your love. Don\u2019t doubt that.\u201d</p><p>Sadness furrowed Kata\u2019s brow. She pursed her lips together, as if she were holding tears inside. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will work. I\u2019m independent. I can\u2019t stand people telling me what to do. I\u2019m stubborn and decisive . . . everything you don\u2019t want. You\u2019re a logical guy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut one who knows when to go with his gut. So our courtship was in fast-forward. So I don\u2019t know your favorite color or TV show. So you don\u2019t know which of my scars are from a childhood bike accident and which are from military service. So fucking what? Those are details.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t confuse a Dom with an asshole. The truth is, you\u2019ve been in \u2018easy\u2019 relationships so your heart would never be threatened. If you were to ask yourself\u2014and be really honest\u2014you know that you can\u2019t ever be truly happy with guys like Ben, who let you call all the shots.\u201d</p><p>Pressing her lush lips together, Kata stared out the window. Only the hum of the truck\u2019s engine and the faint twang of an old-time country western station broke the silence. Hunter wasn\u2019t deterred. Even if she didn\u2019t admit it, she was thinking.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about me?\u201d he prompted, his tone brooking no refusal. \u201cAnd watch the sarcasm. You should know I have no problem turning your ass bright red.\u201d</p> <p>Kata paused, shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous, but you don\u2019t act like you know it. You have loyal friends and family, which suggests that you must be loyal yourself. You seem confident in almost every situation, but not cocky. You\u2019re smart and quick . . . and probably good with kittens and babies, too.\u201d Kata quipped with a twist of her lips that gave Hunter hope. \u201cBut you\u2019re also relentless and too damn perceptive. Every minute you find some new way to twist me inside out. I hate the word \u2018submissive.\u2019 It implies that I\u2019m some simpering, brainless\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever you. I told you, that\u2019s one reason I want you. Some subs lose themselves and their identities to their Masters. If they\u2019re uncollared, in other words if the relationship ends, they\u2019re so used to being dependent, they don\u2019t know who they are anymore. I\u2019ll never worry about that with you. I have no doubt you\u2019ll always challenge me. Honey, the big difference between me and Gordon\u2014and listen closely\u2014is that, with that selfish prick it\u2019s all about his desires. With me, I can\u2019t be happy if I\u2019m not giving you what you need. I\u2019ll concede that our marriage was quick. But give us a fucking chance before you bow to your fear and quit on us.\u201d</p><p>RUSH hour, or Lafayette\u2019s equivalent, was nearly at an end when Kata and Hunter approached the city. She stretched, then applied some lip gloss from her purse as her\u2014she still could barely say the word\u2014husband drove with a pair of aviators covering those perceptive blue eyes. With one hand, he held the wheel. With the other, he gripped her hand.</p><p>Before last night, the wound he\u2019d made in her defenses in Vegas had just begun to scab over. She could have resumed her life without him, granted, with some regrets. But after last night . . .</p><p>Kata trembled. Hunter had introduced her to a whole new pleasure. Electric. Breath-stealing. Once-in-a-lifetime wow. No way was she going to delude herself and say that she hadn\u2019t enjoyed his manacles and firm hand. Hunter had forced her to see deep inside herself and admit her fears to him. In his domination, she\u2019d felt utterly adored, almost pampered, which was contrary to everything she believed. He\u2019d ripped off that scab and permanently scarred her defenses.</p><p>Today, she hated the raw, vulnerable feeling left behind. His every move had been designed to shove his way into her life, her head, her heart. He\u2019d made her feel something for him that was way bigger than she could handle. Sure, other women craved being controlled. Kata wasn\u2019t cut out for letting anyone that deeply into her soul.</p> <p>And whether Hunter fessed up to it or not, he wanted to control bunches beyond their bedroom play. That\u2019s where she had a problem. No, he wasn\u2019t Gordon. Hunter was her stepfather on steroids, smarter, more determined. Under all his pushiness he was probably a decent guy, but he could also act like Asshole version 2.0 when it suited him. He claimed that his behavior was about giving her what she needed. Smooth line. Bet Gordon wished he\u2019d thought of that. Granted, Hunter hadn\u2019t torn her down to build up his own ego, but did that matter if she had no power in the relationship? She\u2019d eventually lose all self-respect and feel like shit anyway.</p><p>On the other hand, he\u2019d accused her of not really giving him and the marriage a chance.</p><p>She glanced his way. He met her stare, and the electric zing between them charged through her.</p><p>Had her mother felt this pull to Gordon, even as her friends, her job, and her individuality slowly slipped away? Hunter even admitted that some subs lost themselves to their Dom. Besides the fact that she couldn\u2019t imagine wearing anyone\u2019s collar, like some pet, Kata worried that if she allowed him complete mastery over her body, she would soon lose herself in the extreme pleasure he gave her, and surrender her heart and soul.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, honey?\u201d Hunter murmured.</p><p>Kata chose her words carefully. He terrified her emotionally, but his point about being distracted on a mission was well taken. She didn\u2019t want to do anything that would place him in greater peril. They\u2019d sort out everything when he returned.</p><p>\u201cJust tired. Overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>He sent her a searching stare as he pulled into the parking lot of an upscale apartment building, then eased the truck into a spot under a shade tree. Twenty feet away, Tyler stood in the doorway, waiting. Whoa! She\u2019d forgotten how big he was built. With a guy like him, she\u2019d normally assume he was a gym rat whose fantasies revolved around increasing the circumference of his biceps, but she\u2019d already seen him in action enough to know he possessed a sharp watchfulness that promised he could totally kick someone\u2019s ass.</p> <p>Yeah, he\u2019d keep her safe, but Kata wasn\u2019t at all happy about this arrangement. How contrary did it make her that she\u2019d been dying to put space between her and Hunter, but already she felt the pangs from his withdrawal?</p><p>They stepped from the truck, and Tyler jogged down the exterior stairs to greet them. \u201cHi, baby. I got your suitcase from the back of your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\u2014\u201d She frowned at the green-eyed beefcake in the killer tight black tee. \u201cHow did you get into my trunk without my keys?\u201d</p><p>Tyler smiled smugly, then turned to Hunter. \u201cI talked to Jack. He\u2019ll be by to get her tomorrow night.\u201d Then his grin turned sly. \u201cThat is, if she still wants to go.\u201d</p><p>Hunter lunged into Tyler\u2019s personal space, then growled, \u201cLet\u2019s get one thing straight: Kata is not your \u2018baby\u2019; she\u2019s my wife. You don\u2019t touch her. You don\u2019t even think about touching her. Or I swear to God, I\u2019ll rip your face off.\u201d</p><p>Really, Hunter had nothing to worry about. Tyler was attractive . . . but her life was complicated enough.</p><p>Tyler looked amused. \u201cPossessive much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFocus on the fact that someone wants to kill Kata. I get that other men\u2019s wives turn you on, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s all bluster, Hunter.\u201d A familiar guy emerged from Tyler\u2019s apartment, with dark, shoulder-length waves that would seem feminine on another man. On him, it looked drop-dead sexy as he sauntered down the steps into the morning light.</p><p>\u201cLuc Traverson?\u201d Kata stared, stunned. \u201cWow, I love your cooking show!\u201d</p><p>And he was even more gorgeous in person.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He extended a hand to her. \u201cGreat to meet you. You\u2019re Hunter\u2019s wife, Kata?\u201d At her stilted shrug, he drawled, \u201cMy deepest sympathies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d Hunter didn\u2019t sound amused as he glared at Luc. \u201cYou\u2019re here because . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Kata frowned. \u201cHow do you two know each other?\u201d</p><p>The two men exchanged a glance, and she knew something was up here. Finally, Luc nodded. \u201cKimber\u2019s husband, Deke, is my cousin.\u201d</p><p>He was cousin Luc? Wow . . .</p><p>Tyler snorted. \u201cHe and Deke used to share everything.\u201d</p><p>Did he mean . . . ? From the looks on everyone\u2019s faces, yes. Kimber and Deke and Luc? Kata\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>Luc cast a sidelong glare at Tyler. \u201cShut up.\u201d Then he turned back to Hunter. \u201cI\u2019m here because I know the hell of wondering if you\u2019re wife is screwing this asswipe.\u201d He jerked a thumb at Tyler. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put anyone through it. I\u2019m happy to babysit until I have to start prep for tonight\u2019s dinner service at Bonheur. Besides, Alyssa is wrapped up in Sexy Sirens\u2019 rebuild, despite being thirty weeks pregnant. So my very curious wife sent me to collect the juicy details about your marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for staying with Kata for as long as you can.\u201d Muttering a curse under his breath, Hunter glanced at his watch, then winced. He turned all his formidable attention on her, his face tight with regret. Damn if just being near him didn\u2019t make her tingle from head to toe. Damn if he didn\u2019t make her feel everything for him, even when she didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, honey.\u201d He layered his lips over hers.</p><p>So often, Hunter had kissed her with possession and overwhelming passion. He was always like a cat-five tornado barreling at breakneck speed for the protective walls around her heart, frightfully eager to mow them down. Now he was like a wisp of smoke, so light she almost wondered if she was imagining the kiss. All too quickly, her lips began to tingle, like they did after eating her abuelita\u2019s homemade salsa. But this sensation couldn\u2019t be cured with cold milk. Hunter just impacted her. And this kiss, so tender, hit her right in the chest.</p><p>For her, there really was something about him\u2014both incredible and terrifying.</p><p>Needing more, she leaned into the kiss, opening to him, fingers digging into his shoulders. She trapped a whimper at the back of her throat.</p><p>With a caress of his knuckles down her cheek, he eased back, then gripped her face in his hands with a desperation that further crumbled her defenses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe safe,\u201d she choked on a whisper.</p><p>After another lingering kiss, he strutted down the steps to the blacktop parking lot already giving off shimmering heat waves, despite the fact that it was just after nine a.m.</p><p>Watching him go hurt. Kata realized that he\u2019d been reassuring her that no third world asshole would prevent him from coming back to her. It hit her then . . . Hunter had an incredibly dangerous job. Worse than a cop or a firefighter. He was knowingly walking into a fight with people who wanted to kill him each and every time he stepped into his role. Fear quivered in her belly, and she had to fight herself not to call him back. She doubted that she and Hunter were meant for the long haul, but if anything happened to him? God, she\u2019d crumble and die.</p><p>Why?</p><p>A taxi arrived to take Hunter away. He waved, and she watched until the ugly yellow and black vehicle rolled out of sight.</p><p>As soon as it disappeared around the corner, Tyler put a hand under her elbow and smiled. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come inside and make yourself comfortable, baby? We\u2019ll find some way to have fun.\u201d He winked at her, then glared at Luc. \u201cEven with the third wheel.\u201d</p><p>AFTER a quick trip through a nearby drive-thru for a burger and a stop at the video store, Kata settled beside Tyler on the sofa as he cued up their movie.</p><p>\u201cWhen I said cuddle up on the couch after Luc left, this isn\u2019t what I had in mind.\u201d His pained expression said he\u2019d rather be boiling in oil. \u201cAre you really going to make me watch this?\u201d</p><p>Hot, funny, attentive without being overwhelming, Tyler was everything she normally went for in a guy. Sure, they\u2019d flirted. It was like breathing for him, both constant and automatic. But she wasn\u2019t feeling a serious vibe between them\u2014which was a relief. Usually, she loved flirting, too, but Hunter had invaded every last brain cell and filled it with thoughts of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your silence as a no.\u201d Tyler reached for the remote.</p><p>She yanked it out of his hand, then had to laugh at his mock pout.</p><p>\u201cI love Edward and Bella. Have you even seen any of the movies?\u201d she challenged.</p><p>\u201cHell no. She looks constipated, and I swear he plays for the other team.\u201d</p> <p>Kata stifled a laugh. She really shouldn\u2019t encourage him. \u201cIt\u2019s called angst. Guess you\u2019ve never felt any.\u201d</p><p>Tyler leveled a hard stare on her that told her she was dead wrong. Then he saved her from muttering an awkward reply by starting the movie. She stifled what she\u2019d planned to say, since his life was none of her business and she was in no shape to be giving advice. Instead, Kata focused on the familiar Bella Swan voice-over that began the film.</p><p>About halfway through, he shuffled into the kitchen for popcorn, and Kata noticed that while it popped, his stare barely left the screen. Pulling one of the sofa\u2019s throw pillows to her chest, she smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d he groused. \u201cHelen Keller and Stevie Wonder could both see this love triangle coming. And this movie made how much money?\u201d</p><p>Kata threw the pillow at him. \u201cShh!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t shush me, woman, or I\u2019ll take you over my knee.\u201d</p><p>She froze. \u201cYou roll that way, too? What am I saying? Of course, you do. You\u2019re friends with Hunter.\u201d</p><p>And didn\u2019t she feel stupid for failing to figure it out sooner?</p><p>A frown creased Tyler\u2019s face. \u201cRoll what way?\u201d He frowned, then shook his head. \u201cOh, Hunter is into the BDSM thing. Control freak. No, that\u2019s not my thing. I leave that to him and Jack Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Jack who\u2019s coming to get me tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne and the same. He\u2019s one cool customer, man. And his wife is a doll. You\u2019ll like Morgan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s . . .\u201d Kata searched for the most flattering words so she didn\u2019t insult a woman Tyler obviously admired. \u201cEasy to get along with?\u201d</p><p>Had Jack erased Morgan\u2019s personality and replaced it with that of a \u201cyes, Sir\u201d kind of woman?</p><p>Tyler howled with laughter. \u201cMorgan, easy to get along with? I made that assumption once. She nearly strung me up by the balls. That\u2019s one scary woman when she\u2019s pissed. Even Jack is smart enough to steer clear of her then.\u201d</p><p>Kata wasn\u2019t sure how to interpret Tyler\u2019s words. If her mother tried to assert herself, Gordon found a thousand not-so-subtle ways to tell Mam\u00e1 that she was wrong and her \u201ctantrum\u201d ridiculous. But when he got mad . . . watch out. But Tyler made it sound like Jack heeded his wife\u2019s moods, rather than belittled them. Was that the norm in a BDSM marriage, or just Jack and Morgan\u2019s?</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. As much as she had feelings for Hunter, as much as they were explosive between the sheets, she didn\u2019t belong married to someone she\u2019d met less than two days ago, who could wring both her body and her heart inside out.</p><p>She needed to talk to someone. To Mam\u00e1, who always understood her.</p><p>\u201cHey, um . . .\u201d she called to Tyler. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a pee break.\u201d</p><p>Thoughts whirling, she headed down the apartment\u2019s lone hallway to the bedroom, which was pure masculine\u2014heavy woods, comforter striped with three shades of brown and a touch of black. Guns everywhere, along with a dizzying array of electronic devices.</p> <p>Kata found her suitcase in the corner and dug into it. There was her cell phone charger. The damn phone had died early this afternoon, and she\u2019d been unable to fish it out under both Luc and Tyler\u2019s watchful gazes.</p><p>\u201cWant me to pause the movie?\u201d he called back.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve seen it, so I won\u2019t be lost if I miss a bit. You go ahead.\u201d</p><p>With Tyler occupied, maybe she could sneak in a quick, whispered call. Yeah, Hunter had told her that her phone was traceable, but it seemed far-fetched for most anyone outside of a government agency to have access to that kind of technology.</p><p>As soon as she plugged the phone in, she silenced the device. Text messages and voice mails started pouring in. Mari, Chloe, Hallie, Ben. She knew what they had to say before reviewing the messages. Sure enough, Mari wanted to know if she was all right after the shooting and if she\u2019d gone insane, marrying a man she\u2019d only just met. She\u2019d insisted that Kata call immediately and bring Hunter around for dinner on Sunday. Clearly, Chloe and Hallie hadn\u2019t yet heard about the shooting because they only wanted the deets on how hot he was in bed. Ben . . . was hurt and confused and angry. And she didn\u2019t blame him. He\u2019d tried to give her the birthday present of her fantasies, and from his point of view, she\u2019d stabbed him in the back. Definitely, she owed him a return call . . . and some sort of explanation.</p><p>Another voice mail popped up from an unfamiliar local number. Kata listened to this latest message. When she first heard the woman\u2019s wheezy, scratchy voice, Kata frowned in confusion\u2014until the caller identified herself as Mam\u00e1.</p><p>\u201cMija, I heard that someone shot at you.\u201d Concern laced her voice. \u201cPlease let me know that you are all right. Gordon is on a trip and took our phone, so I am calling from my neighbor\u2019s.\u201d She coughed, a long string of hacks resounding from deep in her chest that made Kata wince. \u201cSorry. Gordon says I suffer from allergies, and he is probably right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s allergies, I\u2019m Bigfoot,\u201d Kata whispered, worry toxic in her veins. Her mother\u2019s chest rattled with every breath.</p><p>\u201cHe left me some ibuprofen and decongestant, so I will be fine soon.\u201d Mam\u00e1 paused to cough for another long spell. When she resumed speaking, her voice sounded even weaker. \u201cCome by as soon as you can, Mija. I love you.\u201d</p><p>As her mother hung up, she began coughing again. Panic raced through Kata. Her mother had bronchitis\u2014or worse. Damn Gordon for being too blind or self-centered to care that Mam\u00e1 might truly be ill. He\u2019d left her with no car, no phone, and probably no money. In his mind, if she went nowhere, spoke with no one, and did nothing, why would she need it? The bastard knew well that Mam\u00e1\u2019s dependence on him made her weak, and nothing gave him a hard-on faster than bending someone to his mercy.</p><p>She clutched her phone and tried to decide what to do. Mam\u00e1 had no way to call a doctor, and she wouldn\u2019t have lingered at the neighbor\u2019s. It would only piss off Gordon if she made a \u201cscene.\u201d Mam\u00e1 should call Mari, but since her older sister was now a mother herself, Mam\u00e1 didn\u2019t want to make Mari\u2019s life any busier.</p><p>For now, the only way to truly assess how sick her mother might be was for Kata to see her herself.</p><p>Kata dropped the phone and reached for the bedroom door. She didn\u2019t know much about Tyler, but he\u2019d been reasonable so far, friendly. Surely, if she explained the situation, he would help her. That seemed logical . . .</p><p>Except that Tyler had already refused to take her anyplace she usually visited, like her apartment. His point that the bad guys could have all her usual haunts staked out was well taken. And Tyler\u2019s first allegiance wasn\u2019t to her but to Hunter.</p><p>Gripping the knob, Kata froze. What if Tyler didn\u2019t agree to help her? He wouldn\u2019t simply let her go. And all his banter aside, he was very capable of keeping her both safe and sequestered. She had no doubt that if he refused to take her to Mam\u00e1, she\u2019d never be able to escape his watchful eye.</p><p>Mam\u00e1 had no one else to help her. Mari was reluctant to help Mam\u00e1, since she didn\u2019t want to \u201chelp herself\u201d by leaving Gordon. Besides, on Mondays, her sister would be doing some pro bono work in Baton Rouge with several of her colleagues. Her sister\u2019s husband was home with the boys, up to his eyeballs in homework and soccer practice. If she sent Tyler alone, her mother would refuse to answer the door for fear of Gordon\u2019s reprisals. Mam\u00e1 needed her.</p><p>Kata bit her lip. Yes, she knew running off was dangerous; she wasn\u2019t too stupid to understand that. But Mam\u00e1 had a history of respiratory problems, and Kata had successfully nursed her back to health every time.</p><p>\u201cYou okay in there?\u201d Tyler called through the door.</p><p>She started. How had he made it all the way up the hall without her hearing the footsteps? Tyler might seem like a nice guy, and he definitely flirted, but under all that charm, Kata suspected that he\u2019d be lethal.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she called before he got suspicious. \u201cI\u2019m . . . looking for something more comfortable to wear. Mind if I take a quick shower?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cNo problem, but, um . . . don\u2019t be long. I paused the movie so we could watch the end together.\u201d</p><p>Think, think. How was she going to get out of here?</p><p>\u201cYou mean you do care about Bella and Edward?\u201d she teased to throw off suspicion\u2014and because he deserved it.</p><p>\u201cFine. It\u2019s not total trash. That\u2019s the most you\u2019re getting out of me. Ten minutes, Kata.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. No problem.\u201d</p><p>How the hell was she going to escape him in ten minutes?</p><p>An idea hit her. She dashed into the bathroom and turned on the shower to mask the sounds to come. Then, hoping this didn\u2019t put her on the grid and in danger, she sent out a quick text to the one person she trusted implicitly and hoped would never refuse her.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>SINCE sneaking out of Tyler\u2019s apartment, Kata had experienced the worst twenty-four hours of her life. She paced her mother\u2019s hospital room as dusk turned to dark, raking a hand through her heavy hair. She needed a shower and a meal\u2014and some way to stop herself from strangling Gordon.</p><p>\u201cControl yourself, Katalina,\u201d her stepfather snapped. \u201cYou look like an elephant stomping from one side of the room to the other. You have your mother\u2019s grace, which is absolutely none, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d she whirled on him, fists clenched, menace boiling inside her. \u201cHow could you fucking leave her alone with no way to help herself when you knew she was sick? She could have died!\u201d</p><p>From her chair in the corner, Marisol gave an imperceptible shake of her head. Kata knew what her sister was saying. This would only make Gordon more angry and defensive, something he\u2019d take out on Mam\u00e1. Mari was definitely of the don\u2019t-get-mad-get-even school of thought. But Kata couldn\u2019t keep pressing her anger down. She wanted this asshole to pay.</p><p>Gordon rolled his pale eyes in his pale face. \u201cYou\u2019re being dramatic. Of course the doctor will say she\u2019s at death\u2019s door. He makes more money that way. But this cold isn\u2019t as serious as you imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold? It\u2019s full-blown pneumonia. If we\u2019d waited much longer, Mam\u00e1\u2019s situation could have been life-threatening. Doctors don\u2019t make this shit up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatalina, no man wants a woman who yells and curses at him, questions his sanity, or corrects him. Coupled with your weight, it\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re still single.\u201d</p><p>She was mad enough to chew nails\u2014and spit them in his face. Then tell him that she was no longer single. But now wasn\u2019t the time to start more family drama. She needed to focus on Mam\u00e1.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Mari rose between them on long legs to her lean, elegant height. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly eight. The cafeteria will stop serving dinner soon. Did you eat, Gordon?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and glanced at her mother. \u201cI\u2019m going home. I\u2019ll eat there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter visiting for ten minutes?\u201d Kata\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cCSI is on. Carlotta knows I never miss it.\u201d</p><p>Even when his wife lay sick in the hospital? She supposed if he could work late tonight to prep for a meeting that wasn\u2019t until next week, he could leave early to watch some stupid-ass TV show. That was so like Gordon. Self-centered to the core.</p><p>Kata swallowed back her fury. \u201cFine. There\u2019s the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like your attitude, Katalina.\u201d He gathered up his suit coat and jangled his car keys in his pocket.</p><p>Yeah? She didn\u2019t like him, period. But what good would telling him again do? He already knew exactly how she felt.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>He harrumphed, then marched for the door like he was the freaking king of England. Loser. The only thing exalted about Gordon was his opinion of himself.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Mari.\u201d He speared Kata with a narrow-eyed glare, then left.</p><p>If he thought for one minute that she cared about his snub, he couldn\u2019t be more mistaken.</p><p>\u201cGod, I hate him,\u201d Kata said to her sister once he was down the hall and out of sight.</p><p>\u201cNo more than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you never say anything to him!\u201d</p><p>Mari\u2019s raised brows and somber gaze showed thin patience. \u201cNo point in making things worse for Mam\u00e1.\u201d</p><p>Kata knew that her temper often got the best of her where Gordon was concerned. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Her older sister shrugged. \u201cYou do it to defend Mam\u00e1. She knows you love her. I do, too, but I won\u2019t get involved again until she decides to leave him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yeah, Mari had made that crystal clear. \u201cWhy won\u2019t she divorce him? I know she\u2019s unhappy and thinks she has no other options, but damn, she\u2019s still young and bright and kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd thoroughly stripped of her self-esteem. He\u2019s left her dependent on him financially and emotionally. Until she figures out her options, we\u2019re just making a bad situation worse.\u201d</p><p>Kata gnawed on her lip. \u201cYou\u2019re always so logical, and I know you\u2019re right, but . . . it just breaks my heart. I wish I could do something.\u201d</p><p>Mari hummed noncommittally, then reached into her briefcase to extract some papers. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you, as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>Spearing her with that older sister look, Mari nodded. \u201cWhen you disappeared after the shooting, I called Ben. To say I was shocked that you\u2019d married Hunter was an understatement. I didn\u2019t tell Mam\u00e1, but . . .\u201d She sighed in exasperation. \u201cWhat were you thinking? You know almost nothing about him, and what Ben has told me\u2014that Hunter is dominant and controlling\u2014doesn\u2019t give me a good feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dominant sexually.\u201d Kata winced at the blush crawling up her face but forged on. \u201cHe\u2019s not an asshole like Gordon,\u201d she defended.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Mari, ever the level-headed attorney, got right to the heart of all of Kata\u2019s concerns.</p><p>How could she convince her sister that it might walk and quack like a duck\u2014but this time, it really wasn\u2019t a duck? She wasn\u2019t completely convinced herself. Hunter wasn\u2019t mean-spirited like Gordon\u2014but he possessed a ruthless streak. She had no idea what sort of husband that would make him.</p> <p>Mari went on with her cross-examination. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I find you after that shooting? I had no idea where you\u2019d gone until you stopped to call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s partially my fault. There wasn\u2019t a lot of time, but I also didn\u2019t want you to fuss over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound convinced. \u201cWould Hunter have let you tell us where he\u2019d taken you?\u201d</p><p>Kata winced. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you\u2019re assigning yourself the blame?\u201d her sister asked incredulously. \u201cWho does that sound like?\u201d</p><p>Mam\u00e1, but . . . \u201cAfter the shooting, Hunter didn\u2019t want anyone knowing where I was, for safety\u2019s sake. Since I was fine and you knew it, I didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal.\u201d</p> <p>Mari raised a dark brow, looking decidedly skeptical.</p><p>\u201cLook, I admit Hunter can be overbearing, but he\u2019s not all bad. He makes me feel really special. Sometimes ... he says just the right thing.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAnd I melt all over.\u201d</p><p>One thing Kata knew for sure, if she\u2019d suffered her mother\u2019s illness, Hunter would never leave her hospital room to watch CSI. He\u2019d probably never leave her side, period.</p><p>Mari slanted a hard glance at Kata. \u201cIf you\u2019ll remember, we liked Gordon once, too.\u201d</p><p>That knocked Kata back in her chair. Mari was right. Years and years ago when her mother and Gordon had been dating, he\u2019d been a peach. Once, he\u2019d taken her, Mari, and Joaquin to an amusement park, then for ice cream later that night. He\u2019d always brought candies and toys when picking up Mam\u00e1. He\u2019d done magic tricks and sang karaoke, played Super Mario Brothers . . . And after Gordon and her mother had married, he\u2019d slowly morphed into the asshole they all knew and hated.</p><p>\u201cKata, think about it. You don\u2019t know anything about this guy except that he\u2019s a Navy SEAL and good in bed.\u201d</p><p>Great in bed, but Kata understood her sister\u2019s point. She so wanted to believe that Mari was wrong that it was like a physical ache. But the warning dredged up all her own uncertainties and magnified them. Mari could be dead-on. Kata really didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just . . . really protective,\u201d she said, oddly determined to make her sister understand that Hunter had good qualities.</p> <p>\u201cHe claims that he\u2019s protecting you, but don\u2019t you think that cutting off communication from all your loved ones and making you take a leave from your job is awfully extreme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA professional assassin was after me.\u201d Kata defended Hunter\u2014even as Mari\u2019s words sank in. Hadn\u2019t Kata told him just yesterday that the marriage had been a rash mistake? So why was she trying to sway her sister?</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that isn\u2019t what he told you so he could lock you away for himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter wouldn\u2019t lie about that. Besides, the shooter pushed his gun to the base of my skull.\u201d Kata shivered just thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that you weren\u2019t in danger. But how do you know it wasn\u2019t one of Villarreal\u2019s street punks or someone else you pissed off along the way, rather than an assassin? How does Hunter know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gunman told me that he\u2019d been hired to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Mari pressed her lips together. \u201cWould a professional assassin bother to announce that? I\u2019m concerned about your safety; don\u2019t get me wrong. I panicked when I heard you\u2019d nearly been shot. But Hunter\u2019s behavior concerns me, too. I could be way off base here . . .\u201d Her voice said she didn\u2019t think so for a minute. \u201cBut you should think seriously of getting out of this marriage before he smothers you.\u201d</p><p>Her sister\u2019s words made Kata go numb from the gravity of the situation. Her own confusion weighed her down even more.</p><p>Mari finally held the sheaf of papers out to her. \u201cI took the liberty of drawing these up earlier today.\u201d</p><p>Kata took the papers with cold fingers and opened them. Petition for Divorce. Even though she\u2019d talked to Hunter about ending it, seeing this document . . . Her knees buckled.</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is sign them and get Hunter to do the same; then it\u2019ll be over. If he really cares about you, he can always call you, date you like a normal guy, make the effort to get to know you. If he doesn\u2019t, if he fights this like I know Gordon would fight Mam\u00e1, then ...\u201d</p><p>Then she\u2019d know. Thing was, she couldn\u2019t picture Hunter just dating her. The way he\u2019d immersed himself in her, tied them together almost immediately . . . he wouldn\u2019t have bothered if he\u2019d merely wanted to date. Besides, Kata had mentioned ending the marriage earlier, and Hunter had flatly refused. But Mari had a point, though Kata wished her sister didn\u2019t. In fact, everything inside her resisted it. Then she looked at Mam\u00e1, pale and drained, lying frail in the hospital bed. A woman so unlike the vivacious mother she\u2019d grown up with.</p><p>If she stayed with Hunter . . . could this be her in twenty years?</p><p>Kata clutched her middle, anger and confusion ripping her apart. She\u2019d known Hunter for three days, and they\u2019d been apart half that time. The thought of leaving him shouldn\u2019t hurt so badly. But she already missed him now.</p><p>As she bit her lip, tears welled. She fought them, but the last few days and her mother\u2019s ill health stacked on top of her until she struggled under the weight.</p><p>Mari crossed the distance between them and hugged her. \u201cYou like him?\u201d</p><p>How did she answer that? What she felt went way beyond like. \u201cI hate the way he argues, especially when he\u2019s right. Then . . . two minutes later he\u2019s everything I could have ever wanted and more, and . . .\u201d She sobbed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to go back to life without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in love with him?\u201d Mari sounded incredulous at the possibility.</p><p>For her sake, Kata wanted to say no. But she couldn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2014I . . .\u201d She blew out a deep breath. Part of her had been relieved when Hunter had been called away. Part of her had been terrified and bereft. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Mari looked shaken. \u201cIt\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><p>Given that Kata had never responded with such abandon to any other man? That everything inside her had begun dancing the samba when Hunter had said he loved her? \u201cMaybe. But he scares the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>Her sister didn\u2019t look at all pleased but somehow managed to smooth out her expression to something neutral. \u201cI haven\u2019t met him, so I should reserve judgment. But those papers give you power. Sign them, hermana. If there\u2019s really something between you two, do this the right way, not by skulking off to a ratty chapel in Vegas for a drunken wedding. Get to know each other, meet your respective friends and family, then, when you\u2019re ready, stand up in front of us all and profess your love.\u201d</p><p>What Mari said made a hell of a lot of sense . . . in her sister\u2019s ultra-logical world. Kata wasn\u2019t wired like that; she didn\u2019t make decisions with her head. And every emotion she had now was one huge jumble.</p><p>Kata gnawed on her lip again. She either needed to throw herself into this hypersonic relationship or end it now, before a decade passed and she was older or too dependent or\u2014God forbid\u2014had to drag kids through a divorce.</p><p>Kata put the papers in her purse. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>Mari pursed her full, red mouth like she wanted to argue but merely nodded.</p><p>A moment later, Ben returned, juggling two cups of steaming coffee, and rubbernecked the room. \u201cGordon\u2019s gone? That was a quick visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMercifully, yes,\u201d Kata murmured.</p><p>\u201cCall me later.\u201d Mari gathered her purse. \u201cIf I leave Carlos alone too long with the boys, Javi and Robby are likely to tie him up and burn the house down.\u201d</p><p>Mari\u2019s husband loved the boys, and sometimes discipline was shoved aside in favor of fun.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she urged. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if there\u2019s any change with Mam\u00e1.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to rest, too.\u201d Mari put on her older sister face. \u201cThink about what I said.\u201d</p><p>Kata nodded as Mari exited, her charcoal gray skirt swishing with each efficient step. Exhaustion set in. A million thoughts skimmed the top of Kata\u2019s head, but she was too tired to actually grasp one. She needed a meal and sleep\u2014and to decide what to do about Hunter.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d Ben handed her a cup of coffee, then caressed her shoulder with a warm hand. \u201cYou want to talk about anything?\u201d</p><p>The last person Kata wanted to discuss Hunter with was Ben. Her former friend-with-benefits wasn\u2019t furious that her husband had stolen her\u2014but he wasn\u2019t thrilled, either.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut something is on your mind. I can see it on your face. Did Gordon say something that upset you? He\u2019s such a prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what Gordon says to me, but the way he treats Mam\u00e1 is unforgiveable. If it\u2019s the last damn thing I do, I will convince her to leave his sorry ass.\u201d</p><p>Ben guided her over to the chair beside her mother\u2019s bed, where tubes stuck out from everywhere and monitors beeped. As soon as her butt hit the ugly mint green vinyl, she focused on her mom.</p><p>She drank some of the coffee he\u2019d given her with a sigh. \u201cThanks\u2014for everything. Smuggling me away from Tyler\u2019s place and watching my back, helping my mother get to the hospital, for not leaving my side since we got here.\u201d</p><p>Setting aside his coffee, Ben shook his head and knelt in front of her. \u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for. That\u201d\u2014he worked his hand up her thigh\u2014\u201cand other things. Kata, come home with me. You need a shower and sleep and someone to comfort you. I miss you. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with you and Hunter. And I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Once upon a time, she would have whispered an easy \u201cyes.\u201d Ben was so familiar and easy to be with. Strong arms; a laugh or two; pleasurable, if predictable, sex. A guaranteed orgasm.</p><p>But she wanted nothing to do with his offer now. Kata knew her indefinable feelings for Hunter were to blame. It made no sense. How could she feel this aching attachment to Hunter when he terrified her emotionally?</p><p>\u201cBen\u2014\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, a man with dark sunglasses swaggered into the room, exuding menace like an expensive cologne. Inky hair, head-to-toe black, and a mean SOB scowl all screamed, \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me.\u201d</p><p>Was he one of Villarreal\u2019s men? Kata snatched up her phone to dial 911.</p><p>\u201cPut it down,\u201d he growled, his hard stare moving to Ben, who cupped her thigh. \u201cHunter will care very much that you\u2019re propositioning his wife. Get your hand off her. Now.\u201d</p><p>Ben scowled but didn\u2019t move. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone more than happy to fuck up your face. Leave, or one of my buddies will set your truck on fire in the next two minutes if you\u2019re not driving it off the lot.\u201d</p><p>Sputtering, Ben jumped to his feet and glared at the stranger, a terrier taking on a pit bull. \u201cY-you can\u2019t . . . Don\u2019t touch my truck!\u201d</p><p>The ominous stranger looked at his watch. \u201cA minute forty-five. You\u2019re wasting time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not going to hurt Kata?\u201d Ben challenged, shoving her behind him.</p><p>Kata loved that Ben was willing to defend her, especially at the risk of losing his beloved truck. But he was going to get his ass kicked . . . or worse. She started dialing the phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPut it down,\u201d the stranger demanded of her, then said softly. \u201cI\u2019m one of Hunter\u2019s friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Me, too.\u201d Ben crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>The stranger took a menacing step closer. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t feel too friendly toward you, since you\u2019re trying to get in his wife\u2019s panties.\u201d</p><p>Kata stood and faced the guy. \u201cI don\u2019t know who the hell you are or why you\u2019ve come, but you don\u2019t get to strut in here and threaten my friends.\u201d</p> <p>A dirty smile lifted his lips. \u201cActually, I do. Your husband sent me. I\u2019m Jack Cole.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY minutes later, Kata still stared at Jack as he lounged against the sterile hospital room\u2019s wall and sent her an unnerving glance. Ben had left for the moment, ostensibly to call in sick to his bartending job, but she didn\u2019t doubt for a second that he\u2019d also gone to move his truck.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hover,\u201d she told Jack.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOccupational hazard.\u201d</p><p>Everything about Jack Cole unsettled her. His every loosehipped move was calculated and full of controlled power. Danger rolled off him. Jack was one bad son of a bitch she wouldn\u2019t want to meet in a dark alley. And she had no trouble believing that he could totally, utterly dominate a woman. He and Hunter had too much in common.</p> <p>Instead of pointing out that she hadn\u2019t asked Jack to do this job\u2014a waste of breath\u2014she grumbled, \u201cWhere is Tyler?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d rather have him as a babysitter than the menacing Cajun.</p><p>As if Jack had read her mind, he smiled smugly. \u201cChecking with the security detail in the hall. He hasn\u2019t had a chance to confer with them much since he put them in place nearly twenty-four hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Kata nearly choked. \u201cTyler\u2019s been here all that time? But I sneaked out of his apartment. How did he . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow? Cher, when you left his place, he wasn\u2019t three minutes behind you,\u201d Jack drawled, looking amused. \u201cHe didn\u2019t drag you back to his apartment because he realized why you\u2019d gone and that your mom needed help.\u201d</p><p>Relief and gratitude poured like a warm shower through Kata as she looked at her mother, still heavily medicated and asleep. Mam\u00e1\u2019s color appeared rosier today, but her lingering, hacking cough hadn\u2019t improved. The doctor hoped her mother would be well enough to go home tomorrow. But even if she was, who would care for her? Certainly not Gordon.</p> <p>\u201cSo . . . Tyler watched me from afar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He blended into your surroundings. He knew that if he showed his face and played the heavy, you were likely to run again, which wasn\u2019t optimal for you or your mother. The hospital environment is chaotic, but along with some of the local off-duty officers who are buddies of ours, he put together a detail to keep you safe until I could take over.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Tyler had done all that seamlessly, invisibly. Kata had been on edge since arriving at the hospital, worrying not only about her mother, but fearful that somehow the threat would find her. But Tyler had managed to keep her safe with quiet efficiency. Behind all the charm and bluster, he was a badass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving my mother,\u201d she vowed, raising her chin.</p><p>Jack smiled, and it wasn\u2019t pretty. \u201cHunter loves a challenge. I can see why you fascinate him.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut it\u2019s not my job to give you the spanking I think he\u2019ll be itching to give you when he returns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA spanking? For taking care of my mother?\u201d She advanced on him with narrowed eyes. It was probably stupid to provoke someone so much bigger than her, but she was exhausted\u2014and he\u2019d just crawled on her last nerve. \u201cI\u2019m being a responsible adult, not a bratty child. I don\u2019t need some man to put me back in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo responsible adults sneak out a second-story window and away from their security detail, putting themselves in danger?\u201d</p><p>Kata winced at his question. Okay, so she\u2019d done that. Still . . . \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if Tyler would let me go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t ask. You didn\u2019t advise him of the situation.\u201d Jack edged closer, his tone dropping to dark steel. \u201cYou\u2019re not a bratty child, Kata. Hunter will want to spank you because you didn\u2019t give his protection a chance. A Dom\u2019s job is to know what you need and to provide it. To protect you. He\u2019s trying to do all that from halfway around the globe and went to a hell of a lot of trouble to see you safe. Instead of trusting him, you cut his protection loose and acted rashly. What good would you have been to your mother if the assassin had been waiting for you at her house and put a bullet between your eyes on her front lawn?\u201d</p><p>Horror assailed Kata. She\u2019d imagined that she\u2019d be safe enough if she moved quickly, then spent all her time in a public place like the hospital. Yeah, she got Jack\u2019s point that she\u2019d been reckless, but something in her rebelled at the idea of punishment. \u201cCan\u2019t he just talk to me? Tell me his concerns? Spanking is so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple and effective. People respond to the unpleasant and generally avoid behaviors that lead to it. Not that he\u2019ll hurt you in the traditional sense, but he\u2019ll make sure you feel remorse. I\u2019m pretty sure the orgasm he\u2019ll withhold will be its own kind of pain.\u201d</p><p>Kata wanted to deny that she\u2019d find any such spanking arousing enough to be on the edge of climax, but she knew better. Just like she knew that he could hold back her orgasm for hours and hours, if he chose.</p><p>She braced her hands on her hips. \u201cYou don\u2019t think spanking is condescending?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I offending your feminist sensibilities with the truth?\u201d Jack raised a dark brow. \u201cLook, we know you\u2019re women, not children. But the spanking isn\u2019t all for you, cher. When a Dom feels his woman has endangered herself, sometimes he needs to reassure himself with your skin under his hand and your cries in his ears. We\u2019re only a few thousand years from cavemen. In evolutionary terms, the blink of an eye. Now, from my perspective, you can remain at the hospital as long as we can keep you safe. Just don\u2019t imagine that Hunter will be as calm when he comes back.\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to ask who the hell he thought he was to give her \u201cpermission\u201d to stay with her mother. But he was Hunter\u2019s stand-in, the assigned watchdog who had no compunction about doing whatever necessary to keep her safe. That he wasn\u2019t shuttling her back to a secure facility was probably cause for celebration. When Hunter returned, she\u2019d have to pay the piper\u2014and damn if the idea of an erotic spanking didn\u2019t make her wetter than it should.</p><p>Or should she just give him the divorce papers and end this before she got in deeper?</p><p>Kata chewed on her lip and retreated to the corner to sort through her tangled thoughts.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, the baby is gorgeous, Jack!\u201d a petite redhead gushed as she hustled into the hospital room, her blue eyes lit with excitement as she placed a soft kiss on his intimidating face. \u201cWait until you see him!\u201d</p><p>This must be Morgan Cole.</p><p>With every step, a sparkling gold and ruby choker bobbed at the hollow of the woman\u2019s throat and her slim hips swayed with a well-sated sensuality. A huge diamond winked on her left hand. Jack had both married and collared her?</p><p>The woman\u2019s lips looked swollen, as if she\u2019d been thoroughly kissed recently. And she looked sublimely happy. As he put his arms around her, Jack\u2019s expression was nothing short of smitten.</p><p>An inexplicable bolt of envy pierced her. Not that Kata wanted Jack, but she yearned for the affection Morgan had, wanted to be steeped in that sort of tenderness and sexuality with someone who meant everything to her. Kata had never been aware of such a need. Hell, until recently, she would have denied it with her dying breath, especially after having Mam\u00e1 and Gordon as her role models. But now the craving for a relationship like Jack and Morgan\u2019s blindsided her. The kind Hunter had described. His face swam in her mind.</p><p>\u201cTell me all about Deke and Kimber\u2019s baby, mon coeur.\u201d Jack smiled at his wife.</p><p>He worshipped Morgan with just a gaze and a few words, bowling Kata over again. Did being a man\u2019s submissive make the relationship deeper\u2014or just more dangerous? Morgan looked like a vibrant woman, full to the brim with happiness. But Kata didn\u2019t know how to reconcile that vision with the reality she\u2019d seen her stepfather dish out for all these years. How could the woman be anything but miserable under her domineering husband\u2019s thumb?</p><p>\u201cTen little fingers and ten little toes. He\u2019s so pink and chubby and perfect.\u201d Morgan sighed. \u201cThe maternity ward isn\u2019t very busy, so they brought the baby in, and I got to hold him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you want one?\u201d Jack\u2019s smile was nothing short of indulgent. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling you since our wedding night that I would love babies with you.\u201d</p><p>Morgan glowed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve appreciated your patience.\u201d</p><p>The big man returned her grin but didn\u2019t say another word. No pushing. No pressure. Just sparkling dark eyes that matched her excitement. Looking at Jack and Morgan, Kata wasn\u2019t sure exactly what to make of their exchange. Who had the power here?</p><p>\u201cCan we . . . ?\u201d Morgan asked with hope in her blue eyes.</p><p>Jack\u2019s smile only deepened. A warmth she would have never imagined him capable of suffused his face. \u201cWhatever you want. You know that. Of course, I\u2019d be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely worth . . . discussion.\u201d Morgan kissed her husband, then shivered at his touch. \u201cBut first things first. Where is . . .\u201d Morgan whirled until their stares locked. The little redhead started, a hand to her chest. \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t see you in the corner. Kata, right? And, oh God, I just talked about having a baby.\u201d She blushed, then punched her husband. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me we weren\u2019t alone?\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed, wrapping an arm around his wife\u2019s shoulder with a wink. \u201cIf Kata has been married to Hunter for more than ten minutes, I\u2019m sure she knows where babies come from.\u201d</p><p>Morgan did a poor job of repressing a smile. \u201cYes, and no doubt, Hunter will want, um . . . lots and lots of practice when he returns.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what Kata feared\u2014and yearned for so desperately. Memories of their night in Logan\u2019s condo kept swirling in her head. Hunter had controlled her body so completely that it still stunned her. The thought of giving that much of herself again both thrilled and terrified her. He would return in the next twenty-four hours, and those papers were burning a hole in her purse.</p><p>She\u2019d come to a fork in the road. Take a chance that her relationship would be more like Jack and Morgan\u2019s? Or was that a fairy tale? Were she and Hunter destined to be more like Gordon and Mam\u00e1?</p><p>SIX a.m. Hunter shoved his phone in his pocket with a curse and headed inside the hospital. He didn\u2019t like any of this one bit.</p><p>The past forty-two hours had been a total waste. Hunter had encountered no arms-for-drugs deal going down by V\u00edctor Sotillo\u2019s old gang. From everything he could tell, the thug\u2019s organization was barely limping along. They\u2019d slowed their pace on funneling money to the corrupt local and national governments who, in turn, did business with Iran to fund terrorists and nuclear weapons. Hunter had no idea who was leading the Sotillo gang now. His local informant had assured him that Adan Sotillo, V\u00edctor\u2019s salsa-dancing brother, was dead, though he had no details or proof. Provided Hunter\u2019s local snitch wasn\u2019t wrong or lying, if neither Sotillo brother was alive to turn an illegal profit, then who was running the show?</p><p>Even more perplexing was why he\u2019d been sent to Venezuela in the first place. The pending deal that had created this blazing fucking emergency? He\u2019d been unable to find even a hint of it. Usually, when he and the other members of SEAL Team 4 went anywhere near Sotillo\u2019s haunts, the meeting was fast, ugly, and brutal. This time, unnerving silence.</p><p>Was it possible that Adan\u2019s sudden death, so soon after V\u00edctor\u2019s, had forced the criminals to slow their plans? Or had someone tipped them off? Either way, the \u201cemergency\u201d that had called Hunter to Venezuela and interrupted his honeymoon hadn\u2019t materialized. And he was beyond pissed off.</p><p>As soon as he got ahold of Barnes, Hunter vowed to chew his commanding officer a new asshole. Respectfully, of course. He\u2019d probably be reprimanded anyway, since Andy liked exercising his newfound power. But he had a bigger problem now that he was back Stateside.</p><p>Hunter understood the need to drop everything and assist a sick loved one. He respected Kata for putting her mother\u2019s welfare above her own, since he did it every day as a soldier. But goddamn it, she wasn\u2019t trained for these situations. She\u2019d disobeyed every direct order he\u2019d given her and shed every safeguard he\u2019d put in place. She hadn\u2019t asked for help when she needed it.</p><p>He had no doubt she was going to balk at her punishment, though she damn well deserved it. And he needed to feel her around him, under him, taking him. He needed to connect with her in a way he\u2019d never needed anything or anyone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hunter wasn\u2019t one of those pussies afraid of commitment or his emotions, but he wasn\u2019t the only part of this equation. He\u2019d pushed Kata to her mental and physical limit before leaving on this mission. He was coming off three days of adrenaline rush and sleeplessness. His mood was bad, his temper worse. Normally, he wouldn\u2019t go near Kata until he was rested and calm. But since he had to leave again Sunday morning for what would likely be months, he couldn\u2019t waste time. He had to see\u2014and deal with\u2014her now.</p><p>Inside the hospital\u2019s too-white lobby, Hunter bypassed the sleepy receptionist and headed for the bank of elevators. He counted to ten ... twenty. Fuck, counting to a thousand wouldn\u2019t calm him down. If Tyler hadn\u2019t been on top of the situation, Kata could have fallen prey to an assassin\u2019s bullet; the heart Hunter still sought to earn could have stopped beating. The very thought turned his blood to ice.</p><p>With a muted ding, the elevator stopped on the third floor. Hunter jogged down the hall, spotting Tyler tucked in the shadows at the nurses\u2019 station, just as he\u2019d promised. Jack and Morgan had gone home for a bit of sleep. Deke had stepped in while visiting his wife, then left around midnight. None of them could convince Kata to leave the hospital and rest someplace safe.</p><p>Hunter\u2019s palm itched. He was going to spank her but good. After they settled her mother, they were going to spend hours and hours sleeping and making love and resolving their problems. He\u2019d do whatever necessary to make her damn well promise not to put herself at risk again. And he\u2019d earn her love by Sunday.</p> <p>Finally, room 304. Though less than a few dozen steps, the jog had seemed interminable. He rounded the corner and stepped into the hospital room.</p><p>And stopped cold.</p><p>In one of the room\u2019s two chairs, Kata sat, all curled up on Ben\u2019s lap, with her face in the crook of his neck and her arms around him, fast asleep. Ben had curled his arm over her thighs, his broad hand anchored near her hip. The other clung to her nape as he dozed. They looked cozy. Intimate.</p><p>The sight felt like a battering ram decimating his solar plexus.</p><p>Behind him, he heard familiar footsteps, and without looking knew they belonged to Tyler.</p> <p>\u201cHow long has he been here?\u201d Hunter swallowed, but nothing could keep the jagged fury from bubbling up inside him.</p><p>\u201cHe brought Kata and her mother here Monday night and has barely left since. Kata hasn\u2019t gone anywhere with him, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Tyler\u2019s unfinished sentence suggested that, given their snug, sleep-warm embrace, it was only a matter of time before Kata fell back into Ben\u2019s bed. And from where Hunter was standing, that looked like an accurate assessment.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>The bottom line was, Ben had been there for her when she needed him; Hunter hadn\u2019t.</p><p>What did you expect? An absent husband can\u2019t give me what I need. He can. His mother had screamed those words at his father fifteen years ago. No one in his family had seen or heard from Amanda again, divorce papers excepting, before she\u2019d died.</p> <p>Fisting his hands, Hunter stared at his wife curled up on another man\u2019s lap, a million thoughts racing through his head. He could turn around, leave, and never come back. But the Colonel had done exactly that when his wife had fallen for someone else, despite the fact that it cost him his heart. No fucking way was Hunter waving his white flag.</p><p>His dad had never quite healed after the bitter divorce, and Hunter knew if he let Kata go now, he\u2019d likely crawl down that same emotional path. Unlike the Colonel, Hunter wasn\u2019t going down without a fight.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to kill him, or should I?\u201d Tyler whispered.</p><p>Personally, Hunter had assumed the man would understand Ben\u2019s position, mired in an unrequited love for Luc\u2019s wife, Alyssa, for about a year. But Tyler wasn\u2019t his focus now.</p><p>\u201cNeither. I took Kata from Ben. Maybe he thinks this is tit for tat. I\u2019ll deal with him later. Since the doctor isn\u2019t releasing Kata\u2019s mom until later today, I\u2019m going to have a long . . . chat with my wife.\u201d</p><p>When he finished, she\u2019d understand exactly the lengths he\u2019d go in order to keep what was his.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>A HEAVY presence woke Kata from a deep, tangled sleep. Had the doctor returned? She opened her eyes to find herself on Ben\u2019s lap and frowned. How had she gotten there? Shaking her head, she stood on shaky legs, then turned\u2014and gasped.</p> <p>A forbidding shadow stood directly above her, face inscrutable in the predawn dark. Heart pounding, she gasped, adrenaline jolting her. Then recognition hit.</p><p>\u201cHunter!\u201d Her first urge was to throw her arms around him, but she suddenly saw his taut shoulders and cold, cold gaze shift down to Ben before lifting back to her with the sharpness of a lethal blade. Trepidation tightened her belly.</p><p>Kata glanced back at Ben, who shifted restlessly in the chair, then faced Hunter once more. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you . . . I\u2014I was just exhausted. I guess we fell asleep. I don\u2019t remember. But nothing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here.\u201d His voice sounded like the snap of a whip. \u201cThe doctor says your mother will be discharged this afternoon. Once she is, we\u2019ll get her home and settled. When was the last time you showered or ate a whole meal?\u201d</p><p>Kata swallowed a lump of dismay. She knew better than to think that he hadn\u2019t asked why she\u2019d been sitting on Ben\u2019s lap because he didn\u2019t care. Rage vibrated off of him. No, he was saving this ass chewing for later. Ben had originally agreed to share her with Hunter, but she didn\u2019t think for one second that Hunter would be at all willing to share with Ben.</p><p>Jack\u2019s warning about the spanking Hunter would undoubtedly give her dive-bombed her thoughts. Had she, in his mind, added to her list of infractions by falling asleep on Ben? Would Hunter strip her bare, force her to lie across his knees, and take every hot, commanding swat of his hand on her ass? What self-respecting, independent female would want that? Yeah, his few swats back at Logan\u2019s condo had been . . . nice, but to actually want him to truly spank her? No way. Not her.</p><p>Still, the thought made her heart stutter . . . and made her pussy dismayingly wet.</p><p>God, her whole relationship with Hunter was confusing, destructive. Kata had fallen asleep trying to decide if she should give him the divorce papers. She still didn\u2019t know what to do. All the ways he\u2019d touched her as if staking his claim, everything he\u2019d said about loving her . . . She wanted so badly for that to be true, even though it terrified her.</p><p>\u201cKata, your last meal and shower?\u201d</p><p>The way he barked questions rattled her. All his warmth, passion, and fire had been replaced with barely checked thunder. An odd shame crawled through her. She\u2019d displeased him, and for some reason that bothered her. A lot.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like it one bit.</p><p>\u201cHello to you, too.\u201d She thrust her hands on her hips. \u201cGlad to see you\u2019re still in one piece. Thanks for telling me all about your trip. Things have been rough here, since you didn\u2019t ask. But I\u2019m handling it.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his jaw and softened his voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry your mother\u2019s been ill. Tyler updated me on the situation earlier this morning. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s recovering. Now I\u2019m concerned about you. Answer the question, Kata. When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you\u2019re glowering at me doesn\u2019t exactly make me want to answer, but it\u2019s been two days.\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d seen thunder on his face before, it now held a storm of fury. \u201cGoddamn it\u2014\u201d</p><p>In the chair behind her, Ben groaned, stretched, and opened his eyes. He froze when he saw Hunter. \u201cOh. You\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>Ben didn\u2019t even try to sound happy about that fact.</p><p>Hunter gave him a single nod, then grabbed her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of my wife from here. I\u2019ll make sure she gets a damn meal.\u201d</p><p>Ben stood and edged right behind her and added fuel to the fire by wrapping his arm around her waist. \u201cFuck you! I begged her to eat. I\u2019ve been by her side for the last day and a half while you were off playing soldier. In fact, I\u2019ve been with her for the last two years. I\u2019ll stand by her, no matter what, and she knows it. It\u2019s up to Kata to choose who she wants to . . . help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp\u201d clearly being a euphemism for something much more meaningful. Kata gaped at Ben over her shoulder. They\u2019d been casual lovers. Was he seriously trying to stake some claim now?</p><p>\u201cBen?\u201d She sent him a questioning stare, tension gripping her insides.</p><p>His arm around her tightened. \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t realize how important you were to me until you weren\u2019t there anymore. But you are, and I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>Kata was there for him, too, but as nothing more than a friend. She didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d just naturally outgrown him or if Hunter had played a role, but she knew that whatever had once been between them was over.</p><p>\u201cBack off.\u201d Hunter pulled Kata out of Ben\u2019s grip, then held up her left hand. Her wedding ring glinted in the white hospital light filtering in through the hall. \u201cI take care of what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a bastard,\u201d Ben snarled.</p><p>The testosterone in the room was so thick, Kata thought she might choke. She stepped away from them both.</p><p>\u201cYou knew that when you invited me to Vegas.\u201d Hunter smiled coldly.</p><p>Ben clenched his fists and looked to her, his expression a plea for reassurance. Kata\u2019s stomach cramped with guilt. If she\u2019d led him on, it had been unintentional. No doubt, they should talk this through at some point.</p><p>She turned and gave him a friendly hug. \u201cThank you for everything. I wouldn\u2019t have made it through this difficult time without your help. I\u2019m fine now. Rest. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>Ben closed his eyes. Despite her gentle rejection, the sting of it tightened his face. Abruptly, he stepped away. \u201cYou\u2019re living in Fantasyland if you think this controlling prick will ever let you call me again.\u201d</p><p>He brushed her shoulder with his own as he exited the room.</p><p>Was Ben right? Would Hunter try to forbid her from even saying hi to someone she\u2019d considered a friend for two years? Kata wouldn\u2019t put up with that.</p><p>\u201cYour mother isn\u2019t set to be released until at least thirteen hundred, in seven hours. She\u2019s out of danger, and you haven\u2019t left her side in days. You need to rest and refuel. You and I need to talk. Tyler will watch her and call if anything arises.\u201d He tugged on her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Kata dug in her heels. \u201cI can\u2019t go anywhere until Mam\u00e1 does. She needs me to take care of her.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s cold eyes narrowed. \u201cShe\u2019s in a hospital filled with health-care professionals. You can\u2019t take care of anyone when you\u2019re falling down on your feet. If you\u2019re not going to take care of yourself, I\u2019ll do it for you. Don\u2019t think I won\u2019t carry you out.\u201d</p><p>She absolutely knew that he would. A part of her reveled. Another part railed. How could he expect her to leave when Mam\u00e1 needed her most?</p><p>\u201cIf this is your way of taking care of me, it feels more like bullying.\u201d</p><p>He crowded into her personal space, then glanced down at her breasts, his gaze a hot caress. \u201cBut you respond to it.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Kata became aware of her nipples, tight and hard, poking against her shirt. A few minutes in his presence did that to her. Her body felt heavy, her breathing shallow. Her panties? Best not to think about how wet those had become.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even begun to discover all the ways I\u2019m going to take care of you. Come with me now.\u201d Each word he spoke in low tones, his voice like smoke and steel, infused with that controlled demand she knew so well.</p><p>Kata knew she should just shut up . . . but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to simply give in. \u201cIf I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>His grip on her hand tightened, and he stepped even closer, his chest brushing hers. \u201cItching to add to all the punishment you\u2019ve got coming?\u201d</p><p>Kata\u2019s pulse leapt. Lightning flared through her nipples. Fresh moisture slicked her sex. She pressed her thighs together, but that only made the ache worse. Damn Hunter. His touch could too easily become an addiction. Already, she felt the slide into craving.</p><p>She looked up, and their gazes locked. The fury in his blue eyes was so cold, they were nearly gray. A glance farther down revealed an erection that made her body tighten with need all over again. But when Kata looked up again, she saw the exhaustion in the deep hollows of his eyes and compressed lips. Concern bled through defiance.</p><p>Kata curled her hand around his shoulder. \u201cWhen was the last time you slept and ate a whole meal?\u201d</p><p>He paused, seemingly disarmed by the question. Some of his starch softened, and he sighed tiredly. \u201cDays ago.\u201d</p><p>Which explained why he was particularly short now. Ben\u2019s presence at the hospital hadn\u2019t helped the cause.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Then let\u2019s go. We\u2019ll be back in time to get Mam\u00e1?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Kata, if you\u2019d let me, I\u2019ll always take care of you. That includes helping the family you love.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That right there. When he said things like that, how could she not melt in a puddle at his feet? How could she not care about him? God knows, Gordon had never given a rat\u2019s ass about anyone but himself. After this declaration, all the times she\u2019d compared the two seemed unfair.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Once we bring her home, I\u2019ll need to stay with her while she recovers\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hunter started shaking his head before she even finished her sentence. \u201cUntil we know who\u2019s after you and I figure out how to make you safe again, you can\u2019t stay there. It\u2019s too obvious. Whoever is after you will pick you off like a target in a shooting gallery. Do you want your family near that?\u201d</p><p>Kata didn\u2019t have misplaced bravado, nor did she want Mam\u00e1 in danger. Put that like, she shouldn\u2019t have come to the hospital with her mother at all.</p> <p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re right, but what about Mam\u00e1\u2019s recovery? Gordon won\u2019t take care of her. She\u2019s this sick because he didn\u2019t care enough about her to see to her welfare to start with, and my sister\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He pressed a finger to her lips, making her tingle from head to toe. \u201cI admire the fact that you want to take care of your mother, but there are other ways to accomplish it without putting yourself in danger. Trust me to make that happen.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s words came back to Kata. She hadn\u2019t trusted Hunter\u2019s watchdog, Tyler. Which Hunter would, in turn, interpret as a lack of trust in him. She\u2019d never looked at it that way, but Jack\u2019s explanation made that logic seem so obvious. Hunter might be dominating and stubborn, but he was also very capable and resourceful. She was exhausted after the past few days, and knowing that she could count on his help was both hard to swallow and pure relief.</p><p>\u201cDid you have anything in mind? Gordon won\u2019t allow another man in the house.\u201d So Hunter sending one of his buddies was out of the question.</p><p>\u201cDuly noted. Let me make a few phone calls. I won\u2019t do anything to make your mother\u2019s situation more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>She squeezed his biceps, absently noting that she couldn\u2019t even come close to wrapping her hand around it. He was solid through and through. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Kata hoped that Hunter would kiss her. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead, he stepped back, agitation still pouring off him. With a sigh, she walked into the shadows of the room hanging over the bed and pressed her lips to her mother\u2019s pale cheek, then followed Hunter outside just as the first fingers of dawn were spreading across the sky in hues of orange and gold.</p><p>Without a word, he helped her into a black Jeep she\u2019d never seen. He slid into the driver\u2019s seat, pulled out of the parking lot, then immediately reached for his phone. With two phone calls, he had a place for them to crash, courtesy of Jack, and a capable female to nurse her mother back to health, thanks to one of Kimber\u2019s fellow nursing friends who was in between jobs.</p><p>Gratitude burned through her, and she felt ashamed that she\u2019d leaned on Ben so much in Hunter\u2019s absence. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNurses aren\u2019t cheap. How much do I need to pay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d His tone warned her not to say another word on the subject.</p><p>She\u2019d offended his masculine dignity. Did he think she\u2019d suggested that he was incapable of doing it himself? Kata winced. Stubborn man ... even if the sentiment was sweet.</p><p>Silence prevailed for the rest of the ride. Traffic began to pick up, and he dodged it smoothly, gripping the steering wheel, his shoulders bunched with tension. He flexed his fingers, then wrapped them even tighter on the wheel. Kata peeked at his profile. Sharp, clenched.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a good sign.</p><p>Suddenly, Hunter pulled into a parking lot and stopped the Jeep. An office building. What were they doing here? Before she could ask, he threw open the vehicle\u2019s door and jumped out, slamming it behind him.</p><p>He marched around the Jeep, glaring at her through the windshield, then opened the passenger door, putting his body between hers and the street. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Kata had no illusions. Given Hunter\u2019s agitation, once they got behind closed doors, there would likely be a hard spanking and a thorough fucking in her immediate future. Ignoring her shiver of anticipation, she eased out of the vehicle. She had to talk to him now, before they got too busy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about running out on Tyler. And about being on Ben\u2019s lap.\u201d</p><p>With a fierce scowl, he stalked across the parking lot, dragging her and her suitcase behind him, heading for the building\u2019s gleaming black door. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to say this now.\u201d She followed him across the blacktop and lifted a hand to the steely solid width of his chest. \u201cBecause if I don\u2019t, you\u2019ll have time to stew and get more pissed off and mentally convict me of shit that never happened.\u201d</p><p>Hunter grabbed her wrist. His blue eyes, usually filled with laughter or passion, looked like an arctic deep freeze. She\u2019d never seen him close to the edge of his temper, but she imagined this was it. Discreetly, she tried to tug her wrist from his grasp. He held firm.</p><p>\u201cLater. After we\u2019re inside and this asshole trying to kill you can\u2019t do an easy drive-by.\u201d</p><p>He released her, dismissed her, and focused on the silver pad to the right of the door. After he punched in a code, she heard an audible click. Hunter wrenched the door open. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>Kata hesitated. The independent woman in her wanted to fight his command. The logical part of her knew that loitering outside the building wasn\u2019t smart. Somehow, the female in her hated disappointing him even more.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d The words slipped out as she entered the building.</p><p>He rewarded her with a caress to her back, and she ached to burrow closer to his touch.</p><p>The door shut behind them with a deafening thud before he turned the lock and engaged the security system.</p><p>Tinted glass, sleek chrome, and ambient lighting filled the lobby. A couple of leather chairs, an empty desk.</p><p>\u201cThis is Jack\u2019s official office. He only uses it for client meetings. It\u2019s secure and out of the way. Come with me.\u201d He grabbed her arm.</p><p>He led her to another door, swiped a key card in front of a plastic panel, then thrust her through the next open door\u2014and into an apartment of sorts. A small living room decked out with a leather love seat and a long, padded ottoman, a kitchenette with everything modern, a dining room less than half filled by a little bistro table and some giant cross affixed to the wall. Hunter flipped on a soft, golden overhead light, then shoved her straight into a bedroom both stark and lavish.</p><p>Cream-colored walls except the one that anchored the wide bed. That was painted a deep, passionate red. Gleaming marble floors, two pedestal nightstands, and a massive headboard that looked positively medieval decorated the space. There wasn\u2019t a single window in the shadowed room.</p><p>Hunter shut the door behind him, then turned sharply to face her. \u201cDid you know that Ben has feelings for you?\u201d</p><p>Well. Now that they were alone, he wasn\u2019t wasting any time.</p><p>\u201cN\u2014not until this morning. He\u2019s never indicated that I meant anything beyond\u2014\u201d</p><p>As Hunter tensed, Kata closed her mouth. Best not to remind him just now that she and Ben had shared a bed. Just a guess, but he probably wouldn\u2019t appreciate the recap.</p><p>\u201cA casual fuck?\u201d he finished for her, his jealousy roared through the room like an inferno.</p><p>Kata tried to play it cool with a shrug. \u201cHe never seemed to care that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Kata. He threw you a Vegas birthday party and went to a hell of a lot of trouble and expense to try to make your m\u00e9nage fantasy come true. You must have guessed. And when you got your mom\u2019s message, he was the first person you turned to, the one you trusted. What am I supposed to make of that? What are your feelings for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in love with him, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. And I didn\u2019t want to have sex with him, either. I just knew he\u2019d come if I needed help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, because he fucking cares. You care for him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a friend. And friends help friends, so yes, I knew he\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>Hunter raised a brow. \u201cDo friends also cuddle up against their friends\u2019 hard-ons?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d already said that she didn\u2019t want Ben. \u201cDamn it, stop twisting my words. You\u2019re pissing me off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pissed? I\u2019ve been prowling jungle shitholes nonstop for the last thirty-six hours, hunting terrorists more elusive than ghosts. We accomplished nothing but exhaustion and dehydration. One of the things that kept me going was knowing that I\u2019d see you again. I\u2019ve been harder than steel, dying to fuck you, since I got on the plane in Venezuela. I came back to find you on your lover\u2019s lap.\u201d</p><p>The way he growled, his eyes seething fury, all screamed that he was at the end of his rope. How pissed would she be if she came home from exhausting days away to find a woman on Hunter\u2019s lap? Enraged . . . and beyond hurt. Maybe they both needed to count to ten.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI tried to tell you earlier, I don\u2019t even remember falling asleep. And you knew from the start that Ben and I are hardly strangers. But, I swear, we\u2019re not lovers anymore. I\u2019ve been dodging his advances since Vegas. I don\u2019t want him anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did he try to get territorial about you with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Hunter pressed his lips into a grim line. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t solve my real problem: You trusted Ben before you trusted me.\u201d</p><p>Kata recoiled at the hurt in his voice. \u201cYou weren\u2019t here for me to trust. I know you had to leave, and I don\u2019t blame you, but my mother needed me. I barely knew Tyler. If he refused to let me help Mam\u00e1, I had no recourse, and I knew it. Why would I ask the guy locking me up on your behalf to let me go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler was there to protect you. If you needed help, you should have told him, not sneaked behind my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had, what? All of four days to reconcile myself to our marriage\u2014while being shot at, grappling with your dominant expectations, and as my mother has been at death\u2019s door. Excuse me if I don\u2019t adjust my thinking fast enough for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat pretty little mouth is going to get you in deeper trouble, honey. You should have trusted that I would see to your needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like you should be trusting that falling asleep on Ben\u2019s lap means absolutely nothing to me?\u201d</p><p>Hunter swiped a hard hand at the back of his neck and stared at the ceiling, clearly willing patience. Then he exhaled and stared at her with blue ice chip eyes. \u201cStrip.\u201d</p><p>Her heart stuttered. Here? Now?</p><p>\u201cAre you going to spank me?\u201d Kata remembered the way he\u2019d heated up her backside, then commanded her body to the ultimate pleasure at his brother\u2019s condo. The thought that he might do it again stirred up a confounding, alluring mixture of fear and anticipation.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. His glare silently repeated his demand, promising more punishment if she didn\u2019t comply.</p><p>She and Hunter had already played this game once, and she\u2019d wound up naked and at his mercy. Better to admit that she enjoyed being naked for him and save her strength for the battles yet to come.</p><p>With a bravado she didn\u2019t feel, she kicked off her shoes, dropped her purse, doffed her shirt, shucked out of her capri pants, unhooked her bra, then shimmied out of her panties. The instant she was bare, a terrible sense of vulnerability, of being naked down to her soul, crashed through Kata.</p><p>At the sight of her, Hunter\u2019s eyes flashed with heat. He fisted his hands at his sides but made no move to take her over his knee. Maybe there was no erotic spanking in her future. The possibility filled her with a disappointment that made absolutely no sense . . . but sat like a boulder in her belly.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>Hunter stared, remained silent, almost dissecting her with his gaze.</p><p>She sucked up her fear and thrust her hands on her hips. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to blame me for shit I didn\u2019t do and sulk, screw this. I\u2019m going back to my mom.\u201d She bent to pick up her clothes.</p><p>Hunter stepped on the garments and blocked the exit, his lean, tightly muscled body squarely in her path. \u201cYou aren\u2019t leaving.\u201d His face seethed with fury . . . and unmistakable lust. In that low, authoritative voice that made her shivery and hot, he ordered, \u201cOn your knees. Bow your head.\u201d</p><p>Kata\u2019s womb cramped at his command. She froze. Her instinct screamed at her to leave. Her logic told her that trying would only be stupid and futile. Might as well get this over with.</p><p>Hunter pressed his lips together in an angry line as he waited wordlessly in the lengthening silence. Slowly, she dropped to one knee, then the other, wincing when she fell too hard on the tile. But she wasn\u2019t going to show him any weakness. And damn it, she wasn\u2019t going to bow her head in repentance when she\u2019d done nothing wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked past the tempting erection about to burst Hunter\u2019s zipper and sent him a challenging stare. \u201cI said I was sorry. I admit I should have asked Tyler for help, but this is all the obedience you\u2019re getting from me. Deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Hunter moved so fast, Kata barely saw him. But she felt him, massive hands around her waist, lifting her. Suspended in his grasp, she flailed, only feeling solid surface under her belly when he drew her over his lap.</p><p>Something hot in Kata flared at the helplessness of her position. Clearly, he liked it, too. His erection, which had grown even larger, prodded her, taunted her, as she wriggled for freedom.</p><p>Above her, Hunter nestled a forearm against her nape and another across the back of her thighs, immobilizing her instantly. He leaned over to whisper hotly in her ear, \u201cHow far do you think that sass is going to get you?\u201d</p> <p>Though her pussy ached, her mouth still had a mind of its own. \u201cYou mean the truth? Nowhere, clearly. Because you\u2019re being churlish and overbearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being disrespectful and obstinate. And you know what I think? You\u2019re pushing me on purpose so that I\u2019ll either give up or get so angry that I\u2019ll force my dominance on you, and you won\u2019t have to submit. Neither will happen. Either use your safe word or take your punishment.\u201d</p><p>If she was smart, she\u2019d blurt out Ben\u2019s name and demand that Hunter let her go. But that would also leave the rapidly climbing ache inside her unfulfilled. \u201cAnd give you an easy way to blame this on me? Fuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019ll get there\u2014after all the punishment you\u2019ve got coming.\u201d</p><p>Kata\u2019s body pulsed at his words. She bucked under his touch, though she knew he\u2019d never let her loose. That added to her twisted excitement. Was she some closet deviant?</p> <p>\u201cI want to be clear,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you refusing to use your safe word?\u201d</p><p>She tensed. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed his hold enough for her to look over her shoulder at his dark, dirty smile. \u201cYou know I will. Just like I know you\u2019ll soon beg me to fuck you, and you\u2019ll come like never before. Since you\u2019re refusing to use your safe word, we\u2019ll start with ten swats, Kata. Count them.\u201d</p><p>Before she could prolong the argument, he raised one hand and brought it down across her ass, smacking her hard. She shrieked as a hot sting exploded across the center of her left cheek, searing her skin. A conflagration quickly spread across her ass. Oh dear God! Within seconds, her sex liquefied. Tendrils of desire began curling through her, even as she struggled to process the pain.</p><p>\u201cCount,\u201d he insisted. \u201cOr I\u2019ll start over.\u201d</p><p>Kata\u2019s entire body trembled. \u201cOne.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. Why are you being punished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a\u2014a brute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong answer.\u201d Then he struck the fleshy part of her ass again, this time low on her right cheek, in the crease of her thigh, where she\u2019d feel it every time she took a step.</p><p>Agonized pleasure whipped across her senses. A burning flush followed. Her blood turned thick like honey. Gasping for air, she braced herself with flat palms on the mattress, trying\u2014and failing\u2014to push away from him. Her breasts dangled, their nipples desperately tight. If Hunter saw them, he would know this spanking aroused her.</p><p>Hunter grabbed her wrists and forced them together at the small of her back, rendering her utterly helpless again. That made her even wetter, damn it.</p><p>\u201cKata?\u201d he held her wrists with one hand and spread his palm across her ass with the other, grinding the burn into her skin.</p><p>She gasped, pressing her thighs together for relief.</p><p>\u201cStop that. Or I\u2019ll keep adding,\u201d His low growl warned as he forced her legs apart. \u201cYou\u2019ve got five seconds. Count.\u201d</p> <p>More blood rushed to her pussy. She swelled, throbbed. Drawing in a shuddering breath, Kata wondered how the hell she was going to make it to ten without falling apart. \u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl. Why are you being punished?\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s hand hovered above her ass. Kata could feel its heat, craved the intimacy of his skin on hers. She\u2019d always appreciated a man with large hands, she thought because he\u2019d likely have sizeable equipment. Now she knew why the size of a man\u2019s hands could turn her on. As the ache between her legs coiled ruthlessly, she prayed Hunter would give her more.</p><p>\u201cBecause I ran from Tyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He smoothed his hot hand across her burning ass once more, priming her, before he spanked her again three more times in rapid succession, strategically striking her flesh in new places: low on her left cheek, high on the right, dead in the middle.</p><p>Desire ratcheted up. Now her entire backside felt tender, on fire. Moisture slid from her sex, coating her so that she felt every little quiver of her hips across Hunter\u2019s lap acutely. Her clit pulsed in time with her heartbeat. Her breath caught. \u201cThree, four, f-five.\u201d</p><p>Arousal made her voice breathy. Kata squirmed again, then realized she was dampening the fabric of his pants under her pussy. Frantically, she tried to wriggle away before he figured out how much this excited her.</p><p>Hunter pressed a palm between her shoulder blades, holding her in place, then slid that hand between her legs. God, no way he\u2019d fail to notice how wet the insides of her thighs were, how swollen her labia had become. Once he spanked her again, he\u2019d likely feel her moisture seeping back between her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cHmm. You going to try to tell me that you\u2019re not enjoying this spanking?\u201d</p><p>Enjoying it? Just knowing that she had five more swats coming forced her to bite back a moan. Kata closed her eyes as a shiver of both shame and excitement ran through her, but that didn\u2019t mean she was about to surrender. \u201cYou\u2019re entitled to your opinion . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cStubborn wench.\u201d Hunter\u2019s laugh wasn\u2019t pleasant as he slid a hand between her legs again, gliding one finger over her clit. Pleasure lit her up, a fireball sizzling right there. Kata clenched her fists, fingers desperate, nails digging into her palms. Her heart pounded, her blood blazed, her entire body felt electric.</p><p>Instinctively, she ground her hips down into his hand. He pulled back. \u201cStop. Why else am I punishing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I turned to Ben,\u201d she sobbed out.</p><p>He landed another two swats to her burning ass, both in the fleshy parts of each cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Amazingly, the pleasure expanded, and she felt herself sinking into it, embracing both it and the white-hot bite of pain that hurtled her ever closer to climax. \u201cSix, seven. Please . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. I love the way you\u2019re sticking your ass in the air, waiting for me to give you more.\u201d</p><p>Kata froze. She was? As Hunter ran a warm finger down her hot rear, she arched her back and strained up, anticipating his next blow. Need and confusion poured through her.</p><p>He struck her ass with his palm twice more, again with more force than before. \u201cYou will never put yourself in danger again. Ever. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>No, she was consumed by the ecstasy just beyond her grasp. The pain flowed through her backside, her thighs, her skin tingling and alive. Her sex throbbed in demand. The sensations licked her with flames of need, torqued her up, driving her close to the edge. She whimpered.</p><p>\u201cKata?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight.\u201d She exhaled raggedly. \u201cN-nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we clear?\u201d</p><p>Hunter wasn\u2019t going to give her that orgasm beckoning with its overwhelming power yet. God, she wanted it. The strength of her desire splintered her. She squirmed on his lap, trying to rub herself on his thigh.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop pushing, can you? I am your husband and your Dom. I say when you come. I say how you stay safe. You will not sneak out behind my back again. If you do, I won\u2019t be responsible for how far I push you or how hard I fuck you. Your role is to surrender.\u201d</p><p>The independent woman in her wanted to tell him to go blow himself. The trembling submissive in her lay braced for his last smack, praying it would send her over the edge.</p><p>\u201cAsk me nicely for what you want, Kata. And do it right the first time.\u201d Or else there would be no orgasm. She heard the implied threat in his voice.</p><p>Nipples and mound both rubbing over the denim covering his strong, spread thighs, Kata held her breath, needing the intoxicating thrill of his hand on her ass again. She\u2019d never imagined that she\u2019d like it. But this stunning pleasure-pain . . . She could almost hate him for giving this to her, making her vulnerable, but she needed him too much.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Sir, may I have another? Please make me come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you consider your safety more carefully in the future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She would have said anything for his next touch.</p><p>\u201cWill you trust me to take care of you?\u201d He rubbed his hot palm across her ass.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>His body jerked, and Kata heard the whistle of his hand as it whipped through the air. She braced herself, but nothing could prepare her for the final blow, again in the center of her right cheek. An inferno blasted across her skin. Tingles sparked from her reddened flesh down, brutally invading her pussy. Need coiled tighter. She hovered on the edge of an orgasm that was both terrifying and essential. Without it, she\u2019d die.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Hunter, Sir. Please . . .\u201d Her entire body jolted, shuddered, pinging with a towering, unrelieved desire she\u2019d never felt in her life.</p><p>Without warning, he released her wrists, lifted her, then rolled her over. Her sore rear rested on his chafing denim. She hissed at the sharp sensation, wishing it was enough to send her over. It only sent her higher.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Kata lifted her frantic gaze to him. The unmistakable lust in his eyes added more fuel to her fire. But that wasn\u2019t all. Every moment, every breath, teemed with his possessive fury.</p><p>Hunter settled a palm on her knee, then slowly slid it up her thigh, his thumb achingly close to her pussy. \u201cWho do you belong to?\u201d</p><p>She whimpered and thrust her hips to him. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you ever forget that?\u201d His thumb grazed her slick flesh, whispering just over her hard, demanding clit.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she mewled.</p><p>\u201cWill you ever disobey me like this again?\u201d</p><p>To feel these million racing sensations again ... this sublime journey into another realm where Hunter put this mind-blowing stamp of possession on her? For that, she\u2019d do nearly anything to please\u2014or provoke\u2014him.</p><p>She closed her eyes, sinking into the drowning pool of need. \u201cNo. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Kata.\u201d The second her eyes fluttered open, he murmured, \u201cNow come.\u201d Then he slapped her mound, right above her clit.</p><p>It was everything she\u2019d ached for and needed.</p><p>Kata let loose a guttural scream as pleasure drew up, in, blood swelling her flesh until she exploded in ecstasy. Her body jerked as she unraveled. And Hunter forced his hand between her legs again, circling her clit, prolonging the staggering clenching of her womb, until she could no longer think or breathe or do anything but feel rapture pour over her.</p><p>Though he had yet to be inside her, she felt utterly possessed. He grounded her, became her reality. In the haze of pleasure, his body, his arms, were the only things that seemed real to her. She met his gaze helplessly, losing herself in the commanding blue fire of his eyes. Needing something to hang on to, she grabbed his shirt and silently pleaded with him. For mercy? For more? She wasn\u2019t sure. In response, he shoved two fingers into the tight clasp of her sex, his thumb working her sensitive nub, and shoved her over another towering cliff of pleasure.</p><p>After Kata eked out the last whimper of need, she opened her eyes. Hunter leaned over her, knuckles brushing her cheeks and wiping her tears away. She\u2019d been crying? Yes, and she still sobbed as the power of their shared moment hit her all over again. Hunter had taken her apart and turned her inside out, opened her up in a way that left her both terrified and exhilarated. Though limp and weeping in his lap, she felt inexorably tied to him, body and heart, in a way she\u2019d never been connected to anyone in her life.</p><p>Gently, he dried her tears again, then lifted her, setting her on her knees between his thighs. \u201cI need you, honey.\u201d</p><p>Kata glanced up into his tight, flushed face. His need was apparent and compelling, just like the hard bulge beneath his zipper. As she basked in afterglow, the urge to please him totally sank into her bones. For some reason, she knew she would not breathe easily again until he was every bit as satisfied as she. The feeling was foreign and illogical but undeniable.</p><p>With trembling fingers, she worked his zipper, looking to him for approval. Desire flared in his eyes. Hunter\u2019s heavy breaths punctuated the rasp of his zipper as she lowered it. Her heart raced. As she worked his jeans and briefs down, Hunter stood. Kata shifted at his feet, squarely onto her knees, and stripped his garments down his lean legs. He kicked them across the room as he tore off his shirt, leaving his muscled chest, washboard abs, and every amazing inch of his cock bare. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He filtered his fingers through her hair, then planted a tender but firm grip on her crown, slowly pulling her toward his open thighs. She reached for him and grabbed his thick cock, licking her lips as she went down.</p><p>When she ran her tongue across the damp purple head of his erection, his fingers tightened in her hair. Hunter tensed, hissed. \u201cYeah, honey. That\u2019s it. Open your mouth just like . . . ahhh. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>At the intense pleasure in his voice, a shiver rolled through her. Kata curled closer, opened her mouth wider, took him deeper. Slowly, eyes closed, she filled her mouth with his thick shaft. She cataloged everything about him: his silky-hard texture, the faint smell of sweat and musk, the tang of salt concentrated at his weeping slit, the dusting of brown hair on his thighs that thickened at the root of his cock, the way he groaned and jerked as she took him all the way to the back of her throat.</p><p>His fingers tightened on her as he arched his hips, stroking into her mouth. \u201cFuck, you feel so good.\u201d</p> <p>Kata heated under his praise, yearned for more of it. Sucking hard, she drew her lips up all the steely inches of his shaft, rubbing and cradling him with her tongue, dragging her teeth delicately over the swollen head.</p><p>Hunter hissed again. \u201cDamn. I\u2019ve been dying to feel that heavenly mouth. Swallow me, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Then he was palming the back of her head with one hand and guiding his cock to her with the other.</p><p>In the past, oral sex had been merely a means to excite a lover before sex. But this was a pleasure all its own. He filled her senses with his musky scent, unique tang, and growling moans, as the hard bands of his hair-roughened thighs tensed beneath her fingers. He threw his head back, eyes closed, and lost himself. The woman inside ached to please him completely, deepen the undeniable bond forging between them.</p> <p>The swollen velvety head of his cock brushed her lips again, and she took him deeper, faster, unable to resist giving him all he sought. She teased him with a sly flick of her tongue. His fingers tightened in her hair, guiding her, establishing a fast, hot rhythm. Kata complied, drawing him to the back of her throat. A long groan spilled from his chest. Kata relished the sound.</p><p>She cupped his heavy testicles in her palm. They drew up as she dragged her tongue up his shaft and curled over the sensitive head again, giving him another gentle nip of her teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so fucking good. Suck me dry.\u201d</p><p>His command sent a thrill through her. The thought of giving him enough pleasure to completely empty him aroused her to a fever pitch. Her breasts hung heavy, ached. Her sex cramped with a hungry clench. She slipped a hand between her legs and fumbled for her clit.</p><p>Hunter dragged her hand away from her slick folds. \u201cNo, honey. Save that for me. That orgasm is mine to give you.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered, but he merely took her wrists in his grasp and lifted them high above her head, restraining them against his chest in one powerful hand. He directed her mouth back to his waiting cock with the other.</p> <p>Even as he denied her self-pleasure, blood rushed through her body, heart pumping. Hunter was becoming an addiction. Kata knew it, felt herself rushing headlong into the danger. Despite knowing she\u2019d crash hard eventually, in that moment, she was willing to do anything to experience the ecstasy he could give her.</p><p>He filled her mouth, leaking more fluid. His urgent need ripped through her. She sucked harder, faster. His words slowly gave way to tortured groans. He hardened again and pulsed on her tongue. Desire clawed at her. She wanted this, needed to know that she could hurtle him into pleasure, as he did for her.</p><p>\u201cKata.\u201d He barely got her name out between harsh breaths. \u201cNow, honey.\u201d</p><p>She moaned, nodded, sucking him deeper than ever before.</p><p>Seconds later, his every muscle tensed. He shouted and flooded her mouth with the salty taste of him, filling her ears with his long, guttural moan. She swallowed him, sucking him through his climax, electric pleasure jolting her simply because she\u2019d pleased him. And she knew it when he looked at her moments later with soft blue eyes, gave her that tender stroke of fingers across her cheek.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Kata hadn\u2019t just wanted to give him pleasure; she\u2019d needed to earn his praise and tenderness, and still ached for his approval. In the past, she\u2019d assumed that lovers would find their pleasure in her, just as she did with them. Hunter was different. Why?</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re incredible.\u201d His raspy voice went straight to her heart. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p> <p>His. Yes, and she felt it down to her very core. Hearing his appreciation settled her anxiety, brought about a sense of peace that she didn\u2019t quite understand. In one way, she felt cleansed, almost happy.</p><p>With a groan, Hunter sat back on the bed. Kata rested her head on his thigh, sighing when he filtered his hands through her hair in tender thanks.</p><p>Kata had never felt anything like this sweet bond. Tears sprang to her eyes again. God, she wanted to experience it again and again, would do anything to have it. Clean his house, bake him cakes, worship at his feet. Whatever he wanted.</p><p>How did that make her different than her mother?</p><p>The question zinged through her brain like a bullet. Her blood chilled. Kata jerked away, avoiding Hunter\u2019s sudden quizzical stare.</p><p>Given her mother\u2019s weakness for Gordon, the fact that she was willing to prostrate herself to earn Hunter\u2019s pleasure and approval terrified her. After the way he\u2019d handled Ben\u2019s challenge and her defiance, she knew Hunter wasn\u2019t like Gordon in the ways that mattered. But what if she was more like her mother than she imagined? What if she lost herself to her unbearably sexy, powerful husband and ceased being Kata, the snarky, independent probation officer, and merely became Kata the eager submissive?</p><p>For a decade, she\u2019d despised that weakness inside her mother that allowed her to subjugate herself to the asshole she\u2019d married. It devastated Kata to realize she carried the same weakness.</p><p>Suddenly, she could see herself as Hunter\u2019s plaything, waiting, hoping\u2014begging\u2014him to bestow pleasure and admiration on her because she couldn\u2019t do without them. After all, he\u2019d dismantled her with a mere ten swats and a single touch to her pussy. How easily Hunter had taken her under, to a place where she didn\u2019t recognize herself, to a world where she\u2019d do anything to make him happy. Kata could too easily lose herself in this, in him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s running through your head, honey?\u201d He reached out for her. When she scrambled away, he frowned. \u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>Kata tried to take a deep breath. Maybe she was overthinking this. Morgan didn\u2019t seem lost to Jack. Then again, they were like some fairy-tale couple, totally happy in a way most spouses could only pray for. That wasn\u2019t reality. The way she\u2019d given herself over to Hunter so completely was. As was her terrible yearning to do it again.</p><p>She saw now that Hunter wouldn\u2019t take her independence. He\u2019d be hard, demanding. But to feel this staggering pleasure again, to please him, she would willingly give her soul away until there was nothing left.</p><p>Kata closed her eyes and sobbed.</p><p>HUNTER frowned at his overwrought wife. They\u2019d been perfectly in sync, her submission so natural and freely given. He\u2019d been so proud. Now he saw panic ripping across her face. She\u2019d fallen hard into a post-scene plunge, where she felt stripped to the bone and emotion ruled.</p><p>Hunter gritted his teeth. She needed aftercare and reassurance\u2014fast.</p><p>He approached, ignoring her when she scrambled away, and lifted her to the bed. \u201cLie back.\u201d He settled her head on the pillow, rubbed a soothing hand over her shoulder. \u201cTell me what\u2019s upsetting you.\u201d</p><p>Kata refused to look at him. Fuck.</p><p>Digging for patience, he curled his body around her own. She turned her back to him, sobbing harder. Shit, was this something more than a common emotional swell?</p><p>Hunter realized that he\u2019d argued without listening much, mistake number one. He understood the urgency of her mother\u2019s situation and should have told her so. God knew, she\u2019d been under pressure and confused. But damn it, she hadn\u2019t even tried to hear his perspective, hadn\u2019t trusted his protection. The words necessary to describe his betrayal at seeing her on Ben\u2019s lap, knowing she\u2019d run to her fuck buddy for help before her husband, weren\u2019t in his vocabulary.</p><p>With that spanking, Hunter had punished her. She\u2019d submitted so beautifully. Now, after experiencing their stunning connection and tasting heaven, she was trying her best to put distance between them again.</p><p>\u201cHoney. Don\u2019t do this. You\u2019ve got to tell me what\u2019s wrong so we can work on it.\u201d</p><p>Kata scrambled off the bed. \u201cWhere\u2019s my purse?\u201d</p><p>She scanned the room with haunted eyes. Worry slithered through him.</p><p>Damn, he should have known that if he was going to ask her to open up to him, the revelations couldn\u2019t be one-sided. He had to open up as well and explain why her refusal to trust him with her feelings was unacceptable . . . and painful. Kata had to understand. He felt so fucking vulnerable, revealing his anguish to someone with the power to devastate him. But she deserved the truth, especially if he wanted the same. They\u2019d have nothing without honesty.</p><p>\u201cHoney, take a deep breath. I\u2019ll find your purse. Then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t meet his stare.</p><p>Reining back his anxiety, Hunter prowled around the room until he found her little clutch. Reluctantly, he handed it to her. Kata tore it open. From inside, she withdrew a sheaf of papers and a pen, scrawled something across the last page, then thrust the crisp document at him with shaking hands. \u201cSign it.\u201d</p><p>Trepidation tightened his gut. With one hand, he shook the papers open and found the only three words in creation that could have fear exploding in his belly\u2014and him seeing red.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cPETITION for divorce?\u201d The blast of his voice echoed off the walls like thunder. Hunter crushed the paper in his hand. He swallowed, nostrils flaring.</p><p>Kata flinched.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t think I can do this for even another five minutes. We\u2019re not going to be right together for a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not willing to stick around and find out?\u201d Hunter crowded in on her, his gaze locked on hers. \u201cThis. Will. Never. Happen.\u201d He spoke slowly, clearly, every word avow. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work this out, Kata. I won\u2019t make my dad\u2019s mistake and watch my wife walk out the door.\u201d</p><p>She froze. His statement explained so much. He tried to hold emotion back, but sadness and rage bled from his expression. Kata\u2019s heart caught as their gazes connected, hers silently asking what had happened.</p><p>\u201cAt the start of my senior year, my mother served my father with divorce papers so she could be with her lover. My dad did nothing to stop her.\u201d</p><p>His father\u2019s inaction had disturbed Hunter deeply, she could tell. \u201cMaybe your dad didn\u2019t love her anymore.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s laugh was grim and ugly. \u201cHe would have cut his heart out of his chest to have her back. I\u2019m not making that mistake, Kata. I will fight to keep you until I stop breathing.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s why he\u2019d refused to talk about his mother in Vegas. Now every line on his face was stamped with determination and pain. She had to fight the urge to wrap her arms around him and comfort him.</p><p>No wonder seeing her with Ben had been such a nasty shock for him. Hunter was possessive and protective to start with, but coupled with his mother leaving for a lover . . . Of course, when she\u2019d told him that she wanted a divorce, she\u2019d dredged up the pain of his past. She, of all people, understood how emotional issues from parents could bite one in the ass. Clearly, they had that in common. Her heart ached for him.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean she could stay.</p><p>Hunter dropped his head, shoulders tight. \u201cNone of us ever saw her again. She was dead less than a year later.\u201d</p><p>Kata gasped. Not only had the woman left, but she\u2019d died? Another terrible blow to a young man still reeling from his parents\u2019 divorce. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe murderer snuck into her apartment, then raped and strangled her. She\u2019d been living alone, had no one to protect her. To this day, the crime is unsolved.\u201d</p><p>No wonder Hunter took the threat against his own wife so seriously. He knew firsthand what could happen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you lost your mother to senseless violence. My father died of a heart attack when I was ten, so I empathize about losing a parent. I\u2019m truly sorry for all you and your family have been through.\u201d She took his hand, squeezed gently. \u201cHunter, I\u2019m not her. I can\u2019t replace her. And you\u2019re not your father. You\u2019ll be fine when I\u2019m gone. Our marriage was a whim, so you\u2019ll barely notice I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>While Kata feared that Hunter had imprinted himself on her forever. Even so, she couldn\u2019t stay and put either of them through the pain she knew would come.</p><p>\u201cBullsh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to make me stay. We\u2019ll both just end up hurt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo these\u201d\u2014he gripped the papers\u2014\u201chave anything to do with Ben?\u201d</p><p>Why didn\u2019t he see that this whirlwind marriage just wasn\u2019t meant to be permanent? She couldn\u2019t be with someone who could not only make her give herself to him so completely, he demanded it. He was only clinging to her so hard because he didn\u2019t want to have his father\u2019s regrets. They didn\u2019t make sense for the long haul . . . but he deserved her honesty.</p><p>\u201cNo, I really don\u2019t love him. I am not leaving you for someone else. I\u2019m just leaving so I can go back to my life.\u201d</p><p>Hunter swallowed again, fists clenching at his sides. And for all that he looked furious and proud, his vulnerability was unmistakable. The fact that she wanted a divorce was killing him. Even though parting was the sane choice, guilt and anguish sliced her stomach like a machete.</p> <p>\u201cThis is all crap. You want to leave because you submitted so totally that it scared you. I won\u2019t let you run from us.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019m not signing those unless I\u2019m convinced that you have no feelings for me.\u201d</p><p>Frustration roiled inside her, and angry tears filled her eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t refuse to let me go. That wouldn\u2019t make you any better than Gordon.\u201d</p><p>Flinty eyes raked over her. \u201cDo you honestly think I would ever degrade you until you lost your self-esteem?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d already crossed this bridge. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I would fail to seek medical care for you when you needed it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she admitted softly. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent a lot of time and effort trying to keep me alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think that I would take away your job and your friends to make you completely dependent on me?\u201d</p><p>Kata glared up through the thick fringe of her lashes with furious eyes. \u201cNo. But to make you happy, I worry that I would let you do anything you wanted to me in bed . . . and eventually in life. I can\u2019t respect myself like that. Please, just sign.\u201d</p><p>NEVER.</p><p>In disciplining her for not trusting him and trying to bring them closer together, he\u2019d taken her too deep and too fast into submission. It had frightened her. His mistake.</p><p>As much as Kata\u2019s family dynamic messed with her head, Hunter realized that he should have at least guessed this could happen. But he\u2019d been running on too much emotion and not enough sleep. Now, he\u2019d have to swallow all the destructive feelings that thinking of his mother dredged up and tread carefully with Kata\u2014or she\u2019d walk.</p> <p>Hunter gulped deep breaths, willing self-control. She was right; four days wasn\u2019t a long time to get to know someone or adjust to a marriage. He\u2019d already admitted his feelings to her. Reestablishing the trust they\u2019d been building during her punishment was important. Proving that she wouldn\u2019t lose herself, no matter how submissive she became, was critical. Kata had to know that she had a deep well of strength, and he didn\u2019t want to change that. Nothing between them would mean a damn thing if she was running from the dominance he needed to give her\u2014and she craved.</p><p>The papers, still balled up in his hands, had been her attempt to control the situation. A part of him wanted to be angry all over again that she didn\u2019t trust him not to take her over the edge. That was counterproductive.</p><p>With hands less steady than he liked, Hunter set the divorce papers on the dresser, then clasped her other shoulder. \u201cHoney, I want you submissive, but I never want you to feel weak. I never want to take over your life. You have so much power over me that it scares me fucking spitless. In just a few days, my feelings for you have taken root. They run deep, lifetime deep.\u201d He fused her gaze to his. \u201cI don\u2019t believe for one minute that you\u2019d ever surrender every bit of your free will to me. You\u2019re an amazing, strong woman. You have to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, not anymore.\u201d Her hazel eyes looked so green swimming in unshed tears. \u201cYou\u2019re so intense. So dominant. Over time, you\u2019ll break me down, and I\u2019ll give and give to you until I wake up one day and find that there\u2019s nothing left of me, just like Mam\u00e1. You may not mean that to happen, but I wonder if, deep down, it\u2019s your way of ensuring that I never leave. If that happens, I will hate myself.\u201d</p><p>Hunter understood her fear, but Kata was dead wrong. He just wanted to love her.</p><p>The instinct he\u2019d had to meet her parents after they\u2019d married was kicking him in the balls now. They should have done it sooner, but with someone trying to kill Kata, they\u2019d been unable to check the meet and greet off his to-do list. He needed to fix that.</p><p>\u201cHow can you think that you\u2019ll lose yourself to me when, from the moment I met you, you\u2019ve done so much to fight for what you wanted and believed in? That straightforward attitude and conviction are some of the biggest reasons I love you. You\u2019ve fought for your mother, for yourself\u2014even your pleasure. Kata, you\u2019re not a woman who could ever lose herself.\u201d</p><p>Emphatically, she shook her head. \u201cAfter the spanking I should have been furious with you. Fucking spitting mad. But all I could think about was pleasing you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA submissive\u2019s nature is to want to please her Dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, so you\u2019ll be thrilled while I\u2019m slowly losing my self-respect.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s not one-sided. I want to please you, too. Always. Sometimes, I have to balance that with what you need. Don\u2019t you think that, instead of spanking you, I would have ten times rather made love to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you spanked me for my benefit?\u201d She sounded incredulous. \u201cYou didn\u2019t enjoy it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little,\u201d he confessed. \u201cBut yeah, mostly for you. Afterward, didn\u2019t you feel a sense of happiness and calm? A desire to give that back? Didn\u2019t you feel closer to me?\u201d</p><p>Her stunned expression told Hunter that Kata was, even now, wondering if he could read her mind.</p><p>Hunter drew her closer, both soothed and fired up by the feel of her naked body and lush breasts against him. \u201cI want to protect and love you, not crush you. Not cage you. I push you hard in bed because you\u2019re a woman with backbone and you have the strength to submit with grace. For me, earning your submission is a pleasure unto itself. If you ever feel like you\u2019re giving too much of yourself away, use your safe word. We will pause whatever\u2019s happening and talk. Once I return from active duty, we\u2019ll go more slowly. But you don\u2019t need those papers, honey. You need to trust that I know what\u2019s best for both of us.\u201d</p><p>In his arms, Kata stiffened, backed away, shaking her head. \u201cTonight, how badly I wanted to please you? It scared me. I know you say it\u2019s natural, but it\u2019s a slippery slope to hell.\u201d She choked. \u201cYou deserve to find some sweet girl who will be content to obey and never leave your side. But it can\u2019t be me. Sign the papers.\u201d</p><p>As more tears flooded her eyes, she pressed her mouth into a grim line. Hunter realized that, even though she thought divorce was the right option, actually leaving him was hurting her. It warmed his heart\u2014and hardened his resolve.</p><p>\u201cThat someone is you. I won\u2019t undo this marriage without a genuine reason. Fear alone doesn\u2019t qualify.\u201d He thrust his fingers into her hair and gripped, pulling her mouth just under his. \u201cI\u2019m going to earn your trust, show you how good it is between us. You\u2019ll give a lot to me, but honey, I\u2019ll give back everything and more. I\u2019m back on active duty Sunday. Just give me until then to prove it.\u201d</p><p>She blinked as she considered his words. It took everything inside him not to lay his mouth over hers and ravage it. Her mind rebelled against how incredible their dynamic was, but when he commanded her surrender, she stopped thinking and started feeling. He had to get her back to that place, where her sensations and emotions ruled, not her fear. He\u2019d given her his discipline, and she\u2019d need more, but she also needed his tenderness.</p><p>Dipping his head, he nipped at her bottom lip with his teeth, then soothed the little sting away with his tongue. She gasped. He covered her sweetly parted lips with his own, barely restraining the urge to throw her on her back, spread her thighs, get deep inside her, and love her thoroughly so she\u2019d know he cherished her.</p><p>She tasted sweet, and Hunter\u2019s knees all but melted out from under him as he thrust slowly into her mouth. For a thin moment, she stiffened. But he soothed her with a gentle caress up her back, held her nape with a firm grip. She softened against him and clung to his biceps.</p><p>Like diving into warm waters in search of treasure, he patiently eased down, ever deeper, until she rose up on her toes, welcoming him unconsciously. His tongue danced around hers, a long caress, a silent promise of more to come. Her soft whimper went straight to his cock.</p><p>As soon as he heard it, he eased back, softly brushing her lips with his own, laving at them for the span of a heartbeat before pulling away. Rising on tiptoes, Kata pressed closer, throwing her arms around his neck, grabbing at the short strands of his hair. At the moment she merely wanted him. But he intended to stay at her until she begged. Until she couldn\u2019t walk away.</p><p>Dusting kisses across her jaw, Hunter smoothed his free hand down the small of her back, over her hip, caressing one fingertip along the outside of her thigh, edging toward her ass . . . but never quite touching her there. He repeated each movement in a random pattern, adding a press of thumb along her upper thigh, a sweep of knuckles over the curve of her hip, a feathery touch to the sensitive bit of flesh just above her butt. He breathed against the soft skin behind her ear.</p><p>Kata mewled and shivered.</p><p>\u201cThose sounds you make, honey? They undo me,\u201d he whispered into her ear.</p><p>She shifted her body restlessly against him, her pebbled nipples brushing over his chest. Closer, she moved, her hips sliding against his own. Hunter grabbed her, stilled her. So the little vixen sought to rob his control by rubbing that sweet pussy against his cock? He\u2019d allow that . . . eventually. But not until she was ready to hand complete control of her body to him and able to see that she would be just fine.</p><p>\u201cOn my flight back here,\u201d he murmured, \u201cI spent hours fantasizing about you. I\u2019m going to find every way possible to make you come.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. She arched against him now, silently pleading with her body. That was good . . . but not good enough. He wanted her mind, her heart, her soul.</p><p>Hunter trailed his mouth over the soft, musky scent concentrated in the groove of her neck and shoulder. He nipped at the tender skin, then sucked it as all the nerves awakened. He licked her in that same spot, teasing her with sensation. When she shuddered, he smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The hell he couldn\u2019t. He drifted a hand up to her waist, trailing lightly over her ribs, to rest just under one of her heavy, swollen breasts.</p><p>\u201cWhy not, honey?\u201d He nestled his thumb just beneath it in a barely there touch and forced himself not to move, knowing it would leave her wanting more. \u201cYou think we shouldn\u2019t or that I\u2019m incapable?\u201d</p><p>No hiding her shiver from him. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can. It\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love nothing more than to spread you across my bed and find out exactly how much I can arouse you with my hands,\u201d he murmured into her ear, the hand at her nape tracing light little circles on her skin. \u201cDiscover the exact pressure to apply to your gorgeous, rosy nipples to make them stand up and beg for more. I want to make your pussy not just wet, but juicy. My goal is to run my hand across every inch of your silky skin until I\u2019ve touched you every way possible.\u201d</p><p>Kata drew in a shuddering breath and pressed tighter against him. Her nipples engorged again. Repressing a smile, he eased back just enough to see the flush crawl up her chest. Perfect.</p><p>He kissed the corner of her mouth. When she tried to press her lips flush to his, Hunter veered away to dust kisses along her jaw. Slowly, he worked his way to her other ear.</p><p>\u201cThen I want to put my fingers inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter, stop.\u201d The tone was forceful, but her breathing sounded harsh and shallow.</p><p>He smiled, then nipped at her lobe. \u201cHoney, I\u2019m just getting started. I can\u2019t wait to feel my way into the hot clasp of your cunt. It\u2019s a silky vise, and I\u2019m dying to find that so-sensitive spot inside you again, brush my thumb over your clit, and watch you go crazy for me.\u201d</p><p>Kata grabbed his face and forced him to meet her stare. Her eyes looked wild and startlingly green. A dusky rose flushed her normally olive cheeks. And her lips were red, swollen. Everything about her grabbed him by the cock, the heart, and refused to let go.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d Her pleading voice was a low mewl.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell you how good I\u2019m dying to make you feel? I don\u2019t want to stop, honey.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, tried to back away. \u201cWe have great sex, God knows, but you\u2019re not hearing me. I can\u2019t be what you want, and sex is only going to muddy the waters.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They needed sex to reconnect, so he could show her that she had no reason to panic. That she didn\u2019t have to fear what she, deep down, wanted. Hopefully, he could break through her wall enough so they could talk out the rest of their issues afterward.</p><p>\u201cI want that pretty ass of yours.\u201d He went on as if she hadn\u2019t spoken, refusing to lend credence to her fear. \u201cI\u2019m going to run my palms up and down that fine backside. Those sweet cheeks took a spanking so well.\u201d He feathered the tips of his fingers down her back, then drifted over the tender line between her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will take a fucking the same way.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, tried to step back. His hold was too tight.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever penetrated you here, and I want to be the first one.\u201d The only one. \u201cI could give myself wet dreams just thinking about prying those sweet cheeks apart and sliding my dick, dripping with your juice, back here, then plunging deep. I want that, honey. Just like I want to see if anal sex will make you come.\u201d</p><p>Kata dropped her gaze, her brows drawing together tightly, like she was fighting hard to resist the lure of his seduction.</p><p>Hunter grasped her chin and raised her stare back to his. \u201cNo running, no hiding. Eyes on me. Until Sunday, Kata.\u201d</p><p>A mulish expression tore across her face\u2014along with need. Hunter waited with a patience that chafed.</p><p>She sighed, opened her mouth, closed it.</p><p>Hunter seized the opportunity. \u201cUntil I figure out who is trying to kill you and why so I can stop them, I know you\u2019re safe with me. Stay. I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else has threatened me since Sunday. Maybe they\u2019ve given up.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d wondered at the pause, too, but in his gut, he knew the threat wasn\u2019t over. \u201cOr whoever is behind the hit is just waiting for us to get sloppy.\u201d</p><p>Kata hesitated. \u201cAll right. Until Sunday, but you have to consider what I\u2019m saying and give me some space.\u201d</p><p>That was the last thing Kata needed. Still, her concession to give him more time was big. If she\u2019d trust him, he\u2019d give her something wonderful in return.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d He cupped her jaw and stared directly into her eyes. \u201cBut you have to try to trust me.\u201d</p><p>She sent him a solemn glance, and he hoped like hell that she was considering his words. Finally, she nodded.</p><p>Sighing in relief, he wrapped a hand around Kata\u2019s hip and pulled her in close, whispering against her lips, \u201cNow, where were we? Oh, yeah . . . After I found all the ways to make you come with just my hands, I\u2019ll start in on you with my mouth. Did you know I have a huge oral fixation? I\u2019m always going to be tasting some part of you. Your lips . . .\u201d He pressed a slow kiss across her mouth, then bent to whisper in her ear. \u201cYour neck.\u201d Another achingly soft brush of lips along the silky skin there made his mouth water. \u201cYour nipples.\u201d</p><p>Hunter dragged his thumbs across those hard points, thrilled when she gasped and arched to him. With one hand at the small of her back, the other cradled her breast, and he brought the little bud to his mouth.</p><p>Hell, yes. He loved the hard candy tip just sitting on his tongue, the way he could pucker his lips around the engorged flesh, just before he bit softly. Kata moaned, shifting her hips not just against him, but into him, wriggling, flaunting, silently pleading for more.</p><p>Not quite success . . . but getting there.</p><p>Passion flowing like lava in his veins, he sucked one nipple deep while he worked the other with his thumb and forefinger. They\u2019d be tender tomorrow, but she wasn\u2019t feeling anything now except growing arousal. She clutched his head, fingers digging into his scalp. The little bite aroused the hell out of him.</p><p>Easing away, he studied his handiwork. Gorgeous nipple. Red, hard, swollen. He leaned into the other and gave it the same treatment, massaging the first with a firm pinch. Soon, she had a matched pair, each looking engorged and dark and eager.</p><p>Then Hunter clasped his hands around her waist and sank to his knees, his tongue tracing circles across her belly, dipping into her navel.</p><p>He clasped her hips and eased down a fraction, gratified when she canted toward him. She might not understand why, and her head might not agree, but she wanted him.</p> <p>With one hand drifting down her stomach, he inched closer to her pussy. Easing back, he studied her. Goose pimples stood out on her thighs. She sought him with little jerks of her hips. And she was beyond wet. He smiled.</p><p>Clasping his fingers around her thigh, he settled his thumb low on her belly, then began a torturous descent. Down, down, in an unhurried stroke. Kata caught her breath, held it. He could feel her silently willing him to touch her and send her over. Another whimper escaped her throat, hardening his cock again, testing his will. He held firm.</p><p>It seemed like an eternity later when he finally felt her clit beneath his thumb, swollen, hard, peeking out from beneath its hood.</p><p>She gasped, thrusting her hands into his hair and holding him against her. \u201cHunter . . .\u201d</p><p>Leaning in, Hunter hovered his mouth over her clit, his hot breath hitting the sensitive bud. \u201cAnd here. I\u2019m going to want to put my mouth right here all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it now,\u201d she demanded in a high, thin voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like that?\u201d</p><p>Above him, Hunter felt more than saw her vigorous nod. \u201cI ache all over. Why the hell can you make me want you too much?\u201d</p><p>He brushed his thumb over her slick clit again, a ghost, there then gone. \u201cNever any such thing, honey. Do you want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeesss,\u201d she hissed. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Ah, a polite little plea. Definite progress.</p><p>\u201cSoon. I need something from you first.\u201d And just to ensure her assent, he swiped his thumb across her needy little bud once, then again, ever so slowly.</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>There it was, that beautiful, dangerous word. \u201cGood girl. It works both ways. I\u2019d do anything\u2014and everything\u2014for you.\u201d</p><p>Hunter rose and smiled, covering her mouth with his own again and sinking into the honey-sweet kiss, as slow as molasses. Kata wriggled, moaned, clutched his shoulders, the edgings of desperation apparent in her every move.</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d He took her by the hand and led her to the padded table in the living room for two reasons: First, he wanted to be as far away from those fucking divorce papers as he could manage. Second, what he needed to do to her would be much easier to achieve here.</p><p>Once they reached the low black table, he eased her down to the surface, stomach first. When the cold leather hit her skin, she tensed. Casting a gaze over her shoulder at him, panic tinged her hazel gaze. He could not let her brain kick in again.</p><p>Flattening his palm over her back, Hunter caressed his way down her ass until he curled his palm between her legs, right over her pussy, and toyed with her clit enough to keep her on edge.</p><p>\u201cI love the feel of you, so wet.\u201d He circled an idle fingertip around that hardened bundle of nerves. \u201cI wonder how long I can draw this orgasm out. Two minutes? Ten? An hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, no. Don\u2019t try to wring me inside out!\u201d</p><p>Hunter flipped the switch under the table, turning it from a stylish, black studded ottoman to a fully functional play table. The compartments that concealed a set of O-rings retracted. He reached into the drawer beneath the table and pulled out two pairs of cuffs. In less than ten seconds, he had one attached to each of her wrists and the other end secured to the table.</p><p>\u201cLet me please you,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>She pulled at her wrists, her body beyond taut with anxiety. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want this orgasm.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her hair out of the way, Kata glared at him over her shoulder. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t need it. Yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t torment me.\u201d She wriggled in vain. \u201cDamn it, uncuff me!\u201d</p><p>Not until he\u2019d given her more of what she needed. Unless she used her safe word, he\u2019d keep pushing her boundaries. Anything else she cried out was just for show.</p><p>Reaching into the drawer beneath the table again, he pulled out a tube of lube. And God bless Jack, there was a new multipronged vibrator sitting there, still in the wrapper, perfect for what he needed.</p><p>He grabbed it and rose. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Striding across to the kitchen, he unwrapped the toy, washed it, then inserted batteries, which he thankfully found in a drawer. Back on the ottoman, he slid Kata over his lap, then lubed up his fingers and the toy.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d The edge of fear was back in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing well, so I\u2019m adding something to your . . . experience.\u201d He traced a finger down the line of her ass and pressed in, finding the tight little hole he knew no one else had ever touched.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d He knew it didn\u2019t; he\u2019d barely put a finger on her.</p><p>\u201cN-no, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t speak unless I ask you to or you wish to use your safe word. Do you understand? If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll stop touching you altogether. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>Kata paused for a long moment, so long Hunter thought he would have to make good on that threat. Finally, she whispered. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Relief poured through him.</p><p>Slowly, he pressed his finger inside her tight entrance. She clamped down hard on him, but with a gentle nudge, he pushed past the ring of resistance, all the way inside. She gasped. When she tried to peer at him over her shoulders, he pressed down on her shoulder blades with his free hand. She needed not to rely on her senses, but on their bond. Kata struggled for a moment, then fell still.</p><p>Easing out, he ringed the entrance again, spreading more lube, then pressed in with two fingers. She clenched her cheeks, and he rubbed her hip softly. \u201cEase up.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she relaxed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, for him, either. She was like an inferno, burning his fingers. The hot, tight pressure . . . God, when he got his cock back there, not only would it feel incredible, but many women said that taking a man anally felt like one of the most submissive acts possible. It sure as hell felt both dominant and intimate to him\u2014exactly what he craved with Kata.</p><p>He spread his fingers apart. \u201cThis is for you, honey, to make taking me easier when the time comes.\u201d</p><p>Hunter worked his fingers inside her tight recesses, back and forth, in and nearly out, massaging her and coaxing her each time she clenched up. It didn\u2019t take long for Kata to draw in a long, shuddering breath and grip the edges of the table until every muscle in her arms and shoulders stood out. Her breathing hitched, her skin flushed red. More moisture gushed from her pussy. She was damn close.</p><p>\u201cNeed to come, honey? You don\u2019t have permission.\u201d</p><p>And wouldn\u2019t that reminder drive her insane?</p><p>Withdrawing his fingers, he took the vibrator in hand and set the tapering anal stimulator against her entrance. \u201cPush down for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014oh!\u201d</p><p>Hunter pressed in with the flexible toy, pushing past the tight clench of muscles there. She hissed as the wider end of the plug began to stretch her. He slowed. No way did he want to hurt her, but he did want her to feel every inch.</p><p>\u201cOh . . . God!\u201d She gasped. \u201cI\u2014it burns and I . . .\u201d She panted, and he waited patiently while the sensations sank in and she worked it out.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give you permission to speak.\u201d He continued pressing in ever so slowly.</p><p>\u201cBut Hunter\u2014\u201d</p><p>With a slap to her thigh, he cut her off. \u201cHow do you address me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir. I know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe word or shut up.\u201d Eventually, she\u2019d learn.</p><p>In the silence, he eased the toy completely inside her ass, the base flush with her cheeks. God, now there was a pretty sight, her ass still rosy from his spanking, her untried entrance slowly stretching, her stubborn submission nearly ripe for his taking.</p><p>He palmed the crown of her head in a soft stroke. \u201cKata, turn your head. Meet my gaze. Good girl. Honesty now. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt burns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d But he could tell from the way she spoke that there was more. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>She wriggled her ass, jostling the wand inside. Her white teeth clamped down on her bottom lip. \u201cI ache.\u201d</p><p>So she liked anal penetration. Some women hated the sensation. Personally, he loved the power and intimacy of taking a woman that way, the forbidden sharing. He was relieved that translated for Kata.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of that soon. He grabbed her thighs so she couldn\u2019t slink away. \u201cFirst, we\u2019re going to talk.\u201d</p><p>A fine sheen of perspiration covered her body. Her skin flushed even rosier as she sent him a pleading expression. \u201cBut ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt me, Kata. You can\u2019t hurl something like a divorce at me without talking to me or trying to work it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know about your mother.\u201d She gritted her teeth against the rise of pleasure. \u201cMy sister, who\u2019s an attorney, gave me the papers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Knowing she hadn\u2019t sought the divorce was a consolation. That fact gave him hope. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I should use them. Then you overwhelmed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought that was a good reason to end us?\u201d God, was his voice cracking? He frowned. \u201cI\u2019ll never punish you for your feelings. They\u2019re real and honest. I will, however, punish you for not talking to me. What we do in the bedroom aside, marriage is a partnership. This \u2018decision\u2019 was all you.\u201d</p><p>Kata said nothing for a long moment. Then tears pooled in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a caveman, and you\u2019re still not listening. You might be the perfect man for some little submissive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the perfect man for you. If you need to talk a scene or your feelings through, fine. Communicate with me, don\u2019t divorce me. I love you. You have feelings for me, too. That scares you, so you lashed out at me. That\u2019s not how this works. We\u2019re partners, and we work things out.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019ve got more punishment coming.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cSee, you\u2019re deciding to punish me. That\u2019s not a partnership.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is where our Dom/sub relationship comes into play. For us to succeed, you need to communicate. Since that hasn\u2019t sunk in yet, it\u2019s my job to help you along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou using your safe word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, right there. You\u2019re being a pushy asshole.\u201d</p><p>He cocked a brow at her. \u201cI guess not. Hold still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the plug . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cStays where it is.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Hunter twisted the toy, aligning the bulbous G-spot stimulator up with her wet pussy. When she gasped, he merely smiled while he inserted it. There, now it would be perfect. Then he flipped it on the lowest setting, while sliding his other hand between her legs, right over her clit.</p><p>\u201cOh dear God!\u201d she cried out as fresh moisture gushed onto his hand. She groaned once, then again when his finger circled her needy bud. Kata ground against his hand, looking for relief. Instead, he eased back\u2014and turned up the vibration.</p><p>Kata\u2019s entire body jolted. As he reached her clit again, he slid his other palm over her ass, transfixed by the gorgeous rosy color from her previous spanking. Her hips gyrated wildly as she sought a relief that wasn\u2019t coming anytime soon.</p><p>He turned up the vibration again. Kata clenched, whimpered, trembled. Her clit swelled again, hard like a stone. She was so close that he damn near held his breath with her. \u201cIt\u2019s too much! Damn it. Please . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what? You want to come?\u201d</p><p>Her body bucked again on his lap as she searched futilely for relief. It would come when he chose to grant it, and certainly not because she\u2019d wiggled for it. In no way would he reward her behavior over the last few days.</p><p>\u201cYou know I do,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cTouch me. Fuck me. Make me come.\u201d</p><p>Willing patience, he caressed her ass once more. \u201cAre you demanding or begging, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBegging ...\u201d She dug her fingernails into the padded leather, still wriggling. \u201cI promise that I won\u2019t get on Ben\u2019s lap again. I won\u2019t run away from your protection. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the future, you\u2019ll talk to me about how you\u2019re feeling instead of springing nasty surprises like divorce papers on me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI swear . . .\u201d</p><p>Kata was many things: impetuous, headstrong, sharp-tongued, vulnerable, and sexy as hell. But she wasn\u2019t a liar. Hunter smiled.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He stroked his way down the dark tangles of her silky hair, then the smooth line of her spine. When he feathered a light touch across her ass again, she shivered. Then he eased out from under her and stood.</p><p>\u201cHunter?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he stood behind her and gingerly withdrew the toy, ignoring her protest, then set it aside. \u201cKnees under you, ass in the air, honey.\u201d</p><p>Panting, Kata hesitated, her aroused body struggling to process his request. But she finally complied, drawing her knees up under her and sticking the luscious globes of her rosy backside high in the air for him.</p><p>\u201cIn addition to finding all the ways I can make you come with my hands and my mouth . . .\u201d He stepped to the edge of the table and grabbed her hips in his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely find every way possible to make you come on my cock, over and over. Starting now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>HUNTER aligned his cock with the slick heaven of her entrance and inched inside. Every blood cell in his body urged him to take her fast, hard. He held back, determined to build her climax up higher than ever. But the slow press inside the tight clasp of her swollen pussy had him gritting his teeth. Desire turned to hot lava in his veins.</p><p>God, getting inside Kata was always the most stunning experience. She gripped him like nothing he\u2019d ever felt. He lost himself to her silken clasp, the little catches of breath. The closeness they shared. He\u2019d fucked plenty of women but never given himself this completely to any. Now, he\u2019d never want sex any other way.</p><p>\u201cHunter . . .\u201d She moaned his name, a question, a plea.</p><p>Nothing could get to him faster than hearing her cry his name. He wanted to hear it every day for the rest of his life. Wanted to connect with her, form something so never ending that she\u2019d never think of leaving him again.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he croaked. \u201cKata, ah . . .\u201d He slid back inside, all the way, and tossed his head back on a groan. \u201cFuck. You\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a thin breath. \u201cAhh. I shouldn\u2019t like the way you force all this sensation on me.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. \u201cIt feels good when I\u2019m deep inside you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>Determined to keep her on edge, he withdrew almost completely, then fell into her again. It was like diving into honey, so slow and sweet, her clinging passage all around him. He thought he\u2019d go insane.</p><p>Finally, he nudged her cervix. She clawed the padded table again and bowed her head, unconsciously submissive. The sight nearly undid him. She might not want to acknowledge her nature, but he felt it, tasted and smelled it. That very nature colored so many of her responses. She would never be truly happy with anyone who couldn\u2019t give her the dominance she craved. And Hunter intended to make her very, very happy.</p><p>Jesus, she was wet and so close. The warning pulses of her pussy gripped him, trying to shove him over the edge. He gritted his teeth, his lungs about to burst, his skin on fire\u2014but he managed to slow down, hold back.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t give in to you the way I do,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>More bullshit. \u201cI love to please you, honey.\u201d</p><p>He punctuated the statement by leaning over the damp flesh of her back, settling his palm over her clit, then grinding into her.</p><p>Kata tossed back her head and cried out. \u201cHunter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to come now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll talk to me before making any decisions about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>Satisfaction burned through him like an inferno at her words. All the leashed power he\u2019d been holding back, Hunter let loose. He surged into her, throwing his body into each thrust. Kata mewled, gripped the edge of the ottoman with her nails. Her pussy clenched tight on him.</p><p>She wailed with pleasure, the skeins of her dark hair covering her shoulders in a silky brush of sable. God, everything about her was sexy. He thrust again, giving her even more, settling into a rhythm that was both blistering and merciless. Around him, she tensed, drawing in one shuddering breath after another, exhaling with a cry.</p><p>Sweat spread across his back, over his scalp, rolled down his temples. And still he kept at her, determined to give her both total devotion and absolute pleasure. He wanted this night to be like nothing she\u2019d ever experienced\u2014or would ever forget. Because in another three days, he\u2019d be shipping out. He had to be certain she had no interest pursuing that divorce in his absence. Losing her would kill him.</p><p>He molded his body more tightly to hers, luxuriating in the feel of her under his hands as he thrust deep, hard, fast. He spread kisses along her shoulder, shoving her hair out of the way so he could slide his lips up her neck, breathe in her skin. Musky, tinged with female perspiration and arousal, and ripe with something that would forever remind him of Kata. The smell and feel of her drove him toward the edge.</p><p>\u201cHunter!\u201d She clamped down on his cock now, dangerously close. In response, pleasure rolled down his spine, flash-heated his blood. His balls drew up tight. Damn it, he was going to be a heartbeat behind her.</p><p>He pressed his palm into her clit again. \u201cNow! Come, honey.\u201d</p><p>She did, screaming out her release. She squeezed him so tightly, he couldn\u2019t move for a long moment. Damn! Her walls closed in on him, pressing, stroking. Had he ever felt anything more mind-blowing? Pleasure was like a fresh razor blade up his spine\u2014sharp and cutting through him with so little effort. He bit gently into her shoulder and let loose, spilling all he had\u2014seed, need, and soul\u2014inside her.</p><p>Kata was everything to him. The submissive he\u2019d always sought, the gutsy, smart wife who\u2019d always challenge him. Somehow, with the few days they had left, he had to stop her would-be killer, ensure Ben stayed away, and convince Kata that she felt the same way for him.</p><p>KATA struggled to find her breath. Hunter\u2019s legs were tangled in hers, his arms banded around her middle. His mouth hovered over her neck as he breathed heavily against her skin. God, he was everywhere, made her feel everything.</p><p>She trembled. The floodgates of her fear and exhaustion poured over the reality of her submission, threatening to drown her. She bucked under Hunter, doing her best to dislodge him. But strapped to his table and held captive by his heavily muscled body, Kata couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>The rising tide rolled up and over her head. She swallowed hard, trying to force the feeling down, but the giant sob tore at her chest, even bigger than the release following her spanking. She choked as it came up. Tears burst out, and her arms and legs gave way.</p><p>In the back of her head, she knew that he wanted her to feel free to show him all her emotions. He\u2019d shown her his. She\u2019d never forget the haunted, angry look on his face when he talked about his mother, about the fact that his father had simply let the divorce happen. Their split was a scar on his heart, festering.</p><p>The way he\u2019d commanded her entire body just now proved that he didn\u2019t intend to allow his own wife to leave. His ruthless domination of her body was his way of fighting back. He\u2019d do anything necessary to make her stay. He\u2019d consume her in the process. And she feared that she\u2019d eventually just let him.</p><p>A shudder rolled over Kata. Damn it, she\u2019d already given him far more than she\u2019d ever given any man, more than she\u2019d ever thought she had to give. But he would never rest until he owned her through and through, all the way down to her soul.</p><p>She must put some distance between them. Every time Hunter touched her, he stripped her a bit more. After every encounter, she didn\u2019t think he could leave her any more exposed or feeling any more raw. And she was always wrong.</p><p>What would another three days with Hunter do to her psyche? Or a lifetime with him? How long before she became his doormat? He pushed, and shoved, and demanded. Then, when she was defenseless, he brought in the steely tenderness, digging his way into her soul. Where Hunter was concerned, she was so weak, some part of her ridiculously eager to submit. Already he was so firmly entrenched, it scared her to death. Kata feared that she\u2019d never be able to get him out of her heart.</p><p>She tried to crawl into a ball\u2014but couldn\u2019t while strapped to the table. More sobs wracked her chest, overpowering, unstoppable, painful. Hunter watched her with all-seeing eyes, petting her with a soothing touch. She couldn\u2019t give all of herself like this to him day after day, year after year, for a lifetime. He didn\u2019t understand what it meant to feel as if he\u2019d been broken down again and again. He\u2019d never know how this submission made her question her sense of self... and whether she\u2019d have anything left if she kept giving to him like this.</p><p>But after giving her the most stunning sex of her life, she had no way to hide.</p><p>\u201cKata, honey,\u201d he whispered in her ear.</p><p>She curled up tighter and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWas it too powerful?\u201d</p><p>For her, yes. Always.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she managed to gasp out through another sob. \u201cJust stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He trailed a soothing hand down her back, then back up, up, until he reached the cuff at the corner of the padded table. With a quick click, one unfastened. He repeated the same movement with the other. Then her wrists were free. With Hunter still buried deep inside her, he drew her back onto his lap, rubbing her forearms and wrists, caring for her gently. Kata refused to look over her shoulder at him, but she could feel his gaze delving past the curtain of her hair. No escaping the feel of his cock stiffening inside her so-sensitive pussy once more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t share herself again now and not bare her soul to him. God, there\u2019d be nothing left.</p><p>Gathering her strength, she pushed away from him and rose to her feet. Her legs had all the strength of rubber and gave way beneath her. She crumpled back to the ottoman.</p><p>Hunter sighed and lifted her onto his lap. \u201cStop, Kata. Let me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>He carried her to the bedroom again. She tensed against the sublime pleasure of feeling his skin against hers. Part of her wanted him to go . . . but the thought of not being with him again shot panic through her.</p> <p>That was a bitter pill to swallow. She sobbed harder.</p><p>Kissing the top of her head, he curled up on the bed and brought her onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cJ-just give me a minute alone,\u201d she begged. And she hated the pleading note in her voice, but he\u2019d stripped to the core. The only thing left was the scared girl inside so terrified of becoming her mother.</p><p>Hunter hesitated, then eased out from under her. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. I\u2019m not going far.\u201d</p><p>A precious few moments passed, but Kata couldn\u2019t center her thoughts or calm herself in the silence. Moments later, he returned, only to sit her on his lap again, then reach for the tray he\u2019d placed on the bedside table.</p> <p>\u201cOpen,\u201d he demanded, placing a pastry with cinnamon and brown sugar right in front of her mouth.</p><p>She shook her head. Sugar wasn\u2019t going to solve her problem.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had a meal in hours. Eat. No arguments.\u201d</p><p>Could the man never listen? \u201cI don\u2019t need this many calories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the time I\u2019m done with you, you will. Open up.\u201d</p><p>Exasperated, Kata opened, accepted the bite\u2014and nearly groaned at the flaky, sweet texture of the pastry as it crossed her tongue. She reached out to grab it and feed herself. He pulled back.</p> <p>\u201cNo, honey. Take from me what you need.\u201d</p><p>Eat from his hand? She finally looked up, met his so-blue eyes, questioning. Yes, that\u2019s exactly what he meant. He intended to feed her himself. The notion both thrilled and disturbed her. How intimate. How frightening that he was encouraging her dependence on him.</p><p>Even with those thoughts running through her head, Kata felt oddly contented to be so close to him, so connected. She couldn\u2019t find the will to say no. He coaxed her into eating the whole thing, then followed with some grapes and a banana, taking a few bites for himself.</p><p>With his free hand, he stroked her back slowly, tenderly, dusting sweet kisses on her shoulder and neck. Finally, she relaxed, her disquiet waning under exhaustion.</p><p>Then he propped a finger beneath her chin and drew his mouth to hers. \u201cYou\u2019re incredible. When I\u2019m with you, I feel like the luckiest man in the world.\u201d</p><p>And she felt like the people of Troy must have with the Trojan horse, succumbing to a handsome, seemingly harmless beast, only to realize that she was under a siege that would only end in total surrender.</p><p>He fitted his mouth over hers. At first, she stiffened, but he kissed her long and deep and slow until her body went liquid. Until she sagged against him. Then he took her by the hand and led her to the shower.</p><p>After setting her under the steaming spray and easing into the small stall, he refused to let her wash herself. He did it in reverent silence. With a pounding heart and hollow, aching eyes, Kata watched as he kissed her shoulders, washed her breasts, soaped her backside.</p> <p>\u201cI know today has been a lot to take in. I pushed you hard. But I\u2019m so proud of the way you took everything I gave you. And you\u2019re still here with me, the same you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t feel the same. Her body hummed, her mind was blank. Emotions swirled in a giant morass that terrified her, but telling Hunter that would only start an argument that she was too overwrought to win. Instead, she stood still as he shampooed her hair, then knelt to wash her feet, calves, thighs, pussy.</p><p>He lingered on the last, toying, teasing with his fingers until Kata had to brace herself against the wall to avoid falling. She bit her lip hard against the rise of pleasure, but nothing could stop it\u2014or him\u2014despite the knowledge that, if she came again, there would be virtually no part of her soul he hadn\u2019t claimed.</p><p>As if he sensed that, he knelt at her feet and lifted her foot to the shower bench, leaving her pussy open to him.</p><p>\u201cHunter,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo holding yourself back from me. You\u2019re so wet and sweet. I need all of you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have an opportunity to say another word. He set his mouth on her so-sensitive flesh, coaxing her arousal until he surged past her fear, until she knew only the feel of his tongue flirting with her clawing need for ecstasy, until she craved only the orgasm he dangled just beyond her reach.</p><p>He slid through her wet folds, tearing through her defenses. She couldn\u2019t help it; her hands slid across his scalp, trying to hold him in place. But he didn\u2019t need to be forced. That wicked tongue of his kept driving her up, hotter, higher, until she\u2019d have given her soul for release.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she sobbed. \u201cYes . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear you scream, honey. Come.\u201d</p><p>As if the words were some mysterious catalyst, the climax pounded over her, flattening her. She grabbed him, her nails making half-moons on his shoulders as her deafening cry resounded through the shower. And still, he lapped at her, wringing every possible tingle and twinge out of the orgasm.</p><p>Then he sat her on the corner bench as he washed and rinsed himself quickly, then helped her out, drying her off like a child, running the comb through her wet hair carefully.</p><p>Kata watched him, watched herself, in the steamy mirror. He looked so big, capable, and content caring for her. So utterly reassured, almost at peace. She looked like a refugee from a war zone, one of those women who had survived but had seen too much.</p><p>Once finished, he led her back to the bed, checking his phone. \u201cWe have another five hours before your mother\u2019s release. You look exhausted.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Sleep. She could escape this overwrought feeling when she slept. Eagerly, she curled up on the bed, rolled to the far side, tucked the sheet beneath her chin.</p><p>With a soft grip on her arm, Hunter rolled her to her back again. Without any warning, he slid his thigh between hers, his body over her own. Then he plunged the iron length of his cock inside her, all the way to the hilt in a single stroke.</p><p>That quickly, her body flashed electric with need.</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d she panted.</p><p>Even as she asked, she parted her thighs wider, threw her arms around him, and clasped him close. Plunging deep, he gave her more of the powerful dominance that her mind could no longer fight. Pleasure soared inside her.</p><p>\u201cYes, again. And again. I will always give you more than you think you can handle. And I have no doubt that you will always thrill me with your surrender and your strength.\u201d</p><p>Shock pinged through her. Before she could think of anything to say or any way to stop him from dismantling her even more, Hunter proceeded to undo her with one deep, destructive stroke after another.</p><p>From his very first thrust, moans fell from her lips, and Kata couldn\u2019t stop them. They weren\u2019t the pretty kind, not from any normal sexual soundtrack. These were animal pleas, punctuated by her nails digging their way into his back and thrusting up at him wildly.</p><p>Hunter held her hips down, controlling her movement, forcing her to take the torture of his slow thrusts. Every inch of him glided over swollen, sensitive flesh as he entered her repeatedly, each stroke ending with a nudge against a spot high and deep inside her. She jolted, gasped, clamped down on him.</p><p>\u201cAh, there. Perfect, honey. That feel good?\u201d</p><p>It did, and he damn well knew it.</p><p>He withdrew, then slid back in to rub over that same nerve-laden spot. \u201cI asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>As he pulled back, her body clung, trying to keep him deeper, the intimacy of the act more stark and stunning than ever. Robbing her of the last of her feeble defenses.</p><p>Kata pressed her lips together and closed her eyes to shut him out. If she didn\u2019t, she would say or do anything Hunter wanted.</p><p>\u201cI want to make love to you, Kata, sweet and slow. But if you keep pushing me, I won\u2019t hesitate to punish you again.\u201d</p><p>Punish. Spank. Sensually torture. He\u2019d drive her to the brink of sanity, then throw her into a black chasm of pleasure so overwhelming that the shelter of his arms were her only chance of survival. But his touch came with a price: her soul. He was fast becoming an addiction, and she didn\u2019t know how to break free of something she wanted so desperately. Or what she\u2019d do when she could no longer cope.</p><p>\u201cIt feels so good,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He caressed her face. \u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, knowing he would strip her raw once more, Kata did. As their gazes connected, he surged deep inside the clasp of her body again, prodding that hungry spot.</p><p>No way could she hold back her needy moan.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sweet, the way your pussy tightens on me while your eyes are all but begging. I look forward to taking every opportunity to push your limits, strengthen our bond.\u201d</p><p>With his methodical thrusts, Hunter continued to nudge the nerve-laden spot inside her again and again, at a slow pace that set her on fire. She mewled and clasped him tight, panting. God, she was close.</p><p>\u201cCome, honey. Don\u2019t hold anything back.\u201d</p><p>His whisper filtered down her ear, vibrating inside her. Pleasure gripped her, settling with a dark throb between her legs. The pulses started, shaking her body, bursting her wide open. A guttural roar sounded around her, ringing in her ears, and Kata realized she\u2019d made the sound. Hunter fucked into her again, and the need bubbled over, jolting her entire body. Again, she screamed. A moment later, he spilled inside her with a possessive roar.</p><p>His stare locked on hers, and their breathing synced up, foreheads touching. Hunter was buried deep, as if he\u2019d always be a part of her. Kata had never felt closer to another human being in her life\u2014and it scared the hell out of her.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he murmured and kissed the tip of her nose before quietly withdrawing.</p><p>Kata closed her eyes. Minutes later, she felt a warm washcloth between her legs, soothing, cleaning. Exhaustion beat at her as she watched him caring for her so intimately. It, like him, was simply too overwhelming.</p><p>When he curled up beside her, spooning his body against hers, Kata knew that she should fight, not give him every part of herself.</p><p>A voice in her head whispered that it may already be too late.</p><p>AFTER a few hours of sleep, Kata and Hunter returned to the hospital. The doctor was in emergency surgery and hadn\u2019t yet signed her mother\u2019s discharge papers. Kata waited impatiently, wincing every time she looked at Mam\u00e1 lying amongst her sheets. Despite the fact that her color looked a bit better today, she still appeared frail.</p><p>Finally, Hunter tracked down the nurse and pushed a few buttons until he\u2019d arranged the release. Now, Kata looked down as he entwined his hand with her own. Even now, she didn\u2019t know if she should grab on tight or push him away.</p><p>THEY pulled up in front of Mam\u00e1 and Gordon\u2019s house near dusk. The lights inside weren\u2019t on, except the alternating flare and darkness of the TV visible through the front window. So, her stepfather was home. Yippee.</p><p>Kata wanted to curl into a ball and sleep for a month. For her mother, she had to deal.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, Mam\u00e1?\u201d Kata asked, turning in her seat.</p><p>Lying down in the back of the Jeep, her mother smiled. She looked pale, her cheer forced. \u201cYou worry too much, Mija. The doctor said I will be fine. All the medicine, it has helped.\u201d</p><p>But the doctors also prescribed a great deal of rest, and Kata knew she wouldn\u2019t get any here with Gordon. \u201cPlease stay with Mari for a few days. Let her wait on you. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe discussed this. She is busy with Carlos and the boys. I will not trouble her. Besides, I belong at home. Gordon will be waiting.\u201d</p><p>Damn it, what did she see in that manipulative bastard? \u201cYou need someone to take care of you now, Mam\u00e1.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly, I will be fine.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she caught Hunter frowning in question. He didn\u2019t understand why she was fighting so hard to keep her mother from returning home. She\u2019d explained Gordon, but . . . maybe it would compute once he saw the asshole in action. After the way Hunter had fed her from his own hand and bathed her himself, she didn\u2019t think Gordon\u2019s neglect would go over well.</p><p>She should be happy that Hunter would finally see the sort of woman she feared becoming and why. Maybe he\u2019d pull back, give her space. But her immediate concern was that he and Gordon would come to blows.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d she asked her mother as Hunter stopped the Jeep and jumped out.</p><p>When her mother nodded, Kata opened her door, then gathered her mom\u2019s luggage. Mam\u00e1 tried to get to her feet. Hunter was having none of that. Instead, he bent and picked her mother up as if she weighed nothing.</p><p>\u201cMr. Edgington, I am older and not quite so healthy as you, but I can make my way up the walk. You need not trouble yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy name is Hunter. It\u2019s no trouble, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>He glanced her way. Despite the tension between them, Kata couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cYou won\u2019t win this argument, Mam\u00e1. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>The three of them made their way to the front door. Kata fished out her key, knowing that Gordon would only be more annoyed with them\u2014and take it out on her mother\u2014if they made him get off the sofa to let them in. He was a selfish prick who\u2019d do anything to assure his own comfort. Her mother was a convenience for him, like an electric razor or a cell phone. And he behaved this way because Mam\u00e1 was too lost to stand up to him.</p><p>Kata wondered if, after months or years of Hunter\u2019s intensity, she\u2019d be like her mother, resigned to taking the path of least resistance.</p> <p>She pushed the front door open. Hunter followed her inside, her mother tight against his broad chest. She looked slightly gray, and it scared the hell out of Kata to think of leaving her here. What if Mam\u00e1 didn\u2019t recover because she didn\u2019t get any rest? Hunter had hired a nurse, which was a relief, but Kata wished she could be here herself to oversee her mother\u2019s recovery.</p><p>Not for the first time, Kata damned whoever was trying to kill her. The asshole had shoved her into Hunter\u2019s arms and now away from the one place that duty and love dictated she be. It fucking pissed her off.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your bedroom, ma\u2019am?\u201d Hunter asked her mother.</p><p>\u201cThrough the living room and at the end of the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d Hunter nodded and made his way through the foyer, into the living room. \u201cYour nurse\u2019s name is Becka. She\u2019ll be here in an hour. She\u2019s picking up your prescriptions along the way. We\u2019ll stay with you until she arrives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet of you. You never said, how do you and Kata know each other?\u201d</p><p>Kata\u2019s heart stuttered. She\u2019d asked Hunter to keep their marriage quiet. Now wasn\u2019t the time to rattle her mother. And really, why bother, when Kata wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d remain his wife past Sunday?</p><p>\u201cIs that you, Carlotta?\u201d Gordon called over the blare of the TV, his feet hanging over the arm of the sofa.</p><p>Kata caught an unfortunate glimpse of the weasel lounging flat on the couch in a T-shirt and his boxers. His salt-and-pepper hair was askew, his pale blue eyes as washed out as the rest of his face.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear.\u201d Her mother sounded breathy. Was she merely tired and winded, or actually anxious to see this bastard?</p><p>Gordon grunted. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p> <p>The man could crawl on Kata\u2019s last nerve faster than anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s not her fault. We had to wait for her discharge papers. Which you would know, if you\u2019d bothered to pick up your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKata . . . Mija, don\u2019t.\u201d Her mother pleaded, meeting her stare around Hunter\u2019s bulging biceps.</p><p>\u201cShut up, girl. I work hard to keep this roof over your mother\u2019s head and food in her belly. All I ask for when I come home is a little peace and relaxation. I already called someone to do the yard work while she was laid up. Back off.\u201d</p><p>As Hunter passed Gordon\u2019s line of sight, her stepfather jackknifed into a sitting position and scowled. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>Kata knew she should leave it alone. Knew it . . . but couldn\u2019t. \u201cSomeone willing to help Mam\u00e1, since you\u2019re too fucking lazy and self-absorbed to even put her to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBed? You\u2019re treating her like an invalid.\u201d Gordon stood, his brows drawn together in incredulity. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly seven o\u2019clock. I\u2019ve been waiting for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Buckley, your wife is in no position to be out of bed for any reason. Kata, hand him the hospital\u2019s instructions.\u201d</p><p>With an angry shrug, she reached into her purse, then tossed them at her stepfather. \u201cHere you go. It says in black and white that she should get as much rest as possible for the next week. Hunter found a nurse who will come in and take care of Mam\u00e1\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo strangers in my house. Carlotta doesn\u2019t need coddling.\u201d He turned to Hunter. \u201cPut my wife down. She can limp to the kitchen from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to bed.\u201d Hunter\u2019s voice rang with steel. \u201cYou\u2019re a capable man who has two arms and two legs. You should be the one cooking.\u201d</p><p>Kata zinged a glance at Hunter. He sounded seriously pissed off. She had to repress a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t tell me what to do in my house,\u201d Gordon snarled at Hunter, then sneered in her direction. \u201cKatalina, no nurse. You\u2019ll stay and take care of your mother and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d And she absolutely would not tell Gordon why. If he could write Mam\u00e1\u2019s pneumonia off as a mere cold, Kata knew he\u2019d never believe that someone was trying to kill her.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t?\u201d He poked a thumb in Hunter\u2019s direction. \u201cBecause you can\u2019t stop spreading those fat thighs long enough to take care of your own mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGordon!\u201d her mother protested.</p><p>Beside Kata, Hunter\u2019s entire body tensed. He sent Gordon a murderous glare. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever talk to my wife that way again. I don\u2019t usually bother threatening. But you\u2019re part of Kata\u2019s family, so I\u2019ll give you one warning: Show her respect, or I will pound you into the ground until you whimper for mercy. Don\u2019t expect me to have any.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, her stepfather apparently found his self-preservation instinct and stepped back.</p><p>Her mother gasped. \u201cWife? You got married, Mija?\u201d</p><p>Kata closed her eyes. So much for laying low and seeing how the relationship panned out.</p><p>\u201cMam\u00e1, let\u2019s get you settled. We\u2019ll talk later. This is too taxing for you right now.\u201d</p><p>Hunter marched out of the room, into the long hall, her mother wrapped in his arms, then pushed open the first door on the left, entering the room that used to be hers.</p><p>\u201cMy room is at the end of the hall,\u201d her mother reminded politely.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. But perhaps you\u2019d be more comfortable in a room of your own. And you wouldn\u2019t disturb your husband in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do cough loudly.\u201d She patted his shoulder. \u201cYou married my Kata?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, ma\u2019am. And I love her.\u201d</p><p>Mam\u00e1 turned her head to smile at Kata. \u201cI do not know when this happened. I want all the details later, but he seems to care for you very much, Mija.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, her mother would say that.</p><p>\u201cMam\u00e1, you need to rest. I\u2019ll tell you everything soon.\u201d Fat chance.</p><p>Inside what was now the guest room, Kata ran around Hunter and pulled down the bed. Once the sheets were smoothed and the pillows fluffed, he set Mam\u00e1 down and tucked her in like a child. Her mother fell back with a sigh, head lolling back into an exhausted sleep.</p><p>Kata sent him a grateful look. Hunter might strip away every one of her emotional defenses mercilessly, but he\u2019d been true to his word in helping her mother. He\u2019d even put Gordon in his place. As soon as they left, her stepfather would berate her mother and refuse the nurse entrance; that had to be dealt with. But the moment Hunter had handed Gordon his ass had been so sweet.</p><p>\u201cWe should let her rest,\u201d Hunter commented. \u201cI have something to ask you.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed Kata\u2019s hand and led her out of the guest room, then down the hall to the master. The second he closed the door behind him, he clenched his jaw, obviously holding on to his temper by a thread. \u201cWhy is your mother still with this asshole?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. He saw the bastard her mother had married, but his question implied that he didn\u2019t understand why Mam\u00e1 hadn\u2019t removed herself from the situation. Did he not see how dependent her mother had become, see everything Kata feared?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to get her to leave. So has my sister. Trust me.\u201d She sighed. \u201cNow that Gordon has stripped her of any semblance of a real life, taking care of him is her only purpose. He\u2019s robbed her of her job, her friends, and her independence. He\u2019s taken her selfworth. I\u2019ve tried to talk her into moving in with me. She won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful woman. Plenty young enough to have a full life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, but she doesn\u2019t see it that way. And whenever I talk to her about it, she always says that she\u2019s happy. I know it\u2019s a lie. She\u2019s afraid of being a burden to me. Besides, Gordon would only find her and drag her home. He\u2019s not about to do without his personal maid, cook, and sex slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she needs to go elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Kata bit her lip. He was right. \u201cI\u2019ll call Joaquin again. Mari can\u2019t keep Gordon away from my mom, but Joaquin can. Hell, Gordon would never find him. But I\u2019m not sure I can, either.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head. \u201cIf he\u2019s undercover, he may not be able to break free. If you want this asshole out of her life, I know a place where she\u2019ll be waited on hand and foot. Gordon will never find her, so he won\u2019t be able to coerce her back. Anything more permanent will be up to her, but I can at least give her the chance for a clean start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will you take her?</p><p>\u201cYou leave that to me.\u201d</p><p>That would require a lot of trust, but Hunter spent his life protecting people. He wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to her mother. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll accept a stranger\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me worry about that. Pack her bag. If your prick of a stepfather is going to work her to death and fail to care for her, then I don\u2019t want your mother here another three minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d Kata gasped. \u201cGordon will give you twenty kinds of hell.\u201d</p><p>Hunter snorted. \u201cThe little pissant can try.\u201d</p><p>Kata hesitated. \u201cShe may not want to go. The one time I convinced her to leave him three years ago, I helped her save up enough money to buy her own car and a prepaid cell phone. We packed her bags ... and about three hours out of town, she was crying too hard to see the road and got in a car accident. It shattered most of the bones in her left shin and foot.\u201d Kata swore she wouldn\u2019t cry. Swore it, but hot tears stabbed her aching eyes anyway. God, how did she have any more tears to shed? \u201cHer surgery and recovery lasted for months. I took care of her. Gordon all but refused. After all, she would never have been hurt if she hadn\u2019t been trying to leave him. Mam\u00e1 walks with a limp now. He constantly tells her that she\u2019s lucky he\u2019s benevolent enough to take care of damaged goods.\u201d</p><p>Hunter clenched his fists. \u201cShit-sucking pond scum. Don\u2019t worry about your mother. I\u2019ll convince her that leaving temporarily for her recovery is in everyone\u2019s best interest, even Gordon\u2019s. By the time she\u2019s better, she\u2019ll have no interest in returning. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>As tenacious as Hunter was, Kata knew exactly who would win that battle. Hope for her mother\u2019s well-being filled her. With Hunter on her side, Gordon would have a fight on his hands. \u201cYou\u2019d do that for my mam\u00e1?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for you. Anything for you, honey.\u201d He placed a soft kiss on her lips.</p><p>Looking into Hunter\u2019s blue, blue eyes, she knew he meant every word he said. He might demand so much that she feared she\u2019d give away her soul. But she knew with every cell in her body that he would help her mother begin a better life. If Kata hadn\u2019t already suspected that some part of her was perilously close to being in love with Hunter, this sealed the deal.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>HUNTER drove down the highway, the Jeep sliding through the night as Kata\u2019s mother slept in the backseat. After Kata packed a quick bag for Carlotta, and he threatened Gordon within an inch of his life, Hunter had called the nurse to cancel her services, assured Kata\u2019s mother this was the best course of action until she recovered, then picked up her prescriptions and began down the road.</p><p>Kata stared out the window into the nothingness of the night, looking bleak and exhausted and lost.</p><p>He held in a curse. She\u2019d had a tough day, and he hadn\u2019t made it easy on her. In fact, he realized that he\u2019d fucked up. After watching Carlotta allow Gordon to treat her as if her wants and wishes were of no consequence, Hunter understood Kata\u2019s fears a whole lot more. Before today, he\u2019d comprehended on a theoretical level that her stepfather was a controlling dirtbag, but it hadn\u2019t really clicked that Carlotta simply let it happen\u2014and that\u2019s what Kata feared becoming.</p><p>Kata\u2019s tart, sexy vivacity had intrigued him. Coupled with her natural submissiveness, she\u2019d drawn him in like no other. Though she\u2019d tried repeatedly to explain, he\u2019d stopped thinking with the head above his shoulders. Wasn\u2019t that biting him in the ass now? The confidence he\u2019d felt in their relationship after making love to her this morning was gone now that he\u2019d seen her mother and Gordon in action.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure your father won\u2019t mind the company?\u201d his wife asked into the inky silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hunter glanced at Carlotta sleeping in the rearview mirror. \u201cNow that he\u2019s home from his latest mission, he\u2019ll welcome the company, honey.\u201d</p><p>In fact, they might be good for one another. At the very least, they would make steadfast friends, and no one could ever have too many of those.</p><p>\u201cI hate to spring this on him. I\u2019m sure he has better things to do than babysit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Colonel needs to slow down, and this will give him a reason. He has plenty of operatives willing to do his work for him, and he continues to globetrot to the shitholes of the world, chasing an adrenaline rush.\u201d He had nothing else to come home to\u2014and hadn\u2019t since he\u2019d let his wife walk out the door.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Kata finally turned to him, grabbed his hand, and squeezed. \u201cFor . . . back there. For putting Gordon in his place. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Hunter wished he could do more. \u201cHe deserved it. I wanted to pound his face into the ground, but he\u2019s the kind of weasel who would only call the police. And the entire incident would upset your mother, I suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much. I can tell the restraint cost you.\u201d A faint smile lifted her grim face. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Sliding his thumb across her soft hand, Hunter gathered his thoughts, then sent her a solemn stare. \u201cI hope you know I\u2019d never treat you like Gordon.\u201d</p><p>Kata swallowed, looked away. \u201cI know you\u2019d never purposely demean me or want me to feel weak. But, like Gordon, you want me all to yourself. Eventually, I fear that I\u2019d . . . let you have your way.\u201d</p> <p>Just as he\u2019d suspected. \u201cI\u2019m possessive, honey. I don\u2019t deny it. But I\u2019d never want you isolated and unhappy. And if I ever had so little respect for you, I\u2019d end the marriage. But I suspect you\u2019d do that long before matters became that bad.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and pressed her lips together, fighting tears. \u201cYou\u2019re not understanding. I\u2019m not afraid of you; I\u2019m afraid of me. A part of me would love giving myself over to you totally, the way my mother seems to enjoy at times. I won\u2019t lie, I love having your attention. You make me feel special. But your intensity terrifies me. And after sex . . . I\u2019m always afraid of how much I\u2019ve given you. I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I lost my spine for good.\u201d</p><p>Kata knew that he wasn\u2019t like Gordon, but Hunter had no fucking idea how to assure her that she wasn\u2019t like her mother.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a lot of time left with her; what they had was ticking down quickly. As much as he wanted to give her the full-court press and totally make her his in every way, she wasn\u2019t ready. As afraid as she was\u2014clearly with cause\u2014he wondered if she ever would be.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t give up.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens between us sexually has no reflection on the rest of our life. I have at least another six months on this contract. Another eight years in the navy if I want to retire with benefits. The reality is, I\u2019d be leaving you in charge of our lives when I\u2019m overseas. I couldn\u2019t do that unless I know you\u2019re strong and capable, which you are. You\u2019d never, ever let me take away your job, your friends, your car, your phone, your free will . . . And I would never ask you to give those up. Would I like you to have a safer job? Yes. Would I like you to avoid Ben? Yes. Would I force you to do without either for the rest of your life? Never.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I have this insane urge to please you that I\u2019ve never felt. I don\u2019t want to give up either right now, but eventually . . .\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>The shame in her voice made him ache. He didn\u2019t see her ever giving up what she needed in life. But she had to learn that. He had to help her. Hunter gripped the wheel, his mind racing. He\u2019d have to think on that. Maybe more information would help him know which way to turn.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you ask Ben for a m\u00e9nage for your birthday?\u201d\u2019</p><p>Kata blinked, the question clearly surprising her. \u201cI didn\u2019t, per se. I told him that it was one of my fantasies. This was months before my birthday. He told me that he\u2019d try to make it happen. Then you showed up and . . .\u201d</p><p>Hunter winced. He\u2019d stomped in the middle and busted up the situation.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . .\u201d She shrugged, looked out the window again. \u201cNot important.\u201d</p><p>But something told him it was. \u201cWe have a couple of hours to kill until we reach my dad\u2019s, and your mom is going to sleep for a while, since we gave her that codeine cough medicine. If it\u2019s important to you, it\u2019s important to me. Please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow, a \u2018please\u2019 from you?\u201d she teased, then sighed. \u201cI guess I should have known Ben wouldn\u2019t really understand, and it\u2019s probably a dumb fantasy . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did Ben not understand? He arranged the m\u00e9nage. I\u2019m the one who derailed it.\u201d And he\u2019d taken great pleasure doing it.</p><p>She squirmed in her seat. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a m\u00e9nage I wanted. I had this fantasy of a man I was with . . . giving me to someone else. Like, demanding that I be with someone of his choosing because he thought I was so sexy and amazing that he wanted to show me off, and I wanted to please him so badly that I let him. It\u2019s dumb.\u201d</p><p>Shock pinged through his system. The depth of her submissive nature stunned him. \u201cNot if that\u2019s what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>She might fight his commands because she wasn\u2019t accustomed to being under anyone\u2019s control and didn\u2019t know where and how to draw the line, but to learn that she wanted to be so utterly owned by a man that she could be shared . . . That was into slave territory. Hunter had no interest in sharing, but her words confirmed everything he believed about her true desires. She saw submission as a weakness, but she needed this on a core level. Somehow, she must see that succumbing to her needs didn\u2019t make her a doormat. But understanding that could only happen when she accepted herself and learned to trust him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never going to happen, so it doesn\u2019t matter. Let\u2019s just drop it.\u201d She withdrew her hand and looked away as if she suddenly found the dark, empty road fascinating.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you had this fantasy?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>Hunter turned a stern glower her way. \u201cI expect an answer now, or I will stop this car and take you over my knee. I don\u2019t care if passersby see.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. Her breath came more rapidly. Jesus, she was already aroused. So was he.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ve had the thought for about seven years. I read a book once where a man shared his girlfriend with his best friend, and . . .\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt just stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you excited about the scene Ben had set for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing touched by two guys at once was something I\u2019d always been curious about. But in my head, since he\u2019d arranged it, he was supposed to take control. But he didn\u2019t. He was too drunk, and that\u2019s not his style. Then you totally overwhelmed me, and I forgot about the silly fantasy. I got lost in you and your demands. So that\u2019s that. Can we drop the subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d For now.</p><p>\u201cTell me why you agreed to Ben\u2019s proposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me you were very hot.\u201d Hunter shrugged. \u201cBut you were more than I expected. For years, I\u2019ve wanted a submissive woman I hadn\u2019t met in a club. So many of them are jaded or head cases or so damaged that they want to be abused. I wanted to meet a strong woman . . . with kink. I never imagined that I\u2019d meet Mrs. Perfect-for-Me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wanly. \u201cWho would have thought we\u2019d wind up here? Amazing that a week ago I didn\u2019t know you even existed.\u201d</p><p>Ditto that. She\u2019d changed his life completely. Hunter didn\u2019t want it any other way. He wouldn\u2019t ask if she regretted marrying him; it was too soon for that. But he could tell her how he felt and hope that she understood.</p><p>\u201cI am glad we\u2019re here. You\u2019re everything I\u2019ve wanted.\u201d</p><p>She turned to him with a furrowed brow and an expression he could only call puzzled amazement. \u201cYou\u2019re not afraid of anything\u2014marriage, my stepfather, my emotional baggage. If I were a braver woman . . .\u201d She smiled sadly, then sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou are a brave woman. Submission takes courage, and you\u2019ve given me more raw honesty in mere days than some subs manage to ever give. Don\u2019t give up on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be ready to handle this. It would be better if you signed the papers.\u201d</p><p>Hell no. Never in a fucking million years. \u201cBetter for who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of us, but you\u2019re not listening to me.\u201d Kata looked away.</p><p>Because she was wrong.</p><p>A ballad turned low filled some of the silence. Hunter had never paid that much attention to music. Now, he felt the singer\u2019s maudlin ache down to his bones. He had hungered for Kata\u2019s touch for a long, lonely time without knowing it. He did need her love. What the hell was he going to do if he couldn\u2019t convince her to believe in them before he left?</p><p>\u201cWhat was our wedding like?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>Despite the turn of his thoughts, Hunter smiled. \u201cLoud. Crazy. Christi and Mick married right before us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThe couple we met in the bar. During the ceremony, the officiant kept rubbing his eyes, complaining that he\u2019d pulled a double shift with a hangover. His assistant turned the music up loud, either to keep him awake or annoy the hell out of him.\u201d He chuckled again. \u201cElvis tunes at a Vegas wedding. How clich\u00e9 is that? But I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>Kata didn\u2019t say a word, just stared out the windshield, as if she were imagining the scene.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cDid you have a dream wedding in mind?\u201d</p><p>Her expression turned wistful. \u201cI think most women do. I wanted to wear white and look beautiful. I wanted my brother to walk me down the aisle, with my mom and sister beaming in the first row. I wanted to hold a big bouquet of white roses, have a long train, and meet a man at the altar who\u2019s crazy in love with me.\u201d</p><p>If he could keep them together, Hunter vowed that, someday, he\u2019d make that dream come true. \u201cAt least you got the last part right, honey.\u201d He reached out, grabbed her hand. \u201cI love you. I know you have feelings for me, too, that scare you, but I think we can work everything out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? We\u2019re running from a killer, my mother is sick, we don\u2019t see eye to eye, and what we have scares me half to death. You\u2019re leaving town and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hunter leaned over and planted his lips on hers, silencing her. \u201cWindow dressing, all of it. We\u2019re going to find the killer. Your mother will recover. We\u2019ll get along just fine once you realize we\u2019re perfect for each other. There\u2019s no reason for you to be scared. As for me leaving, yeah. But I\u2019ll be back. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p><p>She gnawed on her lip. \u201cHey, is that the golden arches up there? I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>A not-so-subtle change of subject. But pushing her now would be counterproductive. Four days wasn\u2019t a long time for anyone to fall in love, be comfortable with a new sexual lifestyle, and overcome years of relationship fear. She needed time. Hunter glanced at the clock, then stifled his urge to curse. He shipped out in seventy-two hours. They\u2019d come a long damn way in a short period of time. And he prayed they\u2019d make it . . .</p><p>But his hope was beginning to dim.</p><p>KATA swallowed nervously as Hunter ushered her mother into the darkened house on the outskirts of Tyler, Texas. As they entered the classic southern brick house with large windows, a tall shadow fell over the threshold, same height and build as Hunter. Same haircut, same mien. This man also looked handsome as hell, but drawn, almost haunted. Would Hunter look like that in twenty years if she left and he never found love again?</p><p>\u201cSon.\u201d The man relaxed, as if he\u2019d just identified the person entering his house as a non-threat. \u201cGlad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColonel, this is Mrs. Buckley.\u201d He nodded to Mam\u00e1, who looked so tiny in his arms.</p><p>\u201cCarlotta,\u201d her mother smothered a cough. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to intrude. If this is inconvenient\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. Call me Caleb.\u201d He addressed Hunter. \u201cSet her on the sofa. I\u2019ll take her up to her room when she\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>The Colonel even sounded like Hunter, a bit gruff, very to the point. Kata lingered in the doorway. Was leaving her mother here really a good idea? It was doubtful that Gordon would find her or fuck with someone as intimidating as the Colonel, but could Mam\u00e1 recover with a terse stranger hovering?</p><p>\u201cWill do, sir,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>As soon as he moved to do his father\u2019s bidding, she sensed more than saw the Colonel\u2019s gaze zero in on her. Kata\u2019s heart stuttered. Though she couldn\u2019t see his face clearly through the shadows, something about his stance said he wasn\u2019t pleased.</p><p>The Colonel stepped forward finally, the foyer lights spilling across his face. God . . . it really was like looking at Hunter in twenty years. Tawny hair, though his had sprinkles of gray. Blue, blue eyes. Attractive, hard, demanding. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello, sir. I\u2019m Kata.\u201d She held out her hand, praying it didn\u2019t tremble.</p><p>Silently, she berated herself. If she and Hunter weren\u2019t going to remain married for long, it hardly mattered whether his father liked her or not. But that logic didn\u2019t smother her anxiety.</p><p>\u201cHunter\u2019s bride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d At least for the moment.</p> <p>He took her hand and stared hard. Damn it, there was no way she would allow herself to feel inferior under that assessing glare. She lifted her chin and met his gaze, refusing to cower.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got spine, son,\u201d he called across the room to Hunter. \u201cI approve.\u201d</p><p>Finally, a stiff smile crossed the man\u2019s face, as if he knew she\u2019d been holding her breath, then he guided her into a cozy den dominated by a chocolate brown sectional and a huge flat screen. Kata relaxed, but wondered . . . what had the Colonel expected?</p><p>Hunter settled her mother on the sofa and wrapped a blanket around her. The TV flickered mutely in the background. Kata sat beside her mother, holding her frail hand. Carlotta drifted off almost instantly. Between the illness and the medication, she was exhausted.</p><p>\u201cClearly your mother needs rest.\u201d The Colonel stared at her mother. \u201cI\u2019ll make certain she gets it.\u201d</p> <p>Mam\u00e1 didn\u2019t like being idle, but in this case, it was good for her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He turned to Hunter with a scowl. \u201cYou say her husband wanted her to make dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Was cranky that she hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucker,\u201d the Colonel said under his breath, then glanced her way. \u201cExcuse my language, but my opinion of him stands.\u201d</p><p>Kata shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ll get no arguments from me. He is a fucker. I hate him.\u201d</p><p>The Colonel threw his head back and laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely not like those twits you used to spend time with. Logan still hasn\u2019t learned his lesson. He\u2019d been here all of five minutes when he started sexting with some local hussy begging for a dose of pain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive it a rest, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Kata whirled at the new voice from the edge of the room. He had the same piercing blue eyes that his father and older brother possessed, the same large frame and intimidating stance. The similarities ended there. His hair was like midnight, his skin naturally bronzed. The cleft in his chin a throwback to another side of the family. This had to be Logan.</p><p>As if on cue, his phone beeped. He took it out, slid the keyboard open, and muttered as he typed. \u201cI said midnight. Natalie definitely needs a spanking.\u201d Then he pocketed his phone. \u201cHey, bro!\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, Hunter crossed the room. \u201cHow the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>The two brothers embraced and gave each other hearty slaps on the back. \u201cDamn fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be in Dallas.\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head, peering around his brother to stare at Kata. \u201cWouldn\u2019t miss meeting the woman who snared your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKimber called with news of your surprise wedding,\u201d the Colonel said wryly.</p> <p>Hunter rolled his eyes. \u201cOur little sister needs to keep her mouth shut. God, why doesn\u2019t she just send an announcement to the paper? Or plaster it all over Facebook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll do both as soon as she\u2019s recovered from childbirth,\u201d the Colonel assured. \u201cI saw her and Baby Caleb this afternoon. He\u2019s got a fine, healthy set of lungs. And seems to have the Edgington eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Logan threw in. \u201cPrecious baby. Deke is in love all over again.\u201d</p><p>Wincing, Hunter admitted, \u201cI meant to see Kimber and the baby this morning when I reached the hospital, but I got . . . sidetracked.\u201d</p><p>By the sight of her sitting on Ben\u2019s lap. Kata cringed. Being with Ben hadn\u2019t been emotional or sexual for her, but the incident had caused an argument, forced painful revelations\u2014and Hunter to miss seeing his newborn nephew.</p><p>Logan\u2019s phone beeped again. He glanced at the screen, raised a displeased brow, then pocketed his phone.</p><p>\u201cWho wants Chinese food?\u201d Hunter\u2019s brother asked, as if everyone in the room didn\u2019t know that some impatient woman was dying for his discipline.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Hunter agreed.</p><p>Twenty minutes and a straight-up whiskey later, Kata sat with the men at the round, utilitarian table, trying to stay awake. The eventful morning and hours in the car piled on top of the days\u2019 worth of vigil in the hospital were catching up with her. Resting her head on her hand, she closed her eyes. What she wouldn\u2019t give for a bed and eight uninterrupted hours of sleep.</p><p>Then Hunter mentioned the one subject guaranteed to rile all the other alpha males in the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, someone is trying to kill Kata?\u201d Logan glared at his brother.</p><p>Their father followed suit, eyeing her protectively. \u201cSuspects?\u201d</p><p>Oh, she didn\u2019t need more drama\u2014or testosterone\u2014right now. \u201cNo one has made a move against me since Sunday. Maybe . . . he\u2019s given up. Or the hired killer who died in jail took his secret to the grave. Or someone realized they had the wrong girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe they\u2019re hiring someone new as we speak. Between the fact that I\u2019ve tried to protect you and you haven\u2019t stayed in one place for too long, we\u2019ve been lucky,\u201d Hunter stated.</p><p>Kata wasn\u2019t feeling acquiescent. \u201cReally, who would be trying to do me in? So I pissed off a gang thug by issuing a warrant for his arrest. I\u2019m a probation officer,\u201d she supplied for Logan and the Colonel when they looked confused.</p><p>Hunter shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think a punk from some street gang has the kind of connections to hire an assassin with that kind of equipment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessional?\u201d The idea looked like it pissed Logan off.</p><p>\u201cAll the way.\u201d Hunter nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know about this guy, except that he\u2019s dead?\u201d her father-in-law asked.</p><p>\u201cNot much. He had no ink or affiliations that we could find. Guy was iced ten minutes after hitting lockup. They still haven\u2019t ID\u2019d the body.\u201d</p><p>Logan whistled. \u201cQuick work. Someone wanted their loose ends covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and fast.\u201d Hunter grabbed her hand, squeezed. \u201cJack knows all the local cops. As soon as they figure out who this John Doe is, he\u2019ll call me. Maybe that will be a clue. For now, Kata can\u2019t think of anyone trying to kill her, other than this Cortez Villarreal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s not adding up.\u201d Arms crossed, the Colonel stared her way.</p><p>He looked like he wanted to interrogate her, and frankly, Kata wasn\u2019t in the mood. \u201cDamn it, no one else has cause to be angry with me. I don\u2019t know who else would want me dead or why. If I did, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be keeping it to myself.\u201d</p><p>The Colonel raised a thick, tawny brow at her.</p><p>Hunter looked like he was repressing a smile. \u201cKata hasn\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep or a real meal in two days. This morning was particularly . . . demanding.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he didn\u2019t just say that, grinning with that cat-that-ate-thecanary expression. The second she got him alone, she was going to kick his ass. Still, she felt a flush crawl up her face.</p><p>As Logan\u2019s phone beeped with a new text message, he grinned broadly at them. Even the Colonel had a knowing look in his eye. Kata glared at Hunter, the rat bastard, then excused herself. No one laughed\u2014but they wanted to, she was sure.</p><p>She walked into the next room and sat on the sofa, taking Mam\u00e1\u2019s hand in hers. A second later, the doorbell rang, startling her mother awake.</p><p>Logan grabbed the food and dispensed with the delivery boy in less than sixty seconds. Hunter set out paper plates, grabbed beers and bottles of water. The Colonel headed her way.</p><p>\u201cCarlotta, time to eat. I\u2019ll make you some eggs and toast.\u201d</p><p>Mam\u00e1 turned and saw all the little white cartons and the pile of fortune cookies on the table. \u201cNo need to trouble yourself, Caleb. Chinese is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking heavy antibiotics. Spicy foods may upset your stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, do not trouble yourself for me.\u201d She reached out to Kata for a hand up.</p><p>The Colonel edged Kata aside. \u201cI\u2019m going to take care of you properly. No arguments.\u201d</p><p>Before her mother could speak, the big man bent and lifted her mother into his arms.</p><p>Mam\u00e1 looked Kata\u2019s way, shock spreading across her face. \u201cCaleb, I assure you, I can walk. I do not wish to be a bur\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely twenty-four hours ago, your fever was one hundred three. That\u2019s a serious illness. You\u2019re family now. You\u2019ll find the Edgingtons take care of their own.\u201d</p><p>Her mother gaped at the tight-lipped soldier. \u201cMy husband would not approve of you holding me this way.\u201d</p><p>The Colonel\u2019s expression turned even more grim. \u201cWith all due respect, Carlotta, any able-bodied man who expects a woman to cook for him hours after being released from the hospital doesn\u2019t deserve the privilege of having a wife.\u201d</p><p>True, but the Colonel was matter-of-factly making sure her mother didn\u2019t exert herself . . . and not really hearing her discomfort. Kata winced.</p><p>Mam\u00e1\u2019s mouth pursed. \u201cI\u2014I would prefer to walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColonel, I can help her. We\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Kata assured.</p><p>\u201cHunter says you\u2019re only staying until tomorrow afternoon. It\u2019s best that your mother and I get used to each other. I mean to take care of her until she\u2019s well.\u201d</p><p>End of conversation, at least as far as the Colonel was concerned. Mam\u00e1 surely heard that tone, too; neither she nor Kata argued again.</p><p>If the man was going to insist that her mother eat something bland, like eggs and toast, then Kata could fix it and put her mother at ease.</p><p>As the Colonel set her mother at the kitchen table, then tucked the throw blanket around her, Kata headed for the kitchen. \u201cEat your dinner while it\u2019s warm. I\u2019ll make Mam\u00e1\u2019s meal.\u201d</p><p>Hunter frowned as he followed her into the kitchen. \u201cHoney, you\u2019re about to fall down. Sit, Kata. Eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMam\u00e1 needs my help, and I\u2019m fine,\u201d she lied as fatigue crept in. \u201cThe snack earlier helped.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arm. \u201cI\u2019m willing to bet that you don\u2019t last ten minutes. Stop being so stubborn and let me do this.\u201d</p><p>Yanking away, she anchored her hand on her hip. \u201cDo I need to get a string? You remember I told you that if you tried to control me outside the bedroom I would string you up by the balls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said, his hands up, wearing a hint of a smile. \u201cLet me help you at least.\u201d</p><p>It went against his grain not to demand, and Kata appreciated his offer, but she wasn\u2019t helpless. \u201cBacon and eggs aren\u2019t hard. Really, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>Hunter didn\u2019t say a word. He merely watched as she rummaged through cabinets until she found a pan and set it on the stove with shaking hands. Exhaustion pulled at her.</p><p>\u201cDo you think your mom will want juice?\u201d Hunter asked, opening the fridge. \u201cI can get you some, too.\u201d</p><p>Hell, why hadn\u2019t she thought that Mama might want juice? Worse, her hands wouldn\u2019t stay still.</p><p>Right now, she didn\u2019t have the strength to string Hunter up by the balls even if she wanted to.</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Hunter poured the juice, setting a glass aside for her and giving the other to his dad, who stood waiting with a frown.</p><p>Ignoring them, Kata trudged to the refrigerator. Her legs felt weak as she withdrew the staples she needed. Gripping the door handle to keep her upright, she dug for the energy to lift the bacon and set it on the counter behind her, then grab the carton of eggs. She drew in a bracing breath.</p><p>As she made her way across the kitchen again, eggs in hand, her weary legs gave out for a split second, and she stumbled. Tears filled her eyes as she realized Hunter was right; she didn\u2019t have the energy to do this.</p><p>Hunter was there to catch her with an arm around her waist and a hand under the eggs. His voice was a soft warmth on her cheek. \u201cHoney, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Damn it, she didn\u2019t want to admit weakness. \u201cI\u2019m just tired. Give me a minute.\u201d She reached for the juice glass and gulped some. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cfamily\u201d face he\u2019d been wearing all evening dissolved. The \u201cDom\u201d face took over. \u201cDon\u2019t lie. Time for you to rest. Dad, will you take care of Carlotta? Kata and I are going to have a chat.\u201d</p><p>With that, he dipped down and picked her up, bringing her against his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she screeched.</p><p>Logan did his best to smother a laugh.</p><p>Hunter didn\u2019t answer. Marching down the hall, he shouted, \u201cSave us some dinner.\u201d</p><p>Kata wriggled . . . but he wasn\u2019t letting go. \u201cDamn it, put me down! Don\u2019t you dare embarrass me like this.\u201d</p><p>No response. A dozen steps later, he kicked the door shut behind him, then dropped her. Kata felt the bed at her back. Her fury seethed. Was he fucking serious, dragging her away in front of everyone like a child in need of discipline? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she couldn\u2019t deny that the bed felt heavenly soft. Kata was sorely tempted to close her eyes and sink into sleep.</p><p>\u201cThis is totally ridiculous.\u201d She struggled to find her feet and get them under her.</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d His big body came over hers. His face, even in the shadowed room, said he was very serious. \u201cI love your spirit, but if you don\u2019t take care of yourself properly, I\u2019ll intercede.\u201d</p><p>Every word out of his mouth sounded too much like the Colonel talking to her mother, commanding and making decisions, without regard to her feelings. Without really listening.</p> <p>Kata sagged back to the mattress, closing her weary eyes, though thoughts ricocheted through her brain. Were they both destined to be like their parents? The awful question crashed over her. Hunter behaved like a younger replica of his father\u2014determined, protective, bossy, unbending. Just this morning, she had realized that she was more like her mother than she\u2019d ever imagined.</p><p>A part of her had been hoping that Hunter was right, that the budding love between them would prevail. But how, when every day brought more proof that this relationship would probably destroy her\u2014and she, slave to the increasing submissive weakness inside her, would let it happen?</p><p>Hunter leaned over and placed a brief kiss on her forehead. Even while furious, the connection between them sparked across her skin. Everything inside her yearned for more.</p><p>The truth hit her\u2014a slap across raw cheeks. She\u2019d fallen in love with a man who would steal her independence, even as she became addicted to his touch and was ruined for every other man.</p><p>The Colonel had cowed her mother into silence in less than five minutes. Granted, she was beat down with sickness and years with Gordon. But Kata wondered how long would it take Hunter to twist her into the same submission. Five years? One? Less? How long before she lost herself to him and her self-respect?</p> <p>That was a question she had to make certain she couldn\u2019t ever answer.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>HUNTER and Kata emerged from the bedroom to find that the Colonel had fixed Carlotta\u2019s dinner, as he should have, in Hunter\u2019s estimation. He\u2019d spent the last twenty minutes with his lips against hers, his hands soothing her aching muscles. He wished she\u2019d sleep, but she was too worried about her mother to do that now. Once Carlotta got settled, he\u2019d be sure that Kata did the same.</p><p>Rolling his stiff, still-healing shoulder, Hunter reheated the Chinese food, then sat down to a plate of steaming vegetables, kung pao chicken, and steamed rice. Carlotta watched Kata pick at her beef and broccoli\u2014and sneak a puzzled glance every now and again at his father.</p><p>After the meal, the men cleaned the kitchen with efficient silence, admonishing the women to stay put. Then the Colonel lifted Carlotta in his arms. Despite the woman\u2019s tired protests, he carried Kata\u2019s mother to her bedroom upstairs, down the hall from his own.</p><p>Kata followed the pair, then gave her mother some medicine, tucking her in. After Kata planted a kiss on her mom\u2019s cheek, and Carlotta gave her daughter a weak smile, the woman drifted off. Hunter watched from the doorway as concern fell across Kata\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d He caressed her shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019ll get plenty of rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she takes a turn for the worse, I\u2019ll get her back to the doctor ASAP,\u201d his father vowed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she addressed the Colonel. \u201cRemember that she\u2019s hurting more than physically. She needs not only your care, but for you to listen to her.\u201d</p><p>With that, Kata shouldered her way past them, out of the room. Hunter saw his father wince.</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s your wife\u2019s way of saying I\u2019ve been a bulldozer. She\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks the same of me.\u201d Hunter shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cYou and I, we\u2019re cut from the same cloth. I don\u2019t know a different way to take care of Kata. I love her.\u201d</p><p>The Colonel shot him an unreadable stare. \u201cTread carefully, son. If you hold on too tightly, she\u2019ll force you to let her go.\u201d</p><p>Hunter heard the voice of reason, experience.</p> <p>\u201cIs that what happened with you and Mom?\u201d</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t ask. Hunter knew it . . . but damn it, to this day he didn\u2019t understand why his father had simply let Amanda go. The Colonel had never explained, and after she\u2019d left, Hunter had never seen his mother again. Maybe understanding would help him with his own disintegrating union.</p><p>\u201cIn retrospect, yeah. I controlled so much of her life to avoid losing her that it became a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d The Colonel rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cAmanda wanted more affection, wanted to know I valued her feelings and opinions. The only things I was good at were protecting her and, when I wasn\u2019t deployed, showing her how much I desired her. It wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>Hunter damn near choked. It sounded too fucking parallel. \u201cShe wanted to leave. I get it. But you gave up and let her go so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that was easy?\u201d the Colonel growled. \u201cLetting her go was the fucking hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. I loved her, but didn\u2019t know how to be what she wanted. I gave her some space, agreed to the separation. I\u2019d hoped the strategy would show her that I\u2019d changed. But then I found out she\u2019d been seeing someone else. I was so furious, but up until the day she was killed, I kept hoping that she would come back to me. Eventually, I realized that I\u2019d loved her enough to set her free. She just didn\u2019t love me enough to come back. And I couldn\u2019t force her.\u201d</p><p>Hunter felt every word down to his bones. His mother had been so miserable being controlled that she\u2019d walked out on a husband and three children and never looked back. Kata had been fighting him since before they said \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Dread rolled through his belly as the years peeled away. He remembered his parents\u2019 ugly fights, the rage his mother had spewed. Her pleas for freedom. She\u2019d finally grabbed it the only way she\u2019d known how. Even in middle school, Hunter had become aware of the depression and anger that plagued his mother. Still, he\u2019d been shocked when she left. He\u2019d always assumed his father would keep the family together.</p><p>That should have been love\u2019s role. When the Colonel had finally realized it, he\u2019d let her go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known for years that you disapproved of me not fighting to keep your mother.\u201d</p><p>His gaze snapped up, and he met his dad\u2019s head-on. \u201cI lost respect for you that day, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t good at hiding it. I could hardly keep Amanda against her will. I did what I thought had the best potential for long-term success.\u201d He shrugged as if he\u2019d finally accepted years of pain and loneliness. \u201cBut after years of not hearing her unhappiness and not doing enough to change my ways, I was going to lose her, regardless.\u201d</p><p>In that moment, everything crystallized inside Hunter. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It takes a wise man to know when he can\u2019t win. And a brave one to let his woman go.\u201d</p><p>Hunter didn\u2019t know if he was that brave.</p><p>The Colonel sent him a sad smile. \u201cApparently not too wise. Carlotta isn\u2019t even mine, and I\u2019m smothering her already. I know how I should behave, but I\u2019m not good at implementing it. I suggest you learn, too.\u201d</p><p>Or Kata will be gone.</p><p>Under the tangle of anxiety, denial, and anger, Hunter knew his father was right. And it made him sick to think that, in all the time he\u2019d been trying to show her how much he loved her, he\u2019d also been hurting her.</p><p>\u201cYou know that biblical verse, \u2018Love isn\u2019t selfish. It\u2019s patient and kind . . .\u201d</p><p>Hunter closed his eyes. Yeah, he knew, just as he knew he\u2019d been selfish, impatient, and pushy. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings between you and Kata aren\u2019t as smooth as you\u2019d like, are they, son? It\u2019s hard when you\u2019re newlyweds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already wants a divorce.\u201d He forced the words out, pinching the bridge of his nose. It hurt to admit just how much he\u2019d screwed up, but his dad was being so damn honest.</p><p>The Colonel sucked in a breath. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her. I can\u2019t stand the thought of her not being mine.\u201d</p><p>His father clapped him on the shoulder in understanding. \u201cBut if her heart isn\u2019t with you, then she\u2019s not yours anyway. Sometimes . . . you have to let go. Better to do it now, before she comes to hate you.\u201d</p><p>His voice cracked as painful memories twisted his strong face.</p><p>Hunter watched his father leave the cozy room. He turned to Carlotta, seeing a lot of Kata in her slightly lined face. It hadn\u2019t escaped his notice how disturbed Kata had been by her mother\u2019s interaction with his father. Hunter just hadn\u2019t been able to curb his own need to care for her in much the same way. But he saw now that if he didn\u2019t change fast, he was going to lose her for good.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he turned out the lights in the little bedroom, then wandered downstairs. Kata had gone off to bed, according to Logan, whose phone continued to beep.</p><p>\u201cInsistent girl,\u201d Hunter commented.</p><p>Logan shrugged. \u201cThree of them now. All pain sluts.\u201d He ran his hands across the top of his buzz cut. \u201cIt\u2019s a game with them. They each want to be the one I finally sleep with.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head. Granted, with his own love life a wreck, he was the last one who should be offering advice, but he had to try to help his younger brother. \u201cHow long has it been?\u201d</p><p>The question made Logan look away. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe five years.\u201d</p><p>A small eternity. Logan was too young and vital to be voluntarily going without. \u201cYour palm chafed raw yet?\u201d</p><p>Logan scowled and punched him in the shoulder. \u201cFuck off. I make sure they get what they need. Xander delivers the sex and aftercare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs sending in your clean-up man good enough for them? For you?\u201d With a shake of his head, Hunter admonished, \u201cBro, you\u2019re going to have to move past T\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say her name,\u201d he snarled. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Hunter held up his hands in a defensive gesture. \u201cFine. You try talking to her again?\u201d</p><p>Longing and misery crossed his face. \u201cShe slammed the door in my face.\u201d</p><p>His shrug told Hunter just how futile the whole mess felt. It was a feeling that Hunter feared he was going to know all too well if he lost Kata.</p><p>The Colonel sauntered into the room with a grimace. \u201cCouldn\u2019t help overhearing. Her prick of a stepfather still lives in the same house. Adam Sterling smiles at me when I jog the neighborhood, as if he enjoys reminding me that his little princess broke my son\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>Hunter wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Logan growled something ugly and anatomically impossible.</p><p>Before Hunter could point that out, his phone rang. He glanced at the clock as he pried the phone off his belt. Who would be calling at eleven thirty?</p><p>Hunter looked at his display, his belly tightening as he pressed the button to talk. \u201cJack, talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve finally got some information, and you\u2019re not going to like it.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t liked anything about Kata\u2019s would-be assassin since he\u2019d popped up. The whole thing stank.</p><p>\u201cKata\u2019s hired hit man was ID\u2019d through fingerprint records earlier this evening. I just found out. His name is Manuel Silva. The name mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. You find something out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, this is where it gets ugly. He\u2019s a well-known hit man, originally from Bogot\u00e1.\u201d</p><p>The words sucked the air from his lungs. \u201cColombia? You\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hundred percent. I made some of my local friends let me see the records before the CIA stepped in. Apparently, he was a person of serious interest to them. I\u2019m still trying to learn why. The INS deported him a few years ago. He\u2019s done a lot of jobs for lowlifes in the drug trade. He was last seen slinking around New Orleans a few weeks ago. His services were very expensive, probably close to one hundred grand a whack.\u201d Jack sounded grim, and Hunter\u2019s blood ran cold. \u201cWhoever wanted Kata iced went to a lot of trouble and expense. The question is, why?\u201d</p><p>For the first time in his life, he felt almost numb with fear. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKata doesn\u2019t know anyone from New Orleans who might want her dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never mentioned it. I\u2019ll ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll keep seeing what else I can find and call you with any new information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jack.\u201d Though the news was really shitty. \u201cKeep me posted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, son?\u201d the Colonel asked as soon as he ended the call.</p><p>Hunter drew in a deep breath. \u201cThe assassin, Silva, is from Colombia. Probably came from New Orleans. I can\u2019t figure out the connection. Cortez Villarreal deals in dope, but how would a small-town street thug from Lafayette even know the kind of badass killer who\u2019s a person of interest to the CIA?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf Villarreal didn\u2019t put that contract out on Kata, any ideas who did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d It wasn\u2019t adding up, but he honestly had no other suspects.</p><p>\u201cJust because the connection isn\u2019t obvious does not mean it doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Logan surmised. \u201cFor all we know, Silva and Villarreal are friends, family, or one owed the other a favor. Or maybe he was hired because he was out of left field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could Villarreal afford Silva? But you may be right; I shouldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover. Maybe there is a simple connection; I\u2019m just not seeing it.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe. Whatever the case, Cortez Villarreal was the only suspect he had. Hunter would have preferred to hit the ground, shake people up, ask questions, dig up answers. But he was running out of time. Logan rose from the table, searching for his shoes, reminding him that it was nearly midnight, the dawn of a new day. He had just under three days to put this danger to bed once and for all. Thoughts raced as he made plans, discarded them, fine-tuned others. He wasn\u2019t sure which would suit best without more information, but he hated all of them.</p><p>Hunter rang Jack again. As soon as the bodyguard answered, he fired off questions. \u201cDo you know where to find Cortez Villarreal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly? No, but rumor is that he\u2019s in the area and been laying real low over the past few days. I\u2019ve been keeping tabs in case we need to have a meaningful conversation with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it may be time. When you find him, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get on it and call you back.\u201d</p> <p>The Colonel leaned in his face. \u201cWhat are you thinking, son?\u201d</p><p>Hunter gripped the phone, tamping down rising panic for Kata\u2019s safety. \u201cIt\u2019s time for something drastic.\u201d</p><p>SUNLIGHT streamed through the windows Friday morning when Hunter heard someone grip the doorknob. He came to, sat straight up, and reached for his SIG on the bedside table. When the door opened, his wife, hair tousled across heavy breasts barely covered by a thin white tank top and wearing black lacy pajama pants that clung to her hips, entered. Damn. Hunter was always ready for sex with her, but the sight of her made far more than his cock ache.</p><p>\u201cSorry if I woke you.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the clock. Nine a.m.? He never slept that late. Then again, he\u2019d spent all night holding Kata close, fearing their days together were numbered. He hadn\u2019t fallen asleep until after five. \u201cI\u2019m glad you did. I need to get up. Honey, does the name Manuel Silva mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>Her blank stare told him everything he needed to know. \u201cShould it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know anyone from Colombia? Where is Villarreal from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t exactly read his family tree when I was assigned to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone in New Orleans have a beef with you?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, shrugged. \u201cNot that I know of. I haven\u2019t been there in a few years.\u201d</p><p>At this point, Hunter had to assume there was some connection between Silva and Villarreal that he simply couldn\u2019t see. He had nothing else.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d She crossed her arms and stared expectantly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe nothing. How\u2019s your mom?\u201d</p><p>Kata\u2019s face closed up as she sat on the edge of the bed. Hunter tried not to be distracted by the fact that he could see her rosy areolas through the little white tank.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I came to talk to you. I appreciate all the trouble you and your father have gone through for her, but she\u2019s not comfortable here. This morning, your father insisted on cooking for her again, carrying her out to the porch for fresh air, assisting her from room to room. He\u2019s been glued to her side, jumping up with a box of tissues or her cough medicine every time she sniffles.\u201d</p><p>In other words, his father knew what to do, and even after having his heart ripped out, he still couldn\u2019t manage to change. Then again, Hunter hadn\u2019t done much better last night at giving his wife space.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cKata, having someone take care of her is good for her recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if she can\u2019t relax. The Colonel is being . . . a general. She isn\u2019t comfortable with him hovering. She wants to go to Mari\u2019s house, so I talked to my sister\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No way in hell am I taking either of you back to Lafayette now.\u201d This wasn\u2019t a good time to be inflexible, but damn it, she had to see the problems with her plan. \u201cWhat if whoever wants you dead tracks you or your mother down? What if Gordon coerces her back home? Carlotta needs to give it more time here. She\u2019s uncomfortable because she\u2019s not used to others caring for her. She\u2019ll adjust.\u201d</p><p>Kata shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Believe me, someone trying to kill me scares me, too, but I can\u2019t leave Mam\u00e1 here to get worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlotta won\u2019t get much rest with two rambunctious grandsons underfoot. I\u2019ll bet that she ends up waiting on them.\u201d</p><p>Kata bit her lip and paused. \u201cI was very clear with Mari that she can\u2019t be out of bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMari will have her hands full with her job, her kids, and a husband who lacks discipline. Your mother will naturally want to help. She can\u2019t afford to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father is totally overwhelming her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Colonel is too . . . attentive. He knows that and will work on it. I\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d she sputtered incredulously. \u201cYou\u2019re going to talk to him about backing off? Um, Pot, meet Kettle.\u201d</p><p>He bridged the space and grabbed her wrist, pulling her against him. \u201cYou\u2019re not using your head, Kata. You want to make your mother happy, but think about what\u2019s best for her. Do you want her returning to Gordon? Because if she\u2019s at Mari\u2019s, he\u2019ll browbeat her into it. If she stays here, the Colonel won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019ll smother her even more. Mam\u00e1 doesn\u2019t want to be here.\u201d Kata tried to pull away. \u201cI saw your point, now you need to see mine.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t afford to. \u201cI can\u2019t risk taking you or your mother to Lafayette now, with a potential assassin on the loose. I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019re staying.\u201d</p><p>Kata rose and grabbed her suitcase. \u201cYou always have to be in charge, don\u2019t you? It\u2019s not just a bedroom thing, so stop pretending it is. And while you\u2019re at it, sign those damn divorce papers. Mari is tied up at work today, so I\u2019m calling Ben. He\u2019ll give us a ride home.\u201d</p><p>With that, she slammed out the door. Hunter scrambled out of bed to find his pants. As he shoved his way into them, he heard the slam of the nearby bathroom door, heard the shower start. She was batshit crazy if she thought he was going to let her put a door between them so that she could fucking call Ben and leave.</p><p>But he also couldn\u2019t mow down her free will, or he\u2019d lose her.</p><p>Hunter cursed, wishing for a convenient terrorist to put his fists into. Fuck, he didn\u2019t want to sign those papers. But while he was on active duty, Kata could proceed with the divorce without him\u2014and he\u2019d be powerless to stop her. Regardless of his dad\u2019s words of wisdom, he wasn\u2019t ready to stop fighting for Kata.</p><p>As Hunter reached for the bathroom door, the phone in his pocket rang. A glance at the display made him groan. \u201cThis better be fucking good, Andy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember who you\u2019re talking to, Raptor.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Andy Barnes was now his commanding officer, not just a buddy. He\u2019d better suck it up. \u201cSorry, sir. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour leave has been cut short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Twice in the same leave?\u201d This was fucking unheard of unless it was a goddamn national emergency. \u201cIs something happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Sotillo organization is definitely gathering. The big arms-for-drugs sale that we anticipated earlier this week will go down Saturday night. We need you there.\u201d</p><p>Hunter struggled to wrap his head around Andy\u2019s words when he could still hear Kata threatening to call Ben in his head. \u201cHow? V\u00edctor is dead. If you read my report, I received intel on my last trip that his brother, Adan, was killed, too. Who the hell would be organizing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSotillo had underlings. I guess it\u2019s one of them. V\u00edctor\u2019s death created a vacuum of power. Of course someone will want to step into it. We\u2019re going to send a small four-man team in there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour men? If they\u2019re going to conduct major business, both parties will come with a frigging army. Four men aren\u2019t going to get the job done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour men will be able to slip in under the radar undetected and clean house. Too many men and too much equipment means that the potential for detection and fuckups is greater.\u201d</p><p>So was the potential for ineffectuality. This mission sounded like pure suicide. \u201cI want it on record that I disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuly noted.\u201d And boy, did Andy sound pissed off. \u201cWe\u2019ll need you back at base by fifteen hundred tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>With that, Andy hung up. Numbly, Hunter pressed the off button on his phone. Three o\u2019clock tomorrow afternoon, in barely thirty hours. How the fuck was he supposed to save his marriage and ensure that his wife was completely safe before he had to leave?</p><p>Hunter didn\u2019t see a way to do both, and any good soldier learned how to prioritize mission objectives when things started going to hell. Between those two, he had no doubt which came first. Mentally, he sifted through his possible tactics. He had only one left.</p><p>And it hurt like hell.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he reached for his phone and called Jack, who answered on the first ring.</p><p>Hunter didn\u2019t even let the man greet him before diving in. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move tonight. I\u2019ll be out of the country indefinitely tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Jack cursed, sighed bleakly. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll make it work. Word on the street is that Villarreal is tired of dodging cops and is ready to wring your wife\u2019s pretty neck. I know the connection between him and Silva isn\u2019t obvious . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what you\u2019re saying definitely lends credibility to Villarreal\u2019s motive and seems to validate him as the prime suspect.\u201d Goddamn it, Hunter felt the walls closing in around him\u2014the danger to Kata, her distance, his job. He had to get his house in order quickly, and keeping her safe was top priority.</p><p>\u201cYou know anything about him?\u201d Hunter hated feeling impotent. Usually, he\u2019d be in there digging for answers and making heads roll accordingly. Staying near Kata and protecting her must take precedence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done a little research,\u201d Jack said. \u201cVillarreal likes throwing his cash at flashy strippers. Sexy Sirens\u2019 grand reopening is tonight. I\u2019ll have Deke ask Alyssa to put out the word that he\u2019ll be a VIP if he shows up. Deke and I can grab him and have a \u2018friendly\u2019 chat with him until he agrees to leave Kata alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m going to keep Kata busy tonight while you bag this fucker. I\u2019ll be around in the morning to talk to him so we can settle this.\u201d</p><p>After agreeing to coordinate later that evening, Hunter made two more phone calls\u2014both necessary evils. Then he threw on the rest of his clothes, brushed his teeth, found Kata\u2019s phone, and gave it to his dad for safekeeping. No way was she calling Ben to come take her away when she was in danger. Preferably not ever.</p><p>Rubbing damp palms on his denim-clad thighs, Hunter stood in front of the bathroom door Kata had retreated to and let out a deep breath. It didn\u2019t help; every muscle remained clenched. If there was another fucking way. . . But there wasn\u2019t, and he knew it. This was it.</p><p>His heart pounded as he pushed into the room. The fragrant, humid air wrapped around him. Everything smelled like her: spicy amber, sweet lilies. Beyond arousing. Like always, he turned hard and aching in an instant.</p><p>God, he loved this woman.</p><p>Seeing him, she gasped and scrambled for her towel on the basin. He grabbed the damp terry cloth first, loving the hell out of her in nothing but a lacy, baby blue thong. Her smooth olive skin and lush breasts with those tight, rosy brown nipples tempted him like nothing ever had. The dark ropes of her wet hair dripped down her back, framing her freshly scrubbed face. He couldn\u2019t wait to get back inside her, hold her again. Yesterday, she\u2019d been dealing with too much, so he\u2019d backed off, hadn\u2019t pressed his way into the snug, silken clasp of her pussy.</p><p>Tonight, all bets were off.</p><p>Realizing that he wasn\u2019t going to give her the towel and that he blocked the path to her clothes, Kata faced him squarely, chin raised. \u201cWhat now? I\u2019ve told you how I feel and what needs to happen. If you\u2019re here to stop me from leaving, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ah, that stubborn streak of hers that intrigued him so much. Normally, he\u2019d argue until he wore Kata down or seduce her until she gave in with a well-sated cry. This situation was far from normal. Until dawn, his most important role was to keep her safe. Nothing mattered more. Hunter had only one way left to do that . . . and give her what she wanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was going to tear his fucking heart out.</p><p>He had no illusions; he\u2019d never be the same. He\u2019d be every inch the miserable bastard his father had been for the last fifteen lonely years, that Logan was now. Hunter had always sworn he\u2019d do whatever it took to hang on to the one woman meant for him.</p><p>Goddamn it, in a handful of hours he\u2019d have no choice but to let her go.</p><p>Hunter crossed his arms over his chest, restraining the urge to embrace Kata, stroke her tempting flesh\u2014and never stop. \u201cFirst, if you go home, you\u2019re not only putting yourself in danger, but your family, too. You might not know everything about this asshole threatening you, but he knows you. Why wouldn\u2019t he come after those you love?\u201d</p> <p>Kata\u2019s stubborn chin rose, but she nodded. Though she didn\u2019t want to, she saw his point. Now he had to put all his cards on the table, even though he had the losing hand.</p><p>\u201cI have a proposition, honey: Today, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to neutralize the threat against you. Tomorrow, you\u2019ll be free in every way.\u201d He clenched his fists. \u201cI\u2019ll sign the fucking divorce papers.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he choked out the words, Hunter wished he could take them back. For him, she was it\u2014had been since the moment he laid eyes on her. He wished he could make her understand, but unless she came to love him in return, accept his needs and her own, they were doomed.</p><p>Surprise flashed across her face, along with something else\u2014regret, maybe . . . or was that his own wishful thinking?</p><p>She smoothed out her expression. \u201cT-thank you for finally being reasonable.\u201d</p> <p>Reasonable? In five seconds, she wouldn\u2019t think so. \u201cI\u2019ll do that, if you spend tonight with me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>HE was going to sign the papers? Kata swallowed as conflicting emotions rushed her. She expected relief. After all, the emotional rollercoaster ride she\u2019d been on the past few days was ending. Instead, dismay crashed through her. After tonight, she\u2019d probably never see Hunter again. She blinked back blindsiding tears that burned like acid. Her heart felt as though it were bleeding out of her chest.</p><p>Was she crazy? She\u2019d demanded this divorce. The minute Hunter relented, some twisted part of her wanted to stay with him?</p><p>God, she\u2019d fallen in love with him.</p><p>Kata closed her eyes. Fine freaking time to realize it.</p> <p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d He leaned against the doorframe, his gaze hot on her body.</p><p>He was cocky, challenging. Damn it, it didn\u2019t seem like his heart was breaking. He loved her so much that he was throwing in the towel after a mere four days? After he got another piece of ass and stole another bit of her soul, of course. Then he\u2019d let her go.</p><p>Or maybe he\u2019d finally realized they were a losing bet.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She cleared her suddenly tight throat. \u201cSpend tonight with you, and you\u2019ll sign the papers.\u201d</p><p>Even saying those words felt like a hot knife carving a jagged hole in her chest. But Hunter wasn\u2019t going to change. His dominance disturbed her. That his parents had split up over his father\u2019s controlling nature didn\u2019t bode well. Spending the day with Caleb had proven that leopard wasn\u2019t going to change his spots. And Logan seemed made from the same mold, if the demanding, growled phone calls she\u2019d overheard with his BDSM bunnies were any indication. Perhaps she was too sensitive, but she\u2019d rather roll over and die than let any man have the kind of dominion over her that Gordon held over Mam\u00e1.</p><p>She and Hunter had shared the best sex of her life. Kata always knew that she\u2019d fall for someone who had a core of honor, straight-up honesty, a decisive bent. Dominance aside, Hunter was everything she could want in a man. It made sense that she had feelings for him. But she\u2019d never be the kind of woman he needed. And she\u2019d ultimately make him miserable.</p><p>She had to find the strength to let go before they hurt one another any more.</p><p>Hunter speared her with a haunting blue stare. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Her voice was scratchy, thin. \u201cWhat about the killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a plan. Jack and Deke are helping. By morning, everything should be over.\u201d</p><p>In that, she trusted him completely. Leaping into a marriage with Hunter might be as scary as jumping off a cliff, but she knew that he\u2019d never let anything or anyone hurt her. And whatever else had happened between them, she probably owed him her life. \u201cThank you. I don\u2019t know how you accomplished it, but I\u2019m very grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain once it\u2019s all settled.\u201d</p><p>That rankled a bit, but Kata nodded. That was Hunter\u2019s way. She couldn\u2019t change him, but she wanted to touch him, cup his cheek, plant a soft kiss on his mouth. It was too much like something a woman in love would do, so she did nothing. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Be ready at five, suitcase packed. The Colonel and Logan have agreed to stay with your mother. I\u2019ll get Dad to back off. But you can be assured that she\u2019s in good hands. Tomorrow, you\u2019re both free.\u201d He paused, glanced down at her lacy blue underwear. \u201cBut tonight . . . no panties.\u201d</p><p>With that, he turned and left, closing the door behind him with a quiet click.</p><p>Kata stared at the solid oak portal between them. That was it? No kiss, no embrace? She\u2019d certainly wanted it\u2014even though tonight was good-bye.</p><p>A fresh wave of desolation overcame her, leaving her bereft in its wake. Hunter seemed all but done with her.</p><p>Kata frowned at her reflection in the lightly steamed mirror, then closed her eyes against the crush of emotion weighing on her. Everything inside her resisted ending this. How had Hunter ingrained himself in her heart so quickly that she suddenly wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d live without him?</p><p>Kata shook her head. She\u2019d lived without the man for twenty-five years. She\u2019d find a way to manage for the rest of her life. First, she had to focus on making it through tonight. Because Hunter would strip her bare, all the way down to her soul, expose everything she was inside, then take it all. She feared she\u2019d never be the same again.</p><p>HUNTER drove across town in silence. Kata wanted to ask where they were going, but his tight-lipped silence didn\u2019t encourage conversation. Wherever they were headed, she knew he would keep her safe.</p><p>Kata had no such assurance where her heart was concerned.</p><p>Finally, they pulled up in front of a big house as dusk began to fall. Just outside of town, on an isolated lane, the sprawling brick house with its black shutters and large windows beckoned from a long stone walkway bracketed by pairs of towering oak trees, their lofty branches reaching up and over the quaint walk. Flowers abounded in pots here and there. An air of old money and wealthy decadence lingered.</p><p>As she exited the truck, Hunter came around and held her door. She noticed another truck, a black one, already against the curb in front of them.</p><p>\u201cIs someone else here?\u201d</p><p>He closed and locked the truck behind her. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho lives here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe owner won\u2019t be here tonight. No more questions.\u201d</p><p>He definitely had his Dom face on. The hard edge to his voice and the distance he put between them now tore at her. Fighting it would only hurt more in the long run, but she ached to throw her arms around him, press her lips to his, and ask him to share himself with her.</p><p>The way he\u2019d been trying to coax her from the beginning. She winced at the thought.</p><p>He took her by the elbow, led her up the stone walkway, reached for the doorknob. And she couldn\u2019t stand the thought that their last night together would be impersonal. As much as he\u2019d pushed and shoved his way into her life, her psyche, and even her heart, the Hunter who stood at her side now was so remote she wanted to scream.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d She swallowed down her nerves. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t want it like this. You . . .\u201d She tried to gather her racing thoughts, find the right words. \u201cIt\u2019s like you don\u2019t like me, even want me, anymore. If that\u2019s the case\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kata didn\u2019t even finish the sentence before Hunter dragged her closer and captured her mouth with his own, fists in her hair, lips tangling with hers, heart racing against her own. He urged her open and dove in. The kiss turned instantly deep. Intimate. He swirled his tongue around her own as if he planned to stay all night. With a devouring pace, he engulfed her senses, silencing her worries. Kata pressed to him, curled her arms around his neck, losing herself in Hunter\u2019s familiar flavor. God, she never wanted the kiss to end.</p><p>As she moaned, he pulled away, his mouth pressed into a grim line. \u201cI want you. Never doubt that. Come inside.\u201d</p><p>He opened the front door, and Kata had the impression of warm-toned walls, tall ceilings, lots of Tuscan details before he hustled her down a long hall. She bit back questions. He\u2019d reveal to her his intentions when he was ready. As much as she hated to admit it, he knew her body well. Whatever demanding, restraining, subjugating things he had planned, she\u2019d likely love it.</p><p>He led her to the very last door and pushed his way into a large bedroom, steeped in shadows. Just inside the door, he flipped a switch. Low, golden light flooded the bedroom. Beige and white striped the walls. A traditional white headboard framed by heavy brocade drapes dropped from a white cornice box affixed to the ceiling, a wood-burning fireplace tiled in traditional marble and a gleaming white mantel all lent the room an air of elegance. Not a piece of BDSM equipment lay anywhere in sight.</p><p>Kata turned to Hunter with a question in her gaze.</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>The cozy, romantic feel appealed, for sure, but . . . \u201cI do. I guess I was expecting something that looked more like your brother\u2019s living room.\u201d</p><p>An expression she couldn\u2019t discern crossed his face. \u201cTonight is about you, honey. Whatever you want, it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to ask him why he could just be with her this way tonight and not every other night, but she knew. He simply wasn\u2019t wired that way for the long term. Tonight, Hunter was willing to put aside his desires for her.</p><p>It made her love him even more.</p><p>She pushed back tears. \"That\u2019s . . .\u201d Incredible. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Hunter looked like he wanted to say more but shook it off. He shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cTell me how you want this to go.\u201d</p><p>With him, it had never been anything but a whirlwind of desire so intense, it was like standing in the middle of a raging storm. For days, she\u2019d wished he would ease off, not try to overtake her mind and soul. Now that he was giving her what she wanted, Kata wasn\u2019t sure what to say.</p><p>\u201cCan you just ... be with me? Soft, maybe a little sweet?\u201d</p><p>For a second, the hard angles of his male face tightened with uncertainty. Finally, he caressed her shoulder, cupped his palm around her neck. \u201cFor you, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was about to break. Kata knew that as soon as he leaned in and kissed her softly, his lips lingering over her own, a velvety brush of tongue. She clung to his wide shoulders and pressed her mouth to his. He didn\u2019t hesitate to open to her, deepen the kiss until she felt herself drowning in the sweet stirrings of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to lie down?\u201d</p><p>Of course. This good-bye was going to be long and poignant. She didn\u2019t want to be rushed or try to join with him standing up. Tonight called for soft sheets, rumpled covers, breathy sighs\u2014a cocoon for lovers.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Hunter reached up to the switch and killed the lights.</p><p>From their argument their first night together in Vegas, she knew that he preferred full light, wanting to see the effect he had on her. He\u2019d given her darkness now as another concession.</p><p>Funny thing, she no longer felt self-conscious around him. In fact, she\u2019d rather have the lights on to see every expression on his gorgeous, familiar face.</p><p>Before she could say so, he took her hand in his. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>Kata frowned. She knew he was letting her set the pace, trying to give her what she wanted, but this behavior was so unlike him, she wondered if making love tonight was going to be like being with him at all.</p><p>Biting her lip, she led him over to the plush queen-sized bed. He followed without word, waiting until she sank down to the mattress, her whole back enveloped in something cloudlike, heavenly.</p><p>He stretched out beside her, taking her hand in his, turning his face in her direction. Their stares met in the shadows, his questioning . . . and so damn resigned, she felt a sob rise up. Kata turned to him, threw her arms around him, pressed their bodies tight.</p><p>Hunter slid his arms around her. \u201cTell me what I can give you tonight, honey. Whatever you need, it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>That would be his parting gift. She heard it in his voice.</p><p>A mix of sadness and panic gripped her. She trapped a sob in her chest and covered his mouth with her own, desperately trying to sink down into the male flavor of him, his gentle embrace. He returned the kiss, every breath, every brush of lips, every slide of tongue. She tried to drown in the heavy, honey-sweet sea of desire he usually created inside her. It wasn\u2019t there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She stared at him in the dark, trying to understand.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He caressed her face. \u201cI\u2019m doing my best to give you what you want.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d said that, but something didn\u2019t feel right. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>He sent her a regretful smile. \u201cEverything you don\u2019t. So let\u2019s not dwell on what isn\u2019t meant to be. Let me give to you tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter was trying to be something he wasn\u2019t\u2014for her. Hunter was letting her go\u2014for her. Suddenly, she knew what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cBe yourself with me,\u201d she blurted into the silence.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cKata . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve been afraid before.\u201d Of him seeing too deeply inside her, of falling for this man who enthralled her so much. No matter how she\u2019d tried to stop him, he\u2019d worked into her soul and stolen her heart. She couldn\u2019t protect what he\u2019d already taken. \u201cTonight is our last time together. I want to be with you completely.\u201d</p><p>This once, that would be her gift to him\u2014for both of them.</p> <p>His grip at her neck tightened. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Yes and no. Hunter was going to strip away her every defense and artifice, but for once in her life, she didn\u2019t want to be too afraid to give her trust, her love. Tomorrow, she could return to her sarcastic, defensive, barbed-wire self. Tonight, she wanted to connect to Hunter in a way she never had . . . and never would with any other man again.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then pulled her to her feet. \u201cAll right, honey. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>Kata squeezed his hand as he led her out of the cozy bedroom, then across the hall. In front of another door, he stopped. She waited as he pulled a black, silky cloth from his back pocket. He held it up in front of her, as if waiting for her to object. She flattened her lips together and kept the hovering question to herself.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d he praised her restraint. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p> <p>Then he turned her away. Kata fully expected him to tie her wrists together. Instead, he lifted the cloth over her eyes and tied it around the back of her head.</p><p>\u201cCan you see, Kata? Be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d That was the frightening truth.</p><p>She heard a soft click, then a long creak. A rush of cooler air greeted her as Hunter urged her forward, guiding her with an arm around her waist and his hand on her hip. Then she heard the door close behind her.</p><p>Kata swallowed nervously. What didn\u2019t Hunter want her to see? Her mind flashed back to Logan\u2019s living room. She shivered. Hunter had admitted that he was no stranger to all that equipment, and he\u2019d known it freaked her out. Was that why he blindfolded her now?</p><p>\u201cYour safe word tonight is \u201cred.\u201d Are you clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed. Yes.\u201d Kata knew without asking that if anything Hunter did frightened or hurt her that she could say one word and stop everything, no hesitation.</p><p>She frowned. When had she come to trust him so unequivocally? The man had seduced her, married her when she was too drunk to know better, dominated, spanked, and punished her. He\u2019d also given her more pleasure and devotion than she\u2019d ever had in her life, and he\u2019d never gone back on his word. He wouldn\u2019t hurt her now.</p> <p>He also wouldn\u2019t be in her life after tonight.</p><p>The reality of that swamped her again. Panic flared, along with a need to feel him close. What was the matter with her? Was it the vulnerability that being blindfolded gave her? Or those useless feelings for Hunter creeping in?</p><p>Afraid to answer the question, she turned to where she sensed he stood and wrapped her arms around him.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d He steadied her, brought her closer. \u201cYou all right, Kata?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little afraid.\u201d She wanted to say more but forced herself to keep silent, trust him. Please him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. Tonight, you didn\u2019t choose what you\u2019ve been telling yourself you want. And I\u2019m glad.\u201d She could hear the sincerity in his voice. \u201cLet me give you what you need. Surrender to me.\u201d</p><p>Kata reached out to touch him. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Then Hunter set his mouth over hers again with hungry demand, and she was lost.</p><p>She might regret it later, but she opened to him completely. If this was their last night, she wanted that connection deeper than ever, wanted to know that she\u2019d been with him without artifice, barriers, or fear.</p><p>Kata knew that might hurt tomorrow, but he would do whatever necessary to give her absolute pleasure. She put herself in his hands and let go.</p><p>\u201cStrip, Kata. Shoes first, then shirt, pants, bra\u2014in that order. Fold the garments, putting them on the table beside you as you go. Once you\u2019re finished, hand them to me.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach lurched, as if she\u2019d jumped off a cliff. A week ago, she would have hated his tone, even as it melted her. Now, she focused on the sound of his voice, on giving herself over, pleasing him, experiencing all they could be. Tonight only.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d She slipped off her shoes and groped for the table, finding it directly beside her. She followed by unfastening her shirt, one reckless loosening of each button after another until she peeled it off her shoulders. Folding it as best as she could, Kata set it aside. Then she took a deep breath. Now for the most frightening command. But she tore at the fastening on her low-rise jeans and pushed them down. Per Hunter\u2019s earlier instructions, she\u2019d worn no panties.</p><p>Kata shoved the denim down, folded it up, then set the pants on top of the rest. With a deep breath, she shoved them in his direction. Hunter was right there, taking the clothes from her hands, settling a soft kiss on her mouth.</p><p>Naked, she stood before him, heart pounding, blood racing. Proud, scared\u2014ready.</p><p>Hunter took her by the hand, led her across the room, then guided her to stand before him, easing her back against something padded. Everything inside her stuttered, and she wanted to ask what he planned. But she didn\u2019t. \u201cSpread your legs.\u201d</p><p>Drawing in a bracing breath, she complied. Something cool and leathery-soft slid around one ankle. It fastened with a quiet click. He repeated the motion with the other leg. Caressing his way up her thigh, her belly, her breast, Hunter reached for her wrist and dragged one over her head. Soon, she felt the supple straps and the cool metal of a buckle. Finally, he reached for her other hand, linked her fingers in his, then raised her arm.</p><p>Kata seized up. God, by binding her so completely, how powerless would he make her? And yet, with his groan of approval in her ear and his body pressing against hers, urgent and hard, she felt the power she had over him.</p><p>The buckle fitted around her wrist, then he trailed his fingertip down the inside of her arm, over her breast, stealing across her nipple until he pinched with just enough pressure to be just shy of pain.</p><p>Hunter leaned in and feathered his lips across her shoulder, her neck, her ear. \u201cWe\u2019re being watched, honey.\u201d</p><p>She froze, her breath catching. There was someone in the room with them? Who?</p><p>Hot eyes roamed her skin, assessing, caressing. She shivered, an icy thrill racing over her. Vulnerability hit her, and she became aware of every taut inch of her skin, the tight beads of her nipples, the wet folds of her pussy sliding against each other with lip-biting friction whenever she moved. And a complete stranger could see it all.</p><p>As if he could hear her racing thoughts, he murmured, \u201cShoulders back. Hair behind you. Show him how fucking sexy you are. Make him know that I\u2019m the luckiest bastard on the planet to be fucking you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Him? The thought, Hunter\u2019s words aroused her . . . even as insecurities tried to take over. \u201cA stranger is looking at my hips and thighs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gorgeous and lush. I\u2019m looking, too. If you can\u2019t commit to submitting tonight, use your safe word. Or let me touch you while he watches.\u201d</p><p>Kata should be horrified by the thought of a stranger\u2019s eyes on her. Anxiety about her appearance niggled at her, but Hunter demanded her compliance. And she wanted to please him.</p><p>This was so much like her fantasy. She held her breath. Oh God, did he mean to give her the entire fantasy? As possessive as he was, would he really share her with another man?</p><p>Hunter brushed his thumb across her nipples, scattering her thoughts. He pressed his body against hers, kissed his way down her neck\u2014and made her feel sexier than any man ever had. She sighed, willed herself to relax. For him.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo fucking sexy,\u201d he groaned against her skin as he kissed his way down the swells of her breasts, laving all around the tight peaks of her nipples.</p><p>Electricity flashed through her as if someone had jolted her. Pleasure flowed between the peaks and in a straight arrow between her legs. Her first instinct was to press her thighs together, but her bindings made that impossible. She whimpered.</p><p>She could almost feel Hunter smile as he sidled closer and fastened his mouth on her breast, sucking hard at the peak.</p><p>His first strong pull was a jolt. She mewled, her entire body alive, racing. The familiar sensations blossomed, yet somehow as fresh as new spring. Pleasure, dormant since he\u2019d last touched her, now burst wide, nerve endings unfurling.</p><p>Then he slid his hand down her abdomen and into her wet folds, settling unerringly on the aching bundle of her clit. And someone she may or may not know could see her pleasure.</p><p>She put herself entirely in Hunter\u2019s hands. No control, no responsibility, no telling what would happen next. A week ago, she would have been hard-pressed to think of anything that she\u2019d tolerate less. Now, she could hardly think of anything she wanted more.</p><p>\u201cSo wet,\u201d he murmured against her skin. \u201cYou smell incredible. I\u2019m dying to taste you.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Hunter\u2019s mouth on her, driving her beyond her control while someone watched, ratcheted up her desire another notch. Kata clenched her fists, struggled to draw in her next breath as the ache between her legs tightened again.</p><p>His large, deft fingers skimmed her clit again, circling the little bud in an unpredictable rhythm that had her gasping. Every time he touched her, he shoved her to the edge of pleasure. When she could barely catch her breath, he pulled away. Her body tightened, and she bucked against her restraints.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d she murmured.</p><p>But Hunter never veered from course.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s watching us. Be a good girl and take what I give you.\u201d</p><p>God, that voice. She was willing to endure torment to please him. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Before she could take another breath, Hunter knelt at her feet and gripped her hips. Her heart stuttered with anticipation when she felt his hot breath on her pussy. Kata tensed, waiting.</p><p>The first touch of his mouth wasn\u2019t tentative or gentle. He dove in hungrily, devouring her slick flesh, his tongue slipping between her soaked folds and nestling right against her clit for a strong lap that made her rise on her toes and nearly come out of her skin. He chuckled softly, then did it again. And again. Every press of his mouth went deeper, felt more intimate, as if he meant to sate himself somehow. As if he was leaving his mark on her forever.</p><p>The pleasure soared, and Kata wanted so badly to touch Hunter in return, feel the soft stubble of his military cut under her fingers, the bulge of hard shoulders against her palms. Restrained and bound, she could only endure the delicious torture.</p><p>Suddenly, a man\u2019s heavy breaths in her ear joined the rhythm. Oh God, the stranger, she thought\u2014just as Hunter\u2019s lips seized her clit. Watching Hunter consume her was arousing the stranger. The ache between her legs coiled tighter.</p><p>Her pounding heart roared in her ears. The precipice of orgasm loomed; just one more sweet caress of Hunter\u2019s tongue would put her over the edge. Instead, he eased back. The cuffs came off her ankles, then her wrists. He rubbed them both with firm, gentle hands until she felt the warm rush of blood in her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you . . . ?\u201d She reached for him, her body boneless against his, the chafe of his slightly starched shirt and jeans against her hypersensitive skin nearly throwing her into sensory overload.</p><p>\u201cNot a word,\u201d Hunter warned with a bite in his voice and a slap of his hand on her ass.</p><p>Kata whimpered, her entire body aching. She was like a grenade with the pin pulled, going to explode at any second. His hot hand across her backside only magnified the explosion building between her legs.</p><p>\u201cTurn.\u201d He gripped her hips and faced her away from him, right at a wall of male heat that smelled like musk and pine\u2014something vaguely familiar that she couldn\u2019t place. Suddenly, she felt Hunter\u2019s harsh breath ruffling her hair, in her ear. \u201cKiss him.\u201d</p><p>The stranger? Anticipation and fear gripped her stomach at equal turns. Kata wanted to ask so badly who he was . . . but that hadn\u2019t been her fantasy. And it wasn\u2019t Hunter\u2019s will.</p><p>Firm lips brushed over hers, soft and slightly minty. Pleasant. She relaxed, opened into the kiss. The stranger pressed their lips together, brushing her tongue with his. Excitement swirled in her belly, grabbing her between the legs and pulling unmercifully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then Hunter reached around her, settling over her clit with a ruthless, rhythmic touch. \u201cNo coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>The stranger cut her off with another hard kiss, and she grabbed his solid biceps and hung on as Hunter drove her body higher. She gasped, and the stranger swallowed the sound with his mouth. This kiss was short on patience, long on hunger as he dove deep.</p><p>\u201cPull back,\u201d Hunter growled.</p><p>Immediately, the stranger tore his mouth away. Kata was still processing Hunter\u2019s command, trying to understand it. Then his fingers left her clit and rose. He painted her juice across the soft surface of her lips, top and bottom. Her stomach flipped.</p><p>\u201cKiss him again.\u201d</p><p>No hesitation. If the stranger had been determined before, he was downright demanding now, plundering her lips, licking them, soaking up her taste with a growl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too selfish to give him your orgasms,\u201d Hunter whispered in her ear. \u201cThey belong to me, but I can see he likes the taste of your pussy, honey. I want him to tease you until you scream.\u201d</p><p>Kata whimpered.</p><p>\u201cSound good, man?\u201d he asked the other man.</p><p>The stranger whispered against her lips, \u201cFuck, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Again, a slightly familiar voice, but her senses were too scattered, her body rioting.</p><p>He grabbed her face and planted another urgent kiss on her lips, short and hungry and passionate. Then he was gone, drifting down her body, his mouth trailing over her neck, the swell of her breast. He lingered to take one nipple in his mouth, nipping, sucking. She gasped and filtered her hands through his severely short hair. He chuckled against her skin.</p><p>The stranger eased down her abdomen, then dropped to his knees. She barely had a moment to feel his unwavering stare and hot pants before he opened her pussy wide with his thumbs. Kata\u2019s breath caught, as he latched on to her clit, sucking gently but deep.</p><p>She cried out, reaching behind her, wrapping desperate arms around Hunter\u2019s neck, holding on to him like a lifeline.</p><p>\u201cYou like that, honey?\u201d he whispered in her ear, his thick cock digging hard and urgent through the denim of his jeans into the curve of her ass.</p><p>She\u2019d liked it better when Hunter had gone down on her, but knowing that he was watching, that this aroused him, was a turn-on all its own. She mewled her reply.</p><p>He chuckled in her ear, moving her hair aside. Then he pressed sweeping kisses across her shoulder and thumbed her nipples until they stood stiff. The stranger\u2019s head bobbed between her legs, his tongue swiping against her hard bundle of nerves again and again. The friction nearly unraveled her. Kata focused on pushing down the orgasm, but the stranger . . . he was good. She clung to Hunter even tighter.</p><p>Him murmuring, \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking sexy, honey,\u201d only drove her higher.</p><p>God, she was so close, lava flowing hot through her veins.</p><p>\u201cEase off, man,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cShe\u2019s about to come.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, the stranger backed off, the devouring pulls of his mouth reduced to gentle licks. Kata whimpered in protest.</p><p>\u201cI told you, your orgasms are mine. But I love knowing you\u2019re on edge. Spread your legs wider for him.\u201d</p> <p>Kata bit her lip. Hunter controlled her utterly, even through another man\u2019s touch. She squirmed, perspiring, feeling overheated and needy. Hunter caressed her arms, his teeth nipping into her shoulder. She wanted more.</p><p>He turned her face toward him, and Kata pulled his head down, bringing his lips close to hers. He resisted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not complying. Do you need a spanking, Kata?\u201d</p><p>He was going to make sure the stranger kept her on the edge for as long as he liked, and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing she could do to stop it. Even as it turned her on, she wished it was his mouth touching her so intimately, his tongue driving her so close\u2014yet so far away\u2014from bliss.</p><p>Finally, she eased her thighs farther apart.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d he murmured against her lips.</p><p>With a moan, she did.</p><p>\u201cPretty. Press your hips forward,\u201d he said over her shoulder, looking down as she complied. \u201cYeah. A bit more. Perfect.\u201d</p><p>The stranger\u2019s lips were there, and he licked his way through her slit, prying her apart again so he could swirl his tongue around the base of her clit, flick over the tip. Sensation slashed through her reserve, and she jerked forward\u2014right into his waiting mouth.</p><p>He accepted the invitation immediately, opening his mouth over her pussy, sinking his tongue in deep, cradling her clit right on the flat and rubbing until the friction made her claw at Hunter desperately.</p><p>The torture went on forever, suspending her with a pleasure sharper than a bed of nails. Every sharp point dug under her skin. And Kata knew it wasn\u2019t because a stranger touched her; it was because Hunter instigated it so he could grant her fantasy.</p><p>And at some point, he was going to wrest control of her body from this man and give her everything she was dying for. The very thought drove her to the edge.</p><p>\u201cBack off,\u201d Hunter instructed. \u201cShe\u2019s close again.\u201d</p><p>The stranger unleashed a frustrated groan but backed away. Hunter rounded her until he stood beside the stranger. Cool air rushed over her overheated skin as she heard the rustle of cloth. Were they getting naked? Goose pimples broke out all over her body.</p><p>Then the powerful press of hands on her shoulders urged her down before Hunter spoke. \u201cOn your knees.\u201d</p><p>Those words pinged shock through her system. Did he want her to suck off a stranger while he watched? A foreign thrill mingled with discomfort. Could she do it? Did he really want her to, or was this just him granting her the fantasy that he\u2019d ended the night they met?</p><p>\u201cKata.\u201d A warning, stern, harsh.</p><p>To please him, she could do this. Succumbing to the pressure of his hands, his voice, she fell to her knees onto the plush carpet.</p><p>A gentle hand stroked her hair from peak to crown before urging her forward. The velvet head of a stiff cock met her lips. Gingerly, she opened, not certain who it belonged to. As soon as she licked the crown, Kata knew this wasn\u2019t Hunter. This man tasted salty, woodsy, earthy\u2014foreign. The stranger groaned.</p><p>\u201cDeeper,\u201d Hunter demanded. \u201cTo the back of your throat.\u201d</p><p>The command ricocheted around inside her, an erotic blend of shock, forbidden thrill, and a desire to please. She opened her mouth, stroking her tongue along the underside of the thick erection, then swallowing it as deep as she could.</p><p>The stranger\u2019s smothered groan told her that she\u2019d gotten to him. So she did it again.</p><p>As she opened her mouth to take a third pass at the stranger, Hunter gathered up her hair in his fist and tugged her away from the other cock to his own. His familiar weight and taste hit her tongue, and her arousal soared. This was what she wanted. He was who she wanted.</p><p>If this was their last night together, she didn\u2019t want a fantasy inspired by an old book fulfilled; she wanted every bit of Hunter. Their relationship might be futile, and she might be too scared to hope that they belonged together forever, but she couldn\u2019t deny that she loved him.</p><p>Kata eagerly devoured Hunter\u2019s cock, taking him all the way to her throat. Lovingly, she wrapped her tongue around him, laved the head, plumped her lips at the crown, then repeated the process.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d the expletive slipped past Hunter\u2019s lips. His hands tightened in her hair. \u201cGod, I love your mouth.\u201d</p><p>And she loved pleasing him. Knowing that her lovers were satisfied in the past had been good enough for her, but Kata wanted to be Hunter\u2019s best, the one he couldn\u2019t forget. Selfish? Probably. But she knew damn well she\u2019d never forget him.</p><p>Tonight, she wanted to soak in every memory she could.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she admitted, breathing against the ridges of his abdomen. \u201cIs it okay if I only want you?\u201d</p><p>In a heartbeat, Hunter lifted her to her feet, gripped her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re sure? This is supposed to be your fantasy, the one I took from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to share me?\u201d She reached for the blindfold to tear it off.</p><p>The stranger\u2019s hands stopped her. \u201cIf I\u2019m not staying, I\u2019d rather just slip out anonymously,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Kata lowered her hands, then sidled closer to Hunter.</p><p>He cupped her face in his hands. \u201cHoney, I never want to share you. If I had my way . . . Well, I think you know.\u201d He pressed a hard kiss to her mouth, then turned to the other guy. \u201cBeat feet, man.\u201d</p><p>The stranger groaned, but after a rustle of cloth and the creak of the door, he was gone.</p><p>Hunter ripped off her blindfold. \u201cWe\u2019re alone. Whatever happens next is your call, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIn every way you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? I won\u2019t go easy on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Please, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, looking as if he had something to say. Then, with a nod, he directed her across the room to a sawhorse-looking item and bent her over it. She went without a word.</p><p>After flipping on every light in the room, Hunter clipped her wrists into cuffs on the sides, then repeated the process with her ankles at the front of the equipment. Then he grabbed her hips, lined his cock up with the empty ache between her legs, and plunged so deep in one stroke, she knew she\u2019d never be the same.</p><p>Covering her back with his powerful body, he thrust into her with a frightening, lightning pace, then growled in her ear, \u201cNo one feels like you. No one will ever replace you.\u201d</p><p>Kata clawed the side of the wooden apparatus, shoving back against him. The pleasure she\u2019d been holding off when the stranger\u2019s mouth had been on her soared again, this time undeniable. Her heart beat, swelled.</p><p>Deep, then deeper Hunter forged and thrust, claiming her utterly. She clenched on him, and he brushed over her wet curls, strumming over her clit. \u201cI\u2019ve had the most fucking vivid fantasies of you as mine always, bare pussy, a little ring piercing the hood of your clit so my tongue would always have a toy to drive you mad . . . matching rings in your nipples with little weights a constant tug. If I got to keep you, honey, I\u2019d want my stamp of possession on every inch of you. I\u2019d want to see it, touch you every damn day, possess every part of you. I\u2019d be the most attentive lover and husband ever.\u201d He closed his eyes, groaned loudly.</p><p>His words were driving her up. The vision exploded through Kata\u2019s brain. Her pussy clamped down on him again, her muscles gripping him. He wanted her bare? Pierced? She\u2019d never considered doing that for a lover, refused to alter herself to please any man. But the thought of doing it for Hunter made her beyond hot.</p><p>His slick fingers glided over her clit again. She gasped, teetering right on the edge again.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, honey.\u201d</p><p>\"Hunter . . . please.\u201d</p><p>He gripped her waist possessively and pounded into her again, again. \u201cI know. I fucking know.\u201d His growl was like a curse. It dripped need, bled desperation. \u201cIf you come, I\u2019ll follow you, and I\u2019m not ready to let you go yet.\u201d</p><p>Kata wasn\u2019t sure she was ready to let him go, either. Parting was smart and would save them heartache in the long run, but . . . she clenched her fists, desperately wishing that she could touch him.</p><p>\u201cDeep,\u201d she begged. \u201cSlow. Love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He set up a grinding, excruciating pace, an unhurried pounding that had her babbling in incoherent pleas for relief.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d He slammed into her again. \u201cSo fucking much. I can\u2019t hold back. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>With those words she detonated with a throaty wail. He stole her breath, her mind\u2014and every bit of her heart. Behind her, he stiffened and roared, pulsing inside her as she gripped him fist-tight, taking everything from him that he could give. Tears burned her eyes, ran down her cheeks. Hunter did this to her every time, ripped her open, stripped her to her core, connected them stronger, deeper.</p><p>He gripped his fist in her hair and tugged until her mouth was under his, then covered her lips with his own. He moaned into her, and Kata felt him all the way through her body, deep down to her heart.</p><p>With a groan, he withdrew and unclipped her quickly, then turned her into his arms, pressing her damp body against his sweat-drenched skin. Their heartbeats fused together as he took her mouth again and carried her across the hall, to the cozy bedroom.</p><p>He set her on the bed, then crawled in after her. \u201cLet me hold you.\u201d</p><p>Jumbled and exhausted, Kata nodded mutely. She didn\u2019t want to let him go\u2014ever. He aroused her, inflamed her, challenged her. Tonight, he\u2019d pushed her farther than ever, and she\u2019d given all she could. What if . . . she asked him not to sign the papers?</p><p>What had changed? He\u2019d still be so much like his father, and she was apparently too much like her mother. Eventually, they\u2019d make each other miserable. She had to let the inevitable happen.</p><p>With her heart breaking, she turned into his arms and sobbed.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>HUNTER never closed his eyes. Kata snuggled up beside him now, though he\u2019d rolled her over twice in the past few hours and taken her again, a deep, soft fusing of mouths and bodies until she cried out in ecstasy beneath him. She\u2019d slipped into an exhausted sleep afterward, and as much as he wanted to slip inside the tight clasp of her pussy and make love to her again, he couldn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Desperation tightened every muscle in his body. He was leaving her for all the right reasons. She\u2019d submitted beautifully tonight . . . but she insisted that she wasn\u2019t built for this in the long run. After meeting Gordon, Hunter knew why she thought so; he just didn\u2019t agree. And he couldn\u2019t force her to conquer all her fears for him. As much as he hated the way his parents had split up, the Colonel was right. Hunter couldn\u2019t hold Kata against her will. She had to want to stay. She had to want to conquer her own fears.</p><p>They were fucking doomed.</p><p>He glanced at the clock. Almost three a.m. He could measure the time they had left together in seconds, and it was ripping him apart. What the hell was he going to do with the enormous void she\u2019d leave in his heart? No one was ever going to fill it. The best Hunter could hope for was that, someday, she\u2019d be happy.</p><p>On the bedside table, his cell phone vibrated. Quickly, he snatched it up. Jack\u2019s name popped up on his display. His time with Kata was up.</p> <p>He went into high alert. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>Jack heaved a long sigh. \u201cWe found Cortez Villarreal. He never appeared at Sexy Sirens, so we had to hunt him down at a rundown meth lab here in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Hunter sat up, easing Kata\u2019s head onto a pillow, then anchoring his feet on the floor.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead. According to the homicide detective, he\u2019s been dead for somewhere between forty-eight and seventy-two hours.\u201d</p><p>Shit. That probably explained why no one else had come after Kata since Silva had taken potshots at her. Villarreal probably hadn\u2019t had time to hire anyone else before his untimely demise.</p> <p>\u201cCause of death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullet to the brain. This was gang style, all the way. In fact, one of Villarreal\u2019s rivals is taking credit. He\u2019s got details of the murder that no one but the killer would know. It\u2019s legit. I swiped Villarreal\u2019s cell phone and laptop before the cops arrived. If they have anything, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>Relief eased through Hunter. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>They hung up, and he opened the blinds so the silvery moonlight rushed in, glowing over Kata\u2019s skin. He stared at her with a sigh. This was it. The end. He had no reason to linger here . . . except that he loved her. Since it looked as if the danger to Kata had passed, he\u2019d ask Jack and Deke to watch over her for a while, just in case. But he\u2019d promised to sign her divorce papers and get out of her life. Even if it fucking killed him, he\u2019d live up to his word.</p><p>Swallowing, he grabbed his phone and flipped it to camera mode. Just one image. He needed it, his own personal heaven and hell. Hunter wanted to remember Kata like this, his wife, in his bed, her soft expression sated, peaceful.</p><p>As soon as he clicked the button, he glanced at the picture, knowing this would be the first of a million times he\u2019d look at it. The image was perfect. She looked absolutely beautiful and lush, her lips swollen, her hair in a wild tangle, almost covering the swells of her breasts . . . but not quite.</p> <p>Squelching all his urges to wake her, take her, try to reason with her again, Hunter rose and shoved into his jeans. He dug into his pocket and fished out the rumpled papers inside and flattened them out. The word \u201cDivorce\u201d screamed out from the top of the first page. Cursing, he flipped to the back and saw Kata\u2019s signature. Beside it sat a blank line, ready for him to add his name and legally declare this union over. He grabbed a pen, hesitated, damn near choking on rage and grief.</p><p>If the divorce would make her happy, he loved her enough to let her go.</p><p>Hunter pressed the pen to the page and forced himself to scrawl his name at the bottom. Resisting the urge to slam the pen down, he set it down gently, leaving both on the nightstand.</p><p>Before he could think any harder, he tossed on the rest of his clothes and headed for the door. One last time he glanced back at Kata sleeping in a lush tangle of silky hair, soft arms, and cotton sheets. His heart twisted in his chest. But there was nothing left to say or do, except leave.</p><p>He shut the door behind him with a quiet click. The finality of it swept desolation through him. Hunter leaned against the door, scrubbed a hand down his face.</p><p>Never had he done anything this fucking hard. He felt like he was breaking into a million pieces.</p><p>Suddenly, Tyler appeared in the hall. \u201cYou gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He glanced back at the closed door. \u201cTake her back to my dad when she wakes up. Thanks for the offer to drive Kata and her mom to Lafayette.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave to go back anyway.\u201d Tyler shrugged, sandy hair falling over his green eyes. \u201cYou sure you want to do this? Kata is a hell of a woman.\u201d</p><p>Fresh anguish swept through Hunter. In his head, he knew it wasn\u2019t Tyler\u2019s fault, but that didn\u2019t stop him from grabbing the guy\u2019s shirt and slamming him against the wall. \u201cI know how you feel about other men\u2019s wives. Even though I signed those divorce papers, she is never available to you. I will dismantle you limb from limb if you ever touch her. And last night never happened.\u201d</p><p>With a pointed glance at Hunter\u2019s fist in his shirt, Tyler went very still. \u201cYou done making an ass of yourself?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he probably had, Hunter conceded\u2014and released Tyler.</p><p>The guy smoothed out his shirt. \u201cLike you said when you invited me, I\u2019m in love with someone else. But I gotta tell you, I think you\u2019re bailing prematurely. Kata\u2019s definitely got feelings for you.\u201d</p><p>Feelings, yes. But those feelings didn\u2019t trump her fear, and he wasn\u2019t sure they ever would. Hunter loved her. He wished like hell that was enough.</p><p>KATA woke as the first rays of sun crept into the bedroom. Hunter! She opened her eyes, only to find the rest of the bed empty. She touched a trembling hand to the sheets where he\u2019d lain. It was cold.</p><p>Just beyond, on the nightstand, familiar, rumpled pieces of oncecrisp paper lay faceup, all pages folded back at the staple to reveal the last one. A black pen lay ominously on top.</p><p>Dread banged through her, like mute cymbals crashing, their silence deafening.</p><p>As if they might bite her, Kata eased her hand toward the papers, picking them up slowly. A glance told her that Hunter had signed. In a few short months, they would no longer be husband and wife.</p><p>No, no, no!</p><p>Kata closed her eyes, and tears welled up. Everything between them last night had been perfect. If she could survive one night under his domination, she could do it again. And again. Couldn\u2019t she? Hunter would never hurt her, never mean to run roughshod over her. Had she let the best man to ever come into her life go because she was too damn afraid to trust her heart?</p><p>Sobbing, Kata reached out for his pillow, dragging it to her chest. God, it smelled like him, wood, summer rain, and pure male. She clutched the pillow tighter against her body.</p><p>\u201cHe left a few hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Gasping, Kata turned toward the voice. Tyler emerged from a chair in the dark corner across the room. He stood, approached. His musky-pine scent drifted across the room. Memories slammed her. He had been her stranger last night.</p><p>Instantly, her face flamed, her body twinged . . . but she clutched the pillow even tighter to her bare breasts. The thought of touching Tyler now left her cold. They might have been intimate the night before, but this was morning. All her intimacy belonged to Hunter, the man who had given Kata her wish . . . and her nightmare.</p><p>He winced. \u201cWow, didn\u2019t take you long to figure last night out. While it might be interesting to proposition you, Hunter would kill me. And you\u2019re not interested.\u201d</p><p>Sadness settled into the shadows around his strong face, and Kata\u2019s heart went out to him. She wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever seen such loneliness on a man. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with Luc\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that. I\u2019ll give you a minute to . . .\u201d He looked at the neatly folded pile of clothes on the nearby table. \u201cDress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she choked out. \u201cDid he say anything when he left?\u201d</p><p>Kata was almost afraid of the answer, but she had to know.</p><p>\u201cVillarreal is dead. As planned, last night Jack and Deke hunted him down, found his body. We think someone in his own gang killed him. The threat is over.\u201d</p><p>Wow. So that was everything.</p><p>As planned? Kata paused, frowned . . . then something dawned on her. Last night hadn\u2019t only been about saying good-bye. He\u2019d hidden her until he knew she was safe, and he\u2019d bribed her with the divorce she\u2019d been fighting him for since their marriage began just so she wouldn\u2019t run home and put herself in danger. He\u2019d done that, at his own expense, for her.</p><p>Kata\u2019s heart plummeted to her knees. Pain battered her . . . even as love welled up. She bit her lip, shoving down an urge to bury her face in her hands and cry. No matter how he felt, he\u2019d promised to live up to his end of the deal. He might take control from her in the bedroom, but when it counted, he\u2019d given her the ultimate power.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, he was one miserable bastard. That man loves you.\u201d</p><p>No, hearing that wasn\u2019t any consolation at all. She felt fucking wretched.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Maybe they could talk, slow things down while she got her head together, work it out. His leave wasn\u2019t over for another thirty hours.</p><p>Pity crossed Tyler\u2019s face. \u201cGone. His CO cut his leave short again. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s out of the country by this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>For at least six months. Oh, God. She wrapped her arms around her middle and fought new tears. God, this couldn\u2019t be the end, not this way.</p><p>He closed the distance between them and put an awkward arm around her. \u201cI\u2019ll um . . . there\u2019s juice and toast ready in the kitchen once you\u2019re dressed.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he stepped out, Kata swiped away the tears on her cheeks and tossed on her clothes. She stalked down the hall to the cheerful kitchen and the smell of burned wheat with peanut butter.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your phone?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Tyler shook his head. \u201cUnless you\u2019re really sure you want Hunter for good, let it go. Don\u2019t jerk his heart around anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut can you live with him? The way he is?\u201d Torment whipped across Tyler\u2019s face, and he blew out a tense breath. \u201cDon\u2019t start this if you\u2019re not sure. Alyssa did that to me before she married Luc. She cared, but . . . she didn\u2019t want what I wanted. Once, she tried.\u201d He shook his head with a curse. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make it far before she called it off. It fucking crushed me. I\u2019m not it for her; I get it, but I wish she hadn\u2019t tried me on for size. It would have been easier if she\u2019d just walked away.\u201d</p><p>Kata\u2019s heart stuttered. Was she ready to be with Hunter in every way he needed? Last night, he hadn\u2019t enslaved her. She\u2019d felt strong, connected. So empowered that she\u2019d let go. But was she ready to be with him that way for a lifetime?</p><p>\u201cIf you have to think about it that long, then you\u2019re not sure.\u201d</p><p>She tried to swallow down a rush of denial, but it bubbled back up. \u201cHe won\u2019t be home for months, and by then he may have moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he isn\u2019t for you, then you\u2019ll have moved on, too. Problem solved.\u201d</p><p>At the moment, with her lips still swollen from Hunter\u2019s kisses and his scent still clinging to her, Kata didn\u2019t believe that, for her, Hunter would ever be solved.</p><p>AFTER forcing down some of the extra-crispy toast and too-tart juice, Kata rode in silence with Tyler back to the Colonel\u2019s house. Logan greeted her in jeans and a white tank clinging to a body slabbed with muscle that obviously got a lot of exercise. He sent her a cold glare but let her in, locking up tight behind her.</p><p>\u201cYour mother is upstairs. She wants to talk to you.\u201d He turned away.</p><p>Kata grabbed his arm. \u201cDid Hunter come by here before he left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Logan stood almost frozen\u2014except for the living fury on his face. \u201cHe signed your papers, despite the fact it killed him. If you ever fuck him over again, I swear I won\u2019t be responsible for what I do to you.\u201d</p><p>With that growled warning, he turned and marched to the back of the house, slamming cabinets in the kitchen as he went. Kata flinched, then pressed a trembling hand to her mouth. She\u2019d really, truly hurt Hunter. She\u2019d been so wrapped up in her own fears that she hadn\u2019t really seen the depth of his pain. God, that realization hammered guilt through her. What the hell had she done?</p><p>\u201cKata?\u201d her mother called down the stairs.</p><p>With a sigh, she rubbed her hands down her jeans, then ascended two steps at a time. If Mam\u00e1 wanted to talk to her this early in the morning, something was up. Maybe hearing her mother\u2019s problems would take her mind off her own. \u201cYeah, coming.\u201d</p><p>At the top of the landing, she glanced into the airy bedroom the Colonel had settled her mother into, right beside his own. She rocked in an antique wooden chair, a thoughtful smile on her face. That peaceful look wasn\u2019t her mother at all.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Kata greeted, testing the waters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMija!\u201d Then she frowned. \u201cYou need a shower. And some way to cover the love bite on your neck.\u201d</p><p>Instinctively, Kata raised her hands to cover herself. Hell, Hunter had a propensity to leave behind his mark when he made love to her.</p><p>And she\u2019d never have another mark of his possession. More misery pressed down on her, and she choked back fresh tears. This was about her mother now. Her own heartbreak could wait. God knew, she\u2019d have a lifetime of it to deal with it.</p><p>She pasted on a plastic smile. \u201cHow are you feeling today? You look better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel better. I am at peace for the first time in years. You can thank Hunter for that.\u201d</p><p>Kata sent her mother a puzzled stare. \u201cBecause he took you away from Gordon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he urged me to talk to his father. Caleb and I are fine now. We will be good friends, I think. He is a good man. They both are.\u201d</p><p>Good friends? \u201cYesterday, you couldn\u2019t stand the overbearing man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter pointed that out to him. They had something of an argument . . . which I overheard. Do not worry about me, Mija.\u201d Her mother grabbed her hand and squeezed. \u201cI will recover here with Caleb. I am going to divorce Gordon and go back into nursing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d She\u2019d decided all of that in one night?</p><p>At Mam\u00e1\u2019s broad smile and nod, joy infused Kata, sugary . . . but bittersweet. She had tried for years to help her mother see another future but had encountered one barrier after another. Enter Hunter. He\u2019d gently taken charge of Mam\u00e1. In doing so, he\u2019d given Kata another precious gift. She\u2019d be eternally grateful to him. Even if her life was falling apart, Mam\u00e1 was getting hers together. That meant so, so much to Kata.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d She hugged her mother. \u201cThis will be good for you. Mari will be completely over the moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed so when I called her this morning, yes.\u201d Then something sad flitted across her face. \u201cMy sweet girl, why did you not talk to me? I cannot tell you how sorry I am that I set a poor example for you. I made you doubt yourself and cost you a marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d She wanted to reassure her mother. \"I . . .\u201d What? She couldn\u2019t reassure her mother that she\u2019d played no role in it. \u201cThe decision not to stay in the marriage was mine.\u201d</p><p>Mam\u00e1\u2019s expression chided her. \u201cS\u00ed, because of me. I heard Hunter and Caleb arguing. It never occurred to me that you would be afraid to become like me. You?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt is impossible. You are so strong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe today, but look what the years with Gordon have done to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I let them. It was not that I lacked strength to stand up to him; I lacked will.\u201d Her mom squeezed her hand. \u201cWhen your father died, I was barely thirty-three. With three growing children, no money, and a broken heart, what was I to do? When I met Gordon, he seemed like the answer to my problems. Believe me, I knew not long after the wedding that the solution was not perfect. Joaquin hated him after he overheard Gordon talk down to me. But you kids had a roof, food, good schools. Me, I did not matter so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMam\u00e1, you married him for money? For us kids?\u201d Until now, she\u2019d never hinted that the union had been anything but a love match.</p><p>\u201cIt is not the first time a woman has put her children before herself. Gordon knew I did not love him, and this made him feel small, I think. So he made me feel small in return. After Joaquin moved out, and the doctors and I lost that little boy during surgery . . .\u201d she shrugged. \u201cWell, every day I felt my love of life dimming. I no longer cared that Gordon treated me badly. The routine of seeing to him and the house was numbing, especially after the car accident. For that, I was grateful.\u201d</p><p>Kata shook her head slowly, shock racing through her brain. \u201cAll this time you acted as if Gordon was the man for you, but you knew . . .\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI did not want you kids to feel any guilt for my choices. After I turned forty and shattered my foot ... I resigned myself to life with Gordon. I was no longer young or had most of my life ahead of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong!\u201d Kata insisted. \u201cYou\u2019re wonderful and deserve every happiness. Sometimes you have to fight for it and go after what you want, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right, Kata?\u201d Mam\u00e1 sent her one of those cat-that-ate-the-canary smiles. \u201cHave you fought for Hunter? He may be demanding and, at times, difficult. He is, after all, a man. But it\u2019s unlike you not to chase what you want. Your zest for life reminds me of your father. He never let anything stand in his way.\u201d She frowned. \u201cAll this time, I never imagined that you were keeping men at a distance for fear of becoming like me.\u201d</p> <p>When Mam\u00e1 put it like that, her behavior sounded cowardly. \u201cI\u2019d watched Gordon browbeat you. I knew that you had to be unhappy, but you didn\u2019t say so, didn\u2019t change the situation.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes softened with love. \u201cKata, you have always had far more courage and strength than I, at least until Hunter. I let your father\u2019s death and Gordon\u2019s behavior take mine from me, but you . . . I am proud of you, Mija. Do not make the wrong choices simply because I did. If Hunter is the other half of your heart, you should not let him get away.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what she\u2019d done, let fears and dark possibilities ruin her chance to be happy.</p><p>\u201cHunter overwhelms me sometimes, and I thought . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat if you stayed long enough you would become me? He knows that. Today he returns to active duty and will not be home until Christmas. You have time to sort this out. He will need the time to think, to heal. Never fear, Mija. I believe he will come back still as in love with you as ever.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since Hunter had promised to sign their divorce papers, she genuinely smiled.</p><p>ACROSS the street from Kata\u2019s apartment, Hunter sat in the Colonel\u2019s Jeep. He\u2019d driven to Lafayette this morning to talk to Jack and Deke, see Villarreal\u2019s body for himself. That grim task behind him, he had a few hours to kill until he had to jump on a plane and head back to Venezuela.</p><p>Barnes was smoking crack if he thought all the men he sent on this mission were going to make it back alive. So he\u2019d spent a little time this morning making sure the navy was informed of his change in marital status. If he died before the divorce was final, no reason Kata shouldn\u2019t have everything she was entitled to as a SEAL\u2019s widow.</p><p>He also visited Kata\u2019s sister. As an attorney, he figured she didn\u2019t see many clients on Saturday. As he\u2019d predicted though, she\u2019d made an exception for him, and agreed to meet with him, in fact was beyond eager to see him. And unload on him. After a little heart-to-heart, Mari still didn\u2019t love him . . . but she knew the score, knew that he would always love her sister. He had the skeleton of a nice, new will, leaving everything to Kata, as a result of the meeting.</p><p>Shifting in the leather seat as the early June afternoon heated up, Hunter stared out the tinted windshield. The only thing that was missing now was for Tyler to drop Kata off safely on his way home. He\u2019d fight down the urge to go to her and persuade her that last night wasn\u2019t a fluke, that she could be both a strong woman and his sweet submissive and still respect herself tomorrow.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t figured it out yet . . . chances were that she wasn\u2019t going to. For her sake, he had to let it go.</p><p>On the seat beside him, his cell phone vibrated. Jack\u2019s name popped up. Hadn\u2019t they already hashed most of the crap about Villarreal?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he barked into the phone.</p><p>\u201cPlenty. You\u2019ve got good instincts. Sure you don\u2019t want a job with Deke and me?\u201d</p><p>Maybe if he and Kata had a future and\u2014He cut the thought off. Pointless. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Jack sighed. \u201cI scanned Villarreal\u2019s phone. Deke scrubbed his computer. It\u2019s all the normal criminal shit, calls to local thugs and drug dealers. There\u2019s just one thing missing . . . No sign of communication between your boy and the assassin. He hasn\u2019t talked to anyone out of the 337 area code in the last month. Unless someone was hiring a hit man on his behalf, Villarreal didn\u2019t hire Manuel Silva.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s blood ran cold. His first instinct had been that Villarreal was too small-time for a hit like that. In the absence of any other evidence or suspect, he\u2019d let himself be swayed by circumstantial shit.</p><p>He pounded his fist on the steering wheel. \u201cGoddamn it to hell! I\u2019ve got to get on a plane in two fucking hours, and I have no idea who\u2019s trying to kill my wife. Or why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one else in her life who would want her dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Her mother thinks she\u2019s a saint. Her sister adores her. Brother is all but MIA with work undercover somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe buddy who set you two up in the first place? Could he be the jealous type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen? Hell no. If he wanted to kill anyone, it would be me. But he won\u2019t fuck with me. I\u2019ll wipe the floor with him. I\u2019ve done it before and have no problem doing it again. \u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure I\u2019d want to cross you.\u201d</p><p>Hunter snorted. \u201cThat would be an ugly fucking fight. Man, I\u2019ve got to solve this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no one in her life who would want her dead,\u201d Jack mulled. \u201cHow about someone in yours?\u201d</p><p>Hunter paused. That didn\u2019t seem possible . . . but he couldn\u2019t afford to rule anything out now without examining the possibility thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cJealous ex-girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He hadn\u2019t done much more than one-night stands in years. Once he\u2019d joined a team, his love life had been one of the first casualties.</p><p>\u201cAnyone who would want to hurt you by hitting where it counted?\u201d</p><p>The list of assholes who wanted to hurt him was probably long and would take too long to cull. Better to just take the logical approach.</p><p>Pushing down the panic threatening to eat away at his composure, he walked through the sequence of events. \u201cIf someone I knew wanted to hurt me by killing Kata . . . who even knew last Sunday when Silva attacked her that we\u2019d married the night before? The people we partied with that night, whom we\u2019ve never seen again. Ben, who wouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d Hunter kept moving forward chronologically. He\u2019d only told one other person before that attack on Kata.</p><p>He froze.</p><p>\u201cAndy Barnes.\u201d He gripped the steering wheel, suspicion and fury poisoning his veins. \u201cMy CO.\u201d</p><p>If he was truly guilty, Hunter vowed to rip the fucker apart limb from limb.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he want your wife dead?\u201d</p><p>Motive was the big question mark. \u201cWe used to be buddies. His last promotion was one I turned down first. We\u2019ve come up the ranks together. I always thought it was a friendly rivalry, but since this last promotion, he\u2019s turned into a prick.\u201d</p><p>Jack started tapping on a keyboard, the clacking sounds audible through the phone. \u201cGive me all the info you\u2019ve got on him. Full name, DOB, anything.\u201d</p><p>Hunter had always had a head for numbers, and he thanked God now that it hadn\u2019t deserted him. In minutes he spit out Barnes\u2019 DOB, phone number, address, and a few other miscellaneous facts.</p><p>Less than a minute later, Jack whistled long and low. \u201cI just tapped into your CO\u2019s phone records. He makes a lot of calls to South America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a surprise.\u201d They had contacts down in Venezuela, informants and former government officials who didn\u2019t like the way their country was headed now. \u201cBut he did ask quite a few questions about Kata.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Saturday, he made a flurry of phone calls to a mobile phone in New Orleans. They stopped abruptly on Sunday. And based on his financials, he wasn\u2019t in particularly good shape until he received a small wire transfer Sunday morning. It\u2019s the kind of amount that makes me think it\u2019s a down payment on a bigger job, you know. But the payoff hasn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>Because Kata was still alive.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who Barnes would be taking from . . .\u201d Hunter skimmed his interactions with his CO. It had to be work related, and in the last two years, he\u2019d devoted most of his missions to stopping Sotillo and his thugs. \u201cShit, Barnes cut my leave short to send me back to Venezuela tonight, to intercept a meeting between a drug lord and an arms dealer. The last mission with that objective was a waste. This one is suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he wants you out of the way. Oh, your CO just received a text from someone with a Venezuelan mobile phone. It says, \u2018Reaching target\u2019s apartment in three minutes.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Venezuelan? Someone from Sotillo\u2019s gang?</p><p>Hunter\u2019s heart nearly fucking stopped in his chest. Maybe Andy had hired a new assassin to kill Kata. \u201cCan you trace the number?\u201d</p><p>A long pause and a few clicks later, Jack sighed. \u201cDisposable phone.\u201d</p><p>Shit, no tracking the possible assassin that way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Someone in Sotillo\u2019s organization wanted Kata dead. But why? To crush Hunter by killing his wife? If so, why not wait until he was out of the country, where he couldn\u2019t protect Kata? Whatever the motivation, Hunter knew that if Barnes was on the take and the Sotillo organization planned to make a move on her now, this was going to get ugly.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>AS soon as Hunter asked Jack and Deke to come for backup, they ended the call; then he sent a text to Tyler not to let Kata out of his sight. Tyler didn\u2019t answer, but he\u2019d called earlier to say they were en route to Kata\u2019s apartment. That probably meant they were still driving.</p><p>Briefly, he considered calling someone above Barnes\u2019 head, but the chances of reaching anyone willing to set aside politics and make a quick decision was about nil. Besides, this was going to go down too fast. He\u2019d ask for forgiveness later. Fuck permission.</p> <p>Formulating a plan, Hunter took stock of his surroundings. Nothing suspicious, just kids playing in the park ahead, people starting their weekend errands, and joggers atoning for the week\u2019s laziness. Rush to Kata\u2019s place and secure it or wait here and see if he could head the assassin off at the pass?</p><p>Hunter no sooner thought the question when Tyler pulled up and parked his black truck at the curb across the street, in front of her apartment complex. Hunter watched through the tinted windshield of the Colonel\u2019s Jeep as Tyler climbed out, his gaze crawling all over their surroundings, then came around to help Kata with her suitcase. She\u2019d showered, dressed, and looked so lush. His heart twisted in his chest.</p><p>Hunter wanted to rush out of the vehicle and warn them, but in case the assassin had them in his sights, he stayed put. He didn\u2019t want to give up the element of surprise unless forced. Instead, he watched.</p><p>Tyler set his hand at the small of her back and helped her into the atrium-style complex. Hunter wished the guy would get his paw off Kata, but if Tyler protected her, Hunter would let it go.</p><p>Soon, they disappeared down a shaded path between a cluster of buildings. Still, he didn\u2019t see anyone following them.</p> <p>It was now or never. From the seat beside him, Hunter grabbed his SIG and tucked it into his waistband, then shoved an extra round of cartridges in his pocket. He slammed out of the vehicle, dodging traffic as he crossed the busy public street, and followed the others at a discreet distance, ducking behind trees and bushes for cover.</p><p>Still, Hunter didn\u2019t see anyone or anything that looked out of place, and that made the hair at the back of his neck prickle. He had a bad feeling that this was all going to go down\u2014quickly.</p><p>Tyler followed Kata down the path paved in river rock as she fished the keys from her purse and headed for the stairs. They rounded a corner, then disappeared from sight. Hunter cursed and grabbed the gun from his waistband, ready for anything. He hated to potentially involve any civilian who might trek this path, but if they saw him and got out of the way or, even better\u2014called the police\u2014Hunter was all for it.</p><p>Watching for danger and innocent bystanders, he followed the signs affixed to the sides of the buildings that denoted the apartments in any given building. From reading Kata\u2019s driver\u2019s license last weekend, he remembered that she lived in unit 251D. He wished he could get ahead of her and secure the perimeter, but they\u2019d reach the apartment way before him. Fuck.</p><p>Creeping behind a tree nearly choked by Spanish moss, he caught sight of the two again, this time climbing a set of stairs to her unit, Tyler carrying the suitcase in one meaty hand as Kata reached the door and unlocked it.</p><p>Hunter held his breath as he began creeping up the stairs until he could just see above the next rise. Kata opened the door, pushed her way in. Tyler followed.</p> <p>Suddenly, gunfire erupted. Tyler shouted. Glass shattered. Then Kata let loose a bloodcurdling scream.</p><p>Adrenaline spiking, Hunter ran for the door as quietly as he could. He didn\u2019t want to spook her or tip off the assassin to his presence. But he had to get up there and fight to keep her safe.</p><p>During a mission, he could block out his anxiety and simply focus on the tasks at hand. This wasn\u2019t a mission, though. This was his wife. His heart drummed so loudly in his chest that he couldn\u2019t hear whether his feet slapping the pavement were too loud . . . or whether Kata was begging for her life.</p><p>He\u2019d likely have seconds to kill this motherfucker before he killed Kata\u2014if he hadn\u2019t already. Shoving the thought aside, Hunter forced himself to focus. If he started thinking she was already dead, he\u2019d fall apart.</p><p>The door hung wide-open. As he reached the top, he saw blood. The sun streaming through the jagged shards of a broken picture window along the back wall blinded him for a moment. As he hit the door in a crouch, shielded his eyes, and stepped inside, Tyler was nowhere in sight. What Hunter could see made his heart stop.</p><p>V\u00edctor Sotillo stood in the open doorway, his back to the enormous shattered window, using Kata as a shield. He held a gun to her temple. She shivered, her body shuddering with wide-eyed terror. Hunter wished like hell that he could comfort her. But he had to get her away from Sotillo, save her, first.</p><p>Hunter wondered how this was possible. Was he seeing a fucking ghost?</p><p>\u201cDrop your gun,\u201d the drug lord demanded.</p> <p>If he did, everything would be over. The man had no mercy and wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill Kata\u2014or incapacitate him and make him watch. Hunter had to come up with plan B.</p><p>Hunter could only imagine that Sotillo had shot Tyler and the blast had propelled him out the window, to his death. He shoved down the regret and dread.</p><p>\u201cHow are you still alive?\u201d Hunter didn\u2019t really give a shit, but if it bought him time until Jack and Deke showed up, maybe he and Kata would make it out alive. \u201cI shot you in the chest.\u201d</p><p>Sotillo\u2019s mustache curved up, along with his thin lips. \u201cModern medicine, it is a miracle, yes? I . . . how do you say, flatlined on the way to the hospital. But the very talented doctors revived me, so here I am.\u201d Then his face darkened. \u201cThey were unable to save my brother after your bullet lodged right in his chest.\u201d</p><p>Damn, he\u2019d shot the wrong brother. That mistake might cost him everything. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, V\u00edctor. From what I hear, Adan was a much better human being.\u201d</p><p>Rage gripped Sotillo, and he jammed the gun harder against Kata\u2019s head. \u201cAdan was a good man. It is your fault he\u2019s gone. You and your team attacked us as we were leaving my abuelita\u2019s house. You killed him.\u201d</p><p>His grandmother\u2019s house? Bullshit. If he\u2019d gone to visit an old lady, why were there so many armed thugs and little baggies stuffed with white powder strewn all around the place?</p><p>And Andy had lied about Adan being alive and running the cartel, likely to hide the fact that V\u00edctor was still alive.</p><p>Hunter caught her gaze and tried to send a calming vibe. He needed her to understand that she wasn\u2019t alone. She still shivered, but anger had overtaken some of her fear. She was getting pissed.</p><p>Excellent. There was the Kata he knew and loved. She was going to have to fight to make it out of here alive. The chances of them both making it out . . . well, the odds of a cataclysmic asteroid hitting the earth were probably better.</p><p>\u201cSo what? You want to kill me, V\u00edctor?\u201d</p><p>Kata\u2019s eyes went wide, silently asking if he\u2019d gone crazy. He ignored her encroaching panic.</p><p>Sotillo shook his head. \u201cSuffering the anguish of loss is much harder to bear than simply closing your eyes forever. I want you to feel that void like a bleeding wound. Originally, I asked Barnes to return you to duty today. I arranged to sneak into the country this morning. My transportation was scheduled to leave tomorrow, but I must return sooner. Big deal going down. Barnes told you about it, yes? I believe you called it a suicide mission, but you\u2019ll be long dead before then.\u201d Sotillo smiled.</p><p>The puzzle pieces fell into place for Hunter. Thank God Sotillo\u2019s schedule had changed because of the big deal. Otherwise, Hunter would have been out of the country while Kata was being stalked . . . and killed. Hopefully, he could save her now.</p><p>\u201cThis plan works much better,\u201d Sotillo murmured. \u201cNow, I will see your anguish when I kill your wife before your eyes. This is much better than merely hearing of your pain.\u201d</p><p>Hunter choked down his fear. He couldn\u2019t lose Kata, especially to revenge for something he\u2019d done in the line of duty. \u201cAnd my commanding officer helped you determine just the right person in my life for you to off, didn\u2019t he? For the right price, of course.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, Hunter heard the cocking of a gun.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, asshole.\u201d Andy Barnes crept behind him, through the open door. \u201cPut down your gun.\u201d</p><p>Hunter didn\u2019t comply. Dropping the gun meant giving up and dying. Instead, he tried to keep Barnes talking. \u201cYou had to know I was going to figure this out, Andy. \u201c</p><p>\u201cIt took you longer than I thought. If you hadn\u2019t been busy fucking this Latina whore, I\u2019ll bet you would have guessed right away.\u201d</p><p>Anger poured through him like scalding acid. Hunter forced himself not to do something rash. He restricted himself to grinding his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re a disgrace to your country and your team. How much did you sell me out for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough to pay off a few bills, along with my house, and buy my wife that vacation she\u2019s wanted for years. My fucking country doesn\u2019t pay as well as Sotillo. I\u2019ll leave the patriotism to idiots like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hired Manuel Silva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you called to say you were married. It was the lucky break I\u2019d been looking for. It didn\u2019t take me long to find Silva, who was only two hours away from your wife\u2019s apartment. If she hadn\u2019t gone to her office building, which took time to break into, giving your friends time to arrive, she would already be dead. I had to make a few more phone calls to find a cop willing to ice him in jail.</p><p>\u201cI cut your leave short on Monday, thinking that would make her easy to pick off. But I couldn\u2019t figure out where you\u2019d stashed her quickly enough. By the time I tracked her down at the hospital with her poor, sick mother, too many of your personal security buddies were crawling around the place.\u201d</p><p>Shit, Hunter had always known that Barnes had a clever streak. He\u2019d underestimated how devious the bastard could be.</p><p>\u201cI called you away early today for the same reason.\u201d He shot Sotillo a rancorous stare. \u201cV\u00edctor changed the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you do all this for the money, Andy?\u201d</p><p>He laughed coldly. \u201cThe money was icing. I did it for all the times you thought you were better than me, were offered promotions before me, were given medals that should have been mine, and swaggered your way through gorgeous women I\u2019d have given my right nut to fuck. It will be sweet to stand here and watch you die inside after we kill her.\u201d</p><p>Then Barnes planned to off him. After all, now that Hunter had seen his face and heard his admission of guilt, his CO couldn\u2019t let him live.</p><p>Sotillo sneered. \u201cYou will indeed suffer. The day I buried Adan, I held my sobbing mother, then began looking for a way to find the person you love most so I could rip them away from you. Barnes was very helpful in telling me about your life. Your father and brother are hard men to track down and ever-vigilant. Your very pregnant sister was a tempting target, but her husband made things too difficult. Then Barnes told me of your lovely new wife and your deep attachment to her.\u201d</p><p>He trailed a finger down Kata\u2019s cheek, into the hollow of her throat, over the curve of her breast, and Hunter buried the urge to kill the fucker on the spot. He had to convince V\u00edctor that Kata wasn\u2019t important, or she would be dead quickly. And just like the bastard wanted, he would know anguish beyond measure. Kata might not be his for much longer, but he would always protect her, always love her.</p><p>\u201cI hate to tell you this, but you came after Kata for nothing. We\u2019re getting divorced,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cThe guy she was with\u2014I assume you already iced him before he fell out the window? I saw them naked together last night.\u201d Technically, that was true, and Hunter tried to be as accurate as possible. Andy was an ace with body language. \u201cIf you\u2019ll let her into her purse, you\u2019ll find the divorce petition. We\u2019ve both signed already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Barnes snapped. \u201cYou love her.\u201d</p><p>He did. No way he could lie about that. \u201cCheck her purse. You\u2019ll see the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatalina?\u201d Sotillo asked her.</p><p>Hunter tried to catch her gaze, hoping she\u2019d understand the ploy.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d she told Barnes. \u201cWe married on a whim. I was drunk, and he was horny. It was Vegas. But Tyler dropped in last night . . .\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThen Hunter saw us. By this morning, he\u2019d signed the papers and left. End of story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Barnes shouted. \u201cLet me see those papers. Get them\u2014carefully. Nothing funny, or V\u00edctor will put a bullet in your brain.\u201d</p><p>Once more, Hunter willed Kata to look at him. She met his gaze for a second, then took a deep breath and dug into the depths of her purse. Hold on, honey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Moments later, she withdrew a stack of papers and, with shaking hands, flipped them to the last page, all but shoving them in Sotillo\u2019s face.</p><p>V\u00edctor frowned, then dropped them back into Kata\u2019s hands, glaring at Barnes. \u201cHe does not lie. For this, I will kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear, he loves her. I can tell. He\u2019s putting on an act so you think he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplete with legal documents?\u201d Kata\u2019s tone told him to get real as she shoved the papers back in her purse. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t going to work out.\u201d</p> <p>Before Hunter could lament the fact, she sent him a weighty stare.</p><p>Shit, Kata was going to do something. What? Fear kicked Hunter in the balls. He tried to give an imperceptible shake of his head. She had no business playing the hero. But she ignored him, raised her hand from her purse just a fraction. The gleam of her handgun she kept there for self-protection shimmered for just a second, then she cast a meaningful glance over her shoulder toward Sotillo. Shit, he\u2019d forgotten about it. She\u2019d used it and almost gotten a jump on Silva. He couldn\u2019t let her try on Sotillo, not with V\u00edctor holding a gun to her temple. Hunter frowned, silently begging her to use caution.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Andy demanded. \u201cYou, get your hand out of your purse!\u201d</p><p>Hunter stepped between them, turning his back on Sotillo. It was a calculated risk. The Venezuelan prick didn\u2019t want him dead, at least not yet. And he wanted Hunter to watch Kata die. He wouldn\u2019t kill her behind his back. Andy had already proven he was unpredictable. Hunter had to take Barnes out first, before he had the opportunity to pull that trigger and harm Kata.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Barnes jumped, snapping his gun inches from Hunter\u2019s face.</p> <p>He stared down the barrel. If his sacrifice saved Kata, he\u2019d count it as a win. If not . . . he\u2019d make sure that somehow, some way, he took Sotillo down with him as he took Barnes.</p><p>Waiting for Kata to be ready with the gun in her hand, Hunter wrapped his finger around the trigger of his own gun.</p><p>Andy didn\u2019t miss it. \u201cDrop your gun. Now!\u201d</p><p>Behind him there was a scuffle. Sotillo growled. Gunfire resounded, deafening in the small space. Kata screamed. Sirens began to wail, closing in. Andy\u2019s attention veered for just an instant . . .</p><p>Hunter took the opportunity, knowing it would probably be the only one.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Adrenaline spiking his bloodstream, he whipped his gun up, firing almost point-blank in Andy\u2019s chest. Barnes was dead before he started falling to the ground. \u201cSir.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter didn\u2019t wait for him to collapse. He turned to see Kata elbow V\u00edctor in the gut. Sotillo released her with a grunt. She whirled and fired. In an instant, he was bleeding from an open wound in his side, staining his pseudo-military uniform dark. His face was mottled, rage blaring from his eyes as he grabbed Kata again and pressed his gun into her temple so hard that she began to bleed. His finger hugged the trigger. \u201cDie, puta.\u201d</p><p>Desperate to do anything, Hunter raced through possibilities, but Kata\u2019s body blocked a clear shot at Sotillo. He couldn\u2019t risk shooting her himself.</p><p>Frenzied and furious, Kata stomped down on V\u00edctor\u2019s instep. His body jerked, arm flailing up as he jerked his injured foot from the floor. His weapon fired, deafening in the small space. Chunks of the ceiling rained down as Kata whipped her gun over her shoulder and pulled the trigger, hitting Sotillo in the jugular. Blood spurted everywhere. V\u00edctor screamed, trying to stem the flow of blood with one hand. Kata kicked the gun from his hand, and he stumbled back, grabbing her hair as if it was a lifeline.</p><p>Hunter dove into the fray, trying to pry Sotillo\u2019s fingers from Kata\u2019s thick tresses. But the dying bastard gripped tighter, staggering back again\u2014right for the open picture window, broken and ominous right behind him.</p><p>\u201cShe dies with me,\u201d Sotillo gurgled.</p><p>Hunter lunged for them, but the bastard glared with hate and pulled Kata closer as he fell out the window to his death. With an evil smile, he took her with him.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Christmas Eve</p> <p>HUNTER stalked out of the terminal at DFW airport and reached for his coat. Shit, coming from Venezuela, where December was damn near eighty degrees, to Dallas, where he\u2019d be lucky if the temperature reached fifty, was always a bit of a weather shock.</p><p>Slinging his duffel bag over his shoulder, he walked through the automatic doors, out to the chill. Right on schedule, Logan waited for him at the curb in the Colonel\u2019s Jeep.</p><p>His brother hopped out of the car, opened the hatch in back, then stuck out his hand. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>Shitty. Fucking miserable. Hunter shook his hand. \u201cOkay. You?\u201d</p><p>Logan shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas, so let\u2019s play happy, huh? Deke, Kimber, and the baby are driving down tonight. They\u2019ll stay a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are they? I\u2019ll bet the baby has really grown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely! Little Caleb is going to be a bruiser. He\u2019s got the temper to match.\u201d</p><p>Hunter dumped his duffel in the back of the vehicle and smiled faintly, glad everything had worked out well for his sister and her husband after such a rocky start. \u201cOf course. Neither Deke nor Kimber has ever had a problem expressing when they\u2019re pissed off.\u201d</p><p>Logan laughed and jogged for the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cC\u2019mon, before the overzealous traffic cops around here write me a ticket.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Hunter made his way to the passenger door</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see ... what else?\u201d his brother mused. \u201cCarlotta is already at Dad\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that was a punch to Hunter\u2019s solar plexus. Carlotta would just remind him of all he\u2019d lost. Kata had survived the fall out her window because Sotillo had landed under her, breaking it. She\u2019d suffered a concussion and a broken arm, lost some blood, and gone into shock, but they\u2019d whisked her away to the hospital and stabilized her quickly. Hunter had gone insane worrying about her, but the police had insisted on asking inane questions, tying him up. Then military brass had demanded his presence soon thereafter, subjected him to a shitload of red tape. He\u2019d told them to shove it until he knew that Kata was going to be fine. But after the doctor\u2019s assurance that her injuries were minor and an admiral called, threatening court-martial if he didn\u2019t appear and explain why he\u2019d shot his commanding officer, he\u2019d been forced to leave. The Colonel had given him frequent updates on Kata\u2019s health until she\u2019d healed completely.</p><p>Back on active duty, he\u2019d tried to write Kata, but he couldn\u2019t wrangle his feelings onto a page. Besides, she\u2019d wanted a divorce and never contacted him to say anything contrary. So he\u2019d stayed silent. Since then, he\u2019d buried himself in one mission after another, turned down another promotion . . . and spent time deciding what to do with the rest of his life.</p><p>He still had no fucking clue.</p><p>Hunter pushed the pain of Kata\u2019s loss and all his uncertainty aside. He didn\u2019t feel like celebrating the holidays, but he\u2019d put on a good face for his family. \u201cCarlotta doing good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, her divorce to Gordon is almost final. She\u2019s got her own place now in Tyler and a job at Mother Frances Hospital as a surgical nurse. She\u2019s been rehabbing her foot.\u201d Logan nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s making great strides and seems really happy. I think Dad may be sweet on her, but if there\u2019s anything there, they\u2019re taking it slow.\u201d</p><p>Maybe someone would come out of this mess happy, and if anyone deserved it after over a decade and a half of misery, it was the Colonel. He\u2019d sacrificed his heart to make his wife happy and hadn\u2019t been the same since. Hunter knew that wretched feeling. But if Kata was happier apart from him, he\u2019d bear it.</p><p>\u201cCarlotta isn\u2019t going to spend the holiday in Lafayette with Mari or her other family?\u201d</p><p>Logan shrugged. \u201cGuess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou doing any better, little brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo better, no worse.\u201d He navigated through the airport\u2019s twisting roads to the main thoroughfare and the toll gates. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you still haven\u2019t had sex in the last five years.\u201d</p><p>Logan slanted him a livid glare. \u201cHow much sex have you had in the last six months?\u201d</p><p>None. He hadn\u2019t had many opportunities . . . but he also hadn\u2019t had any interest. Hunter looked out the passenger window, knowing he\u2019d walked right into his brother\u2019s trap. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that long since we split up. You\u2019ve had a dozen years to get over T\u2014\u201d</p><p>\"Don\u2019t say her name,\u201d he growled. \u201cOr I swear I\u2019ll stop this car and take you apart.\u201d</p><p>Hunter understood his brother\u2019s anger. He could barely think Kata\u2019s name without getting choked up and pissed that he\u2019d somehow let her slip through his fingers. He hated to think he\u2019d still feel the same way years down the road . . . but it was damn likely.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m having a hard time. She\u2019s in town for the holidays.\u201d Logan stared bleakly at the busy road.</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d No doubt, the situation was rough. So close . . . yet so far away. To this day, he didn\u2019t really know what had happened between them, but whatever it was had left Logan broken.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d his brother broke into his thoughts. \u201cWith so much company and all the beds in the house taken, we drew short straws to see who\u2019d have to find other bunks. You lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t there to draw for myself.\u201d Hunter frowned. \u201cYou cheated.\u201d</p><p>Logan winked. \u201cSucks to be you.\u201d</p><p>They hit the highway, and the long drive to Tyler passed with loud alternative rock and a smattering of conversation. Once they left the bustle of Dallas behind, the barren spindles of tree branches flared across gray skies as one mile rolled into the next. Pastures that had been green in June were now brown, dead. Like he felt inside.</p><p>He whipped out his phone and stared\u2014yet again\u2014at his contraband picture of Kata. As always, it never failed to both soothe and destroy him.</p><p>God, he\u2019d give anything to go back and change . . . what? If he\u2019d been any different with Kata, he would have been lying to them both. She feared the sort of relationship he needed and had only felt free to really submit when she\u2019d known it was good-bye. Everything about that night had been bittersweet. He\u2019d had hope when she\u2019d wanted to make love to only him, but ...</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Tyler doing?\u201d he asked. Anything to avoid treading the same mental ground he\u2019d stomped on a thousand times.</p><p>\u201cStill rehabbing his back, but he\u2019s nearly a hundred percent. I still think it\u2019s incredible that the fall didn\u2019t paralyze him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d The blood loss from the shot to his arm had actually been worse than his fall out the window. Hunter had been very relieved when a couple of minor surgeries had fixed the majority of Tyler\u2019s damage. He didn\u2019t need anything else to feel guilty about.</p><p>The outskirts of town appeared, hovering on either side of Highway 69. The holiday decorations up on the shops and restaurants should have helped Hunter get in the spirit. Nah, he was more depressed than ever.</p><p>He drew in a deep breath and broached the one subject he dreaded most. \u201cDid the final divorce papers come to Dad\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>Logan hesitated. \u201cNo. Why would they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust asking, since they didn\u2019t come to my barracks. The only thing I received was a letter telling me that my request for married housing on base had been approved. I guess when I told the navy I\u2019d married, they thought I\u2019d want a real house.\u201d</p><p>He wished so fucking badly that he could share it with Kata.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Logan drawled.</p><p>\u201cAfter Christmas, yeah.\u201d No way was he dealing with it now. It would only depress him more. \u201cI\u2019m home for two weeks this time. I told my new CO that he\u2019d better not call me once unless the world was coming to an end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he lives up to that.\u201d</p><p>Hunter snorted, despite his misery. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem eager to give me a reason to shoot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense. You\u2019ve gained a hell of a reputation for being hard on a CO.\u201d Logan drove for a minute, then exited the freeway, stopping at the first red light. \u201cYou\u2019ve asked me about everyone except Kata.\u201d</p><p>God, even hearing her name hurt. He knew now why Logan couldn\u2019t stand to be reminded of his ex-girlfriend.</p><p>Sucking in a sharp breath, Hunter tried to pass off the question with a shrug. \u201cI assume that someone would tell me if something\u2019s not right with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Logan turned right, away from the Colonel\u2019s.</p><p>Hunter frowned. \u201cWhere am I staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cooked a little something up for you. This place belongs to a friend who\u2019s away for the holidays.\u201d</p><p>That grin worried the crap out of Hunter. Since when did Logan let anyone close enough to actually call friend? The only people who remotely qualified were all the hard-core folks at that BDSM club he frequented. \u201cWhat the hell are you up to?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan stopped the car beside the curb of a nondescript little house about six blocks from his family. \u201cGot a surprise for you inside. Merry Christmas, bro.\u201d</p><p>When he got out of the car and grabbed the duffel in the back, Hunter followed reluctantly. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to set me up with one of your pain groupies, please don\u2019t. Just let me see Dad and everyone else\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Logan darted for the door and fished the keys from his pocket. He slung the duffel in Hunter\u2019s direction, then tossed him the keys. Hunter caught them reflexively. \u201cI\u2019ll be back for you by dinner. If you\u2019d rather stay in, just text me.\u201d</p><p>What the hell . . . ? Hunter turned on his brother and stormed down the concrete walkway, toward the Jeep. \u201cDamn it, I don\u2019t want this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d Logan got in the car and locked the door, rolling down the passenger window. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>With that, he drove off.</p><p>Hunter sighed. He\u2019d be furious if it didn\u2019t take too much energy\u2014something he hadn\u2019t been able to muster much of in the past six months. Shaking his head, he stalked into the house.</p><p>A female lived here, he knew the instant he hit the threshold. The d\u00e9cor didn\u2019t give that fact away as much as the smell. Vanillascented air fresheners were the top note. Musky amber and lilies hit him next\u2014a scent that made him freeze in his tracks.</p><p>Kata? It was her scent, but she couldn\u2019t be here. Maybe he\u2019d finally lost his mind. It would be a welcome change.</p> <p>Heart pounding ridiculously fast, he closed the door behind him and stalked through the house. He was going to find out what was happening here and get some fucking peace.</p><p>The cozy living area was filled with buttery tan leather and wrought-iron tables, which led into a kitchen with earth-toned paisley patterns and cherry cabinets. The scent he sought had weakened, so Hunter turned, wending back the way he\u2019d come, until he found a hallway.</p><p>He inhaled more of the gorgeous smell. God, it was stronger here, perfect. For the first time in what felt like forever, he had a raging hard-on. He tried to will it away.</p><p>Two bedrooms down either side of the hallway proved empty and lacking the scent he craved. The corridor dead-ended with a closed door. The master bedroom? Likely, he\u2019d find it empty, and this strong scent the work of a candle or something, but . . . that didn\u2019t keep his heart from beating like mad, his hope from soaring.</p><p>Hunter gripped the knob and shoved the door open.</p><p>Inside, he found a Dom\u2019s paradise. It was a shadowed room filled with toys, tables, and restraints galore. In the middle, a woman knelt naked on her knees, head down, palms up, thighs spread, glossy dark curls swirling around her body.</p> <p>Shock spread over him. Everything inside him froze, stuttered, then began racing a hundred miles an hour. \u201cKata?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome back, Sir.\u201d</p><p>What the hell was going on? Why was she here, waiting for him like his perfect fantasy? \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she raised her head, her familiar hazel eyes rimmed in black liner. She met his gaze with a languid, sure sexuality that made his entire body tighten\u2014and love. Then he looked down.</p><p>Since he\u2019d last seen her, she\u2019d embellished her body into his most potent wet dream. A delicate weighted hoop dangled from each nipple. Down lower, her pussy was completely smooth and bare. A little silver ring winked from between her slick folds. Dear God ... He staggered back a step.</p><p>Hunter was about two seconds from pouncing on her like a starved man. It damn sure looked like she was offering herself but... \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m signaling my willingness and availability to you.\u201d</p><p>The submissive pose was generally meant to convey that, but . . . coming from Kata? \u201cWe\u2019ve been down this road. You didn\u2019t want what I wanted. Not to say I don\u2019t love the way you look.\u201d Hell, he loved everything about her\u2014except the fears that kept them apart. \u201cBut we\u2019re divorced for a reason. I haven\u2019t changed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have,\u201d she assured softly. \u201cI want to submit in whatever way you need. I want to please you, husband.\u201d</p><p>Everything about that statement filled him with questions, but he focused on the most important. \u201cEx-husband, right?\u201d</p><p>She reached onto the bed right beside her and pulled down papers that had escaped his attention. Not surprising since her gorgeous, naked form had captured it. With a trembling hand, she handed the papers to him.</p><p>Mind racing, erection nagging him like an infected tooth, he unfolded them, knowing full well what they were.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThe petition for divorce. We both signed. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Finally, she looked nervous. \u201cI never gave them back to Mari so she could proceed. I wanted to see you again, apologize for everything, submit to whatever punishment you deem appropriate, then let you decide what happens next.\u201d</p><p>The words sank in. Shock pinged through him. Hope crept back in. \u201cWe\u2019re not divorced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and we won\u2019t be unless you want to. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Her hazel eyes filled up with tears, sincerity pouring from their depths. Hunter\u2019s breath caught. His heart seized up. He wanted to cover her body with his and take all she offered. What little logic he still possessed made him pause.</p><p>\u201cYou were terrified of me and the sort of relationship I wanted. You sought this divorce. Now you love me?\u201d He shrugged, struggling to balance his hope and fear. \u201cYes, I see you\u2019re pierced in exactly the way that turns me inside out, and I won\u2019t deny that the sight of your bare pussy is arousing as hell, but it\u2019s going to take more than that for me to understand what\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head, her silky hair sliding over her soft shoulders. The gesture, the intimation\u2014hell, everything about the woman\u2014was about to undo him.</p><p>\u201cOur last night together was a revelation to me. When I wasn\u2019t afraid about the future and put my trust in you, I simply let go and discovered how connected I felt to you. How strong. You\u2019re not Gordon. I\u2019m also not my mother, settling for a man who takes pleasure in bending me low to cause me pain. The last few months, I\u2019ve worked a lot of issues out. I\u2019m at peace. I\u2019ve learned to submit with grace and calm. Unless you no longer love me and have moved on, I want nothing more than to be your wife in every way.\u201d</p><p>Hope crept over Hunter, damn near blocking out rational thought. In Kata\u2019s head, she\u2019d worked through their issues. Maybe. God, he hoped so. But what if she went running again the first time he overwhelmed her? He didn\u2019t think he could stand the torment of losing her again.</p><p>\u201cMy love for you was never the question. I\u2019m always going to love you, but if we can\u2019t be together in the most basic way . . . \u201d He narrowed his eyes as he stared at her, trying not to focus on the little piece of jewelry dangling between her luscious thighs that made his tongue twitch. \u201cWhy should I believe that anything has truly changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked at length to your brother, along with Jack Cole and his wife. They introduced me to Cheyenne, a Domme. We\u2019re . . . friends.\u201d</p><p>Hunter stared hard at her, a bolt of jealousy piercing him. \u201cYou submitted to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOften, yes. For the practice. It wasn\u2019t sexual.\u201d</p><p>For most submissives, the act of opening themselves up to another\u2019s will opened them up sexually. \u201cYou never came for her?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have missed his skeptical tone, because she flushed. \u201cWhen she wielded a paddle in one hand and a vibrator in another, it was impossible to resist. You are welcome to punish me as you see fit.\u201d Kata lifted her gaze to him, so open and welcoming. \u201cPlease touch me, Hunter. Try me.\u201d</p><p>The strength of her conviction, along with his enduring feelings for her, made him stand and hold out his hand. As she placed her fingers in his palm, his heart slammed against his ribs. He couldn\u2019t help but notice that they both shook.</p><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d He helped her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cNo. Just nervous.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he was, too. She might be placing her body in his grasp, but he was placing his heart completely in her hands. If this didn\u2019t work out, Hunter knew it would crush him\u2014and he didn\u2019t know if he could ever find his way back.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go easy on you.\u201d</p><p>Kata nodded. \u201cI haven\u2019t earned anything else.\u201d</p><p>She definitely knew the score. There was only one thing left to say. \u201cYour safe word is \u201cdivorce.\u201d You say it, and we\u2019re done. I\u2019ll disappear forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never hear that word from me again.\u201d</p><p>The possibility of a thousand bright tomorrows stretched out in front of him. Having this woman by his side for each and every one was his biggest fantasy of all.</p><p>Unfamiliar with the setup in the room, he prowled to the closet. Bingo! He found exactly what he needed in seconds. Grabbing a few items, he shoved them in his pockets, then turned back to Kata.</p><p>\u201cTurn on every light in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d She flipped on the switch near the door. Light flooded the room from a fixture overhead. It shined on her bare skin, glowing golden across her shoulders, down her back, on the bare skin of her buttocks.</p><p>His mouth watered. His chest clenched. God, how badly he wanted her to be his forever . . .</p><p>Kata turned on the lamps at both the nightstands flanking the bed. Intense light flooded the bed, white, bright, unforgiving.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d But he hadn\u2019t asked anything particularly taxing of her. Yet. \u201cNow get on the bed, flat on your back, legs spread wide.\u201d</p><p>She jumped to do his bidding without hesitation.</p><p>With this light, she had to know he would see any flaws she\u2019d tried to hide in the past. But she didn\u2019t flinch once, just arranged herself on the double bed, head on a pillow, heels hugging the edges.</p><p>Jesus, she looked gorgeous. He wanted to pounce on her, affix his mouth to her pussy, feel her explode on his tongue, then fill her with every aching inch of his cock. Hunter fought the need, forcing himself to think this through. He had to know if she could really be free to submit, not just for him, but for herself, too.</p><p>\u201cArms above your head.\u201d</p><p>Again, she complied, no hesitation. He climbed on the bed and grabbed her wrists, then withdrew handcuffs from his pocket. Quickly, he clapped one around each wrist and attached the dangling chain between to a fastening screwed into the headboard.</p><p>Squelching the urge to kiss Kata until she was putty, Hunter focused his attention lower. Could she submit without being seduced into it? Could she give her will over to his because they both needed it, nothing more, nothing less?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to inspect you.\u201d He stared at her with a raised brow, waiting for her to flinch or protest or close her legs.</p><p>She did nothing.</p><p>Making his way slowly to the end of the bed, he knelt between her thighs and looked at her bare flesh and the pretty piercing in the hood of her clit. Fuck, nothing got to him faster than knowing she\u2019d done that to please him, and on Kata the sight ramped him up like he\u2019d never known before.</p><p>Reaching out with one finger, he trailed it up the smooth, damp skin in the crease between her pussy and her leg. At his first soft touch, she gasped.</p><p>\u201cQuiet, unless I say otherwise.\u201d</p><p>No rancor or annoyance crossed her face. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your pussy shaved or waxed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLasered. It\u2019s permanent. Cheyenne recommended someone really great to me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d committed to keeping herself bare for him? The thought made desire coil inside him even tighter. Damn, it was going to be tough to focus on putting her through her paces and not fucking her like a rabid animal on the spot.</p><p>Breathing deeply, he forced himself to hold back and ran that same finger over her clit. \u201cAnd the piercings?\u201d</p><p>Her muscles tensed. Her breathing hitched. But she answered his question. \u201cCheyenne recommended me to Bruce. He did them all. He\u2019s very gentle.\u201d</p><p>Which meant that Bruce had seen his wife naked, and Hunter didn\u2019t like it one bit. He swallowed the urge to hunt the asshole down and focused on the fact that Kata had seemingly gone to great lengths to please him.</p><p>Flicking the little ring with his finger, she tensed, then forced herself to relax. Hope sprang a little higher inside him.</p><p>\u201cHow long ago was this done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiddle of July.\u201d</p><p>So plenty of time to heal. Plenty of time for her to take them out if she\u2019d reconsidered the kind of commitment he sought. Then her words hit him all over again. She\u2019d done this shortly after getting out of the hospital. She\u2019d been thinking of him while he was thousands of miles away, miserable with the distance between them. Had she, even then, been looking for a way to bridge the chasm so they could be together?</p><p>Hunter released a shuddering breath, but nothing was going to stop the freight train of desire slamming through him. Kata got to him, now more than ever.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like another man seeing you naked.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved up, but she said nothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that smile about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that you\u2019re possessive.

I\u2019ll invest in a whole lot of string for your balls. Keep me all to yourself in the bedroom, and we\u2019ll be great.\u201d</p><p>Exactly how he wanted her. \u201cNo more fantasies about me sharing you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThank you for the offer. I know having Tyler with us wasn\u2019t easy for you.\u201d</p><p>He froze. \u201cIs that why you refused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I did it because I only wanted to be with you. Being shared was just a fantasy, but the reality of you and me together is so much better.\u201d</p><p>Damn, could she be any more perfect for him? They\u2019d had a tough road, both learned hard lessons. They\u2019d both had to compromise. Was it possible that would pay off for the rest of their lives?</p><p>Unable to resist, he swiped his tongue through her wet slit, teasing the little ring piercing the hood of her clit. Hmm, sweet. Her body tensed. Her breath caught. The taste of her sank onto his tongue, and he reveled in having her this way again. As he sucked her clit gently into his mouth, he slid the base of the ring against her bundle of nerves so it created a friction she couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>Up he drove her, higher, higher. Her breaths became moans. Her hips arched up.</p><p>Hunter held her down and gave her the sternest expression he could muster. \u201cBe still. You can\u2019t force your orgasm with this wriggling and silent begging. You\u2019ll get it when I think you\u2019re ready. If you get it. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Her voice emerged as a high-pitched squeak.</p><p>He repressed a smile. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying my treat. Do you know how fucking hungry I\u2019ve been for the last six months? You don\u2019t want to spoil it for me.\u201d</p><p>Kata shook her head and tensed every muscle in her body as he set his mouth back on her cunt and lapped slowly, hungrily, losing himself in her taste. He wanted her so far on the edge that she could see the chasm of destructive pleasure below but still want it so badly that she was willing to risk anything for it, for him.</p><p>Her fists clenched, unclenched, along with her jaw. She tossed her head as he tongued that little ring again and plunged two fingers into her soaking pussy, feeling around for that one spot . . . Yeah.</p><p>Perspiration broke out across her skin and she flushed a dusky rose everywhere. Her labia swelled. Her clit turned hard. She rippled around his fingers, but clamped down, trying to control her response.</p><p>She\u2019d done well, so far. Now it was time to challenge her.</p><p>Forcing himself to pull back from her sweet taste, he eased to the edge of the bed and slapped his fingers down on the pad of her pussy. Kata cried out, bucked. Then brought herself under control.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she panted.</p><p>She knew she hadn\u2019t followed his instructions to be still and silent. He didn\u2019t have to remind her at all.</p><p>\u201cTurn over. Present your ass for a spanking.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, and Hunter tensed. Yes, she\u2019d enjoyed the last thorough spanking he\u2019d given her . . . eventually, but not without a lot of persuasion and coercion. She\u2019d fought him all the way to orgasm.</p> <p>Finally, she turned over, arms crossed over her head, knees beneath her.</p><p>\u201cYou hesitated.\u201d He rubbed her backside. He hoped like hell the touch was at least a tad threatening, and she was thinking about the paddling she\u2019d soon get. Mostly, he couldn\u2019t keep his hands off her ass.</p><p>\u201cPermission to speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to enlighten me, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very close to the edge, Sir. A spanking will put me over quickly. I took a moment to compose myself. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Candor, an admission that his discipline excited her, and an apology? That set him back on his heels. She\u2019d come so far and obviously done a great deal to work through her issues. He was so damn proud of her, he was about to burst. And so encouraged, so happy, it was all he could do not to tear off his jeans and sink tightly into her body, stake his claim for good.</p><p>But he had to remain steady. \u201cThat will cost you five extra swats. You understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount them.\u201d He smacked her right cheek dead center. Her flesh made a satisfying smack against his hand, and she breathed through the sting.</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>Nice. Nodding, he brought his palm down on her left cheek, first at the top, then the bottom, hitting a bit harder each time.</p><p>She tensed, forced herself to relax. \u201cTwo. Three.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words were out, she sank deeper into the sensation, body going lax, her head dropping to the bed. Hunter could see the outline of his hand on her ass, and he nearly clawed his way out of his clothes to get to her.</p><p>He forced patience. He\u2019d tested her a great deal . . . but hadn\u2019t crossed all her boundaries. Conversations with Logan, Jack, and Morgan seemed to have emotionally prepared her for submitting. This Cheyenne woman he hadn\u2019t met had certainly given her practice. But there was one boundary that another woman couldn\u2019t cross with her.</p><p>Suddenly, he was eager to take her there, find out if she could really be his in all ways.</p><p>Palming her ass once more, he rained down a series of blows on it, high on her right cheek, on the fleshy part of her left, straddling the luscious parting of those globes. He spared her no mercy.</p><p>\u201cFour, five, six.\u201d Her voice grew calmer with each word. Her skin actually glowed with a healthy sheen of perspiration and blood pooling just under the surface.</p><p>Hunter slipped a hand under her, to swim through the moisture wetting her sweet pussy. Her clit was still a tight knot, and her body begged to be fucked. As he pressed his fingers inside her again, she rippled around him. But she breathed through the pleasure-pain, finally relaxing everything but her pelvic muscles. With those, she held on to her need to orgasm tightly.</p><p>He smiled wide and hefted four more hearty smacks on her ass, one right after the other. No yelping, crying, begging, arguing. Kata merely took them in stride.</p><p>\u201cSeven, eight, nine, and ten,\u201d she breathed out.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Hunter tried to sound in control, but the truth was, he\u2019d lost it. Knowing he was with Kata and that she was submitting so perfectly . . . That had been the stuff of his fantasies for the past six months. The need to hold her, the yearning to have her under his hand as she still wore his ring and he saw love in her eyes, had nearly strangled him. Now it seemed that everything he wanted was within his reach. Nothing on earth was going to keep him from her. Elation swelled inside him.</p><p>With jerky motions, he shoved his jeans down his thighs and guided his cock to her wet entrance. With one shove, he pushed his way in on a tortured groan. Her body parted for him, like warm water flowing around a rock, she caressed and clung until Hunter wondered if he was going to lose his ever-loving mind with the sublime joy.</p><p>In long, deep strokes, he began to fill her, pushing his way over her most sensitive spots, all the way up to her cervix. He leaned his body over her back and put a hand on her chest. \u201cBreathe with me, honey.\u201d</p><p>He waited a moment until their breathing synched up, until he felt a measure of calm overtake them both. Fucking perfect. She felt like home, and he never wanted to leave her again.</p><p>Clutching Kata tightly, Hunter fucked her, each stroke ending with a mutual indrawn breath, every withdrawal punctuated with a moan. God, he could feel her, her rising excitement, her peace in the knowledge that she was pleasing him.</p><p>It was as if the last six months of separation hadn\u2019t existed. They fell away, and he wasn\u2019t the same bastard who\u2019d been looking for a reason to get out of bed each day, snapping guys\u2019 heads off at every opportunity, wishing every night that he drank, because drowning in alcohol sounded like a damn relief. Now he was purely in the moment, more connected to Kata than ever.</p><p>Gripping her hips, he thrust in faster, faster, reaching under her to circle her engorged clit with his fingers. She was damn close.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019ve earned it, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Damn, even an obedient answer, and it went straight to his cock. \u201cYes. Come!\u201d</p><p>Almost immediately, her body began convulsing. Her sex sucked him in deeper, gripping him so tightly, Hunter had to breathe hard through the urge to climax and flood her. Six months without sex was damn unpleasant. Six months without Kata had been excruciating.</p><p>Knowing he either had to pull out of her tight clasp or come now, he withdrew, still having one question mark in his head about her submission. This didn\u2019t have to go perfectly, and if she was still coming to terms with it . . . he\u2019d deal. She\u2019d already come so far.</p><p>Fishing into his pockets, he extracted the plastic tube he\u2019d shoved in there and dabbed a large dollop on the small pink rosette between her cheeks, then slid even more inside her.</p><p>Every time he\u2019d touched Kata\u2019s ass before, she\u2019d resisted in some way. Now? She relaxed and pushed down on his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you here.\u201d He pressed deeper. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me if I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you won\u2019t. Cheyenne helped me with a variety of plugs, each bigger than the last. I made sure I was prepared for you.\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019d been shocked before, her answer completely blew him away now. She\u2019d willingly had her body prepared for the ultimate act of his submission?</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want you to have me this way if you desire it.\u201d Her eyes sparkled, filled with life and joy as she looked at him over her shoulder. \u201cAnd because I think it will be hot as hell.\u201d</p><p>His heart clenched. There she was. His hell on wheels Kata was right below the surface, waiting to tease and drive him mad. She would submit in the bedroom, but the partner he loved more than his own life had merged with the submissive he needed.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her middle and trailed kisses along her shoulders. All the reserve he\u2019d been using to hold himself back until he\u2019d been sure . . . it was gone now, dissolved in the blush of her pure acceptance.</p><p>\u201cSweet Kata, goddamn it, I missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cI missed you, too, Hunter. Every day, I thought about nothing more than you coming home and us having another chance. I was so afraid. I\u2019m not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey. I see you, so obedient and so brave. So strong. I\u2019m proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me.\u201d</p><p>Her husky, pleading tones charged through his veins. No way to deny that request.</p><p>Fitting the head of his cock to her tight hole, he pushed gently to the ring. She pushed down and back. The resistance gave way quickly\u2014and he found himself sliding into heaven. He gripped her hips, hissing in a breath as fire breathed through his body.</p><p>She groaned. \u201cThis is so different than a plug. So much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to help you enjoy it. Tell me what feels good.\u201d</p><p>He drew back, then stroked in again. And again. Around him, her insides tensed, and her body flowed with him, hips catching his rhythm for one deep thrust after another. God, he was so deep into her, Hunter knew he\u2019d never find his way out. His body craved hers. His heart . . . well, she might be his wife and submissive, but no doubt, he was the one enslaved.</p><p>Diving back into his pocket one last time, he pulled out a little vibrating bullet and switched it on. He wasn\u2019t going to last much longer, but damn it, if he went over the edge into pleasure, she was going with him.</p><p>He flipped it on and shoved it right against her clit. Kata jolted, cried out. Her body tightened around him almost unbearably. Gnashing his teeth, Hunter tried to keep it together.</p><p>But he was fighting a useless battle.</p><p>\u201cCome for me.\u201d He barely got the words out before his own climax slammed across his senses, taking out his ability to breathe, to see, to do anything but feel Kata shudder around him as she found her own pleasure. He shouted, his cries mixing with hers.</p><p>They collapsed to the bed in a heap, and as soon as he could feel his legs again, Hunter withdrew carefully, shucked his pants, then found an attached bathroom. After gathering a warm, wet washcloth, he entered the bedroom again and went to Kata\u2019s side.</p><p>He cleaned her gently, then uncuffed her. As soon as they were face-to-face, her hazel eyes sought his, the apprehensive questions lurking there a silent shout in the room. She wanted reassurance that she\u2019d pleased him\u2014the most basic instinct for a submissive.</p><p>Warmth spread all through Hunter, and he wondered that he didn\u2019t goddamn glow. With a smile, he pushed the dark curls from her face and caressed her cheek. \u201cYou pleased me very much. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that you\u2019d be waiting for me today, much less so prepared to accept everything I\u2019ve wanted to share with you. You can\u2019t know how proud I am of you or how much I appreciate all you\u2019ve done for me. No more fears?\u201d</p><p>Joy suffused her golden face. \u201cNone. Hunter, I know now that I can be me and still love you. You should know that I will still kick your ass when you need it. But I\u2019m not going to run again. I would conquer my fears twenty times again just to be with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>His heart fucking exploded with joy as he clutched her close and pressed a sweet kiss to her lips. \u201cThank you for that.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, some way, his gut had led him to this woman from the moment he\u2019d laid eyes on her. She\u2019d come to feel the same way, and had been willing to fight for their happily-ever-after. He felt like the luckiest bastard in the world.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Kata, \u2018Sir\u2019 is someone you\u2019re testing out, to see if you can share a relationship. \u2018Master\u2019 is the man you intend to stay with.\u201d He held her hand, relieved to still see that band of gold he\u2019d put on her finger all those months ago. \u201cSurrender to me forever?\u201d</p><p>She reached up and cupped his jaw, bringing her mouth to his for a slow kiss that was a sharing of breaths and souls. \u201cYeah, Master. Forever is how long I intend to love you.\u201d</p>   </body></html>"]
