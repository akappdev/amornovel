It brought casual conversation to a halt, brought those seated to their feet, brought fear to all eyes. It was the sound of the scream, the very heartfelt terror within it, which had been lacking during the day\u2019s work.</p><p>The ocean breeze had been beautiful throughout the afternoon and evening; it seemed almost as if the hand of God was reaching down to gently wave off the last dead heat of the day, leaving a balmy temperature behind as the sun sank in the western horizon with an astonishing palette of crimson, magenta, mauve and gold.</p><p>The film crew had set up camp on the edge of the sparse pine forest, just yards away from the lulling sound of the ocean. The Bahamian guides who had brought them and worked with them had been courteous, fun and knowledgeable, and there was little not to like about the project, especially as night fell and the last of the blazing, then pastel, shades faded into the sea, and it and the horizon seemed to stretch as one, the sky meeting the ocean in a blur.</p><p>A bonfire burned with various shades from brilliant to pale in the darkness, and the crew gathered around as it grew dark. South Bimini was sparsely inhabited, offering a small but popular fisherman\u2019s restaurant and little more, unlike the more tourist-friendly North Bimini, where numerous shops, bars and restaurants lined what was known as The King\u2019s Highway in Alice Town.</p> <p>They had taken it a step further than South Bimini, choosing to film on one of the several little uninhabited islands jutting out to the southwest. One with a name that had greatly appealed to Jay.</p><p>Haunt Island.</p><p>A long time ago, there had been a pirate massacre here. Over the years, truth and legend had merged, and it was this very story that Vanessa had used in her script for the low-budget horror film they were shooting.</p><p>So infamous years ago, Haunt Island was currently just a place where boaters came now and then. An island filled with scrub and pines, a single dock and an abundance of beach. Out here, tourism wasn\u2019t plentiful\u2014the terrain remained wild and natural, beloved by naturalists and campers.</p><p>There had been more people in their group, but now they were down to ten. There were Georgia Dare and Travis Glenn, the two actors playing the characters who remained alive in the script; Jay Allen, director; Barry Melkie, sound; Zoe Cally, props, costumes and makeup; Carlos Roca, lighting; Bill Hinton, and Jake Magnoli, the two young production assistants/lighting/sound/gophers/wherever needed guys; their Bahamian escort and guide, Lew Sanderson; and Vanessa herself, writer and backup with the cameras and underwater footage.</p><p>It was all but a wrap. The historical legend filled with real horror that was sure to be a box-office hit on a shoestring budget had been all but completed, and they\u2019d been winding down, crawling out of their tents to enjoy the champagne, laughing and lazing against the backdrop of the sunset and the breeze.</p> <p>And then the sound of the scream, so much more chilling and horrible than any sound Georgia Dare had managed to emit throughout the filming.</p><p>Until that moment, Vanessa Loren had enjoyed the project. It was simple enough\u2014a low-budget horror flick that actually had a plot. She had written the script. In addition, she and Jay were financially committed to the project, which made them both willing to work in any capacity. She was ready to do instant rewrites as needed because of the actors and the environment, and she could film underwater shots and even pitch in as second camera for many of the land shots.</p><p>Jay, the director, was planning on making a bundle; he was counting on the success of such films as The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal State. Vanessa and Jay had known each other forever, and had both gone to film school at NYU. He\u2019d contacted her while she was working back in Miami after she\u2019d gotten her master\u2019s degree at the University of Miami. He\u2019d talked the good talk on getting together and finding a few investors to finance a really good low-budget flick.</p><p>Luckily, she had just been nicely paid for work she had done writing and filming an advertisement for dive gear. It had been one of the few projects she had worked on that hadn\u2019t been rewritten by a dozen people before coming to fruition\u2014and it had been a sixty-second spot.</p><p>Jay agreed with her that if they were going to do the project, an independent endeavor, it had to be done really well. However, they were also looking for commercial success. So the script was well written but also included the usual assortment of teen-slasher-flick characters\u2014the jock who counted his conquests with scratches on his football helmet, the stoner guitar boy, the struggling hero, the popular slut coming on to the hero and the good-girl bookworm. So far, two characters had been killed in the water, two had disappeared from the boat\u2014and two had to fight the evil, reborn pirates on land and sea and somehow survive until help could come to the patch of sand where they\u2019d been grounded in the Atlantic.</p><p>The scream.</p><p>Vanessa had been sitting by the fire, sipping a glass of champagne and chatting with Jay, Lew and Carlos. They\u2019d broken it open just a few minutes earlier, taking a minute to relax before they all gathered to cook dinner over the fire and the camp stoves they\u2019d brought and finish off the rest of the champagne.</p><p>At the scream, she, like the others, stopped what she was doing. They looked at one another in the eerie light produced by the flames in the darkness, then bolted up and started running toward the sound.</p> <p>Vanessa was in the lead when Georgia came tearing down the beach toward them. Vanessa caught the young woman, trying to hold her, trying to find out what had happened. \u201cGeorgia! Stop, stop!\u201d Georgia Dare, a stunning twenty-one-year old blonde, stared at her with eyes as wide as saucers. \u201cGeorgia, it\u2019s me, Vanessa. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNessa...Nessa...oh my God, oh, no, no...!\u201d</p><p>Georgia started to scream again, trying to shake Vanessa\u2019s hold.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia!\u201d</p><p>By then, everyone had come, bursting out of their camp tents, forgetting whatever task they had been involved in.</p><p>The others gathered behind her while Jay came forward. \u201cGeorgia, damn it, what the hell kind of a prank is this?\u201d he demanded. Once, Georgia had tried to pretend that a stunt knife was real and that she\u2019d been stabbed by a woman from the Retirees by the Sea trailer park back in the Keys.</p><p>\u201cThe bones, the bodies...they are alive, they don\u2019t like us, they\u2019re going to kill us...they\u2019re angry...we\u2019ll all die!\u201d Georgia blurted.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I\u2019ve had it,\u201d Jay said with disgust, turning away. Most of the others did the same.</p><p>Vanessa didn\u2019t. Georgia was shaking violently. And that scream! The sound of that scream still seemed to be chilling her blood.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to kill us all. Kill us all,\u201d Georgia said. Her eyes fell directly on Vanessa\u2019s then, and she was suddenly as strong as a sumo wrestler, breaking free from Vanessa\u2019s hold and gripping her shoulders instead. \u201cThey\u2019re real! They\u2019re going to kill us, don\u2019t you understand, we have to get out of here! They\u2019re coming out of the sand. I saw them...the arms, the hands, the skulls... I saw them, coming out of the sand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia, Georgia, please, stop it. Hey, come on, we\u2019re filming a horror movie, remember?\u201d Vanessa asked gently. \u201cThe guys probably set up some of the props to scare you,\u201d She frowned suddenly. \u201cWhat were you doing alone, way down on the beach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTravis and I...Travis and I... Travis is gone.\u201d</p><p>Travis Glenn was the male lead, an exceptionally beautiful if not terribly bright young man.</p><p>\u201cOkay, where is Travis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone. Gone. The pirate took him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pirate?\u201d</p><p>Georgia shook her head. \u201cMaybe he wasn\u2019t a pirate. I didn\u2019t see him very clearly. But he was evil\u2014he was like an evil shadow, skulking in the darkness. Travis was yelling, and he went after the shadow. He was mad. He thought you all were playing tricks. And then this monster came out of the sand, but he wasn\u2019t right, he seemed to jerk around, like his bones were put back together wrong. And he took Travis and I started screaming and ran.\u201d</p><p>Jay came back, hands on his lean hips, chest glistening in the darkness. \u201cSlap her! Nessa, don\u2019t look so damned concerned. She\u2019s jerking us around and it isn\u2019t funny. Damn you, Georgia. Look, I realize this isn\u2019t anything major-budget, but the crew has worked hard and everyone is tired\u2014and you\u2019re acting like a complete bitch! It\u2019s just not the time for practical jokes. Slap her, knock her out of it, Vanessa!\u201d</p><p>Vanessa glared at him and shook her head. Georgia wasn\u2019t that good an actress. She had disagreed with casting the young woman, but she had looked phenomenal on film.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go down to the beach and see what scared her,\u201d Vanessa suggested. She looked back at Lew, a big, broad-shouldered Bahamian man who had been one of their guides. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s anything down at the beach, Lew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSand,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go see.\u201d</p><p>Georgia jerked away from her, shaking her head vehemently. \u201cNo, no, no! I am not going back there. I am not going back!\u201d</p><p>Carlos Roca, their lighting engineer, came toward them. He\u2019d been close to both actors, and Georgia liked him. Vanessa did, too. He was a nice guy\u2014even-tempered and capable. He took Georgia\u2019s hands. \u201cHey, hey. I\u2019ll stay here with you, and we\u2019ll sit by the fire with the others while Lew, Jay and Vanessa go check it all out. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Georgia looked up at him. Huge tears formed in her eyes and she nodded. \u201cTravis is dead,\u201d she told him. \u201cTravis is dead.\u201d</p><p>Jay looked at Zoe, who worked with the props, makeup and buckets of stage blood they\u2019d been using. He glared sternly at her, then turned to Bill and Jake, the young production assistants, earning credit from the U of Miami. \u201cHey, you guys didn\u2019t rig anything, did you\u2014any practical jokes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zoe looked at him with incredulous disdain. \u201cNo. No, we did not.\u201d</p><p>Jay looked from face to face and was obviously satisfied with the chorus of denials.</p><p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019ll check it out,\u201d Jay said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, yes. Come on, let\u2019s do this,\u201d Lew said with his pleasant and easy Bahamian accent. \u201cWe\u2019ll find Travis and see what\u2019s going on. Miss Georgia, you\u2019re going to be just fine, honey.\u201d</p><p>But Georgia shook her head. \u201cTravis is dead,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll light some torches from the fire,\u201d Lew offered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019re doing this,\u201d Jay said, tired and irritated as they started down the beach. \u201cI made a mistake in casting, that\u2019s for sure. We\u2019re filming a legend, a horror flick, for God\u2019s sake. She\u2019s letting it all get to her. This is crazy.\u201d</p><p>Lew chuckled softly. \u201cAh, yes, well, that\u2019s the way it is with American slasher flicks, eh? Two young people drink and wander off into the woods or the pines to make love, and then the monster comes upon them. They are mistaken. This is Bimini. There are no monsters.\u201d</p> <p>Vanessa stopped. They had come to the edge of the beach. A pine forest came almost flush with the water after a rise in the landscape.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Jay said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing out here at all.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa raised her torch to look around. She froze suddenly. There was nothing there now, but just feet from her, the sand looked as if it had been raked, and it was damp as well, as if someone had dumped buckets of water twenty feet inland from the shore.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSomeone was playing a joke on her\u2014on her and Travis, maybe,\u201d Jay said. He swore. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one more day of filming to tie up loose ends, and I guess it\u2019s natural that someone just feels the need to play practical jokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where is Travis?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p> <p>Lew was hunkered down by the disturbed sand. \u201cInteresting,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jay asked.</p><p>\u201cIt does look like something burst outward from the sand\u2014more than it looks as if someone were digging in it,\u201d Lew said. \u201cAs if it erupted, and was then smoothed over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe work with great props and special-effects people,\u201d Jay said dryly. \u201cLet\u2019s get back. I\u2019m tired as hell. Someone has to have some kind of sleeping pill Georgia can take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure she should be taking a pill\u2014\u201d Vanessa began.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Jay interrupted her. \u201cI need to sleep tonight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take Georgia in with me,\u201d Vanessa volunteered. She surprised herself. She hadn\u2019t disliked Georgia; she just found the woman to be a little...vapid. But that night, she felt sorry for her. Georgia had dropped out of high school, certain that an actress didn\u2019t need an education. She\u2019d spent several years working as a model at car and boat shows, and Jay had discovered her because she\u2019d gotten a local spot on television promoting a used-car dealer. Vanessa had to admit that Georgia might not be the most talented actress she knew, but she had been professional and easy to work with. She was pretty sure that Georgia had never gotten a lot of support from her parents or anyone else.</p><p>She also knew that she had been lucky. She had been raised by parents who had cared more about their children than anything else in life. Her mother and father had been avid historians, readers, writers and divers, and they had done everything in their power to put their two children through college. She loved history and she loved diving. Her actual forte was in script writing, but in Hollywood, that was a difficult route, with scripts being rewritten so many times that you seldom recognized your own work at the end, and you seldom received credit for a project, either. It had been necessary, in her mind, to learn cameras as well, and with her background, underwater work was a natural. She was driven and she was passionate about her work, so she\u2019d jumped at the chance to work on this movie when Jay called her.</p> <p>Jay loved horror movies, and they had loved each other forever. Not as boyfriend and girlfriend\u2014they had known each other since grade school in the small town of Micanopy, Florida. He had a chance with this movie, and she wanted him to have his chance. She wanted this chance for herself, too.</p><p>She had said from the beginning that she was in only if she got her own tent.</p><p>But tonight she\u2019d bring Georgia in with her and be a mother hen.</p><p>Carlos had been settling the young woman down; the two were sitting by the fire with large plastic cups\u2014 Vanessa was pretty sure they contained something a lot harder than champagne. As Vanessa, Jay and Lew returned, Georgia jumped to her feet, staring at them. \u201cSee? See? I told you!\u201d</p><p>Jay took Georgia by the shoulders and tried to be calm and reassuring. \u201cGeorgia, all I can think is that Travis is playing some kind of a trick on you, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no! You have to go look for Travis!\u201d Georgia said.</p><p>\u201cI guess we should,\u201d Vanessa said quietly.</p><p>Jay stared at her with aggravation. \u201cLook for him? Oh, please! You know damned well that Travis is the one who played this ridiculous joke, or he\u2019s in on it! And there\u2019s nothing there, Georgia. No hands, no skulls, no monsters. Georgia, you\u2019ve got to get some sleep. I need some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I saw it!\u201d Georgia said, shaking her head in fear. She glared furiously at Jay. \u201cI have to get out of here. I won\u2019t stay here!\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be joking!\u201d Jay declared irritably. \u201cGeorgia, you were touting used cars, for God\u2019s sake! This could make you the new scream queen!\u201d</p><p>Georgia was obviously terrified beyond caring. \u201cI don\u2019t care! I don\u2019t care if I spend the rest of my life as a waitress. I have to get off this island\u2014now. Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dark!\u201d Jay reminded her.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s all right, we\u2019re fifty miles from Miami, and we\u2019ve got a good speedboat. I can take her in and be back to help with any follow-up or backup shots that we need tomorrow,\u201d Carlos offered.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we need the actress?\u201d Jay demanded. \u201cI haven\u2019t looked through the sequences we shot today.\u201d</p><p>Carlos looked at Vanessa. \u201cIf Nessa doesn\u2019t mind, she\u2019s the same height and build and has long blond hair. She can fill in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, Vanessa can fill in! You can be my stunt double!\u201d Georgia said enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cFor joy, for joy,\u201d Vanessa murmured. But she was still disturbed by the young woman\u2019s absolute terror. Georgia was ambitious. Was she really so terrified that she would walk away from what could be a big break for her?</p><p>She realized that everyone was staring at her.</p><p>\u201cSure. Whatever is needed,\u201d she said dryly to Jay. Of course she would do it. They both had a lot of hard work\u2014not to mention their finances\u2014tied up with this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in the morning,\u201d Carlos promised. \u201cLook, seriously, it\u2019s what? Seven-thirty, eight o\u2019clock now? I can make Miami in a few hours. I\u2019ll get a night\u2019s sleep and head back by five or six tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>It was agreed. In another hour, Carlos and Georgia were off.</p><p>Vanessa found herself sitting by the fire with the others, sipping champagne once again, though it had lost its taste.</p><p>\u201cI still think we should look for Travis,\u201d she said.</p><p>Zoe let out an irritated \u201ctsking\u201d sound. \u201cThat jerk! He\u2019s out there somewhere, laughing at everyone, and not caring that he\u2019s put a real bug in the production.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd messing with the props. When he walks up laughing and swaggering in the morning, I think we should give him a good right hook,\u201d Barry said.</p><p>Silence fell.</p><p>\u201cHey, we could sit here and tell ghost stories!\u201d Bill suggested.</p><p>They all glared at him. Apparently, no one was in the mood.</p><p>For a while, they did reflect upon the many disappearances and oddities that had occurred in the Bermuda Triangle, but even that didn\u2019t last long.</p><p>It was only nine-thirty when Vanessa opted for bed. She lay awake, watching the patterns of the low-burning fire playing upon the canvas roof of her tent. She thought about the ridiculousness of filming the movie\u2014the hours of getting the characters into makeup and how, to save money, they had all taken on so many different tasks. Jay and Carlos had played the vengeful pirates, coming out of the sea, and she had supplied some of the sound effects and acted as the kidnapped and murdered Dona Isabella.</p><p>Her script was honestly good, based on history and legend. Once, the Florida Keys and the Bahamas had been areas of lawlessness, ruled by pirates. An infamous pirate captain, Mad Miller, and his mistress, Kitty Cutlass, had gone on a wild reign of terror, taking ship after ship, or so legend said. Then all had gone wrong. They had taken a ship bearing the beautiful and rich Dona Isabella. They had sunk her ship, killed most of the crew and, presumably, planned on ransoming Dona Isabella. She had been sailing from Key West to Spain, back to her wealthy husband, when she had been taken. But nothing had happened as planned. Legend said that Kitty Cutlass killed Dona Isabella in a fit of rage, and on Haunt Island, Mad Miller went really mad and massacred the remaining crew and many of his own men. Finally, his pirate ship had sunk off Haunt Island, caught in the vengeful winds of a massive storm. Vanessa had based her script on the legend, doing what research she could, with contemporary teenagers finding themselves victims of bitter ghosts risen from the sand and the sea. As a screenplay, the story provided amazing fodder for the imagination. Filming had actually been fun. There had been some amusing accidents along the way, but none that had caused any harm. Bill had fallen into one of the buckets of blood, and Jake had come bolting up out of the water once, terrified of a nurse shark. She liked the people she was working with, and so, for the most part, it had been enjoyable. A crash shoot\u2014all of it done within three weeks. And Jay was right\u2014it could hit big at the box office.</p><p>She still felt disturbed and uneasy, although she wasn\u2019t alone. The tents were no more than a few feet apart. Jay, who had been bunking with Carlos, was next to her. Bill and Jake were on her left side. Lew, as secure a figure as anyone might ever want to meet, was just beyond Zoe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she was still afraid. It was as if Georgia\u2019s gut-wrenching scream had awakened something inside her that knew something was coming, something that she dreaded.</p><p>At eleven o\u2019clock, she was still staring at the canvas. She didn\u2019t have anything really strong to help her sleep, but she decided on an over-the-counter aid. In another half an hour, she was asleep.</p><p>It might have been the pill. She slept, but she tossed and turned and awakened throughout the night. And she dreamed that Georgia was standing in front of her, giant tears dripping down her cheeks. \u201cI told you, I told you there were monsters!\u201d</p> <p>Georgia\u2019s image disappeared.</p><p>She dreamed of giant shadow figures rising over her tent and of seaweed monsters rising out of the ocean, growing and growing and devouring ships, boats and people, and reaching up to the sky to snatch planes right from the atmosphere.</p><p>She awoke feeling better, laughing at herself for the absurdity of her dreams.</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe in seaweed monsters\u2014sea snakes, yes, sharks and other demons of the real world, but seaweed monsters, no.</p><p>When she had nightmares, they were usually more logic-based\u2014being chased in the darkness by a human killer, finding out she was in a dark house alone with a knife-wielding madman.</p> <p>It had been Georgia. Georgia and that terrifying scream.</p><p>She blinked, stretched and rose. Taking off the long T-shirt nightgown she\u2019d worn, she put on a bathing suit, ready to hit the beach. There were showers in the heads on both boats the crew had been using, the Seven Seas and the Jalape\u00f1o. Of course, one boat wouldn\u2019t be back until Carlos returned. It was a bright and beautiful morning, and she felt that a good dousing in the surf would be refreshing.</p><p>She stepped out of her tent. The morning sun was shining, but the air retained a note of the night\u2019s pleasant coolness. The sea stretched out before her, azure as it could only be in the Bahamas. Jay and Zoe were already up, and one of them had put the coffeepot to brew on the camp stove.</p><p>\u201cMorning!\u201d Jay called.</p><p>\u201cMorning!\u201d she returned. \u201cHow long till coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! As fast as it brews!\u201d Jay told her.</p> <p>Zoe giggled. \u201cWhat? Did you think this film had a budget for a cook?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa walked on out to the water. It was delightful; warm, but not too warm. So clear she could easily see the bottom, even when she had gone out about twenty-five feet from shore and the depth was around ten feet. The current of the Gulf Stream was sweeping the water around to the north; she decided to fight it and swim south, then let it bring her on back offshore from the campsite.</p><p>She swam a hard crawl, relaxed with a backstroke, worked on her butterfly and went back to doing the crawl, and then decided that she had gone far enough. She had angled herself in toward shore, so she paused a minute, standing, smoothing back her hair.</p><p>It was then that she looked toward the shore.</p><p>She would have screamed, but the sound froze in her throat.</p><p>She stood paralyzed, suddenly freezing as if she were a cube of ice in the balmy water.</p><p>The bones...the bodies...</p><p>Georgia\u2019s terrified words of the night before seemed to echo and bounce in her mind.</p> <p>Then she did scream, loud and long. And she found sense and logic, amazingly, and started shouting for the others to come.</p><p>The bones...the bodies...</p><p>They were there. There was no sign of the boat, but Georgia Dare and Travis Glenn were there\u2014in the sand. Their heads, eyes glaring open, were posed next to one another, staring toward the sea. Inches away from each, arms stretched out of the sand as well\u2014just as props had done in the filming. It was as if they desperately reached out for help as the earth sucked them down, leaving only those pathetic heads, features frozen in silent screams.</p><p>Jay had reached the scene. He was shaking and staring, in shock and denial. He shouted. \u201cTravis, what is this, damn it! Georgia\u2014no! No, no, no! Where is Carlos? What kind of a stunt is this?\u201d Jerking like a mechanical figure, Jay went to touch the actor\u2019s head, as if he could wake him up or snap him out of whatever game he was playing.</p><p>The head rolled through the sand. The body wasn\u2019t attached.</p><p>Jay himself began to scream.</p><p>Frozen still, shaking from a sudden cold that threatened never to leave her, Vanessa remained just offshore. She didn\u2019t move until Lew had gotten the authorities, until a kindly Bahamian official came and wrapped a towel around her shoulders, and led her away.</p><p>1</p><p>2 years later</p><p>Key West</p><p>Before him, frond coral waved in a slow and majestic dance, and a small ray emerged from the sand by the reef, weaving in a swift escape, aware that a large presence, possibly predatory, was near.</p><p>Sean O\u2019Hara shot back up to the surface, pleased with his quick inspection of Pirate Cut, a shallow reef where divers and snorkelers alike came to enjoy the simple beauty of nature. It was throughout history a place where many a ship had met her doom, crushed by the merciless winds of a storm. Now only scattered remnants of that history remained; salvage divers of old had done their work along with the sea, salt and the constant shift of sands and tides and weather that remained just as turbulent through the centuries.</p><p>It was still, he decided, a great place to film.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t opted for scuba gear that day\u2014it had been just a quick trip, thirty minutes out and thirty back in, early morning, just to report to his partner, David Beckett, so they could talk about their ever-changing script and their plans for their documentary film.</p><p>Because Sean was an expert diver, he seldom went diving alone. Good friends\u2014some of the best and most experienced divers in the world\u2014had died needlessly by diving alone. But a free dive on a calm day hadn\u2019t seemed much of a risk, and he was pleased that he had taken off early in the morning. Most of the dive boats headed out by nine, but few of them came to Pirate Cut as a first dive, and it wouldn\u2019t get busy until later in the day.</p><p>And out in the boat, he wasn\u2019t exactly alone.</p><p>Bartholomew was with him.</p><p>Climbing up the dive ladder at the rear of his boat, Conch Fritter, he tossed his flippers up and hauled himself on board. His cell phone sat on his towel, and the message light was blinking. Caller ID showed him that he\u2019d been called from O\u2019Hara\u2019s, his uncle\u2019s bar.</p><p>\u201cI thought about answering it, but refrained.\u201d</p><p>Sean turned at the sound of the voice. Bartholomew was seated at the helm of the dive boat, feet in buckle shoes up on the wheel, a National Geographic magazine in his hands.</p><p>Bartholomew was getting damned good at holding things.</p><p>\u201cThank you for refraining. And tell me again, why the hell are you with me? You hate the water,\u201d Sean said, irritated. He pushed buttons on his phone to receive his messages, staring at Bartholomew.</p><p>\u201cLove boats, though,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>Sean groaned inwardly. It was amazing\u2014once he hadn\u2019t believed in Bartholomew. Actually, he\u2019d thought the ghost might have been one of his sister Katie\u2019s imaginary friends. He realized he either had to accept that she was crazy or that there was a ghost. At that time, Sean couldn\u2019t see or hear Bartholomew.</p><p>But that had been a while ago now. While solving the Effigy Murders\u2014as the press wound up calling them\u2014he\u2019d ended up with his head in a bandage and stitches in his scalp.</p><p>It was the day the damned stitches had come out that he\u2019d first seen the ghost\u2014as clearly as if he had physical substance\u2014sitting in a chair next to the hospital bed.</p><p>Sean listened to his messages. The first, from David Beckett, asking him what time he wanted to go out. Sean grinned. David was in love\u2014and sleeping late. Sean was glad, since it seemed that his old friend was in love with his sister, Katie, and she was in love with him. They\u2019d both seen some tough times, and Sean was happy for them.</p><p>The next message was from his uncle just asking him to call back.</p><p>He did so. Still, he didn\u2019t learn much. His uncle just wanted him to come to the bar. Sean told him it would take him about forty-five minutes, and Jamie said that was fine, just to come.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d Bartholomew asked.</p><p>\u201cGoing to the bar, that\u2019s all,\u201d Sean said. He was curious. Jamie wasn\u2019t usually secretive.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep a hand on the helm? Bring her straight in?\u201d Sean asked Bartholomew as he brought up the anchor. Securing it, he added, \u201cJeez, am I crazy asking you that?\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew looked at him with tremendous indignation.</p><p>\u201cReally! That was absolutely\u2014churlish of you! If there\u2019s one thing I know, it\u2019s a lazy man\u2019s boat like this!\u201d</p><p>Sean grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the head in the shower for about fifteen minutes. That\u2019s all you need to manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be great if we pass the Coast Guard or a tour boat!\u201d Bartholomew cried.</p><p>Sean ignored him. He just wanted to rinse off the sea salt\u2014his uncle had him curious.</p><p>He showered, dried and dressed in the head and cabin well within his fifteen minutes. In another twenty, he was tying up at the pier.</p><p>Duval Street was quiet.</p><p>As he walked from the docks to O\u2019Hara\u2019s, Sean mused with a certain wry humor that Key West was, beyond a doubt, a place for night owls. He was accustomed enough to working at night\u2014or even partying at night\u2014but he was actually more fond of the morning hours.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think Jamie wants?\u201d</p><p>Sean heard the question again\u2014for what seemed like the tenth time now\u2014and groaned inwardly without turning to look at the speaker. Imagine, once he had wanted to see the damned ghost!</p><p>Oh, he could see Bartholomew way too clearly now, though when he had first come home to Key West\u2014hearing that David Beckett was in town and worried for his sister\u2019s safety\u2014he had come with his longtime fear for Katie\u2019s mind. She had always seemed to sense or see things. But that had been Katie, not him.</p><p>Bartholomew had apparently wanted to be known, though at first he proved his presence by moving things around.</p><p>Then Sean had seen him in that damned chair in the hospital room. Now he could see the long-dead privateer as easily as he could see any flesh-and-blood, living person who walked into his life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cursed the fact.</p><p>He had never believed in ghosts. He\u2019d never wanted to believe. In fact, he\u2019d warned Katie not to ever talk about the fact that she had \u201cstrange encounters\u201d or had been \u201cgifted\u201d or \u201ccursed\u201d from a young age. The majority of the world would think that she should be institutionalized.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t pleased that he saw Bartholomew. Now he had the fear that he would one day wind up institutionalized himself.</p> <p>And he was far from pleased that the dapper centuries-old entity had now decided to affix himself to Sean.</p><p>\u201cI will not answer you. I will never answer you in public,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Bartholomew laughed. \u201cYou just answered me. Then again, we\u2019re hardly in public, you know. I think the whole island is still asleep. Besides, you\u2019re a filmmaker. An \u2018artiste!\u2019 People will happily believe that you are eccentric, and it\u2019s your brilliance causing you to speak to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Don\u2019t you feel that you should go and haunt my sister?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cI believe she\u2019s busy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m apparently hanging around for something,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cOthers have gone on, and I haven\u2019t. You seem to be someone I must help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will, I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>Sean kept walking.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think he wanted?\u201d Bartholomew persisted.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sean said flatly. \u201cBut he wanted something, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to see him.\u201d He cast a glance Bartholomew\u2019s way. The privateer\u2014hanged long ago for a deed he hadn\u2019t committed\u2014was really quite a sight. His frock coat and stockings, buckle shoes, vest and tricornered hat all fit his tall, lean physique quite well. In his lifetime, Sean thought dryly, he had probably made a few hearts flutter. Sadly, he had died because of the death of the love of his life, and an act of piracy blamed upon him. However, after haunting the island since then, he had recently found a new love, the \u201clady in white,\u201d legendary in Key West. When they filmed their documentary, Sean meant to make sure that he covered Bartholomew\u2019s case and those of his old and new loves.</p><p>He\u2019d heard once that ghosts remained on earth for a reason. They wanted to avenge their unjust deaths, they needed to help an ancestor or they were searching for truth. There were supposedly ghosts who were caught in time, reenacting the last moments of their lives. But that was considered \u201cresidual haunting,\u201d while Bartholomew\u2019s determination to remain on earth in a spectral form was known as \u201cactive\u201d or \u201cintelligent\u201d haunting.</p><p>Bartholomew had been around for a reason\u2014he had been unjustly killed. But Sean couldn\u2019t figure out why he remained now. His past had been aligned with David Beckett and his family, and Sean had to admit that Bartholomew had been helpful in solving the Effigy Murders, all connected to the Becketts.</p><p>Maybe he had stayed because of the injustice done to him and because he still felt that he owed something to the Becketts. All Sean knew was that he had been Katie\u2019s ghost\u2014if there was such a thing\u2014and now he seemed to be with him all the time.</p><p>Sean liked Bartholomew. He had a great deal of wit and he knew his history. He was loyal and might well have contributed to saving their lives.</p><p>But it was unnerving from the get-go to realize that you were seeing a ghost. It was worse realizing that the ghost was no longer determined to stick to Katie like glue, but had moved on to him. He was a good conversationalist\u2014and thus the problem. Sean was far too tempted to talk to him, reply in public and definitely appear stark, raving mad upon occasion.</p><p>Ghosts were all over the place, Bartholomew had informed him. Most people felt a whisper in the breeze, sometimes a little pang of sorrow, and if the ghost was \u201cintelligent\u201d and \u201cactive,\u201d it might enjoy a bit of fun now and then, creating a breeze, causing a bang in the dark of night, and so on. Katie had real vision for the souls lurking this side of the veil. So far, thank God, he\u2019d seen only Bartholomew, and maybe a mist of others in the shadows now and then.</p><p>Sean had been damned happy before he\u2019d \u201cseen\u201d a ghost at all.</p> <p>Pirate Cut, he noted mentally. A good place to begin shooting. They hadn\u2019t known in Bartholomew\u2019s day that the reefs needed to be protected. They had brought their ships to the deep-water plunge just off the reef many times. Bartholomew knew for a fact that the legend about the area was true\u2014ships of many nations had foundered here in storms, been cut up on the reefs and left to the destruction of time and the elements. But there was treasure scattered here, treasure and history, even if it had been picked over in the many years since.</p><p>It would also make for beautiful underwater footage. The colors were brilliant; the light was excellent. And it was near the area where Bartholomew had allegedly chased and gunned down a ship and murdered those aboard. Falsely accused, in the days after David Porter\u2019s Pirate Squadron had been established, he had been hanged quickly, and it had been only after his unjust death that his innocence had been proven.</p><p>It was a good story for a documentary. Especially considering the events of the recent past, when a madman had decided that it was his ancestor who had been wronged and that the Becketts were to pay.</p><p>The whole story needed to be told, and it would.</p><p>And perhaps, if he managed to get Bartholomew\u2019s story out there, with any luck Bartholomew might \u201csee the light\u201d and move on to the better world he believed he would find.</p><p>It was true that Bartholomew was not a bad guy and that, if he were flesh and blood, he\u2019d be great to hang out with. But with Katie engaged to David Beckett now and basically living at the Beckett house, it seemed that Bartholomew was really all his.</p><p>And no way out of it\u2014it was awkward. Disconcerting. And he was starting to look as if he walked around talking to himself. So much for an intelligent and manly image, Sean thought dryly.</p><p>\u201cBartholomew, please, stop talking to me. You\u2019re well aware that I look crazy as all hell when people see me talking to you, right?\u201d Sean demanded.</p><p>\u201cI keep telling you, you\u2019re an artist. And a true conch,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cBorn and bred on the island. Tall, with that great red hair, good and bronzed\u2014hey, fellow, a man\u2019s man as they say,\u201d Bartholomew told him, waving a ringed hand in the air. \u201cTrust me\u2014you\u2019re masculine, virile, beloved and\u2014an artist. You\u2019re allowed to be crazy. And, good God, man\u2014this is Key West!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Then the tourists will have me arrested,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>They\u2019d reached O\u2019Hara\u2019s, toward the southern end of Duval. Sean cast Bartholomew a warning glare. Bartholomew shrugged and followed Sean in.</p><p>Sean walked straight up to the bar. Jamie O\u2019Hara himself was working his taps that day.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d Sean asked, setting his hands on the bar and looking at Jamie, who was busy drying a beer glass.</p><p>It was early in the day\u2014by Key West bar standards. Just after eleven. Jamie, when he was in town, usually opened the place around eleven-thirty, and whoever of his old friends, locals, or even tourists who wandered in for lunch early were served by Jamie himself. He cooked, bussed and made his drinks, poured his own Guinnesses\u2014seven minutes to properly fill a Guinness glass\u2014and he did so because he liked being a pub owner and he was the kind of employer who liked people, his employees and his establishment. He could handle the place in the early hour\u2014unless there was a festival in town. Which, quite often, there was. Starting at the end of this week, he\u2019d have double shifts going on\u2014Pirates in Paradise was coming to town.</p><p>At this moment, though, O\u2019Hara\u2019s was quiet. Just Jamie, behind the bar.</p><p>Jamie was the perfect Irish barkeep\u2014though he had been born in Key West. He, like Sean\u2019s dad, had spent a great deal of time in the \u201cold country\u201d visiting their mother\u2019s family\u2014O\u2019Casey folk\u2014and he and Sean\u2019s dad had both gone to college in Dublin. Jamie could put on a great brogue when he chose, but he could also slip into a laid-back Keys Southern drawl. Sean had always thought he should have been an actor. Jamie said that owning a pub was nearly the same thing. He had a rich head full of gray hair, a weather-worn but distinguished face, bright blue eyes and a fine-trimmed beard and mustache, both in that steel-gray that seemed to make him appear to be some kind of clan chieftain, or an old ard-ri, high king, of Ireland. He was well over six feet, with broad shoulders and a seaman\u2019s muscles.</p><p>Jamie indicated the last booth in the bar area of the pub, which was now cast in shadow.</p><p>He realized that someone was sitting in the booth.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but grin at his uncle. \u201cYou\u2019re harboring a spy? A double agent? Someone from the CIA working the Keys connection?\u201d</p><p>Sean knew that bad things\u2014very bad things\u2014could happen, even in Key West, Florida, \u201cisland paradise\u201d though it might be. He\u2019d seen them. But someone hiding in the shadows seemed a bit out of the ordinary.</p><p>Jamie shrugged and spoke softly. \u201cWho knows why she\u2019s sitting in the dark? She\u2019s a nice kid. Came in here, I guess, \u2019cause the world seems to consider it neutral ground or something. She heard about you and David and the documentary you two are going to film together.\u201d</p><p>Sean frowned. \u201cWe\u2019ve had ads in the papers for crews for the boats and the filming. David and I have been setting up for interviews at his place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me, son, eh? She came in here, knowing I was related to the O\u2019Hara looking to film about Key West and her mysteries. I said yes, and she asked if there was any way she could speak to you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s applying for a job? Then she should go about it just like all the others and ask for an interview,\u201d Sean said, annoyed. He couldn\u2019t really see the woman in the corner, but he thought she seemed young. Maybe she was trying to secure a position by coming through the back door, flirting, drawing on his uncle\u2019s sympathies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s work she\u2019s looking for, but I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s pretty tense. She wanted to know about the recent business down here\u2014you know, all the nasty stuff with the murders\u2014and she was mainly wanting to know, so it seemed, how you all coped with the bad things going on. Like, frankly, were you a pack of cowards, was it really all solved by the police, did I think that you were capable people\u2014and did you really know the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, great. She sounds like someone I really want to hire!\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Jamie laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s not that bad\u2014she was dead honest in the questions she asked me. She didn\u2019t use the word coward, that was mine. There\u2019s something I like about her, Sean. Talk to her. She seems tense and nervous\u2014and somehow, the real deal.\u201d His uncle leaned closer to him. \u201cThere\u2019s some mystery about this girl, and yet something real. Talk to her. Oh, and by the way, she is really something. She\u2019s got every diving certificate, advanced, teacher, you name it. She\u2019s gotten awards for her writing, and oh\u2014hmm. She happens to have amazing blond hair, giant blue eyes and a shape to die for, nephew. Check it out. Go ahead. What\u2019s the matter, boy, scared?\u201d</p> <p>Sean looked at his uncle in surprise and laughed. Scared? No. He was at least intrigued. Couldn\u2019t hurt to talk to the woman. He and David were anxious to get started on their project because it was important to both of them\u2014and it was also what they were best known for in their separate careers. But they were discussing just what bits and pieces and stories they would use for their documentary. Bartholomew\u2019s situation was a must, Robert the Doll was a must, and the bizarre, true and fairly recent history of Elena and Count von Cosel was also a must. It wouldn\u2019t be Key West if they didn\u2019t touch on Hemingway and the writing connection. And there had to be pirates, wreckers, sponge divers and cigar makers, and how the Conch Republic became the Conch Republic. But as to exactly what they were using and what they were concentrating on, they were still open. They hadn\u2019t made any hard-and-fast decisions yet, but since David was home and planning a wedding with Sean\u2019s sister, they had decided that, at long last, they should work together. Friends in school who hadn\u2019t seen each other in a decade, they had both gone the same route\u2014film. Once the tension and terror of a murderer at work in Key West had died down, David had decided he was going to stay home awhile. That had a lot to do with the fact that he was in love with Sean\u2019s sister, Katie O\u2019Hara. But David was a conch, too\u2014born and bred in Key West from nearly two generations of conchs. David belonged here.</p><p>Sean had stayed away from home a lot, too. But now he was excited about the idea of working with David\u2014and working on a history about Key West and the surrounding area, bringing to light what truth they could discover that lay behind many of the legends. One thing had never been more true\u2014fact was far stranger than fiction. But as he knew from living here, fact could become distorted. Tourists often asked which form of a story told by a tour guide was the true one. He and David meant to explore many of the legends regarding Key West\u2014and, through historical documents, letters and newspapers of each era, get to the heart of the truth. Fascinating work. He loved his home. Key West was the tail end of Florida, an oddity in time and place. An island accessible only by boat for much of its history. Southern in the Civil War by state, Union by military presence.</p><p>Bartholomew suddenly let out a soft, low whistle, almost making Sean jump. He gritted his teeth and refused to look at the ghost.</p><p>\u201cPretty, pretty thing!\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cI\u2019d have been over there by now, not wondering if there was some secret agenda behind it all!\u201d</p><p>Somehow, Sean refrained from replying. He even kept smiling and staring straight at his uncle.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to stare at the shadows? Or are you at least going to let the girl have her say?\u201d Jamie demanded. \u201cI\u2019ll bring coffee,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI know where the coffee is, thanks, Uncle,\u201d Sean said. He came behind the bar to pour himself a cup, trying to get a better look at the woman at the booth.</p><p>She was waiting for him. There was no looking at her surreptitiously\u2014she was staring back at him. She was still in the shadows, but his uncle seemed to be right about one thing\u2014she was stunning. She had the kind of cheekbones that were pure, classic beauty\u2014at eighty, she\u2019d still be attractive with that bone structure. Her hair was golden and pale and simply long, with slightly rakish and overgrown bangs. He didn\u2019t think she spent a lot of money in a boutique salon; the shades of color had come from the sun and the overgrown, rakish look was probably because she didn\u2019t spend much time getting it cut.</p><p>She was dressed more like a native than a tourist\u2014light cotton dress with a little sweater over her shoulders. Down here, the days were often hot, tempered only by the ocean and gulf breezes that were usually present. But inside, it could be like the new ice age had come\u2014because of the heat, businesses were often freezing. Jamie kept his swinging doors to the outside open sometimes\u2014it was a Key thing. Trying to be somewhat conservative in the waste of energy, the air blasted in the back, not near the front.</p><p>Coffee in hand, he walked back to the booth at last. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Sean O\u2019Hara. We\u2019re doing interviews tomorrow and the next day at the old Beckett house, because, I\u2019m assuming you know, it\u2019s a joint project between David Beckett and myself.\u201d He offered her his hand.</p><p>She accepted it. Her grip was firm. Her palms were slightly callused, but they were nice, tanned. Her fingers were long and she had neat nails, clipped at a reasonable length rather than grown out long.</p> <p>Her eyes were steady on his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Vanessa Loren,\u201d she said. \u201cI have real experience and sound credentials, but that\u2019s not exactly why I\u2019m here, or why I wanted to meet with you here.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, taking a seat opposite her in the booth.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>She suddenly lifted both hands and let them fall. \u201cI\u2019ve actually practiced this many times, but I\u2019m not sure where to begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\u2014practiced?\u201d Sean asked. \u201cPracticed an interview for a job?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve practiced trying to explain. This is really important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Start anywhere,\u201d Sean said.</p> <p>She lowered her head, breathing in deeply. Then she looked at him again. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve been under a rock, you must have heard about the Haunt Island murders.\u201d</p><p>He blinked and tried to remember. He\u2019d been filming in the Black Sea two years ago, but he had heard about the bizarre murders. Members of a film crew had been gruesomely slain on an island just southwest of South Bimini. Though uninhabited, the island belonged to the Bahamas.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t moved into the booth and hadn\u2019t left room for Bartholomew. However, the ghost had followed him to the booth, and leaned against the wall just across from them.</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard something about the murders,\u201d he said carefully.</p><p>\u201cI was with the film crew,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of my best childhood friends was the director, and I was the scriptwriter. We both put money into the venture, and we were doing double duty. When I say low budget, I mean low budget. But we had it together\u2014we knew what we were doing, and we worked incredibly hard. The film wasn\u2019t going to win an Oscar, but we had hopes of having it picked up by a national distributor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know much about that,\u201d Bartholomew said sorrowfully, as if he were part of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou were making a film, and people were brutally killed,\u201d Sean said, ignoring Bartholomew. He didn\u2019t want to feel sympathy for her. Sadly, there were a number of unsolved mysteries that had little chance of being solved. He vaguely remembered some of the newspaper articles his sister had e-mailed him at the time\u2014a lot of people were chalking the tragedy up to the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle. \u201cWhat are you trying to tell me, or ask me?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s really all the same area\u2014the same area you\u2019re doing a documentary on. Do you know how many boaters go from the Intracoastal, South Florida, say Fort Lauderdale and Miami, out to Bimini and then on to Key West?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr vice versa. We\u2019re all connected here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he said, feeling oddly irritated. \u201cWe always intended to do a documentary on the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a story that shouldn\u2019t just be included, it should be the main focus,\u201d she said somberly. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s an unsolved mystery. And there\u2019s a killer or killers out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, there are many killers on the loose at any given time. I\u2019m not sure what we can do for you. David and I are not law enforcement,\u201d Sean said. \u201cAnd if we were, Haunt Island is still the Bahamas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound as if law enforcement has had much luck yet,\u201d Bartholomew interjected.</p><p>\u201cI was there when it happened,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThe truth must be discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re just doing a documentary,\u201d Sean protested.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a documentary on history\u2014and oddities and mysteries. You\u2019ll never find a better mystery,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cI admit, the script was written for what would basically be a teenage-slasher-type flick,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was based on history. Key West and Bahamian history.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m still getting lost here. You were filming a movie based on history, but it was a slasher film? Low budget? A historical slasher film? You\u2019re talking big money there.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot with the people we had working with us. The new digital age has helped a hell of a lot. And we had easy access to costumes\u2014we bought most of them here, some from the shop on Front Street, and some at Pirates in Paradise. We refitted one of our boats, and with a little digital finesse, we had a pirate ship, which could become pirate ships. We knew what we were doing\u2014I\u2019m talking about people with real degrees in film and real experience\u2014and more. It was our project.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m listening. Tell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re from here and you\u2019re working on history,\u201d she said. \u201cYou must have heard of the Santa Geneva\u2014and Mad Miller and his consort, Kitty Cutlass, and the murder of Dona Isabella.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly. He knew the legend. All Key West kids knew the stories about pirates in the area. They made great tales at campfires. \u201cA piece of pirate lore,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, and if you\u2019re following pirate lore, you should be following that story. It was past the Golden Age of Piracy. It was after David Porter came here to clear out the pirates. There were still Spaniards living here, naturally. Dona Isabella was a wealthy woman, with homes in Madrid and Key West. She was married to Diego, a very wealthy Spanish merchant. She was kidnapped off a Spanish ship, the Santa Geneva. They say she was never ransomed because Mad Miller, the pirate, fell in love with her\u2014and because of that, she wound up dead. Some say that Mad Miller murdered her in a frenzy, because she loathed him. Some say that Kitty Cutlass, furious over her lover\u2019s adoration for another woman, was the one to kill her. At any rate, she supposedly wound up dead in the company of the pirates. It\u2019s thought that she survived until the pirates reached Haunt Island, where they might have drawn in for ship repairs. Some of Mad Miller\u2019s men then massacred the remaining crew members of the Santa Geneva, and members of their own crew who were in revolt over what had happened. Thus the name, obviously, Haunt Island, and the legend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d Sean began.</p><p>\u201cDona Isabella lived in Key West. Her ship, a Spanish ship, left from Key West. The pirates raided her in American waters. Off of Key West. Mad Miller came from Key West. Let\u2019s see\u2014Kitty Cutlass began as a prostitute in a shack on Duval. Mr. O\u2019Hara, this is an amazing story that has everything to do with the documentary you want to film. You\u2019re a fool if you haven\u2019t already thought of using the legend\u2014and the truth of what happened to the members of our film crew,\u201d she said.</p><p>All right\u2014that was aggravating. But there was something desperate in her voice that kept him from entirely losing his temper.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Miss Loren. You have a good story. What, exactly, is it that you want? I\u2019ve told you, we\u2019re not any form of law enforcement. I can\u2019t go over to the Bahamas and just solve your mystery for you.\u201d</p> <p>She inhaled again, staring at him. She let out a long breath of air. She seemed to physically square her shoulders, as if seeking strength and resolve.</p><p>\u201cI know that, and...\u201d She paused, wincing. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just passionate about my feelings on this. First, I need you to hire me. I\u2019m good\u2014really good. I swear. You can check all my references,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI would definitely do so, no matter what,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d bet good money that she has excellent references,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>Sean locked his jaw, determined not to turn, or respond to the ghost in any way.</p><p>\u201cNo one is hired unless David and I agree,\u201d he said to Vanessa.</p> <p>\u201cThat is certainly understandable,\u201d she said. Again, she paused. \u201cI know all about David Beckett, as well. I know that he was once accused of murder, and I know how desperate he was to find the truth. And the truth was discovered. I can\u2019t believe that he wouldn\u2019t understand how I feel, or be sympathetic to my cause.\u201d</p><p>Sean felt tension steal through his body. The Effigy Murders had been bad, very bad. He still felt they were all recovering from the terrible things that had happened. He still had scars beneath his hairline.</p><p>David would be sympathetic, he knew.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014I think you need to make me your assistant. I\u2019m excellent at managing a schedule, and I can write a scene, narrative, interview questions, anything you need, at the drop of a hat. I know you do a lot of your own scheduling and writing. That\u2019s why I say assistant. I went to film school. When needed, I can handle any kind of a camera. I\u2019m fit so I can tote and carry. The filmmaker in you must see what there is here\u2014a legend that remains a mystery, historical and contemporary. You can look for the Santa Geneva, you can really follow the path of those who came before you. And if you leave out piracy, and the stamping out of the pirates, and the supposed massacre on Haunt Island, you\u2019re doing a disservice to everyone.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back. \u201cIf this is such a great documentary, why don\u2019t you do it yourself?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She leaned back, biting her lower lip. \u201cWell, for one, I don\u2019t have the kind of money you need for a documentary. And...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p> <p>She leaned forward. \u201cLook, I\u2019ll work cheap. I\u2019ll work harder than anyone you ever imagined.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019d like to help you, I\u2019d really like to help you. But it seems as if you\u2019re chasing something, and I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m not what you\u2019re looking for. If these murders haven\u2019t been solved, you need a private investigator. You need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever tried to look for a private investigator who specializes in water, legends and boats?\u201d she asked irritably.</p><p>He hesitated for a moment. \u201cLook, from what I understand, every agency possible was involved in that case. If there are no clues, there are no clues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one wanted to follow through on the legend\u2014or the history,\u201d she said, exasperated.</p><p>He felt his fingers tense around his coffee cup and he stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to tell me that pirates returned to massacre your friends?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Something about the tightening in her lips and the way that she stared at him caused him to feel as if he should be ashamed\u2014as if he had spoken out of turn.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t. And he couldn\u2019t explain to her that he knew what ghosts were capable of doing, and what they weren\u2019t. As a matter of fact, he knew a few of them....</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m suggesting at all,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014don\u2019t know, exactly,\u201d she said, looking away. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing. We\u2019ve had this movie stowed since it happened. But...people know about it. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll get an offer from a major distributor. My partner would gladly sell. I don\u2019t want to sell\u2014not unless I can get some justice for those who were involved. I don\u2019t want to make money on sensationalism, on something...something unsolved. I\u2019ve gotten Jay to agree that I can try one more time to discover the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Please just tell me that you\u2019ll consider doing it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He stared at her, not knowing what to say.</p><p>No. A flat-out no would be a great answer. He and David hadn\u2019t set anything in stone as yet, but...no. This one had to be a no. They both had their individual exemplary careers, they knew what they were doing. They could write themselves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just don\u2019t think my partner will agree,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWill you ask David Beckett?\u201d she queried stubbornly.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWill you quit asking if I talk to him and he says no?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014Look, I know I\u2019m asking a lot without much to offer. But I am really good at what I do, and if you give me a few weeks, I promise, I\u2019ll help to make anything you want to do come out as brilliantly as possible. I\u2019ll be slave labor, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want slave labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the best damned assistant you\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she swore.</p><p>\u201cTake her up on it!\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cHell, my boy! Take her up on it just for the pleasure of having her upon your wretched little boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to David,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou really will. And...and if he\u2019s hesitant, if there\u2019s any chance, will you let me try to persuade him, as well?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He forced an even smile. No, just say no!</p><p>He asked himself if he would be so torn, so tempted, if the person asking him wasn\u2019t this young woman, not just beautiful, but...strong. So confident in her ability that she would swear she could make his work the best ever.</p><p>Ability.</p><p>The way she looked.</p><p>The sound of her voice.</p><p>The mystery involved. Yes, he knew the damned legend. And hell yes, he was curious.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he began.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t looking at him. She was looking at the door. She let out a little cry of surprise and gladness.</p><p>Sean swung around. His sister had just come in the door.</p><p>He looked at Vanessa Loren.</p><p>Ah, hell.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>The young woman knew Katie. He should have figured.</p><p>He stared back at her, irritated, and suddenly certain that it was all over.</p><p>\u201cYou know my sister,\u201d he said.</p><p>She glanced at him while rising. \u201cYes, I know Katie. I\u2019ve been on a few dive boats with her, and of course, I bring friends in here for Katie-okie when I\u2019m down....\u201d</p><p>She started to head out to see Katie. He set his fingers around her wrist, drawing her back.</p><p>She didn\u2019t jerk away, but then his hold was pretty firm. Those huge, cornflower-blue eyes of hers lit on him.</p><p>He smiled coldly. \u201cYou know my uncle, too, don\u2019t you? And my uncle knew just who you were and what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met Jamie before, yes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cKatie can explain it all to David, if you don\u2019t want to, but I know that she\u2019ll convince him that I\u2019m right. I came to you first, because Katie told me that David had said all the major decisions were going to be yours, so if you just agree\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stood, releasing her wrist.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like being played,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cGood day, Miss Loren.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t call after him.</p><p>Bartholomew did.</p><p>\u201cSean! Oh, come on, Sean. I can help you with this, I was around when it all happened,\u201d the dapper buccaneer cried to him. \u201cSean, oh, do come on! If I were flesh and blood, I\u2019d be on this like a mosquito at a topless bar! Sean!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean passed Katie near the doorway. \u201cHey, sis,\u201d he said, kissed her cheek, and kept on going.</p><p>They\u2019d all just survived near death.

The lithe and dignified Miss Loren had come rushing out, and now she stood on the sidewalk, staring after him.</p><p>Despite himself, he paused.</p><p>She walked to him, her chin high. \u201cI never meant to play anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just desperate for help. You don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI think I do,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t. I have reason to believe that someone must find out what happened, not just for those who were killed, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther things have happened. Bad things. Not involved with filming, but with other boaters who disappeared near Haunt Island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sea can be huge and merciless, Miss Loren. And sadly, throughout history, many a boat and ship have disappeared without a trace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to it. I know there\u2019s more to it, and I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid of what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that if the truth isn\u2019t discovered, more people will die. That there will be blood and death...a massacre again, and maybe this time, here, in Key West.\u201d</p><p>2</p><p>Vanessa walked back into O\u2019Hara\u2019s, trying to feel as if she hadn\u2019t just been crushed in a major defeat.</p><p>Katie was sitting at the bar, talking to her uncle. She watched Vanessa as she came up and took the stool next to her. Vanessa had known Katie forever, or so it seemed. They\u2019d met when Katie\u2019s school had brought a group of Key West students up to dive the springs and Vanessa\u2019s school had been hosting the week of camp. She wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d liked her at first, being ten and wary of kids who came from cool places like Key West. But she\u2019d been paired with Katie, who had an exceptional voice, for the talent show, and Vanessa had been her harmony and backup act, and they\u2019d won the grand prize\u2014two new regulators for their scuba equipment. That had begun the friendship. Of course, they\u2019d been kids living almost four hundred miles away from one another even if it was the same state, but they\u2019d kept up as much as possible, visiting one another at their respective colleges and meeting whenever they could.</p><p>By the time they had been able to get together in Key West, or anywhere in the Keys, Sean had been gone most of the time, so it really wasn\u2019t that strange that she\u2019d never had a chance to meet him before.</p><p>It seemed odd that the O\u2019Haras could so clearly resemble one another and yet look so different. When she\u2019d asked Jamie O\u2019Hara what Sean looked like, he told her that Katie was Sean in a dress. That wasn\u2019t true at all. Sean was very tall, three or four inches over six feet, with a linebacker\u2019s shoulders. Katie was slim and willowy. While Katie had auburn hair, Sean\u2019s was lighter, though with the same streaks of red. Katie\u2019s eyes were a hazel green while Sean\u2019s were more of a golden color. He had almost classic features, just like Katie, but he looked like a man who had braved the wind many a time, and his jaw leaned toward the square side.</p><p>Maybe that had just been because he\u2019d been talking to her\u2014and she sensed that she\u2019d irritated him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should have mentioned first that I knew you both,\u201d Vanessa said dryly to Katie.</p> <p>Katie smiled and swirled a stirrer in her coffee cup. \u201cHa-ha. Perhaps he\u2019s feeling as if we\u2019re ganging up on him! Oh, well, Sean is just being\u2014Sean. He\u2019ll get over it. Really, I think the lure of the mystery will get to him, once he thinks it all out. I think.\u201d She looked at Vanessa with concern. \u201cBut...are you sure you should be doing this? Maybe you should just leave it all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that\u2014you know you couldn\u2019t do that! Hey, I\u2019ve talked to people around here. You plunged headfirst into finding out what had happened in David\u2019s past, a pretty dangerous occupation, so I heard,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t realize at the beginning that there were going to be more bodies,\u201d Katie murmured. \u201cAnd David was determined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then, let me put it this way\u2014could you just forget about it? Katie, I saw that poor girl the night she disappeared\u2014and wound up dead. She was terrified. There was something on that beach. Other people go over there still, despite what happened.\u201d</p><p>Katie frowned. \u201cBut nothing has happened since, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on Haunt Island,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened otherwise?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cIn two years\u2019 time? I don\u2019t know everything, but I\u2019m suspicious every time I hear about any bad things happening. I know about one boat that disappeared in that area. A charter boat on its way to Bimini about a year ago. Disappeared, as in vanished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings don\u2019t really disappear in the Bermuda Triangle,\u201d Katie said. \u201cIt was just that for years, we didn\u2019t know what had happened. But they found the planes that went down years ago, after World War II. They finally found them. No one knows why they went down, but they certainly have educated theories. So a charter boat didn\u2019t really disappear\u2014it\u2019s out there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, one of Jay\u2019s boats disappeared,\u201d Vanessa said flatly. \u201cIt disappeared\u2014and Travis and Georgia were found dead on the beach.\u201d</p><p>Katie looked at her sympathetically. \u201cThe Bahamian authorities, Florida State authorities, and even the FBI got in on the investigation, Vanessa. There\u2019s a problem with the ocean\u2014when things go down, they may go down miles. There are storms, there are currents. There were no clues on the island.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cThey, um, never found the rest of the bodies, right?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa shook her head. \u201cI\u2019d say they actively investigated for months...maybe even a year. The torsos, hips and legs were never found. God, I can\u2019t even believe I\u2019m saying that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there was a suspect, right? Carlos...someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlos Roca,\u201d Vanessa told her. \u201cBut he was a good guy. A friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so, no matter how you might think that he was a good guy, and even if he was a friend, you have to admit, Vanessa, it does appear as if Carlos had already killed Travis, and that when he said he\u2019d take Georgia back to Miami, he was lying. What he did was kill her, get the boat down the beach, find where he\u2019d stashed Travis\u2019s body, and stage the heads and arms. Then he stole the boat and dumped the rest of the bodies into the ocean. Oh, Vanessa, I know you don\u2019t want to believe that. But there\u2019s no other explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlos would have popped up somewhere. And the boat would have been found.\u201d</p><p>Katie let out a long sigh. \u201cNessa, the boat could have gotten into trouble\u2014and it might have sunk. And Carlos might have gone down with it. God knows where he might have tried to go from Haunt Island. But that boat\u2019s out there somewhere. I don\u2019t know about the bodies anymore\u2014fish are ravenous little creatures, really\u2014and not so little, often. Time, salt water...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t David\u2019s cousin, Liam, a detective now? Could he know something?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I talked to him after you called me. He was never in on that investigation. He\u2019d heard about it, of course, but he didn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Jamie O\u2019Hara strode down the bar to where the two of them were sitting. \u201cDon\u2019t you be worrying, Miss Loren. If I know my nephew, and I think I do, he\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>Katie arched a brow at Jamie. \u201cUncle Jamie, don\u2019t go getting her hopes up, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Jamie winked at Vanessa.</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019ll come around, too, don\u2019t you, Katie?\u201d</p><p>Katie frowned. Then she sighed. \u201cYes, I started on David this morning, so...well, we\u2019ll see. But, Vanessa, I don\u2019t want you to be so\u2014obsessed. I know my brother and David, and I know that they\u2019re fascinated by mysteries like this, but...you have to understand,\u201d she added quietly. \u201cDavid came home determined to discover the truth behind a ten-year-old murder case because he had been accused of murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Vanessa said. She\u2019d read all about the insanity that had first driven David Beckett out of Key West, and then home. Naturally. She had been friends with Katie O\u2019Hara for years. She had read every word in the papers when the case had been solved, and that had brought her back here. Key West had two of its own native conchs\u2014David Beckett and Sean O\u2019Hara\u2014about to embark on a film project that would bring to light many of the mysteries that surrounded the area throughout the decades and even centuries. David Beckett had a military background, and Sean O\u2019Hara had filmed in many dangerous places, had received a great deal of defensive training and certainly knew how to take care of himself. Beckett also had a cousin who was a detective with the Key West police. They were the right people to at least explore the waters, and the story, and make her feel at the very least as if she were doing all that she could to find out just what had happened to Georgia, Travis\u2014and Carlos Roca.</p><p>\u201cOh, I mean, David\u2019s a great person!\u201d Katie said, quickly defending the love of her life. \u201cYou have to understand, it\u2019s not that he wouldn\u2019t care, or that he wouldn\u2019t be horrified\u2014but he\u2019s not FBI, a cop or any other kind of law enforcement.\u201d She brightened suddenly. \u201cHey, I\u2019ll set up a meeting with Liam. I mean, if Liam gets into it, maybe he could help us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great\u2014thanks, Katie. I\u2019d like to meet him and hear what he thinks, because I\u2019m sure he had to have heard about it, at least when it was all taking place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jamie said, \u201cwell and good. Now you can\u2019t sit here in the bar, moping about all day. Go enjoy the fall. Beautiful days we\u2019ve got going here now. Days that are the kind that bring people south. Get\u2014get out of bar, go and do something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, I know that my friend Marty\u2014big-time into pirates\u2014is getting ready for his booth and show for the Pirates in Paradise performances this year. Let\u2019s go give him a hand\u2014he loves to talk pirates. I bet he knows all about that pirate you were using for your horror movie, Mad Miller. And I can almost guarantee you he knows about Kitty Cutlass and Dona Isabella, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie,\u201d Vanessa said, \u201cI did tons of research. And I love the history\u2014love it!\u2014but we\u2019re talking about people murdered just two years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were filming history, right?\u201d</p> <p>Vanessa grimaced. \u201cWell, history\u2014fractured beyond belief\u2014that we were using for a slasher flick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll call Liam. We\u2019ll have dinner. We\u2019ll have him over to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid will be there, right? I mean\u2014you are living with David at the Beckett house, right?\u201d Vanessa asked her.</p><p>\u201cDavid will be on your side,\u201d Katie said. \u201cI\u2019ll call while we head over to Marty\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that you\u2019ll convince David to be on my side?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p> <p>Katie laughed. \u201cI can be very persuasive. No, all kidding aside, they should agree to follow your mystery. It\u2019s good film. They\u2019ll be delving into piracy, the founding of the area\u2014and something that\u2019s contemporary and horrible. People like justice and a satisfactory ending. No one can bring the dead back to life, but there is something to be said for closure. We don\u2019t feel that we failed those who died if we can figure out a riddle and bring a killer to justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may have you do all the talking,\u201d Vanessa told her.</p><p>\u201cIt will work out,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Vanessa wasn\u2019t at all sure that she believed Katie, but she had to keep trying. She had exhausted other possibilities. She had plagued many law-enforcement agencies, and people had been kind and they had said the right things. But the case, though open, was not being actively investigated. Her only recourse was filmmakers\u2014and those with a preplanned budget and a plan. And a wealth of knowledge about the history of the area.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Vanessa said. She smiled at the elder O\u2019Hara behind the bar. \u201cThank you, Jamie. Katie, let\u2019s go play with the pirates.\u201d</p><p>Clear air turbulence in the Bermuda Triangle.</p> <p>That was one of the main causes listed on a number of the flights\u2014major commercial flights and smaller, private craft\u2014that had plunged a thousand feet or more or had trouble in the last few decades.</p><p>There were other losses, however. A number of disappearances in the area known as the Bermuda Triangle. It wasn\u2019t officially an area at all, and had only become so in latter history\u2014the U.S. Board of Geographical Names didn\u2019t recognize it as a place with a name at all. Superstition ruled a lot of what people believed about the area, and it had a doppelg\u00e4nger on the other side of the world called \u201cthe Devil\u2019s Sea\u201d by Japanese and Filipino people.</p><p>The most widely accepted scientific explanation for the strange events in the area had to do with magnetism. In the Bermuda Triangle, magnets might point \u201ctrue north\u201d in contrast to \u201cmagnetic north,\u201d which had to do with circumnavigating the earth. The compass variations could be as great as twenty degrees, which would definitely cause havoc when attempting to reach a destination.</p><p>Sean leaned back in his computer chair, studying the screen.</p><p>The next theory had to do with gas\u2014gas from the sea itself. Subterranean beds shifting due to underwater landslides could cause a vast leakage of methane gas. An Englishman from Leeds University had proposed the theory as late as the 1990s that the weight of the gas in the water could cause a ship to sink like a rock and also that the gas in the air could cause instantaneous combustion of a fuel-filled jet in seconds flat. Boom.</p><p>The first odd occurrence went all the way back to Christopher Columbus, who, along with several of his men, reported mass compass malfunctions, a massive bolt of fire that suddenly fell from the sky into the sea and then strange lights on the horizon\u2014all in the area of the Bermuda Triangle.</p><p>Switching from site to site on the Internet, Sean had to admit that he found what he was reading fascinating.</p><p>But from magnets and gas, the theories went off into other realms, ones he was certain he couldn\u2019t buy himself.</p> <p>Aliens. Apparently, the belief that aliens were responsible for the disappearances was more widespread than he\u2019d wanted to know. Some people believed that extraterrestrials had brought down a massive ship hundreds of years ago. That ship was down below the ocean floor. Sometimes the aliens were angry and destructive. Sometimes, to perform their evil deeds in their evil laboratories, they would send out their own vessels to snag ships or planes and bring them down below the surface.</p><p>Some people believed that they made trips to earth only now and then to snatch planes from the sky and ships from the sea.</p><p>Another theory had to do with the lost city of Atlantis. The psychic Edgar Cayce, who passed away in 1945, had claimed that he\u2014and many other people\u2014were reincarnated residents of the doomed Atlantis. He said that the city had not been in the Old World at all but near Bimini, in the Bahamas. The people had been highly advanced and used fire crystals for their power\u2014fire crystals that had gotten out of hand and exploded, thus causing the sinking of Atlantis. There were still fire crystals deeply embedded in the ocean, and their power surged sometimes, causing ships, people, planes and debris to disappear. He prophesied that Atlantis would rise again in 1968 or \u201969.</p><p>In 1968, the Bimini Road or Bimini Wall was discovered\u2014a rock formation of rounded stones beneath the sea near North Bimini that definitely bore the appearance of an ancient great highway. Some geologists argued that it was a natural highway; others were convinced that it might have been a manmade structure dating back three to four thousand years.</p><p>Sean had seen the Bimini Wall, and it was fascinating, but he wasn\u2019t a structural scholar, so he couldn\u2019t determine if the wall had been there forever, lurking beneath sand and the elements, or if it had been manmade.</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe that Cayce had once been a citizen of the fabled Atlantis.</p><p>Another man had put forth a crystal theory\u2014Ray Brown. While diving in the area in 1970, he had gotten cut off from his friends. He\u2019d found an underwater cave. The cave had been extraordinary. He\u2019d seen a pyramid formation against a beautiful aquamarine light. Obviously, some higher intelligence had been at work in the cave, creating the light, the formation and the smooth workmanship within the cave.</p><p>He\u2019d found a crystal sphere in the pyramid, and taken it. When he\u2019d left the cave, he\u2019d heard a voice telling him to get out and never to return.</p><p>Sean sat back, shaking his head, puzzled. If he\u2019d ever found such a cave, he\u2019d have partners and film crew down in the water before he ever came out of it.</p><p>Ray Brown didn\u2019t do that.</p><p>He didn\u2019t tell the world about his remarkable experience.</p><p>He brought his crystal to a psychics fair in Phoenix in 1975.</p><p>If his cave had ever been discovered or the secret of the crystal divulged, Sean didn\u2019t know about it, nor, going from site to site to site on the Internet, could he find any mention of it\u2014the cave, that was. There was mention only of the crystal.</p><p>Behind him, Bartholomew sniffed.</p><p>\u201cGod! Would you not read over my shoulder?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Bartholomew ignored the question.</p><p>\u201cThey are referring to the Gulf Stream. They are referring to an area that, even in my day, was one of the most heavily traveled sea passages in the world. The current is always five to six knots, storms rise up constantly out of nowhere, and statistically, it would be almost impossible for things not to happen in the area. Ah, but absurd things do happen. So is there a Bermuda Triangle? Or is it just the natural state of the world?\u201d he queried.</p><p>\u201cI believe that you\u2019re right about the fact that the sea can be dangerous, the Gulf Stream can be treacherous and human beings can make errors. There was a case just a few years ago where seven fishermen were out. The captain had sailed the waters more than thirty years. They left on a clear day, and a rogue wave overturned the boat. They weren\u2019t five nautical miles from shore, but after the wave hit, the boat overturned. Two died and five were found alive. If the five hadn\u2019t been recovered, it would have been another case for the Bermuda Triangle, because no trace of the fishing boat was ever discovered and they were in relatively shallow waters, close to shore, when it happened. I don\u2019t believe in crystals or aliens. Who knows? Maybe a city was sunk thousands of years ago\u2014I\u2019ve been places where they know that one day the volcanoes beneath the surface will blow\u2014and old islands will go down and new ones will be formed. Hawaii will sink\u2014hell, one day, Florida will sink. That\u2019s the planet. But as far as people being murdered by the Bermuda Triangle, crystals, aliens, or even a subspecies of humanity with gills\u2014I don\u2019t believe it for an instant.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew laughed. \u201cThat from a man carrying on a conversation with a ghost!\u201d</p><p>Sean glared at him.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Bartholomew protested. \u201cI\u2019m just pointing out that there is more in the world than what most people are willing to see or accept. But frankly, I\u2019m with you. I don\u2019t believe in aliens\u2014not from other planets. Oh, there may be life out there, but I have a feeling that life might be fungi or sponges. And no one sees the future\u2014except for God. I\u2019ve been around a very long time. I\u2019ve been able to observe quite a bit. Like the fact that you\u2019re thinking about all of this because you\u2019ve spent the day on the computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there no one else you can go haunt?\u201d Sean asked him. \u201cWhere is your beautiful lady in white?\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew waved a hand in the air. \u201cI\u2019ll see her later.\u201d</p><p>A ghost, yes. He was talking to a ghost. Not his fault\u2014he blamed that on Katie! So he was talking to a ghost, and calling others absurd!</p><p>\u201cGhosts are different,\u201d Bartholomew said, as if reading his mind. \u201cWe were, we lived and breathed. Energy doesn\u2019t die\u2014and we are the result. Most human beings have a religious or spiritual belief, and if you believe in what you don\u2019t see, as in God, then it\u2019s not such a stretch to believe that souls exist. And we all know that even among the living, some people can communicate and some can\u2019t. But I do agree with you. The perpetrator of the evil deeds surrounding the film crew was not the Bermuda Triangle, the power of a crystal or a little green man popping out of the ocean. There\u2019s a live person, homicidal, organized and possibly psychotic,\u201d he finished. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean stared at him, hiding a smile.</p><p>\u201cI have spent some time in the police station, obviously,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cActually, it\u2019s quite something. People are always saying \u2018I\u2019d just love to be a fly on the wall.\u2019 Well, that is one thing about departing one\u2019s earthly form. I am able to be a fly on the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so you\u2019re an expert now on all things law enforcement,\u201d Sean teased.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m gifted at listening to other people\u2014and you may never know when you need the services of an excellent eavesdropper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint noted, thank you. Isn\u2019t it time for high tea, or something like that?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off to find my dear beauty in white,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cBe nice to me, Sean O\u2019Hara\u2014I believe I\u2019m still here to watch out for you, so you just may find that you need me!\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew walked to the door, and disappeared through it.</p><p>Sean turned back to the computer and keyed in the name Vanessa Loren.</p> <p>\u201cFascinating!\u201d Marty said to Vanessa. She and Katie had joined him at his house on Fleming Street. It was what they called a \u201cshotgun\u201d house, built with a long hall or breezeway, so that if the front and back doors were both open, you could fire a shotgun and the bullet would run right through the house. Basically, the plan was to keep the air going through the house at all times, since it had been built long before air-conditioning became a customary feature in homes in the hot, subtropical climes of the Keys.</p><p>Marty seemed like a very nice guy. Vanessa had actually seen him before, stopping in at O\u2019Hara\u2019s for Katie\u2019s business, Katie-oke. O\u2019Hara\u2019s was always pleasant and laid-back, and a lot of locals planning acts for different festivals, private parties or any such ventures spent time there. The bar had the kind of comfortable feel that worked for locals and tourists alike. Vanessa hadn\u2019t met Marty formally before, but she\u2019d seen him do a good job with a pirate bellow in a rollicky sea shanty.</p><p>His house was decorated to fit the man. There were a number of ship\u2019s bells, ships in bottles, old figureheads, anchors and other paraphernalia from the past set up around the house; he was a collector of books, music, logs, parchments, deeds, old money and more. The place was eclectic and comfortable. Vanessa thought that he must have a small fortune in the place as far as the value of some of the antiques would go, but it was still comfortable and casual.</p><p>\u201cFascinating!\u201d Marty repeated, then he looked sheepish and rueful. \u201cOh, that\u2019s terrible, that\u2019s really terrible of me to say. I\u2019m so, so sorry about your friends, of course. And I suppose it all did terrible things to the futures of those who survived. But that it all happened when you were working on a movie about Mad Miller and Kitty Cutlass... I\u2019ve always been intrigued by the tales of people that have come down to us. History. People make it so dry. This date and that date. It\u2019s not dates schoolchildren should be remembering\u2014it\u2019s the people. History should be like a reality show\u2014or Oprah. No, Jerry Springer. People love the weaknesses, the cruelty and sometimes even the honor of others!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe an enterprising person will get it together that way one day, Marty,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cAha!\u201d Marty told her happily. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing at the fort this year. An interview with a few of our notorious pirates and their consorts. You have to come. Better yet, you could be consorts, harlots, barmaids\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to work, Marty,\u201d Katie reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping to be working,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>Marty sighed, disappointed, and studied Vanessa. \u201cHave you not worked for the last two years\u2014since the incident on Bimini?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ve been working, Marty. I\u2019m doing all right. You know the commercial for the new under water camera that any two-year old can use? I wrote it.\u201d</p><p>Marty shuddered. \u201cAll those two-year-olds!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fun, actually. We shot in a lovely private pool, and the kids were really adorable,\u201d Vanessa assured him.</p><p>Marty still looked at her worriedly. \u201cYou okay down here? Where are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a perfectly good room at my house or with David and me\u2014she won\u2019t take either,\u201d Katie said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just down Duval, perfect location, a little room for rent above one of the shops,\u201d Vanessa told him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m quite happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if you\u2019re not safe?\u201d Marty asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right on Duval, in the midst of the tourist horde. There\u2019s someone up just about all hours of the night, and the cops are out in droves. I\u2019m safe. Look, I\u2019ve been bugging police and anyone else you can think of for two years\u2014whatever happened, happened. It\u2019s sliding by, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so concerned. This killer might lie dormant for a long time, then swoop down on another group of unsuspecting boaters.\u201d</p><p>Marty stood. \u201cWell. Just in case you didn\u2019t come across this in your research, I have something to show you.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the large buffet where a ship\u2019s dining bell held the central position. Reaching behind it, he pulled out a framed picture. He turned to her with pleasure in his eyes. \u201cDona Isabella!\u201d he told her.</p><p>Vanessa walked over to study the picture. It was a pen-and-ink drawing of a woman in an elegant gown circa the early eighteen hundreds. Her hair was loose, curling around her shoulders. The artist had captured the beauty of the woman, and something more\u2014something that was partly flirtatious and might also be cunning. She could see that the sketch had been titled \u201cThe Mystery of a Woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that this is Dona Isabella?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>Marty smiled, proud of his acquisition. He opened the frame, showing the old parchment on which the portrait had been sketched, and the signature of the artist. Len Adams had sketched the picture, and he had written, \u201cDona Isabella at Tea with a Friend, 1834.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had it authenticated, of course,\u201d Marty said. \u201cLen Adams is known down here\u2014his pieces are coveted. He died very young of tuberculosis, so he doesn\u2019t have an extensive body of work. He came here because he was dying in the north. He died anyway. But he sketched many wonderful portraits.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa was fascinated by the picture, and suddenly felt guilty about her slasher-film script. Of course, in the movie, Dona Isabella had been the victim of Kitty Cutlass, quickly in the film, and quickly out. It had been Kitty Cutlass who\u2019d returned from her watery grave to join with the ghost of Mad Miller to wreak murder, mayhem and havoc upon the unsuspecting teens sailing to Bimini and on Haunt Island.</p><p>\u201cOh, girl, you\u2019re one after my own heart!\u201d Marty said, appreciating the way she looked at the picture. \u201cI\u2019ll copy it for you\u2014won\u2019t be the original, but you\u2019ll have the beauty anytime you choose. Poor thing! So lovely, such a coquette and so tragically young to be a victim.\u201d He looked at Vanessa. \u201cBoy, that would be something, wouldn\u2019t it? What if your people were killed because the ghosts of Mad Miller and Kitty Cutlass are out there, cruising between Key West and Bimini, right into the Triangle, alive through some wild magnetic source?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa stared at him.</p><p>He gave her a tap on the shoulder. \u201cJoshing with you, girl. But if you want more pirate history, you come on back here anytime, all right? And if you need anything at all, you come to see me. I\u2019m like a Key West structure, an institution, always here, and I wouldn\u2019t be anywhere else in the world.\u201d</p><p>She thanked him, and she and Katie said goodbye.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that the murders might have had something to do with the story you were filming?\u201d Katie asked as they walked. \u201cNo, wait. We\u2019ll wait until we all get together, and then we\u2019ll talk about it. I don\u2019t want to make you repeat it all over and over.\u201d</p><p>They stopped in front of the Beckett house and Vanessa looked up at the grand facade. \u201cSo you\u2019re living in the Beckett house!\u201d Vanessa teased.</p><p>Katie shrugged. \u201cLife is pretty bizarre, just like death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems,\u201d Vanessa agreed.</p><p>Katie opened the front door with a key and they stepped into the hallway. She paused. \u201cI guess they\u2019re already here,\u201d she said. They walked through the large parlor, through the kitchen and to the back porch, handsomely furnished with white wicker and plush jungle-colored cushions. There were three men there already\u2014not just the two tall, dark-haired men Vanessa assumed to be Liam and David Beckett, but Sean O\u2019Hara, as well.</p><p>They all stood as Vanessa and Katie came into the room.</p><p>She envied Katie, who walked comfortably up to David Beckett and slipped an arm around him. There was something nicely sure and confident in the motion, and more so in David\u2019s smile of response. They were happy.</p><p>David and Liam shook hands with Vanessa and were pleasant and cordial. Sean, of course, she had already met.</p><p>He waited quietly.</p><p>Then the awkward silence fell at last.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t everyone sit, and I\u2019ll get some drinks and snacks,\u201d Katie suggested.</p><p>Great! Vanessa glared at her, feeling as if she had suddenly been thrown to the wolves.</p><p>But she was the one who wanted help!</p><p>She sat stiffly, folding her hands around her knees as she looked at the three. \u201cPerhaps this is way out of bounds. But I don\u2019t know where else to go from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart at the beginning,\u201d David suggested. \u201cSean has told us what you want us to do\u2014but start back at the beginning, the film shoot you did, everything that happened that night and everything that happened after.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa decided to start out looking straight ahead, and then she decided to speak as naturally as possible and not avoid anyone\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve loved Key West since I was a child, since my father first brought me down here. When my friend Jay Allen came to me saying that he wanted to make a film, the first thing that came to my mind was the story of Mad Miller, his mistress, Kitty Cutlass, and the murder of poor Dona Isabella. Everything went fine, and we were down to a skeleton crew\u2014Georgia and Travis, the last characters who remained alive, Jay and myself, of course, two young production assistants, Bill Hinton and Jake Magnoli, and Barry Melkie, our soundman. Zoe was everything as far as props, costume and makeup, with the help of Bill and Jake. Oh, and of course, Carlos Roca. Lew, our Bahamian guide, was there, too. That night, we had just about wrapped, and I was by the fire... Jay was there, I\u2019m not sure who else at first, but everyone was just winding down. Suddenly, Georgia came screaming down the beach\u2014she\u2019d seen heads sticking out of the sand, arms. She described a scene that was the exact one in which we found her and Travis the following morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou found Georgia and Travis?\u201d David asked.</p><p>She nodded gravely.</p><p>\u201cYou found the bodies?\u201d Sean asked.</p> <p>\u201cI did,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cLew and Jay came quickly down to the beach, then the others...and then the Bahamian authorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see if I\u2019ve got this straight, though,\u201d Sean said. \u201cGeorgia and Travis were found dead. Georgia had been running down the beach. Where was Travis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knew,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you look for him?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cFrankly, we thought he was part of a huge prank being pulled on Georgia. Jay was aggravated with him. We did go down the beach\u2014Lew, Jay and I\u2014and there was nothing there. Except\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcept?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cThe sand where we later found the two had been churned up. It looked as if maybe there had been something stuck in the sand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that didn\u2019t bother you?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cWe were filming a horror movie. We thought that someone was playing an elaborate prank, and, as I said, that Travis was involved in the prank. I\u2019m afraid that a lot of pranks are carried out on film sets,\u201d Vanessa said evenly. She took a deep breath. \u201cAnyway, Georgia was in terror\u2014she wasn\u2019t going to stay on the island. She was having an absolute fit, so Carlos said that he could take her into Miami and head back first thing in the morning. We all thought it was best. But Georgia and Travis were found on the beach, and Carlos and the boat disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much of a mystery there,\u201d Sean said. \u201cApparently, Carlos stole the boat after he killed the two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it, not for a minute,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cThe police, the Coast Guard, the FBI\u2014every known agency looked for the boat and Carlos, but it was as if they had vanished. What you don\u2019t understand is that Carlos Roca wasn\u2019t capable of doing something so horrible. He was one of the most gentle people I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in on the investigation, but I do remember it,\u201d Liam said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry to tell you this, but most of those law-enforcement agencies believe that Carlos Roca did murder the two young people and steal the boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what they believe!\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>She was surprised when Sean said, \u201cOf course, there\u2019s another scenario. Someone else hijacked the boat, someone who might have already taken Travis. That person either killed Carlos first to take control of Georgia or had Carlos knocked out somewhere. Then did the grisly deed on the island and dumped Carlos in the Atlantic.\u201d</p><p>David leaned forward. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the curious part\u2014where was Travis? Had he been killed and his body hidden? And was it possible for someone to have killed him, hidden his body and managed to go after Carlos and Georgia in the boat, get back to the island without being seen, find the one body, stage the gruesome death scene, and then get rid of Carlos? And how, with the alarm that must have gone out, could they have gotten away with the boat? Everyone in the Bahamas, South Florida and all of the Caribbean would have been on the alert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, stealing the boat, gassing it up, changing it\u2014that seems the easiest part of it,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cI agree with you\u2014where Travis was when the whole thing started would be a nice piece of the riddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead,\u201d Vanessa said softly.</p><p>\u201cProbably dead, but where? And how was he killed, and then not found until later?\u201d Sean mused.</p> <p>\u201cThese are the questions everyone has asked time and time again, and they haven\u2019t found the answers. But they aren\u2019t people who know the legends, know the area\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnacks and beer!\u201d Katie announced cheerfully from the hallway.</p><p>She set nachos with steaming cheese and other ingredients on the coffee table and passed around the tray she carried with ice-cold beer bottles.</p><p>Vanessa accepted a beer with a gaze that said both \u201cThanks\u201d and \u201cHow could you have left me alone in here?\u201d</p><p>Katie smiled. \u201cI know you all,\u201d Katie said, sitting, \u201cand there isn\u2019t a better mystery out there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of work to do now,\u201d Liam said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a bad time, a very bad time, at the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing has been decided,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all agreed to talk about it. We\u2019ve talked about focusing on a number of mysteries and legends, but we haven\u2019t decided what our focus is going to be,\u201d David said. \u201cIt\u2019s Sean\u2019s decision. I am gung-ho on the idea of pooling our resources and working locally, but Sean\u2019s been doing the budget, mapping and research, so it\u2019s his decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but if you\u2019re thinking about the story, I ought to be on the trip,\u201d Liam said. He looked at Vanessa. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t occurred to you to be afraid? The killer or killers were never caught. They might still be out there,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cI still have nightmares. I see Georgia alive and screaming, and I see the heads and the arms sticking out of the sand. I remember being terrified of the dark for nearly a year. And then I got very angry, and I finally figured out that I\u2019d probably have nightmares for the rest of my life if I didn\u2019t do something to discover the truth. I think the killer is a coward\u2014he worked in the dark, at night. I think there has to be a way to stand against him. That starts with finding him\u2014and when he\u2019s found, I don\u2019t care if they give him life or the death penalty, just so long as he can never do anything so horrible to anyone else, ever again.\u201d</p><p>She stood up. They were going to agree, or they weren\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you all talk,\u201d she said. \u201cKatie knows where to find me. Thank you for your time.\u201d</p><p>Afraid? Yes, she\u2019d been so afraid....</p><p>Her only fear now was that they would say no.</p><p>The Happy-Me sat off the coast of Bimini in shallow water. Jenny and Mark Houghton and their friends Gabby and Dale Johnson had planned on camping on the beach, but they had gotten lazy. They hadn\u2019t tied up at the dock because they\u2019d kept the boat in the shallow water, and talked so late that the sun had gone down.</p><p>Both retired, the couples motored the short distance to Haunt Island several times a year.</p><p>Gabby and Dale had gone to bed, Mark was still topside and Jenny was humming as she put away the last of the dishes. They\u2019d dined on spaghetti and meatballs, heated up in the microwave.</p><p>She was startled to hear her husband call her name. \u201cJenny!\u201d</p><p>She nearly dropped the dish in her hand, it had been so quiet. She set it on the counter and hurried up the ladder to the deck. For a moment, it struck her that they might as well be alone in the world. Entirely alone. There were a few stars in a black-velvet sky, and it seemed that there was no horizon, the sea melded with the sky. The lights of the Happy-Me were colorful and brave against the night\u2014and pitiful, as well.</p><p>\u201cHand me the grapple pole there, quickly, Jenny,\u201d Mark said, leaning over the hull and staring into the water.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She was concerned. Mark had been given a clean bill of health after having suffered a heart attack on his seventieth birthday, but he thought himself a young man still, at times. And he was acting like a crazy one now.</p><p>\u201cThat one,\u201d he said, spinning around. There was a grappling hook on a long pole set in its place in metal brackets against the wall of the cabin.</p><p>\u201cBut, Mark\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jenny, please\u2014there\u2019s someone in the water!\u201d</p><p>She heard it then: a gasped and garbled plea for help.</p><p>While Mark continued to stare into the water, Jenny reached for the hook, almost ripping it from the wall to bring to Mark.</p><p>He stuck it out into the water, calling out, \u201cHere, here, take this, we\u2019ll get you aboard!</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d he murmured. Jenny saw that someone had the pole and that Mark was managing to pull the person closer to the boat.</p><p>\u201cThe flashlight, get a flashlight!\u201d Mark said.</p><p>Jenny turned to do so. As she did, she heard another gasping sound, and within it a little cry of terror.</p><p>She spun around.</p><p>The sound was coming from Mark. Because someone...something...was rising from the sea.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be. It was a bony pirate, half-eaten, so it appeared, in rags. Bones and rags, and it was laughing....</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jenny gasped herself.</p><p>The thing reached out and grabbed Mark around the neck. It lifted him and tossed him overboard. Jenny started to scream in protest, horrified for Mark, her companion, friend, lover, husband for all of her life.</p><p>And then...</p><p>In terror herself. For her own life.</p><p>Because now the thing pulled a sword. A fat sword. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a sword. Maybe it was a machete. Maybe it was...</p><p>Her last conscious thought was, What the hell does it matter what it is?</p><p>It swung in the night.</p><p>She never managed to scream. Her windpipe was severed before she could do so. She dropped to the deck, her head dangling from the remnants of her neck.</p><p>\u201cQuickly,\u201d said the one to the other, joining him on board. \u201cQuickly. The other two, before they wake up!\u201d</p><p>The deck was drenched as they walked across it and down the ladder to the cabin below.</p><p>Gabby and Dale never woke up.</p><p>For a while, the Happy-Me rolled in the gentle waves of the night, beneath the velvet darkness of the sky.</p><p>Then it sank to a shallow grave.</p><p>3</p><p>Vanessa had the dreams again that night.</p><p>They had started the night on the island when Georgia had talked about the monsters, left the island with Carlos\u2014and wound up murdered with her head on the sand.</p><p>For the first weeks after the incident, they\u2019d come frequently. They would start with her being Isabella, rising from the sea in her period gown, covered with seaweed.</p><p>Vanessa had agreed to play the small role of Isabella, and the day when they had filmed her in the costume had turned out to be fun\u2014after she\u2019d calmed down from being aggravated. There she had been in that gown, floating\u2014a corpse that had come to the surface, about to open its long-dead eyes\u2014and they were supposed to have been filming from beneath her. But in the middle of the shoot, they\u2019d gotten distracted by a school of barracuda, and she\u2019d looked up at last to see that the boat was far away and there was no sign of the others. She was a good swimmer, but the seas were beginning to rise and the gown was heavy. She lay there cursing them, then called out, hoping someone on the boat would hear her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The boat had come around at last with Jay and the others on board. They\u2019d been thrilled with their footage of the barracuda\u2014which usually left people alone, unless they had something on them that sparkled and attracted the attention of the predators. Incredulous, she\u2019d asked if they\u2019d gotten the shots of her, floating in the water. Oh, yes, they\u2019d done so. Then, seeing her face, Jay had been entirely contrite, and everyone had tripped over themselves trying to appease her for the afternoon.</p><p>But in her dreams, she didn\u2019t see Isabella as herself. She saw her dead, murdered, empty sockets where her eyes should be, yet seeming to see, face skeletal and pocked with the ravages of the sea, bits of bone and skull peeking through decomposing flesh. The woman stared at her as if she were the enemy, and all around her, huge black shadows seemed to form, and they were made of seaweed and evil.</p><p>Then she was alone on the beach at Haunt Island, and they were coming after her, and she didn\u2019t run because there was nowhere to go to escape the darkness and evil, she simply stood there, staring at them, as they seemed to grow larger and larger and come closer and closer, and she could smell the rot of flesh and a stagnant sea and she could almost feel the salt spray of the ocean.</p> <p>Right before they embraced her, she awoke with a start.</p><p>For a moment she was disoriented in the darkness of her room. Then she heard a whistle from below her window, the wheels of a late-night taxi going somewhere and the laughter of the few drunken revelers still on the street, and her eyes adjusted to the darkness. She was in her little studio room atop the bathing suit and T-shirt shop on Duval Street. A glance at the faceplate of her phone told her that it was just about 2:00 a.m.</p><p>She stared at the ceiling for a while, angry with herself. She wasn\u2019t afraid of ghosts or sea monsters. Someone real and alive had happened upon the island. A real person had killed her friends\u2014and she just couldn\u2019t believe it was Carlos. Carlos was probably dead. She hated the fact that everyone assumed that he\u2019d been the killer, when he probably died trying to protect Georgia from whatever sick maniac had come upon them. It was chilling to think that the killer had to have been on the island with them when Georgia had first screamed, when they had all thought that Travis was fine somewhere, laughing at the cruel joke he had played on Georgia. They should have looked harder for Travis that night.</p><p>And yet, who would have really suspected anything? They were a large enough group. They\u2019d been enjoying the shoot, and even the pristine isolation of Haunt Island.</p><p>She probably lay there for hours, and then drifted off.</p> <p>Vanessa\u2019s phone rang at 8:00 a.m. She knew, because the jarring sound caused her to bolt up, and she saw the time immediately. She fumbled to retrieve it from the stand next to the bed and answered breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa?\u201d</p><p>She felt as if her heart stood still for a moment. The voice sounded like that of Sean O\u2019Hara.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you awake? Sorry if I woke you.\u201d</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t one bit sorry, she thought.</p><p>\u201cI was awake,\u201d she said. So she was lying. She wasn\u2019t sure what she had said or done exactly that had seemed to raise a barrier of hostility within him\u2014other than that she did want him to take his project and turn it to her purpose.</p><p>\u201cReady to let me see your stuff?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiving, filming,\u201d he said. Was there a touch of mockery in his tone? Was he amused that she might have thought that he meant something else?</p><p>\u201cOf course. Anytime. Does this mean that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I want to see if you\u2019re as good as your credentials,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Where do you want me, when, and with what equipment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have equipment. You probably want your own regulator and mask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. What about cameras?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine are excellent quality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if you know my equipment, and my methods,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I hire you, it\u2019s going to be as my assistant, remember? Hauling, toting. But...it won\u2019t hurt to see what you can do with a camera. You never know when you may need some backup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet me at the dock in half an hour. My dive boat is the Conch Fritter. I\u2019ll be setting her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d she promised.</p><p>For a moment she couldn\u2019t afford to waste, she just sat there, staring at her phone. He hadn\u2019t agreed.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t said no.</p><p>And in the water, she could prove herself.</p><p>She blinked, then shot out of bed. She had thirty minutes to shower, find a suit and run down the seven or so blocks to the boat docks.</p><p>And there had to be a cup of coffee somewhere along the way.</p><p>Vanessa Loren was all business when she arrived at the dock precisely on time. She was wearing a huge tank-type T-shirt over a bathing suit and carried a dive bag in one hand, a large paper cup of coffee in the other. Her hair was swept back in a band at her nape and she was wearing large dark sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cHand over the bag,\u201d he said politely.</p><p>\u201cI can manage,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She could. Without needing a handhold of any kind for balance, she made the short leap from the dock to the deck with amazing dexterity, never in danger of losing so much as a drop of coffee\u2014not that the company didn\u2019t serve its coffee with A-one lids.</p><p>He shrugged as she landed. \u201cSuit yourself. Want to grab that line aft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew leaned casually against the rail, arms crossed over his chest. \u201cShe\u2019s got quite the physical prowess, and yet she\u2019s light and sleek as a cat. I say, hire her on! Trust me, the women of my day were seldom adept at working on any ship. Ah, this is but a boat. There you go.\u201d</p><p>Sean wanted to tell Bartholomew that there had been a number of famous and infamous women working upon pirate ships, but since Bartholomew was indignant at the term pirate, he\u2019d deny it. And he knew that Bartholomew was going to goad him all afternoon.</p><p>He refrained from replying.</p><p>He went to the fore to release the front line and she scurried to release the one aft. He didn\u2019t speak to her as he guided the Conch Fritter out of the harbor.</p><p>Bartholomew, however, kept up a running conversation.</p><p>\u201cAh, what a lovely day. Truly lovely day! Calm seas, a beautiful sky and just the tiniest kiss of autumn in the air. I do remember this reef\u2014we forced a few Spaniards into her sharp tentacles, we did. Glorious sailing! Oh, and by the way\u2014you do know that this is the area where Mad Miller supposedly attacked the Santa Geneva and kidnapped Dona Isabella. Alas, the ship upon which she sailed sank to the bottom of the sea with the nasty, evil creatures upon the pirate ship, Mad Miller\u2019s flagship, slicing up many a man as he begged for mercy, cast into the water, drowning!\u201d</p><p>Slicing them might have been a mercy, if they were drowning, Sean thought, but he kept silent.</p><p>As he cleared the channel, Vanessa came and took the companion seat by the helm.</p><p>\u201cAh, but she looks lovely there!\u201d Bartholomew commented.</p><p>She did. She was relaxed, enjoying the wind that whipped around them as they sped through the water. The Conch Fritter wasn\u2019t new, but she was a thirty-eight-foot Sea Ray custom Sundancer, and Sean loved her. She did twenty knots with amazing comfort\u2014she wasn\u2019t going to outrun a real powerboat by any means, but she could move. The cockpit was air-conditioned and equipped with two flat-screen TVs, and there were three small sleeping cabins, the captain\u2019s cabin at the fore and two lining the port and starboard sides. There was a small galley and main cabin as well, and the helm sat midway through the sleek design with a fiberglass companion seat that offered plenty of storage. He\u2019d had her outfitted with a helm opening and an aft boarding ladder with a broad platform, and portside and starboard safe holds for dive tanks.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, you love your boat,\u201d Bartholomew said, rolling his eyes. \u201cAnd she is a thing of beauty! But then again, can anything rival the gold of that young woman\u2019s hair, the sea and sky that combine in her eyes?\u201d he asked with an exaggerated sigh. Sean thought, I will not look at you, you scurvy spectral bastard.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Vanessa asked above the hum of the motor.</p><p>\u201cPirate Cut\u2014it\u2019s a close, easy dive,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even need tanks,\u201d she commented.</p><p>\u201cAh, she knows the reef!\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cFrankly, it seems that everything this young woman has said to you is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to stay down and film we need tanks and equipment,\u201d Sean said pleasantly to Vanessa.</p><p>She flushed and looked away, but it was obvious that she knew the reef, and probably knew it fairly well.</p><p>She did. She knew exactly where they were going, and how long it was going to take to get there. When they were still five minutes away, she stood and dug into her bag. She worked with a dive skin, not a suit, but a skin, light and not providing warmth. He actually liked a skin himself\u2014a skin protected a diver against the tentacles of small and unseen jellyfish.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t brought one.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d stopped the motor and dropped anchor, she had on her skin and dive booties. Dive booties could be good, too, he had to admit. He\u2019d brought neither his skin nor booties, but he didn\u2019t always wear them. She\u2019d attached her regulator to a buoyancy-control vest and tank\u2014the one next to the tank he\u2019d prepared for himself. She wasted no time.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we using?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He opened his storage container. He loved his equipment; he could spend hours perusing new camera equipment on the Internet.</p><p>He had many makes and models of video and still cameras, lighting systems and sound recorders, though often sound was added after shooting. He chose a Sony that day, with a Stingray Plus housing.</p><p>\u201cWant help with your BCV and tank?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNope, thank you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d worked on dive boats growing up; tanks were heavy, it was easy to go off balance with them. Most people didn\u2019t mind help rising with them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He let her go on her own.</p><p>She buckled into the vest and rose carefully, her mask on her head, her regulator ready. She proceeded carefully to the edge, slipped her regulator in her mouth and entered in a smooth backward flip. She had managed the weight on her slim body without any difficulty. All right, so she was trying to be one of the guys, not a hindrance, not someone on a crew who couldn\u2019t manage basic tasks.</p><p>She surfaced, and he handed her the camera equipment.

She sank below the surface.</p><p>\u201cWhat a woman!\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cWhy, if I were only flesh and blood...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not,\u201d Sean told him.</p><p>He hurried into his own gear and followed in her wake.</p> <p>Pirate\u2019s Cut was a beautiful place to dive. The water was clear, and visibility was amazing. Staghorn coral rose and wafted in the movement of the water, while torch and pineapple coral in dazzling shades grew around it. Tiny fish darted here, there and everywhere, while a large grouper, at least three hundred pounds, decided to swim at her side.</p><p>It did make for beautiful filming. She shot the coral with the tiny fish and panned slowly around to the giant grouper.</p><p>There was a drop-off near the shallow area of the reef, and she followed it down; she knew that the ocean went to no more than a hundred feet at the drop-off. She eased down about another twenty feet, aware that Sean was near her then, watching her. He came to her, motioning for the camera. She frowned behind her mask but handed it to him. He indicated her side, and she saw that the giant grouper was still following her, like a pet dog. She shrugged and swam slowly alongside the fish while Sean took footage. She reached out and stroked the side of the fish. He circled her\u2014hoping for a handout, she was certain. Divers must have recently come to the reef with food to encourage the creature to come near. It was amazing that he hadn\u2019t wound up on a dinner plate himself.</p><p>He lingered a little while longer, and then swam off.</p><p>Sean returned the camera to her. She decided to go to the bones of the old sunken ship that was assumed to be the Santa Geneva. She\u2019d been a wooden-hulled ship and had broken up, however it was that she\u2019d gone down. She was really nothing but wooden bones now, since the sea had caused the disintegration of most of the hull. Vanessa still loved the wreck. It was possible to imagine the size of the ship, where the masts had been, the hold, the cabins, the quarters.</p><p>She looked through the camera as she neared a section of the remains.</p> <p>She almost choked, and started in the water.</p><p>Through the lens, she saw a figurehead.</p><p>Impossible. The figurehead was long gone.</p><p>She looked again, and for a moment, she could have sworn that she was seeing a woman\u2019s face\u2014and the sleek lines of a beautifully crafted figurehead.</p><p>She blinked, and it was gone.</p><p>She moved the camera away for a moment and lowered herself down to the ruins. She shook the image of the figurehead and filmed the length of the ruins, taking in the fish, the barnacles growing on those sad bare bones that remained.</p><p>Something crusted rose from the bed of sand on the floor of the ocean that held the wreck. It was just a dot on the sand, but through the lens, it seemed to be something. Vanessa moved down and reached out, gently swishing sand from the object. She wasn\u2019t sure what it was, it was so encrusted, but it was odd, so she picked it up.</p><p>Sean was behind her. He eased himself down on his knees and she showed him what she had discovered. He took the camera from her and pointed upward. He was ready to surface.</p> <p>They had moved a good hundred feet from the boat and stopped at thirty-three feet to pressurize. Sean reached the dive platform and ladder before she did. He set the camera down on the platform and threw his flippers on board as she grasped hold of the platform. The sea rocked around them, but Sean ably drew himself up and turned to reach for her. She hesitated only briefly and then accepted his hand, throwing her flippers up as well and climbing up the ladder.</p><p>They came through the little custom hatch to the deck of the Sea Ray and he spun her around without asking, unlatching her tank.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get yours,\u201d she said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t protest but accepted her help and stowed the tanks. He came back to her and asked for the object she had picked up from the ocean floor.</p><p>He turned it around and around in his hand. \u201cI have friends to take this to,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Vanessa felt a sudden, eerie sweep of air around her. She spun around, looking for...</p><p>Something.</p><p>But there was nothing around her.</p><p>Still, she was suddenly cold. She could remember the figurehead she had seen through the camera lens with a frightening clarity\u2014since it hadn\u2019t really been there. And now...</p><p>This. This chilling sensation that...</p><p>They weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>Sean looked at her suddenly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNothing. A goose walked over my grave, I guess. What do you think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA coin...or a pendant. I think you\u2019ve found a real relic,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we could find out it\u2019s a 1950s Timex or something...I don\u2019t know enough to take a chance trying to get the ocean crust off it, but as I said, I have friends who do this professionally. We\u2019ll bring it to them. I\u2019m driving in. Want water, beer, soda? They\u2019re in the cooler, over there, portside. Help yourself.\u201d</p><p>He pulled down the dive flag and drew in the anchor\u2014it was automatic, all he had to do was push a button. The Sea Ray was definitely nice.</p><p>He went to the helm, starting the motor, taking the wheel. She still had the crazy feeling that they weren\u2019t alone, that the air was charged.</p><p>She grabbed a couple of bottles of water out of the cooler and hurried back to the companion seat.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014did I pass inspection?\u201d she called to Sean, more to start a conversation than because she was really ready for an answer.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply; he was looking straight ahead with a small smile on his face. The wind had ruffled his hair, he was in board shorts and nothing else, and his chest was gleaming bronze and powerfully muscled. She was startled to feel a stirring of admiration or something worse, even\u2014attraction.</p><p>It was the smile, she thought.</p><p>He reached for sunglasses, and leaned casually against the captain\u2019s seat rather than sitting.</p><p>She eased back in the companion chair, tired from the night before. She closed her eyes and allowed herself just to feel.</p><p>The figurehead had seemed so real...</p><p>Her eyes flew open. She almost bolted out of the chair.</p><p>The figurehead! The figurehead with its beautiful face...</p><p>The same face she had in her own possession, her copy of the artist\u2019s rendering of Dona Isabella.</p><p>4</p><p>Vanessa Loren knew how to work and how to move. She seemed familiar with every aspect of equipment and the importance of rinsing off their dive gear and his camera rigging as soon as they got back to the dock. When they were done, she slipped her oversize T-shirt back on and looked at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cTell her she\u2019s hired,\u201d Bartholomew said. He was stretched out on his back on the aft seat, hands crossed behind his head, hat over his eyes, as if he still needed to shade them from the sun. One leg dangled over the other in lazy comfort. \u201cTell her that she\u2019s hired, and you\u2019re doing the story. You know you\u2019re going to do it. She\u2019s a scriptwriter, she knows cameras, she knows boats, and she sure seems to have a great work ethic. Not to mention great legs as long as a yardarm and...well, nothing wrong with the rest of her, either.\u201d</p><p>Sean ignored Bartholomew. He smiled at Vanessa. \u201cYou know we\u2019ll do a background check,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cGo for it,\u201d she said, looking off into the distance. She seemed distracted.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOh, the object you found\u2014I\u2019m going to take it to friends who have a small shop on Simonton\u2014they usually work privately, but they have a little storefront. It\u2019s called Sunken Treasures. You\u2019re more than welcome to take it yourself, if you prefer. You discovered the piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you to take it\u2014I\u2019m not after treasure,\u201d she told him. Her hair was still damp; her eyes seemed the most brilliant blue he had ever seen, filled with honesty. There was something as she stood there, her answer to him filled with trust and disinterest, that seemed to catch at his throat. Or his heart.</p><p>Or, admittedly, other parts of his anatomy. Even wet, she was stunning. And yet beauty itself never created such an appeal. Maybe it was her energy or vitality. Or the way she seemed filled with warmth and vibrant, sleek movement\u2014even when she stood still. He wanted to step closer to her, as intrigued by the woman as the mystery she brought.</p><p>He stepped back.</p><p>\u201cAll right, but you\u2019ll know where it is,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She smiled. The smile seemed a little distant. She looked around him and seemed confused, then shrugged, as if returning to the subject. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll, uh, talk to you later, then?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll talk to you later,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She was sincere.</p><p>And yet it was odd. She still seemed distracted as she walked away. Sean watched her go, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cShe senses me\u2014that\u2019s what\u2019s going on,\u201d Bartholomew said, rising and adjusting his hat. \u201cShe\u2019s got the sense\u2014it\u2019s not developed, but she\u2019s got something. I know\u2014trust me. I spent a few of my early years in this rather awkward state playing tricks on people. There are those who will never sense a thing, and there are those who always get a feeling...but don\u2019t really know what it is. She\u2019s gifted, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful. She\u2019s tracking a murderer\u2014seriously, that\u2019s what she wants to do\u2014and you\u2019re doing your best to make her jump at every whisper of breeze,\u201d Sean said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcuse me! I don\u2019t really have much to do with it. Well, maybe I do. I mean, ghosts can make an effort, as you know...but I wasn\u2019t doing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly true\u2014since you talked a blue streak all day. Now I have to think over some things.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew shrugged. \u201cBut you know you\u2019re going to work with her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just my decision. David has to decide on this, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid\u2019s going to do whatever you want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is, really, there\u2019s nothing new that we\u2019re going to discover. Say Carlos Roca did it\u2014he\u2019s long gone. Say someone else did it\u2014that someone has managed to change the boat so that no one would ever recognize her, and they\u2019re probably living in Brazil by now,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cYou know better than anyone that it\u2019s never too late to seek the truth,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cBartholomew, you\u2019re like an old fishwife. Quit nagging. The story is intriguing. I have to see how I\u2019m going to fit it in with the rest of the history we want to put out there\u2014touching on enough, creating a story line\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were creating a documentary about legends and mysteries in this area. Fits right in,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cHey, look\u2014isn\u2019t that the lady in white?\u201d Sean asked, pointing toward the center of Mallory Square. There was no one there, but Bartholomew looked. He glared at Sean. \u201cShe has a name, you know. Lucinda, Miss Lucinda Wellington\u2014Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s just damned adorable to see you so smitten, my friend,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Bartholomew shook his head. \u201cYou won\u2019t distract me. Lucy and I have a lovely relationship. We walk every afternoon through the cemetery, strolling and reading the headstones. And sometimes we stroll down Duval and observe the tourists. Ah, I can smell the rum, so it seems, at times. But, Sean O\u2019Hara, God knows why, it seems I\u2019m here still to help you, and my beautiful lady in white, dear Lucy, seems glad enough to be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Just great. Well, why don\u2019t you go see if she\u2019s in the cemetery now. I\u2019m going to take a shower and then bring whatever that encrusted piece is that Vanessa found over to Jaden and Ted.\u201d</p><p>He left the ghost on deck and went down to the Conch Fritter\u2019s head. Twenty minutes later, he headed to his friends\u2019 shop, curiously flipping the thing\u2014trinket or treasure\u2014in his hand.</p> <p>Back in her room, Vanessa showered for a long time, luxuriating in the heat of the water, trying not to think. She emerged, and, convincing herself that she was overtired and suffering from the nightmares again, she went to the dresser and stared at the copy of the likeness of Dona Isabella that Marty had given her the day before.</p><p>She\u2019d never heard that any ship had sailed with a figure head carved as a replica of Dona Isabella.</p><p>Of course. There was no figurehead. She was exhausted, and she\u2019d spent the morning trying to prove that she was more efficient than the Energizer bunny.</p><p>She dressed quickly and looked at the time. One o\u2019clock. She realized that she was starving and still really exhausted. Okay, she was pretty sure that she\u2019d pulled the morning off quite well\u2014she\u2019d been efficient, she\u2019d gotten good footage, the giant grouper had certainly allowed Sean to get some good footage of her with the fish, and she\u2019d discovered something at the bottom of the ocean, where the ship had wrecked and broken up nearly two hundred years ago.</p><p>She could take a nap.</p><p>Food and a nap.</p><p>And maybe a drink to help her relax. She was just a few feet away from the Key West Smallest Bar. Food, something good and stiff and a long nap.</p><p>She had imagined the figurehead in the water. But, really, if she thought about it, if she was going to imagine images, maybe in her mind the poor martyred Dona Isabella was trying to help her, she wanted the history known, she wanted the world to know what horrible villains Mad Miller and Kitty Cutlass had been.</p> <p>Sleep.</p><p>And she would quit seeing things.</p><p>And with any luck, she wouldn\u2019t dream.</p><p>Sunken Treasures was located on Simonton. The proprietors, Jaden Valiente and Ted Taggart, were friends of Sean\u2019s from school. They\u2019d lived and worked together for years without choosing to marry, but they seemed happy, had no children, kept five cats in the small store, and appeared pleased with every aspect of their lives. They never fought, which was nice, since Sean was good friends with both of them. He\u2019d traveled so much working that he hadn\u2019t been home much since high school, but when he was in Key West, with the two of them, it was as if he had never left.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jaden said, looking up from her workstation as he entered. Ted was across the room at an identical station. They were both equipped with bright, twist-neck lamps, bottles with all kinds of solutions and brushes with varying degrees of bristles. The shop was decorated with old broadsides and sailing paraphernalia from every century and decade. It was eclectic and had one showcase\u2014where they displayed the reproduction pieces that they made, much more affordable than the real items that could be purchased many places in the city.</p><p>Jaden looked at him through magnifying glasses that made her eyes appear huge. They were warm brown eyes, and she had curly brown hair past her shoulders that gave her the look of a new age hippie. Ted had the same look\u2014he was wearing a Grateful Dead T-shirt and he also had curly brown hair that he wore long, a curly brown beard and mustache and an easygoing smile.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you in our neck of the woods. We usually have to go to karaoke down at O\u2019Hara\u2019s and warble out an old Cream number to get to see you, Sean,\u201d Ted said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself. I do not warble, I sing delightfully off-key,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA young woman diving with me this morning made a discovery,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cOh? What?\u201d Jaden asked, coming around from her workstation.</p><p>Sean produced the piece. \u201cRight now, God knows, it could be anything, but...this kind of growth and debris upon it, whatever it is, it looks as if it has been out there awhile.\u201d</p><p>Jaden took it from him, studying it. Ted came around, as well. \u201cLooks old,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIs it a coin?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cLooks more like a medallion...a brooch? Where was it found?\u201d Jaden asked.</p><p>\u201cPirate Cut,\u201d Sean told her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where the Santa Geneva went down under pirate attack,\u201d Ted said. \u201cOther ships, too. The water is so deep and then the shallow reef juts up\u2014caught lots of ships over time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were diving over the bone structure\u2014what\u2019s left\u2014of the Santa Geneva,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d Jaden looked at Ted with a pleased smile. \u201cThis really could be something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have thought that, over the years, almost everything of any value had already been brought up,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cFor shame, Sean O\u2019Hara!\u201d Jaden said. \u201cThe sea is ever a cruel mistress, and you never know what\u2019s been found and what hasn\u2019t\u2014especially over time. I\u2019ll get on it right away,\u201d Jaden promised. \u201cAnd carefully!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you would,\u201d Sean told her.</p><p>\u201cIt would be spectacular if this were a documented piece of jewelry!\u201d Jaden said enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cDid you get any of it on film?\u201d Ted asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes, some of the discovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause you\u2019re going to work with David Beckett and do a really cool documentary, right?\u201d Ted asked. \u201cWow\u2014and you start off by finding a treasure from the Santa Geneva. Lord, do I love that story!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomantic in an icky kind of tragic way,\u201d Jaden agreed.</p><p>\u201cGorgeous Dona Isabella captured, her ship sunk in Pirate\u2019s Cut!\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently when Mad Miller attacked the ship, he swept Dona Isabella from it first. And of course, he was supposed to be asking her husband for a ransom,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cBut he fell in love with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd infuriated Kitty Cutlass!\u201d Ted said dramatically.</p><p>\u201cThe ship was blown to smithereens, most of the crew killed in the water, but some of them taken prisoner as well for slave labor,\u201d Jaden said.</p><p>Looking at them, Sean shook his head and smiled. \u201cYou two should take it on the road. You\u2019re very dramatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who knows what really happened?\u201d Jaden asked with a shrug. \u201cAll that is fact is that Mad Miller did attack the ship and he did kidnap Dona Isabella. And Kitty Cutlass was madly in love with Mad Miller. I mean, supposedly, Mad Miller was in love with Kitty Cutlass, so why kidnap Dona Isabella unless it was for ransom, and she had a rich husband, and whether they were living apart or not, he would have paid the ransom, just for the sake of his pride. But, no\u2014Dona Isabella is murdered, some say by Kitty Cutlass, and the crew of the Santa Geneva who were taken prisoner rather than murdered or left to drown at the site were then massacred on Haunt Island. Oh! And those other murders took place on Haunt Island just about two years ago\u2014now, there\u2019s a story for you, Sean.</p><p>\u201cHey, who were you with?\u201d Jaden asked him curiously. \u201cWho is the \u2018young woman\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Vanessa Loren. And, yes\u2014I see you\u2019re starting to frown. If you were following the newspapers when members of the film crew were killed on Haunt Island, you heard the name. She was one of the survivors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa\u2014wow!\u201d Ted said. \u201cMan\u2014perfect. Why, you have an excellent story going there. Hey\u2014what is she like? How did she wind up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, I can\u2019t even imagine how horrible that must have been\u2014not that we haven\u2019t had our share of our own absurdities around here lately,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa! Did she come to see you on purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to meet her!\u201d Ted told Jaden.</p><p>\u201cNow, wait\u2014\u201d Sean said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. We\u2019re not going to say anything to her. We won\u2019t embarrass you!\u201d Jaden protested. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2014I just can\u2019t imagine she really likes being quizzed constantly on what happened. It must have been pretty\u2014horrifying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you two have something in common. You were almost killed by a madman,\u201d Ted pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBut Sean\u2019s madman was caught\u2014and no one knows what happened to the other,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cOh, it is a mystery! I\u2019d love to know what happened on that island. Most people, of course, think it was that fellow who was supposed to take the actress home.... Rodriquez... Rod...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRoca. Carlos Roca,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she think?\u201d Ted asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying to see what she looks like!\u201d Jaden said.</p><p>\u201cJust be nice when you meet her,\u201d Sean said. He was defending her. Well, these were his friends, but they were professing some intrusive curiosity.</p><p>\u201cAnd you might have found a relic. Like Ted said, wow, cool!\u201d Jaden said happily.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what some people think?\u201d Ted asked, nodding sagely.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Bermuda Triangle,\u201d Ted said, as if it were fact.</p><p>\u201cTed, ships get lost, planes go down, and many so-called victims of the so-called Bermuda Triangle have been found. Ships have sunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha! But throughout the years, they\u2019ve found ghost ships out there, too. Ships with absolutely nothing wrong with them\u2014but no one aboard. Hey, come on! You can order DVDs from the educational channels on the Bermuda Triangle,\u201d Ted argued.</p><p>\u201cThe Bermuda Triangle did not decapitate two people and leave their heads and arms in the sand,\u201d Sean said.</p> <p>\u201cUgh. Scary!\u201d Jaden said.</p><p>\u201cWho says that there isn\u2019t some form of really vicious creature making its home in the Triangle?\u201d Ted asked. \u201cThey\u2019re finding new species of fish constantly\u2014things like the megamouth shark that was supposed to be extinct. They know that giant squid exist, but they know almost nothing about the habits of the creatures,\u201d he said triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cA giant squid didn\u2019t do it either, Ted,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cAh! But what happened to the boat? If there\u2019s an explanation, go ahead\u2014you find it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA half-dozen law enforcement agencies, including the Coast Guard, couldn\u2019t find it\u2014I\u2019m not so sure I\u2019m going to,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about the killer? If it\u2019s a man, he\u2019s out there somewhere. Or, like I said, he\u2019s a victim of the Triangle. The Bermuda Triangle harbors some form of evil, and that evil got into the man, and then the man killed the actor and actress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure it wasn\u2019t aliens?\u201d Sean asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cEvil aliens living in the Triangle!\u201d Ted agreed.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that Sean\u2019s accepting any of your theories, my love,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cSean, before he starts to argue UFOs, I suggest you get out of here. I\u2019m going to get right on this piece\u2014I\u2019m really excited, it just might be something unique and historic. I\u2019ll call you later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe good to that young woman,\u201d Ted advised. \u201cPoor thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, be kind,\u201d Jaden admonished.</p><p>They were staring at him like a pair of proud parents on prom night. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Sean said. He offered a grimace, waved and left the shop.</p><p>Key West was a small island. Pretty soon, everyone would be talking. And like Ted, most people liked to believe there was something about the Bermuda Triangle. Or aliens.</p><p>As he headed out, his phone rang. It was Liam Beckett. \u201cI\u2019ve checked out everything possible on your Miss Loren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not exactly my Miss Loren,\u201d Sean protested.</p><p>\u201cWell, she came to you,\u201d Liam said. \u201cAnyway, she appears to be everything that she claims on paper. She went to college, and she\u2019s worked on prestigious projects since. Apparently, she invested about fifty thousand dollars into filming the movie and her partner, Jay Allen, did the same. But it doesn\u2019t seem that she\u2019s in any financial trouble\u2014in fact she was recently very well paid for a project. I have a list of her work, some of which can be pulled up on YouTube.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I had you do extensive work on her background,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d find anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the real deal, so it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if you\u2019re doing this\u2014I want in on it. I have to apply quickly for the time. Hey, you two are going to need me. Yeah, yeah, you\u2019re tough guys, but I\u2019m a cop, and three of us who completely trust each other are better than two. You need me,\u201d Liam repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou were always invited, whatever the end choices. I just didn\u2019t think that you could get off with everything that has gone on lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I\u2019m there,\u201d Liam said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed. \u201cKatie-oke at O\u2019Hara\u2019s. David sips a beer and munches on conch fritters every night she works, as if he\u2019s still afraid to let her out of his sight.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I understand that feeling. So why am I even considering doing this?</p><p>Because he knew, too, what it was like not to know the truth, to mistrust your best friends and wonder as the years rolled by.</p><p>\u201cYou are going to be following the route of the film crew, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>He wanted to protest again that he wasn\u2019t working alone, that the business venture was between him and David Beckett.</p><p>But David had already handed the decision over to him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said simply. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later tonight.\u201d</p><p>He headed over to the Beckett house; that afternoon, they were interviewing for positions for the shoot.</p><p>One, he knew, was already taken. Two. Liam was in, as well. And if they were all going, well, then, he could guarantee that his sister would be with them, as well.</p><p>There would be two boats, as always planned.</p><p>It occurred to him that the film crew who met the tragic and traumatic fate had also started out from Key West with two boats. Wasn\u2019t that the point? He mocked himself.</p><p>They were re-creating history. Seeking the truth.</p><p>And they were probably fools.</p><p>But, he determined, they\u2019d be fools who came on the journey aware and alert\u2014and well armed.</p><p>The Smallest Bar in Key West was very small. Vanessa had gotten to know several of the bartenders, and they were nice\u2014even when she just wanted to order a soda or a bottle of water. She was certain that they knew who she was\u2014her picture had been in the papers and on the news.</p><p>The afternoon had gone well. The warm shower, food and the Irish car bomb the bartender had suggested had done a number on her and she\u2019d slept like the dead for almost four hours. Once she awoke and thought about the night, she didn\u2019t want to be alone and she didn\u2019t want to sit by the phone waiting to see if Sean was going to call her.</p><p>She decided to head south on Duval for O\u2019Hara\u2019s. Katie should have been setting up the karaoke by then. Not that she had to set up much\u2014it was her uncle\u2019s bar, and nothing was going to happen to any of her equipment there.</p><p>As she walked down the street, she knew that many of the shopkeepers and servers at outside restaurants watched her as she went by. Just another reminder that people would not quickly forget her face, or the story that was associated with it.</p><p>Such gruesome murders did not occur without a great deal of sensationalism.</p><p>She wondered sometimes if whoever had killed Travis and Georgia\u2014she didn\u2019t believe for a minute that it had been Carlos Roca\u2014had relished the attention that the killings had brought. The police had questioned both her and Jay about their enemies. To the best of her knowledge, she didn\u2019t have any. Nor did Jay. They had led simple lives, gone to college, gone out into the world, worked really hard and survived. That had come from a lot of twenty-hour days at film school, but they had paid off. She knew she was lucky, too; she knew the water, thanks to her father.</p><p>Ah, her father! As far as her parents knew, right now she was just in the Keys with Katie. She knew they wouldn\u2019t be happy if they knew what she was doing\u2014trying to retrace the steps she had previously taken and find out if there was an answer anywhere. Maybe, if she had convinced Sean, they would find nothing. But she would have the satisfaction of knowing that she had tried everything that was in her power to find out the truth.</p><p>When she reached O\u2019Hara\u2019s, she found that Katie and David were seated at the bar. Katie was ready to go when the time rolled around, and she was snacking on conch fritters with David and sipping a soda. The two were in deep conversation when she arrived. She wondered what they were talking about\u2014they shut up the moment they saw her.</p><p>David Beckett stood politely, offering her the stool next to Katie. She tried to tell him to sit, but he wouldn\u2019t, so she thanked him and sat down. \u201cI hear we\u2019re on,\u201d Katie said happily.</p><p>\u201cWe are?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>\u201cSean called and asked if I was sure it was a direction I willing to go in\u2014and I must say I\u2019m intrigued. We\u2019ve had Liam studying what information he can from various sources, and it is one of the most disturbing mysteries of recent time,\u201d David told her.</p><p>Katie looked at Vanessa with triumph. She had an \u201cI told you so\u201d look in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe started interviewing for researchers and our film crew today,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cAnd how did that go?\u201d</p><p>David grinned. \u201cSean said that not one of the people we saw had your credentials. But some seemed okay. We actually have a number of friends who are top-notch, but most of them are already committed to projects\u2014it\u2019s tough, even for the best people, so when something is up, you commit fast. And I admit, we didn\u2019t set this up ahead very far, which might have helped in that area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still sure you can find the people you need,\u201d Vanessa said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, yeah. But it would have been easier to hit the folks we know\u2014and whose work and work ethic we know,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cEveryone has to start somewhere,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, and now I have to go to work,\u201d Katie said. \u201cI\u2019m counting on both of you if it\u2019s a dead crowd,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Vanessa smiled and shook her head. \u201cA group number!\u201d Katie said.</p><p>There were about twenty people in the bar when Katie started up, singing a number with a friend of hers, Clarinda, who was also one of the night servers at O\u2019Hara\u2019s. The two sang a country number that was beautiful and sexy. By the time they finished, other people were walking in the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that she\u2019s going to have any problem with this crowd not getting up,\u201d Vanessa told David.</p><p>\u201cProbably not. We\u2019re off the hook. Oh, and she\u2019s trying to get Clarinda to get up enough confidence to take it over when she\u2019s not here,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p> <p>David smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t think we\u2019ll all be going on this excursion without Katie, do you?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa smiled. \u201cSo it\u2019s a done deal?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to be so,\u201d David told her. \u201cI heard about your dive today\u2014and that you might have discovered a relic of some kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully. And hopefully, it is a real relic, and not a watch lost recently that encrusted quickly,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d David said, \u201cSean has a good eye for things like that. The sea can play games, that\u2019s for certain, but anyone who has grown up diving down here has found something lost from a boat from some period of time\u2014he\u2019d probably know if it was just a twenty-year-old barnacle crustation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found it awfully easily.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe current is always moving and the sand is always shifting,\u201d David reminded her.</p><p>She faced the doorway where, in ones, twos and threes, others were now coming into the bar. She saw Marty and he waved to her as he headed up to Katie and her computer area to request a song.</p><p>\u201cAh, good, Marty is here. We\u2019ll be getting a good sea shanty,\u201d David said.</p><p>She smiled at him and noted the door again.</p><p>She stiffened where she sat at the stool, dead straight.</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe it, didn\u2019t believe that she was seeing the man who was walking in.</p><p>A man obviously looking for someone.</p><p>Her.</p> <p>5</p><p>Sean arrived at his uncle\u2019s bar around nine-thirty. Katie-oke was in full swing.</p><p>He saw David at one of the high-top tables in the rear of the karaoke area and came to sit by him at one of the free bar stools. There was one left; Bartholomew sat in it as if he and Sean had come in together like any friends out for a drink together.</p><p>David acknowledged Bartholomew\u2019s presence with a nod. He could hear Bartholomew at times and see his faint outline at certain times, too. Sean didn\u2019t think that David had any kind of a sixth sense, but Bartholomew had become so entwined in the events that had nearly cost all of them their lives that David did have a sense of him. It was often a relief for Sean to be with his sister and David, who knew about Bartholomew\u2019s presence. That way, when the pirate goaded him, he could reply without appearing to be talking to an imaginary friend.</p><p>\u201cLiam here yet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But I talked to him after you did. Seems he\u2019s in on this one way or the other,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cWhich is great\u2014having a skilled cop with us cannot be bad,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cYou really think that we might have trouble?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo people were murdered, maybe three, when they were making the film. I think that the only rational explanation is that Carlos Roca was the killer, and that he\u2019s out there somewhere. But will he come after our crew? Probably not. He got away with murder\u2014and a good boat. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d come back. Is there the possibility of something going wrong, such as idiot drug smugglers, human traffickers? Sure, always. We both know that. So it\u2019s good to have a cop along. We can watch each other\u2019s backs. Yeah, I like that,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cThe pickings seemed slim today at the interviews,\u201d David said.</p><p>Sean shrugged. They had talked to a couple of \u201cpossible people.\u201d He wished he could have Frazier, from Key Largo, but he was working on a National Geographic project. There were other friends he\u2019d known for years and years. Of course, they could delay the project. But now, he didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d David said. \u201cYou know Katie is coming. And she can help with lights, sound...cameras. She says she hung around you enough when you first got into it, and we\u2019ve been out doing some fooling around filming on the reefs since we decided to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo and two,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cAlways close enough to be in easy vision, that\u2019s the way to do it.\u201d</p><p>David gazed in his direction. \u201cAnd which boat will you be on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhichever appears to be more comfortable. Or, perhaps, more in danger,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll leave Lucinda, Lucy\u2014your lady in white\u2014for that kind of time?\u201d Sean asked Bartholomew. He realized, oddly enough, that as much as he didn\u2019t want to be \u201chaunted,\u201d he did think it was a good thing that Bartholomew was ready for the trip.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t leave you folks alone. And who knows, maybe Lucy will be up for the voyage. Though she does hate the water. And boats,\u201d Bartholomew admitted.</p><p>\u201cA long time to be away,\u201d Sean noted, mumbling so that only David could hear him.</p><p>Bartholomew slowly lifted an aristocratic brow. \u201cTime is irrelevant, my dear boy. You must remember, Lucy and I have both been drifting these streets for many, many a year now. We\u2019ll be fine with a few weeks apart\u2014as they say, absence makes the heart grow fonder.\u201d He frowned. \u201cAlas, you should be worrying about a living vision of grace and beauty!\u201d Bartholomew said gravely, looking toward the booths in the bar area.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sean turned to stare.</p><p>Vanessa Loren was seated in one of the booths, oblivious to his presence\u2014and all else, including the slightly inebriated college student attempting a rap number on stage. She was facing a man; Sean could see shoulders and a head of dark hair. She was speaking passionately, and seemed to be upset.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Sean asked David, frowning. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Vanessa was in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who it is, and you didn\u2019t ask about her. We were talking. She saw that fellow in the doorway and excused herself, telling me it was an old friend she was surprised to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Sean said.</p><p>So who was the guy?</p><p>Yeah, right, and what was it to him?</p><p>That morning she had attracted him. In fact, he realized, he was more than attracted, and he didn\u2019t want to be. He wanted everything professional, every single decision he made. But she had slipped into him, mind, soul and substance, since he had first seen her sitting here in O\u2019Hara\u2019s, and he wondered if that was why he had wanted to fight anything she had to say to him\u2014it was far safer, it was far more professional not to be attracted to an employee, especially when employment started out with such a story.</p><p>All right, face it, he didn\u2019t want her bothered by anyone. All right, in all honesty, he wasn\u2019t sure what he wanted, but he didn\u2019t want her there with anyone else.</p><p>He had no right to feel that way\u2014he still barely knew her. A day of diving did not a long-term friend make, nor did standing near her, realizing just what a chemical mystique she possessed, give him the right to go interrupting her conversations with other men.</p><p>He stood. He suddenly felt as if he were a jealous boyfriend, irked that his girlfriend was flirting with someone else. Ridiculous feeling\u2014but she had pursued him, determined on her course of action. And people had been murdered. He\u2019d agreed to what she wanted\u2014he did have a right to find out why she appeared to be so disturbed.</p><p>If she was happy speaking with an old friend, fine. But if she wasn\u2019t, well, she had appealed to him for help in one way already.</p><p>Even as he approached the booth, he didn\u2019t think that this was anyone with whom Vanessa had an intimate relationship. They were on opposite sides of the booth. Her hands went from the table to the air as she spoke but never touched his. When he was speaking, she sat leaning back, arms crossed over her chest, and she seemed annoyed.</p><p>He reached the end of the booth. The man was talking, but he fell silent when Sean arrived and started to get up. He was about Vanessa\u2019s age, tall, well built and well bronzed, as if he spent a lot of time in the sun.</p><p>Sean set a hand on his shoulder. \u201cSit, sit, sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt a conversation. I just came by to say hello to Vanessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Sean,\u201d Vanessa said, her voice tight.</p><p>\u201cSean\u2014Sean O\u2019Hara?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. And...you are?\u201d</p><p>The young man stood quickly, offering his hand. \u201cJay. Jay Allen.\u201d</p><p>Jay Allen.</p><p>Producer, director and the man who had lost a small fortune because of the murders on Haunt Island.</p><p>\u201cPlease, sit down, please, please, join us,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>Vanessa didn\u2019t seem to want to have anyone\u2014more specifically him\u2014join them. Her jaw was set at a rigid angle and she stared at Jay as if her eyes were vivid blue daggers.</p><p>He was definitely going to join them.</p><p>Vanessa didn\u2019t move; she didn\u2019t look away from Jay and she appeared rigidly angry. Sean slid in beside Jay as he scooted to the inside edge of the booth.</p><p>\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m here to apply for work\u2014with you,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>Sean thought that Vanessa kicked Jay under the table.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Jay nodded. \u201cI heard that Vanessa was down here and that there were filmmakers about to embark on a historical documentary. I was working\u2014filming tourists while they played with dolphins\u2014in the Bahamas.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI see,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014 Honestly, I know everything\u2014or at least something about everything\u2014from shooting, lighting, sound, editing, you name it. Seriously, ask Vanessa. Oh, and I have a boat. It\u2019s got some equipment. I can work anything on any vessel you\u2019ve got, my diving certificate is a master\u2019s and I wash dishes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve directed, but don\u2019t worry\u2014it\u2019s not an obsession. I can take direction, as well.\u201d</p><p>Jay seemed earnest. It was just too bizarre\u2014him being here, right after he had agreed to film in the direction Vanessa had petitioned.</p> <p>Or maybe it wasn\u2019t bizarre at all. Vanessa was here. Maybe she\u2019d been elected to be the one to get under his skin and get it all going.</p><p>He stared at Vanessa. Obviously, she knew what he was thinking. Or she had known exactly what his thoughts might naturally be once Jay had shown up.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know Jay was coming in,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey, look, I just arrived with a tremendous amount of hope,\u201d Jay said. \u201cI went down like a lead balloon in all that, you have to realize.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo\u2014possibly three\u2014people are dead,\u201d Vanessa said sharply.</p><p>\u201cOh, of course! I mean, that\u2019s the most important part of all this, the really tragic part,\u201d Jay said. \u201cAnd they deserve justice. And if Carlos is innocent and out there somewhere...alive, well, we owe the truth to him, too, right? And if he did murder poor Travis and Georgia, and he didn\u2019t get swallowed up by the Bermuda Triangle, he deserves to go to prison. Or be executed. The whole thing screams for answers, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswers, yes,\u201d Sean agreed. \u201cWhether there\u2019s a prayer in hell that a set of filmmakers could get the answers, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, I swear, ask Vanessa,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>\u201cVanessa?\u201d Sean asked politely.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good. He knows boats and he can dive,\u201d she said, still not facing Sean. Her cheeks seemed flushed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it all under consideration,\u201d Sean said. \u201cAnd, of course, discuss it with my partner.\u201d</p><p>He started to rise.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Please consider me,\u201d Jay said. He sounded humble. Sincere.</p><p>And desperate.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what it means to me. Honestly\u2014yes, yes, other than the dead\u2014this didn\u2019t affect anyone as badly as me. I can\u2019t tell you... I still spend my life wondering,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s not even a real suggestion that we can find any answers,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Jay repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll discuss it with the others,\u201d Sean said. He left then, aware that Vanessa\u2019s eyes were following him as he walked across the room.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t realized that Bartholomew had been behind him until he felt the pressure when the ghost bumped into him.</p><p>\u201cSuch a skeptic!\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like what?\u201d Bartholomew demanded.</p><p>\u201cI decide to go her way\u2014and suddenly her old friend is here, asking for a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t know he was going to come here,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems honest.

Wait\u2014better call it a boulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to be careful,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014what is there to be so careful about? I\u2019d say that it\u2019s natural. If you\u2019d been involved in something like that and you heard that someone was doing anything that touched upon the mystery, wouldn\u2019t you jump it on it like a starving tick on an Irish wolfhound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA starving tick on an Irish wolfhound?\u201d Sean repeated.</p><p>\u201cI make my point\u2014and if you tell me no, I\u2019ll call you a liar of the worst kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, yes, I\u2019d be after anything that could get me close again,\u201d Sean admitted. He paused. His sister was singing an old Beatles number, giving all due honor to the Fab Four. He paused, clapping, and watching David clap, watching the pleasure on his face. The world seemed so strange. David Beckett was seriously in love with Katie. It was nice. It was the kind of thing you had to admire\u2014and envy.</p><p>He gave himself a mental shake. He\u2019d had his share of relationships, most of which had ended decently, and he was long past the stage where he understood anyone who tried to hook up with a stranger in a bar purely for the purpose of sex. But somehow, looking at his sister and David, he felt a strange sense of emptiness he\u2019d never known. He\u2019d liked his life; come and go as you please, come and go anywhere in the world. Appreciate family and old friends, and look for new adventures. But now...</p><p>He took his stool back at the high-top table with David.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cThat is Jay Allen\u2014the director of the movie that went so astray,\u201d Sean explained.</p><p>\u201cAh, the plot thickens,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks it\u2019s strange that Jay just appeared,\u201d Bartholomew said, rolling his eyes. He jumped up suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d Sean asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cLucinda lingers just outside. You\u2019ll excuse me...?\u201d Bartholomew asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Mistress Lucinda just come in?\u201d Sean asked. \u201cDamn, Bartholomew, the way you jumped up...I thought something had happened. Invite the lovely and ethereal Miss Lucy in.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cGood God, she\u2019d never!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014are you insulting my uncle\u2019s establishment?\u201d Sean teased.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re forgetting that such an establishment as O\u2019Hara\u2019s didn\u2019t really exist in my lady\u2019s day. Quite frankly, there was a house of disrepute on this very corner back then, and it was certainly no place where Lucinda would come. That\u2019s why she wanders so much. Of course, she knows that it\u2019s not a house of prostitution now, but still...memories will linger.\u201d</p><p>With a touch to his hat, he was gone. Sean watched him. Out on Duval, a rather staggered trail of tourists was wandering by. Oblivious to them, Bartholomew met his Lucy, his lady in white, in the street. He took both her hands in his own and looked down into her eyes, laughing at something she said. The tourists continued to move on by...smiling, chatting to one another, unaware of the tenderness that went on beneath their noses. One young woman paused and looked in their direction, and then smiled. The young man at her side paused as well, asking her what she saw, what made her smile, so it appeared. She shrugged and replied, stood on her toes and briefly kissed his lips, and then kept moving.</p><p>Sean saw Liam beyond the door. Like the young woman, he paused, as if sensing something there. But he didn\u2019t see the ghostly duo. He shrugged and came on in. He took the seat Bartholomew had vacated.</p><p>Liam knew about Bartholomew. One night, they had tried to explain. Liam tried to believe them; he just couldn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t see Bartholomew, or hear his voice. He didn\u2019t show his skepticism, but Sean knew it was there. Liam seemed to think they were victims of a shared hysterical hallucination, but he didn\u2019t voice his thoughts or his doubts.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the hiring going?\u201d Liam asked them both. Clarinda came by then, asking them what they\u2019d like. Sean ordered a Guinness, wondering if the dark mellow tones would lighten his mood. Liam opted for one as well, musing that it sounded good when Sean ordered it.</p><p>\u201cWe met some folks who are possibilities. I\u2019d take one Frazier Nivens over the six people we saw today, but he\u2019s working,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing all right though, really,\u201d Liam argued. \u201cYou\u2019ve got me and Katie\u2014and Vanessa. David and you, and you\u2019ll be fine with a few more people. I\u2019m not great, but I\u2019m a solid backup guy on the boat and I can hold an extension and boom arm when you\u2019re recording on deck\u2014good muscles for that. I did it enough for both of you when we were kids and recording backyard bands and some of our great oceanic discoveries like old work boots. And I can haul anything you need in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Liam, we\u2019re thrilled with you going. Hate the idea of you taking time off now, though,\u201d David said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a bad time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you are always wanted,\u201d Sean assured him. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve just had another applicant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone in the bar?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>Sean indicated Vanessa Loren\u2019s booth. \u201cJay Allen\u2014 Vanessa\u2019s friend, and the director of the ill-fated film shoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Liam said. \u201cAnd what are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI\u2019m irritated in a way\u2014it\u2019s kind of like Vanessa was sent in as a vanguard, and now he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend in beauty, and then bring the beast?\u201d Liam asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cShe pretends to be\u2014or is\u2014unaware that he planned on coming,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cAnd it may be the truth,\u201d David told him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of being used,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cLiam, want to be in charge of another background check?\u201d David asked his cousin.</p><p>Liam grinned. \u201cWay ahead of you guys. I checked out everyone on that film crew. I even did cursory checks into the one or two day jobbers they took on in different locations, and the other four cast members. Jay Allen appears to be clean as a whistle. Got through school with excellent marks\u2014and perfect attendance, for whatever that is worth. He\u2019s never been arrested, pays his bills on time and works out of Palm Beach most of the time now\u2014that\u2019s where he has his office. He directed segments of a historical series set up in Virginia, chronicling the men in the Civil War. And he won an award for editing. He\u2019s got good reports from every employer. They say that he is imaginative, dedicated and responsible.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd no corpses turned up anywhere else he worked, right?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. The movie project collapsing caused him to fall into a steady decline, though, I\u2019m afraid. He lost his personal savings, obviously\u2014just like Vanessa,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s doing all right?\u201d Sean asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes\u2014maybe because she wasn\u2019t the director of the project. Who knows why certain people wind up suffering and others don\u2019t?\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, say we take on Jay Allen. It might not be a bad thing,\u201d David said. \u201cIf we\u2019ve agreed we\u2019re following this trail, why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a timetable, and I\u2019ll get it all legit through the Bahamian authorities,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set up a schedule tomorrow,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take Jay Allen on with us, mainly because I\u2019d like to interview him when we get to Haunt Island but also because I\u2019d like to have a lot of footage edited on a daily basis, seeing how we\u2019re moving on. It will be great if it\u2019s not something we have to do ourselves, since it\u2019s so time-consuming. I\u2019d like to start with Marty, dressed up in his pirate best, telling the tale of the Santa Geneva, Mad Miller, Kitty Cutlass and poor Dona Isabella. That will explain Vanessa\u2019s script\u2014and the quest we\u2019re heading out on, to find the truth. Marty is a great character. He can also tell some of the pirate lore and history in general without becoming dry\u2014or downright boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like a plan to me. Set it up,\u201d David said.</p> <p>Sean saw Vanessa and Jay stand; they headed together over to the table where Liam, David and Sean were sitting together. \u201cDavid, Liam, this is Jay Allen. He and Sean just met. He\u2019s applying for work on the project.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was clear, but there was no emotion in it. She was angry and covering it up.</p><p>Jay offered his hand. The introduction was acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading on out for the evening. I hope you\u2019ll consider me for your crew. I truly can never explain just how much this project means to me,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>\u201cWe may find nothing. We may just rehash the same old, same old,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be aboard, just for my own peace of mind, retrace every step\u2014and see if there wasn\u2019t something of importance that we never gave to the police,\u201d Jay said.</p> <p>His words sounded reasonable, and they would certainly appeal to David.</p><p>\u201cWell, like I said, I\u2019m out of here,\u201d Jay said. \u201cI\u2019m at Paradise Inn, and\u2014\u201d he paused to write a number on a cocktail napkin \u201c\u2014this is my cell number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlan on meeting us here tomorrow at one o\u2019clock,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do an interview with a friend who\u2019s an expert in pirate lore and Key West history. I\u2019m going to have you edit the footage and we\u2019ll see what we get.\u201d</p><p>Jay brightened and grabbed Sean\u2019s hand, pumping it. \u201cGreat. Great. You won\u2019t regret it, I swear. I can stand in as well, in almost any capacity. Whatever you need. Thank you. Thank you.\u201d He looked around the table, animated, humble and grateful. \u201cThank you, thank you all.\u201d He turned to Vanessa. \u201cNessa, want a walk back to your place?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re south, I\u2019m north. I\u2019m fine. But thanks. I\u2019m going to hang around a few more minutes,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNothing is too far south or north around here, you know,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, really. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Jay nodded to her, and nodded toward the table again. He backed away. \u201cMy equipment or\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOurs, thanks,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Jay nearly knocked into a table as he left, still looking at them all the while, as if they would change their minds if he didn\u2019t. Finally, he was out the door.</p><p>David had already risen to drag a chair over to their table for Vanessa.</p><p>When she sat, David said, \u201cWell, this is interesting.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI had no idea he knew anything about this, or that he was anywhere nearby at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Sean murmured.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Liam said quickly, \u201cyou two are old friends?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMicanopy is not a big place,\u201d she said. \u201cWe went through twelve years of school together\u2014 I\u2019ve known him since I was four or five. He is a good filmmaker, and he\u2019s serious when he says that he\u2019ll do anything, anything at all. That\u2019s why our initial project had seemed so exciting. It was mainly our money, and we were willing to do what it took to get the movie made. And it is true, he\u2019s excellent at editing. He has the instinct for it, which, in my mind, at least, is one of the hardest parts of any production. Slow, hard, tedious\u2014and amazingly important to a final project. Honestly, I admit, I was angry that he suddenly showed up and wanted me to...introduce him to you all, but...he is good.\u201d</p><p>She sounded so damned honest. Sean didn\u2019t know why he still felt a strange twist inside. He wanted to trust her. Maybe he wanted to trust her too much.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t left, Sean knew, because she had felt the need to talk to the three of them. Was she protesting too much?</p><p>\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d David asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThanks, no. I\u2019m going to head out, too. I just wanted to...I wanted to talk to you for a few minutes, try to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll see what he\u2019s worth on the project tomorrow,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come, too?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not necessary,\u201d Sean said quickly. \u201cYou proved your ability today.\u201d He stood. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you back,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary. I\u2019ve walked Duval alone a...a zillion times. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to because it was necessary. I was going to walk you down because I wanted to,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then, sure. I\u2019ll just say good-night to Katie.\u201d</p><p>She walked to the stand. A man of about sixty was onstage. He was doing a damned good Sinatra imitation with his version of \u201cFly Me to the Moon.\u201d</p><p>She kissed Katie on the cheek; Katie looked up and waved to Sean. She was smiling. He walked to the computer area himself and kissed his sister on the top of the head. \u201cTomorrow, kiddo,\u201d he told her. \u201cReady?\u201d he asked Vanessa.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>They walked through the high-top tables in the karaoke area and said good-night to David and Liam. \u201cCan you grab the tab?\u201d Sean asked David.</p><p>\u201cGot it. I\u2019m not too worried\u2014I know the owner,\u201d David said.</p><p>Sean waved a hand and walked Vanessa out.</p><p>The south end of Duval was quiet as they walked along. Down by the inn where Vanessa was staying, there would still be activity at Sloppy Joe\u2019s, Captain Tony\u2019s, Rick\u2019s, Irish Kevin\u2019s and maybe a few more. It would probably be a mild crowd though. On Friday and Saturday nights, it was a wild crowd. When any of the festivals was going on, anything went.</p><p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t know anything about Jay looking to join on,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s what you\u2019ve said. Several times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t believe me,\u201d she said flatly, turning her blue eyes on him. The woman really looked like a damned angel. Her hair was like a halo, blond, and bleached lighter by the sun. Not really an angel. She wasn\u2019t delicate, he had learned that by watching her in action. She was really just about perfect. Too perfect. He felt jealous, though he barely knew her. He wanted to strangle Jay Allen because he seemed to be so close to her. He wanted to know if\u2014in the years of their friendship\u2014they had ever been intimate. Information he had no right to. He barely knew her.</p><p>He wanted her. She was gorgeous, she was sensual, she was lithe, athletic. He was imagining far too much about her.</p><p>That meant he had to stay the hell away.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe you, it just seems all too opportune,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my partner agrees that it\u2019s interesting, and we\u2019ll see how Jay does tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be there,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cLet\u2019s see how he stands on his own, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>They were coming closer to the northern end of Duval, where revelers were still out. Too many people for a real conversation. All seemed to be having fun\u2014a few were inebriated.</p><p>\u201cWatch out,\u201d he murmured. A group, nicely dressed and not composed of teenagers, seemed to be having a bit of a problem navigating the streets. He thought a tall stout man was about to run into Vanessa. He took her hand and pulled her out of the way.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe stairway is up the back, through the garden gate.\u201d She rummaged in a pocket for her key.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you around,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAll right, thanks.\u201d</p><p>They passed through a little walkway. It led to the back. There was nice foliage along the way, but the inn was basic, just some rooms over a storefront. No charming tables and chairs outside, no pool, nothing but access to the rooms.</p><p>Sean knew that it was filled with spring-breakers and bachelor and bachelorette parties.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you chose this place,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt gets awfully loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted the loud,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the activity\u2014cops around most of the time, lots of people at all hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d he asked her, frowning and setting his hands on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not really afraid. But I like people and noise.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAll right. But you do know my sister well, so it seems. She owns the house we grew up in, though I\u2019m living there now and Katie has moved in with David. Both places are huge. You\u2019re on the project now. You\u2019re welcome to come stay at either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d It seemed there was a slight tremor in her voice. \u201cI thought I should stand on my own until we get going with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour choice,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She looked at him for a long moment. He found that he really was in love with her eyes. Other assets as well, but her eyes...</p> <p>The moment grew awkward. He pulled his hands away and shoved them in his pockets. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually...\u201d she began, and then hesitated.</p><p>\u201cActually, what?\u201d he queried.</p><p>\u201cWell, I am your assistant, and a writer. I have a list of interview questions. I wrote them up, assuming you\u2019d be interviewing an expert on the pirate era, and with Pirates in Paradise gearing up, it seemed to make sense. And Marty is amazing. I mean, it\u2019s your project, you have your own questions, and once Marty gets going, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your questions,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she told him. She turned the key, entered the hallway and ran up the stairs. She returned within a minute flat, an envelope in her hands.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou are on the ball,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI swear, we\u2019re good at what we do. I\u2019m good at what I do. Honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting to hear back from Jaden and Ted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Um, well, see you then.\u201d</p><p>The door was still ajar. He opened it for her, and she entered the hallway. He watched as she ran up the stairs. The door closed behind her, and Sean pushed it so that it would close firmly and lock. He turned away and headed for his own place.</p> <p>He barely knew her.</p><p>If he\u2019d admitted it to himself, that didn\u2019t matter. He wanted her to be everything that she seemed. He wanted to know more about her. Everything.</p><p>Two people had died. Maybe a third.</p><p>And the mystery was intriguing. The only way to really understand it, to try to figure out what could have happened, was to follow the same trail.</p><p>They would do so.</p><p>Two boats.</p><p>He\u2019d make sure that Vanessa was on his.</p><p>And that Jay Allen wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>That night, it was the heads.</p><p>Vanessa was sound asleep, and the world was pleasant and dark, and then the darkness began to lift. She was walking along the shore, and it was beautiful, pristine white sand, the ocean in all its glorious shades of aqua and blue, light and deep. She heard the sound of the waves and felt the sand and the pleasant wash of the waves over her toes.</p><p>And then she reached them. Georgia\u2019s head, with her arms in front of her, stuck out of the sand, and Travis\u2019s head, his arms in front, as well.</p><p>\u201cVanessa, see! I told you I wasn\u2019t lying!\u201d Georgia said angrily.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t play bad practical jokes on people,\u201d Travis said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you all look for me, why did you just assume I was being an ass?\u201d Travis demanded.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Georgia said. Her arms moved in the sand with the exclamation, and she pointed down the shore. \u201cThey were having champagne. They were celebrating. And they all got mad at me! Then Carlos...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Carlos what?\u201d Vanessa cried out.</p><p>\u201cCarlos...Carlos...\u201d Georgia said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Come help me. Oh, wait. I can\u2019t get out of here. I have no legs. I have no torso. Why didn\u2019t you believe me, Vanessa, why didn\u2019t you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful. They\u2019ll get you, too,\u201d Travis warned. He blew a lock of his hair out of his eyes. \u201cThey\u2019ll get you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can be with us, just heads, talking heads, sitting in the sand,\u201d Georgia said.</p><p>\u201cWe have arms,\u201d Travis reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, we have arms,\u201d Georgia agreed, and they both waved their hands in the air.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Vanessa, be careful, you need the truth, or you can join us...heads and arms and hands, hands and heads...here, in the sand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact,\u201d Travis said, \u201cyou need to come closer and closer....\u201d</p><p>She awoke with a start. She was shaking, clammy with sweat. She inhaled on a deep breath and wondered if the nightmares would ever stop.</p><p>It was day. She glanced at the cheap alarm on the bedside table. Almost 9:00 a.m. She would get up, walk down to the Internet caf\u00e9, read some e-mails and drink lots of coffee. A shower would be wonderful, so wonderful now.</p><p>She ran her hands over the bed as she pushed herself from it. She frowned as her hands went over something gritty.</p><p>Sand.</p><p>She jumped out of the bed. There were a million explanations for it. She\u2019d spent the day diving. There was dirt and sand everywhere.</p><p>The pile on her bed was pristine and white.</p><p>With a shout of irritation, she whisked it off the bed and to the floor, and hurried into the bathroom.</p><p>There were tons of explanations....</p><p>Yeah, right. The explanation, ridiculous and horrible, that came to her mind was simple and sad. Georgia and Travis were haunting her. They blamed her for not doing more. They...</p><p>They needed the truth, justice, closure.</p><p>Somehow, she had to give it them.</p><p>Before she became nothing more than a head and arms in the sand herself.</p><p>6</p><p>One o\u2019clock rolled around and Sean, Jay and David went to film at Marty\u2019s place. Marty told them that they didn\u2019t need to pay him for an interview on his love of pirates and the sea, but they insisted and he shrugged it off. He seemed pleased enough to meet Jay, and he was more than helpful as they set up for the shoot in his eclectic house. When they were set, Sean did the questioning, admitting to himself that the questions Vanessa had written were excellently phrased and led Marty quickly in the right direction.</p><p>David filmed, Jay was recruited for lighting, and Marty was assured that it didn\u2019t matter if he made mistakes or wanted to go back, it was fine. The footage would be edited.</p><p>It went well. Marty was a natural showman, and if any man looked like an old pirate, it was Marty. He talked about the early days of Key West\u2014the very early days, when the Calusa Indians were around, through the Spanish period, the English period, the Spanish period, and then the days when Florida\u2014and Key West\u2014became a territory of the United States. He knew his piracy and could trace it through the sixteen, seventeen and eighteen hundreds\u2014and he could even tell hair-raising tales of modern-day piracy.</p><p>Sean led him to talking about the attack on the Santa Geneva, Mad Miller and Kitty Cutlass.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, there\u2019s a story!\u201d Marty said, his eyes blazing. \u201cMad Miller was born and bred on the island, just like his paramour, Kitty Cutlass. Kitty was a saloon girl, right on Duval Street, and let me tell you, they were rough places back then, shacks, they were. Some say she was a sweet girl gone bad, and some say she was born pure evil. Mad Miller was working a rich man\u2019s merchant vessel when he turned it around and made her a pirate ship. He managed to take a gunboat down and steal her cannons, then reworked the merchant ship into a fine pirate vessel with twenty guns. Now, it\u2019s said that the early days were good days\u2014Mad Miller would blast a merchant ship or any enemy ship to smithereens, but he\u2019d always pick up the survivors, and he never kidnapped a soul for ransom, just left them all beached somewhere. Ah, but then the battle of the sexes began! There\u2019s always a woman, right? In any story. Except in this story, there were two. Key West had barely become an American territory, Admiral David Porter had just begun his campaign with his Mosquito Squadron to clear out the pirates, when Mad Miller and his crew came upon the Santa Geneva. Relations with Spain were doing fine\u2014God knew, enough Spaniards were still living here. Now Dona Isabella was a great beauty of her day. Black eyes, black hair, fair skin, white bosom and wasp waist, and she lived a fine life of society right around the Southern tip of Duval\u2014the house is long gone now, though a fine residence still stands where it once was. She was married to Don Diego de Hidalgo, a man highly respected in his native Spain, where he chose to reside most of the time. Dona Isabella had just left Key West to return to Spain\u2014her husband wanted her back with him\u2014when Mad Miller and his crew lit out after her ship, said to carry great riches upon it. But it seemed that Mad Miller suddenly changed his ways\u2014he took a number of the surviving crew captive, but it\u2019s said that his men slashed to death those in the water who were begging to be saved. From the point of the attack\u2014near Pirate Cut and the Pirate Cut reef\u2014Mad Miller sailed off to his safe harbor at Haunt Island, a nearly desolate islet off South Bimini. There it\u2019s said that Mad Miller and his crew massacred the survivors\u2014even the beautiful Dona Isabella. Of course, much of what we suspect is theory, since no one knows what really happened. But there were rumors among other men of unsavory repute that Mad Miller had gone insane with desire for Dona Isabella and that Kitty Cutlass, in a jealous rage, had murdered her. Mad Miller then left Haunt Island, ready to attack more ships, but it wasn\u2019t to be. He met his demise not at the end of a hangman\u2019s noose but in the midst of the fury of the Atlantic. A hurricane came through, and Mad Miller\u2019s ship was sunk with all aboard, and all his treasure. This is known because another ship caught in the weather made it back. The hazardous conditions prevented any type of rescue operation, and frankly, since the ship that reported her foundering was a part of the Mosquito Squadron, it\u2019s likely that the men watched her go down with laughter on their lips\u2014when they weren\u2019t fighting to stay afloat themselves!\u201d</p><p>Marty stopped speaking and looked at Sean and then David and then Sean again.</p><p>\u201cWonderful. You were great, Marty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Really?\u201d Marty asked.</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d Jay said. He looked really pleased. \u201cMarty, you\u2019re so damned good, it\u2019s going to be easy for me to appear to be the world\u2019s most talented editor. When I\u2019m done, you\u2019ll see what I can do. You\u2019re going to love the final footage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s going to be good,\u201d David said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOne more thing, Marty. Will you do one of your sea shanties for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA privilege, boys, a privilege!\u201d Marty said. He went for his old guitar in the corner. \u201cShould have a squeeze box, really, but this will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive us a chance to move the lights and the camera around a bit,\u201d Sean said. Marty nodded happily and practiced strumming his string and tuning the instrument.</p> <p>\u201cReady,\u201d Sean said. \u201cAnd we can film several takes, so you\u2019re under no pressure.\u201d</p><p>Marty grinned, strummed and sang.</p><p>\u201cOh, the sea, she is my lady,</p><p>E\u2019er my lady true,</p><p>For the lady t\u2019was my lady</p> <p>Back upon the shore\u201d</p><p>Mary strummed the last chord, set the guitar down and grinned.</p><p>\u201cCut,\u201d Sean said. \u201cPerfect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d David agreed.</p><p>\u201cShould we do another, for safety\u2019s sake?\u201d Marty asked anxiously.</p><p>David glanced and Sean and shrugged with a grin.</p> <p>\u201cSure, we\u2019ve got the time, the people, and you\u2014you\u2019re an amazing intro, Marty,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Marty was pleased. He blushed. He picked up his guitar again, explained that it was an old sea shanty his father had taught him, one that had come down from old pirating days.</p><p>The next take was even better. Marty was just warming up.</p><p>They spent a while longer there, letting Marty go over a few facts and figures from history and the area, and then they wrapped it up.</p><p>While they packed the equipment, Jay asked, \u201cCan I get started immediately on the footage, show you just what you\u2019ll be getting?\u201d</p><p>Sean hesitated, wondering what his problem was with Jay. Of course, he knew. Allen was close with Vanessa Loren. He was being unreasonable.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back now\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo to my place. I\u2019ve got the equipment set up that you need,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Jay nodded with pleasure. \u201cYou won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that comes out well enough, you\u2019ll be wanting to take some shots at the setup for Pirates in Paradise, down by Fort Zachary Taylor,\u201d Marty said. \u201cCostumes, knives, swords, reproductions of all kinds. Pirate food and grog. Hey, everybody wants to be a pirate. Everybody wants to be Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean, huh?\u201d</p><p>They all agreed that Johnny Depp had done wonders for piracy, and then left the house at last. David went on to find Katie, and Sean took Jay Allen to his house, to the back, where he had his computer set up with all the software Jay might need.</p><p>And where he found Bartholomew, reading the screen\u2014and pushing the keys.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Jay murmured.</p><p>Sean reached over and pushed the escape key and then keyed in for his film system.</p><p>\u201cYou might have just said \u2018move,\u2019\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cOr, more politely, \u2018Bartholomew, old fellow, I need the computer now. Would you mind?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good to go,\u201d he told Jay.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll see\u2014and you\u2019ll want me more than you ever expected,\u201d Jay promised, sitting down to get started.</p><p>\u201cGo for it,\u201d Sean told him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to watch over my shoulder, are you?\u201d Jay asked.</p><p>Leave this guy alone in his house?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019ll be here, looking over his shoulder!\u201d Bartholomew assured him.</p><p>Sean lowered his head to hide a smile. It was perfect. He could leave and yet know every single thing that went on in his house while Jay was there.</p><p>\u201cActually, no. I need to see a few friends,\u201d Sean assured him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll lock up,\u201d Jay told him. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done. I\u2019ll leave it in a \u2018Marty\u2019 file for you to find when you get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Sean agreed. \u201cAll right, then. I\u2019ll call you if I don\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><p>He walked to the door. Bartholomew had taken another chair, at the table, his feet plunked upon it. He was watching Jay Allen with narrowed eyes.</p><p>When he headed for the door, Jay called him back. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know how much I appreciate this opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded, and left.</p><p>With the door closed, he smiled. Bartholomew could be a true pest, an annoyance, taunting him when a response would make Sean appear to be totally insane.</p><p>But the old pirate/privateer was actually a damned good guy.</p><p>Oddly enough, a damned good friend.</p><p>Vanessa didn\u2019t want to stay in her room at the inn, and she had been sincerely un-invited to be involved in the day\u2019s shoot with Marty. She had decided to go explore down by the grounds at Fort Zachary Taylor, wearing a bathing suit beneath a cover-up dress, and force herself to stay calm and away from anyone with the name Beckett or O\u2019Hara.</p><p>The main events of Pirates in Paradise weren\u2019t taking place yet, but Vanessa learned from the first \u201cpirate\u201d she encountered that the booths would be starting to open the next day with eager, friendly vendors\u2014all in pirate attire, of course\u2014and that the first parties would take place that night. She was invited to come\u2014he\u2019d get her in free. She thanked him, said that she wasn\u2019t sure and explored a lot of the merchandise.</p><p>At one booth, she found a beautiful display of reproduction jewelry. As she looked through the pieces she was impressed. The booth carried pen-and-ink drawings of various ships, lists of their manifests, the pirate \u201ccode of honor\u201d and many more bills of lading and other pieces of the past, all historic copies.</p><p>She started when she looked up after studying one case to see that the picture above it was of Dona Isabella. Or at least it was a likeness similar to that which Marty had given her.</p><p>The girl attending the booth, a pretty young thing who looked to be no more than a teenager, came before her smiling. She was in a corset, skirt and big billowing blouse, with a tricorn hat perched atop her head.</p><p>\u201cShe startles everyone,\u201d the girl said. \u201cDona Isabella, I mean. What a gorgeous creature\u2014to die so sadly. Do you know the story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, actually, I do,\u201d Vanessa told her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s supposed to haunt a lot of places, you know. Pirate Cut for one\u2014a few divers swear that they\u2019ve seen her! And, let\u2019s see\u2014she haunts the south end of Duval Street, where she supposedly lived. And Haunt Island, of course. I mean, what would Haunt Island be without a few haunts?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa smiled. She didn\u2019t want to talk about Haunt Island.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she asked, pointing to the piece in the display case that had drawn her attention. It was a jeweled pendant, a mermaid studded with various precious stones.</p><p>\u201cOh, this is a reproduction of one of Dona Isabella\u2019s necklaces. Beautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She giggled. \u201cThere was description of it in the ship\u2019s manifest. There were always three manifests, you know. One for the ship\u2019s owner, one on the ship and one left with the dockmaster\u2019s office from the original embarkation point of a ship\u2019s journey. This pendant was in the manifest\u2014well, not this pendant, it\u2019s a reproduction, of course\u2014and, as you can see, Dona Isabella is wearing it in this picture, which is another copy, of an oil painting that hangs in a museum in Spain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous. Truly, absolutely gorgeous,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cAnd more reasonable than you would think. Okay, truthfully? It\u2019s done in ten carat\u2014if I\u2019d had my say, it would be fourteen carat at the very least. Eighteen for such a piece would be closer to the original. And the jewels\u2014that really looks like a ruby, but it\u2019s a garnet. And that\u2019s not a sapphire, it\u2019s blue topaz, and the yellow stones are citrine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>The girl smiled and told her. The piece was more than affordable. Vanessa bought it.</p><p>She looked at an exhibition that was going to be on food, and she glanced through the costume racks, remembering when the world had been bright, when she had done so with high excitement, thinking that she and Jay were about to produce their first full movie. That was then, this was now. She walked around and saw some excellent outfits\u2014should Sean and David want them for anything\u2014then moved on to the beach.</p><p>It was a decent day, even though they were into fall. The air temperature was still rising to eighty-five, and the water at the shore was only about ten degrees cooler. She\u2019d grown up in the chilly freshwater springs of north Florida, so it was a lovely temperature to her.</p><p>She lay on the sand, slipped on her sunglasses and watched the waves.</p><p>She tried not to think about the fact that she was ready to kill Jay. She could remember the look in Sean O\u2019Hara\u2019s eyes when he had met Jay, when Jay had said that he was applying for work. She looked like the agent sent in to scope it out.</p><p>What was, was.</p><p>Except that she needed the truth more than Jay.</p><p>She needed to silence the nightmares.</p><p>To keep from thinking too much, she headed into the water. She swam awhile, working her muscles, then ambled back toward the shore, watching a father play with his children\u2014a boy of about ten and a little girl, around five\u2014and as she walked, not paying attention, she crashed into someone. A hard body. She stepped back awkwardly and quickly apologized. Hands shot out to steady her.</p><p>It was Sean.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself. You\u2019re hard to find,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWell, I would have been easier, if I\u2019d known you were looking for me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014my phone is with my towel and bag, on the shore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014you were looking for me. How\u2019d the filming go?\u201d She realized she was shivering. It was getting later than she realized; the sun was beginning to sink, and while the temperature was still far from cold, being wet made her shiver.</p><p>He arched a brow to her. \u201cNot that badly, trust me, no need to shake.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m suddenly freezing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get out and get you a towel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good plan,\u201d she said.</p><p>She hurried ahead of him and found her towel. He had worn cutoff chinos into the water, and just the edges were wet. He reached for the polo shirt he had thrown on the sand near her things and skinned it over his head. She towel dried quickly and slid on her dress, and still she was shaking.</p> <p>\u201cAh, you know what you need?\u201d he asked, taking her discarded towel and wrapping it around her shoulders and rubbing them.</p><p>\u201cDry clothing?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cA hot toddy\u2014and Irish whiskey. I know where they make the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that be a place south on Duval known as O\u2019Hara\u2019s? I hear that it\u2019s a real hangout for actual locals\u2014conch-type people\u2014and that the tourists crash in sometimes, wanting to hang with the locals,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the place,\u201d he agreed.</p> <p>He was pleasant and easy, charming, in fact. She wondered how she would have felt about him if they\u2019d met on different footing. If she\u2019d just come in with Katie somewhere and it had been, oh, Vanessa, you\u2019ve met my brother, Sean, right? No, after all these years, imagine. Well, anyway, then, Sean, this is Vanessa, Vanessa, Sean.</p><p>She had chosen their meeting. Katie had offered to introduce him. She hadn\u2019t wanted friendship to be a part of it. Maybe she had made a mistake. What did it matter? She was getting what she had set out for\u2014another chance to discover what had happened. At the very least, a chance to feel that she had done everything in her power.</p><p>\u201cSo, seriously, how did it go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBrilliantly. Better. I don\u2019t know if I would have thought of having an intro with Marty if I hadn\u2019t wanted to see what Jay could do. And Marty was wonderful. He\u2019s a natural before the camera, and he absolutely loves his history, so it was all great. Jay is editing now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe brought all his equipment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s at my house.\u201d</p> <p>She was silently impressed\u2014with Jay. She was surprised that Sean would trust a stranger with his work system, and she said so.</p><p>\u201cYou left him\u2014at your house\u2014alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a trusting soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>She started to sink in the sand while taking a step. He took her hand. The feel was a jolt. A nice one. She liked the scent of him, too. Ocean and...him. Clean and fresh.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to feel so attracted.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t want to break free from his hand.</p><p>She walked casually, thanking him.</p><p>\u201cI looked around at costumes today. This is really one of the best places to purchase. A lot of the retailers have researched the period thoroughly. They have great poet\u2019s shirts, vests, jackets, hats, corsets, blouses, skirts\u2014you name it. Oh! I bought a piece today. A replica of one worn by Dona Isabella,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded and continued walking.</p><p>The vendors had covered up their wares; some were still around, chatting, eating sandwiches and keeping a firm eye on their goods, while others were off, trusting in hired security.</p><p>\u201cI drove down here. Let\u2019s get to my car,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>They hurried along, Sean still holding her hand. He unlocked the car and opened the passenger-side door for her.</p><p>It was a car she might have expected for him, and she liked it. A Jeep. New enough, but not brand-new, a car that could go just about anywhere. It fit Sean very well, down-to-earth, utilitarian, and somehow, though anyone could buy the car, it seemed rugged and sensual and masculine.</p><p>She really had to stop her mind from wandering in that direction.</p><p>It was difficult. A St. Nicholas medallion hung from the rearview mirror, and she wasn\u2019t surprised to see that he honored the patron saint of the sea. An O\u2019Hara\u2019s sticker was on the front windshield, low, on the passenger side. The rear of the Jeep was filled with a stack of neatly piled clothing, as if he had just been to the laundry, though she wasn\u2019t sure why he would go out since she was certain that the house\u2014which had actually been bought by Katie\u2014had a washer and dryer.</p><p>He saw her looking at the stack of clothing. He winced. \u201cI suck at it so I take it to the Laundromat to get it done for me. I\u2019ve had too many white and beige things wind up an ultrafeminine shade of pink.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa laughed. Good God, she found even that endearing.</p><p>\u201cLet me see your piece,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She dug in her tote and took out the box that carried the mermaid pendant.</p><p>He took it and stared at it, and then at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded. Something about the way he looked at her made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cI just saw this same piece,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh? Did you go by the vendors?\u201d she asked. Her voice seemed faint. And hopeful.</p><p>He shook his head slowly. She thought she knew his answer before he spoke, and she was oddly afraid without knowing why.</p><p>\u201cThis is the piece you found at the shipwreck site the other day. Where the Santa Geneva went down. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s the exact piece,\u201d he said at last.</p><p>They were at O\u2019Hara\u2019s, where they had run into Katie and David. Sean had gotten Vanessa the promised Irish coffee. It was delicious. At O\u2019Hara\u2019s, there were equal parts Irish whiskey and Drambuie in with the coffee, along with a generous dollop of real whipped cream. The night was pleasantly cool with a southwesterly breeze, making the hot drink perfect.</p><p>She was still in her bathing suit, and the damp and the salt and the sand were irritating, and she was certain that her hair looked like windblown spiderwebs. If they were all about to take part in filming on boats and at sea, she supposed, they should all get accustomed to one another in wet and scraggly mode.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it\u2019s the original, eighteen or twenty-four karat, with rubies and sapphires, it\u2019s worth a mint,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cI imagine,\u201d Sean agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do with it?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cDo with it?\u201d Vanessa said blankly. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t actually see it as mine. I was on a trial run for the film when I happened upon it. I don\u2019t know\u2014it should be in a museum, I guess. It\u2019s confusing, though. It should really belong to Sean and David, I think. Isn\u2019t that the way it works when you\u2019re working for someone? Like Mel Fisher had all kinds of divers, but the finds were his\u2014right?\u201d</p><p>Sean laughed. \u201cAfter he fought the state for a decade,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he won. Nowadays, in territorial waters, it\u2019s twenty-five percent to the state. The rest is yours. Jaden was beside herself with excitement when she called me. She says that it\u2019s stunning. I haven\u2019t had a chance to get over and see it in person yet. All I have is the picture she sent to my phone. She and Ted had a party tonight, so she locked it up tight. We\u2019ll go and see it in person in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Vanessa said. She wasn\u2019t sure it was wonderful at all. She wished that she hadn\u2019t found it. She could only imagine the terror of the woman who had worn it. By legend, Dona Isabella hadn\u2019t died on the ship\u2014she had been murdered with the others on Haunt Island, probably by Kitty Cutlass. In the movie script, she\u2019d written in a spectacular scene of the beauty floating in the water. It was unlikely that had been the case\u2014Dona Isabella\u2019s bones were somewhere beneath the sands of Haunt Island.</p><p>Kitty Cutlass had most probably perished in the storm.</p><p>\u201cYes, that sounds fine,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Katie said. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound excited. Vanessa, that\u2019s a real historical find. It\u2019s amazing. I\u2019ve been on those reefs all my life. I found an old boot and a high school ring from Miami High, class of \u201975. Hey, this is...treasure!\u201d</p><p>Vanessa smiled and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get to work,\u201d Katie said. She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go to Sean\u2019s and see what Jay has done with the footage we took this morning,\u201d David said. \u201cKatie...do you mind? I\u2019ll be back before you close.\u201d</p><p>Katie laughed and touched David\u2019s face tenderly. \u201cI worked here long before you came back, my love. But, hey, I do appreciate walking home together, so thanks.\u201d</p><p>She went off to introduce her show; a blonde girl was waiting impatiently to sing.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s head down to my house,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m off to shower and change,\u201d Vanessa said, slipping from her stool. She paused. \u201cThank you, Sean, the Irish coffee was delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you enjoyed it,\u201d Sean said, standing, as well. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to see the footage? I put some together from the dive, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but...\u201d She grimaced, indicating what she was wearing. \u201cI really need to shower and change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy enough. We\u2019ll walk by your place, and I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s all right. It will take me a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d David assured her.</p><p>\u201cSure\u2014we haven\u2019t looked in the T-shirt shop windows for a while,\u201d Sean said, but he was smiling. \u201cActually, Irish Kevin\u2019s has a great band. We can hang out and listen, and when you\u2019re ready, head to my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting something,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine here. I\u2019ll get it in the morning. There won\u2019t be anyplace to park on lower Duval. I\u2019ve left it before\u2014it will be fine.\u201d</p><p>Duval was crazy at night, with many people dressed up. Open containers were legal in Key West, and many a pirate and his dame walked about with their grog in a leather-bound drinking vessel of some kind or another. Some looked great and truly played the part.</p><p>\u201cHey, we wouldn\u2019t be hard put to find extras, if we were filming a smashing pirate scene,\u201d Sean said dryly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s happened every year for about a decade,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cNo surprise there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOne of the parties is happening,\u201d David said. \u201cI think it\u2019s down on Mallory Square, but I\u2019m not sure. It won\u2019t be in full swing for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd hopefully, we\u2019ll be out of here by then,\u201d Sean said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cHey, I think it\u2019s great. They do reenactments and all kinds of cool historical stuff. Kids can come to it, and face it, Key West isn\u2019t always kid-friendly,\u201d Vanessa said.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me\u2014I was a kid here, and I came out just fine,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cI grew up here, too. So we stayed off Duval growing up,\u201d David said. \u201cWe had the water. Boats, the sea, diving. What more could you ask?\u201d</p><p>They reached Vanessa\u2019s place. When Vanessa ran up to shower and change, Sean and David walked across the street to Irish Kevin\u2019s. She would find them there when she was ready.</p><p>She showered and shampooed, and though she was in a hurry, she discovered that she was determined to be thorough. She shaved her legs, dried her hair with the blow-dryer and despite herself, opted for makeup. She chose a knit dress that was both casual and slinky, and though appalled at her choice, she went for heeled sandals.</p><p>Dressing up as if out on the hunt, she mocked herself.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t her\u2014it wasn\u2019t the way she lived.</p><p>And yet, that night, it was.</p><p>Impatient at last, she gave her hair a last brush and hurried out. As she crossed the street, whistles followed her from the tiny bar next door. She blushed and was glad.</p><p>The two men were hanging at the entrance to Irish Kevin\u2019s\u2014the music could be heard clearly from there. The band was good, playing something from Three Dog Night that she hadn\u2019t heard in years and years but sounded absolutely great.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Sean said, seeing her.</p><p>David whistled. \u201cWhat a transformation.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Sean cleared his throat. \u201cYes, you look great. But transformation? David, are you implying that she doesn\u2019t look great wet, in sand, with ratty hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least. And I\u2019d have never said ratty hair,\u201d David protested.</p><p>\u201cHmm. You\u2019re right. I do apologize!\u201d Sean said.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cThank you both, I\u2019m pretty sure. Should we go and see if Jay is still at your house?\u201d</p><p>They agreed. She walked between the two of them as they traveled the short distance from Duval to the O\u2019Hara house.</p><p>Vanessa remembered it well. She had stayed here with Katie many a time.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t changed much, though Katie had added a few little touches that made it her own. There were new seascapes on the walls, light, new upholstery on the furniture that still seemed to fit the Victorian period of the house, and there was a new entertainment center with a flat-screen TV in the parlor. Walking into the house was comfortable. She\u2019d spent good times there.</p> <p>\u201cYou know my house?\u201d Sean asked her.</p><p>\u201cI spent a lot of nights here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPity. And I never knew,\u201d Sean murmured.</p><p>\u201cHey! You\u2019re back!\u201d Jay called from the rear of the house, once an open porch, then a screened porch, now a glassed-in family room.</p><p>They headed toward the sound of Jay\u2019s voice.</p><p>The rear of the house had changed. It was all Sean O\u2019Hara\u2019s now, with several screens set up, a large computer, camera equipment here and there, microphones, booms and more. Jay was in a twirling office chair at the computer.</p><p>\u201cNessa, old gal, you\u2019ve made it with the boys! I\u2019m so glad. This is great stuff, great!\u201d Jay said enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s shy, never toots his own horn,\u201d Vanessa said dryly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see it,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Jay hit a key that sent the film to the largest of the screens in the room. They moved around to perch on chairs to watch. As she took a seat on the divan by the back of the house, Vanessa felt a chill sweep through her and something almost like a gentle touch on her arm. She looked around, certain one of the men was near her. But Sean was perched on a stool and David had taken the wicker wingback chair to her far right. Neither was anywhere near her.</p><p>And Jay was at the computer chair still, arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>Vanessa had to admit that the footage was fantastic. Marty was an amazing subject and storyteller, and Jay had the editing just right. It ran approximately three minutes, with an extra twenty seconds of the old pirate historian playing his sea shanty. In all, it was fabulous footage.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Jay demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cYes, very good,\u201d David agreed.</p><p>\u201cAm I hired? Please?\u201d Jay begged.</p><p>Sean was still staring at the screen, though it was dark. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re hired.\u201d</p><p>Jay let out a yelp of joy. He sprang from the chair and came to Vanessa, pulling her from her seat, swirling her around the room. \u201cThank God, thank God!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t share his elation. She felt her cheeks redden, and she nodded.</p><p>Sean rose, ignoring the two of them. \u201cThis is what we got the other day,\u201d he told David. He hit a few keys. Sean narrated what had been shot, and she knew that, beyond a doubt, she would watch the documentary even if she had nothing to do with it. His voice was a captivating tenor with the right inflection at every moment. There was footage she hadn\u2019t even realized he had taken as she set her mask and slipped off the side of the boat. Her shots of the reef with the brilliant fish flashed by as he explained the wrecks and the delicacy of the reefs, along with the dangers they had, and still did, create. There was footage of her with the grouper as he talked about the wonder of the reef today\u2014and then went into the sinking of the Santa Geneva as she was beset by pirates. He talked about the legend, about the film crew, and how they had chosen, in presenting unsolved mysteries, to focus on the legend of the Santa Geneva, Mad Miller, Kitty Cutlass and the sad plight of Dona Isabella. That legend had given rise to many others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You did that just shooting with the two of you?\u201d Jay said. \u201cHey, what am I talking about? I was doing a motion picture with a small crew that did extra duty as stunt doubles!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a walking wonder, Jay,\u201d Vanessa said, teasing him, and yet, she realized, her tone was dry. She was still angry with him. He shouldn\u2019t have just shown up. He should have called her.</p><p>But then again, she had barged in. No, she had set up an appointment. Jay had used her.</p><p>\u201cI am a walking wonder, Nessa,\u201d Jay said, grinning. But then he sighed. \u201cI just wish I knew what had happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Sean said. \u201cTomorrow, we\u2019ll get together and go through everything you did from the time you came to Key West to start filming. Since this was planned as a documentary, there\u2019s an outline and a list of shoots, but no actual script. Things will change now, some, but I don\u2019t want to make the changes until you\u2019ve given me your story from start to finish.\u201d</p><p>Jay nodded gravely. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might make another dive where the Santa Geneva went down, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the boss. Bosses,\u201d Jay said, looking from Sean to David.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>Sean smiled. \u201cDinner. No one has had any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man, great idea. I\u2019m starving,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>David rose and said, \u201cHow about Turtle Kraals? Tourists are out, but it\u2019s a guaranteed relaxed atmosphere and it\u2019s on the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Sean agreed.</p><p>They walked the back streets down to Turtle Kraals and the docks. The air was pleasantly cool and the walking was beautiful. She was next to Sean, who was somewhat quiet, while Jay walked next to David, talking enough for everyone.</p><p>\u201cBeginning to end,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what I remember, clearer than anything? Just how annoyed I was with Georgia. If I\u2019d only known...if we\u2019d only looked for Travis. But we weren\u2019t expecting anything. I\u2019d been on Haunt Island dozens of times. Boaters come and go. And of course we did everything by the book, notifying the Bahamian authorities, even hiring Bahamian tour guides just to keep everything legit. And that on our budget. I still can\u2019t figure it, I just can\u2019t figure it. I didn\u2019t see any other boats during the day. I know that most of the authorities believe that Carlos Roca killed Travis earlier in the day, and killed Georgia when he pretended he was going to take her home. Why? I can\u2019t begin to fathom. And why stage the bodies in the way that he did? None of it makes any sense. You\u2019d think there had been a ghost,\u201d he said with disgust.</p><p>Then, oddly, he jumped and spun around.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Jay demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in front of you,\u201d Vanessa reminded him.</p><p>\u201cMust have been the wind,\u201d Sean said, still walking and not looking back.</p><p>\u201cThat was one hell of a wind,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>\u201cOh, we get those now and again down here,\u201d David said.</p><p>They walked on and arrived at the restaurant. Sean knew the right people. He smiled and chatted with the hostess, and they wound up with a perfect table, one that overlooked the water of the historic seaport. It was a pleasant place, named for something not so pleasant, really. It was where turtles had once been stored until it was time for them to be sent to whatever restaurant or manufacturer or distributor of turtle soup and turtle steak was ready for them. Nowadays, turtles were protected, and the wildest events here that included the reptiles were the turtle races held on certain days of the week.</p><p>They ordered, and Vanessa excused herself, saying she wanted to look at the moon over the water. She walked out and realized someone was behind her. She turned to see that Sean had followed her. \u201cBeautiful night,\u201d he said. \u201cPerfect weather. Calm seas and a full moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, perfect,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>There was a silence between them for a moment. It wasn\u2019t awkward, and yet Vanessa knew he was about to say something. And he did.</p><p>\u201cYou know, there\u2019s something underneath everything here. On the surface, what happened was a horrible, gruesome tragedy, a heinous crime. The kind that couldn\u2019t be repeated. But now we\u2019re about to go the same route. Have you ever wondered if the person\u2014or persons\u2014responsible might find out what you\u2019re doing, be afraid that you know something and come after you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She inhaled deeply. \u201cI did my best to convince you to make your film following our route. But it might have been the wrong thing. If you\u2019re afraid in any way\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head impatiently, interrupting her. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. We\u2019ve been on a dangerous route before. I\u2019ll have myself, David, Liam and maybe a few other people I know well and trust with my life. I\u2019m worried about you. All right, I don\u2019t think you ought to be in that room on Duval Street. Yes, it\u2019s Duval, yes, there are cops around. If you don\u2019t want to stay at my house\u2014or Katie\u2019s house\u2014go and stay with Katie and David at David\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just...it would be awkward, either way,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>\u201cI can ask Jay to stay, as well,\u201d he said.</p><p>She spun around to look at him. \u201cHey, I can honestly be the perfect gentleman,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cMust you always be?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He arched a brow and smiled. She looked quickly away, wondering what she had been thinking to speak so rashly. She stared at the water. \u201cGood God, I\u2019ll be on a boat again with Jay. I love him, he\u2019s a good friend, but he drives me crazy when the contact is constant!\u201d</p><p>As she stared into the water, images seemed to form within it. As she looked, it rippled.</p> <p>Fish. Fish were always moving about.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t a school of fish moving. Something seemed to be rising, coming to the surface. She wanted to grab Sean\u2019s hand and find out if he saw it, too, but she seemed to be frozen in place. She knew what it was.</p><p>The image of the figurehead. The figurehead that bore the facial features of Dona Isabella.</p><p>She turned away from the water. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll stay at your house. I appreciate the offer. I\u2019ll move in tonight, after dinner, if that\u2019s all right with you.\u201d</p><p>He seemed startled by her sudden change of mind. He looked at the water.</p><p>And saw nothing.</p> <p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said softly. \u201cShall we go in? Food is probably about ready.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, looking up at him with her wide, beautiful eyes. They caught the opalescence of the water and sky and seemed especially hypnotic. He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m going to give Liam a call and see what your other friends are up to now,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour crew from your movie shoot.\u201d</p><p>Her brows shot up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hire us all on?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re following the trail that you and Jay and your crew followed for the movie. I thought we should use everyone who was involved in the film shoot.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s brilliant. But it\u2019s not as if we were all the best of friends. We worked well together but I had never met Bill Hinton or Jake Magnoli until the shoot. I\u2019ve known Barry and Zoe through different projects during the years, but... I\u2019m sure, though, that Jay would have information on how to reach them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Liam will find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGreat. We\u2019ll get on it.\u201d</p><p>She still stared at him, wondering why she felt quite so paralyzed that night.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked her. \u201cSeriously? Do you not want the others\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no! Of course I do,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>She gave herself a shake. Something didn\u2019t seem to be boding well for her, but she didn\u2019t understand her feelings of dread. She tried to shake them off.</p><p>\u201cFood!\u201d she said. \u201cI think I need food.\u201d</p><p>He slipped an arm around her shoulders and led her in.</p><p>And the feel of him was good.</p><p>7</p><p>The scream awakened Sean like a bolt out of the blue.</p><p>He had been sleeping soundly, glad to have Vanessa under his roof. He didn\u2019t know why he was suddenly worried about her sleeping in what should have been a fairly safe haven, but maybe it had been recent events here that had gotten him so worried. And maybe he was looking for something closer. Ass. Any fool in his right mind would want more. She reeked of beauty and sensuality.</p><p>Just having her in the house was some kind of a strange primitive pleasure.</p><p>But the scream ripped him from any thoughts except the possibility of danger, and he tore out of his own room and down the hall to where she slept in Katie\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cVanessa!\u201d He turned the light on, seeking whatever threat she faced.</p><p>But there was nothing there. She was up on her knees, staring into the sudden light, blinking furiously. She was more than decently clad in a massive cotton T-shirt, and he didn\u2019t hesitate to rush to her, slide onto the bed and take her shoulders, shaking her slightly, bringing her focus to him.</p><p>\u201cVanessa, what? What happened?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply for a minute. Then her eyes focused on his and a flood of color filled her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOh, God! I am so sorry. I never thought that I...that I screamed aloud,\u201d she said.</p><p>She was shaking. He pulled her toward him, leaning her against him where he sat on the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. What? A nightmare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt used to always be the same. Now it\u2019s changing. First, I just saw the heads in the sand. Then they began talking to me. Asking me how and why I let it happen. Travis wants to know why we didn\u2019t even look for him. Georgia wants to know why we didn\u2019t believe her when she screamed about monsters...and now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, on top of Travis and Georgia, I keep dreaming about Dona Isabella. It makes me think that I am losing it and I certainly had no right coming here and getting you and David involved. Except that, of course, I don\u2019t think these nightmares will ever stop if...if there can\u2019t be an answer somewhere out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d He found himself smoothing back her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I understand. And David and I aren\u2019t coming into this blindly. We know what happened. We consider ourselves worthy of the task, honestly. We\u2019re good at what we do, and we know how to defend ourselves. Liam is a cop, and he\u2019s coming. We\u2019ll stack the decks with the right people, Vanessa.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cHow? You were saying that you weren\u2019t getting exactly what you wanted, so many of your friends were already involved in projects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will happen. I\u2019m going to try to recruit old Marty, and maybe even Jamie. It will be fine. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll do some more shooting on the reef with the four of us working and see how it falls out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLew will come to the beach again. He was there, and he saw,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLew...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur Bahamian guide,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cDavid has already sent ahead to the Bahamian government, getting film permits and letting them know our location plans. We\u2019ll soon need a list of the crew, though I believe he\u2019s submitted certain names already.... Listen, about your screaming...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever be afraid if you scream in the night here. We\u2019ve had our share of fear and dread, and there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of when it regards fear,\u201d he said.</p><p>He wanted to melt into her being suddenly. Those eyes. Huge and blue and staring so trustingly into his.</p><p>Great. When holding her made every sexual instinct in him scream away in silent agony.</p><p>Yes, come to my house, it will be perfectly safe! he mocked himself.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stay here? Until you fall asleep?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cOh, I really couldn\u2019t ask you to do that,\u201d she said, offering a small laugh. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry. It is embarrassing. I am competent! And you\u2019ll never believe that if I keep screaming in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApples and oranges,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>She smiled again. \u201cStay,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYour wish, my command,\u201d he told her. \u201cWell, for tonight, anyway.\u201d</p><p>That brought a true smile to her lips. She crawled up to one side of the bed. \u201cReally awkward, huh? I was about to plump the pillow, asking you to come up. But that would be rather...oh, God, the whole situation is very...\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cPremature. That\u2019s all. Quite frankly, every time I see you, I\u2019m more under some kind of a spell. I\u2019m fascinated with your knowledge and talents. And there\u2019s the simple fact that you love the water as much as I do. Then again, it could be how beautiful you are. God knows, you\u2019re probably vibrant and vital when you sleep. Stop me if there\u2019s someone in your life and I\u2019m going on ridiculously,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one in my life. Dating is really out of the question when you\u2019re the wrong kind of screamer,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>He laughed and moved up to the pillow. He drew her head down on his chest. \u201cSleep, my dear, in comfort, I hope. You\u2019re safe from the evils of the world\u2014and me\u2014for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you might be too good to be true,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing is that good, and certainly not me,\u201d he assured her gruffly.</p><p>He smoothed her hair. It felt like silk.</p><p>He felt her breathing against him. Felt her warmth, her form, close to his.</p><p>A sense of longing filled him. Not just the burning need for sex she could create.</p><p>Longing. For something more.</p><p>Tonight, he would be content.</p><p>Thank God, she didn\u2019t scream again. Waking, Vanessa opened her eyes and realized that she was sprawled atop Sean. For a moment, she didn\u2019t dare move, and then she did so. He was awake, watching her. She flushed and winced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Did you sleep all right?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cBeautifully,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cThank you for staying with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it could have been greater pleasure,\u201d he teased. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She grew serious. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask last night, what about you?\u201d she asked him. \u201cIs there any involvement in your life?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t been home that long. Before, I moved too much. The Black Sea, the Great Barrier Reef. Loch Ness. The Great Lakes. The Bahamas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really been everywhere,\u201d she noted.</p> <p>\u201cEverywhere\u2014and nowhere,\u201d he murmured. He rolled over and rose. \u201cI\u2019ll put coffee on. Are you a breakfast person? I\u2019m a decent cook\u2014that\u2019s what happens when you live on boats half the time. You get desperate and learn how to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no laundry, eh?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cHey, I packed enough for what I needed. Laundry was done onshore. Eating is a necessity on a daily basis. So, you a breakfast person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, only I help cook,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cActually, there\u2019s already coffee on. Programmed it last night. I\u2019m going to jump in the shower. Help yourself whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He left the room. Vanessa walked into her own bathroom and met her reflection in the mirror. She was still flushed. She washed her face, brushed her teeth and thought about the shower.</p><p>Then she thought about the night.</p><p>She thought about his words, and about the way he had behaved.</p><p>She winced, hesitated, caught her breath.</p><p>He was everything she wanted, as well. Yes, he was gorgeous, tall, bronzed, well muscled, with his striking, rugged and intriguing face. Classical features. Golden eyes. But it wasn\u2019t just the tempting pull of his equally sculpted build.</p> <p>It was the sea. The things he loved. The way he behaved. Even his bark when he was angry. Even the way he looked at her when he was wary, skeptical. It was in his movement, in his words.</p><p>She didn\u2019t step into her own shower. She walked down the hall, knowing which room was his from days gone by. She listened and heard the sound of the water flowing in his shower.</p><p>\u201cSean?\u201d She tentatively pushed open the door to his room and walked through it. The bathroom door was ajar and the water was flowing.</p><p>She stepped closer. \u201cSean?\u201d</p><p>The shower curtain jerked open and he looked out, alert and anxious.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, nothing!\u201d she declared quickly. So much for being a femme fatale with a casual and sensual style.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014oh, God, I\u2019m not at all good at this. I thought that maybe...we could shower together. I mean the way that you were speaking last night, it didn\u2019t seem quite out of the question,\u201d she said.</p> <p>His shoulders eased. A broad smile slowly creased his features and he looked down for a moment, and then back to her.</p><p>\u201cThe shower will work better if you come in naked,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She laughed, breathless and more than a little nervous. She slipped from her panties, drew the huge T-shirt over her head and walked over to join him. Unabashedly, he looked her up and down.</p><p>\u201cWell, since bathing suits leave little to the imagination, I can\u2019t say that I haven\u2019t noticed the infinitely fine attributes you possess. But reality is far superior to anything I imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere on earth did you get your language skills?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He pulled her under the spray beneath him. The water was warm and delightful. His body was pure fire and magnificent against hers.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like my language skills?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, they\u2019re fine! Lovely, really,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should stop speaking,\u201d he said. He did so, pressing his lips down upon hers. The touch was electric, and his kiss was perfect, gentle, tasting at first, his mouth molding to hers. And then, as their bodies crushed closer together, it deepened to something forceful and coercive, volcanic in the rush it created within her. Or maybe it was the molten-steel feel of his body, the rise of his erection against her lower abdomen. All she knew was that what she had started so tentatively was now urgent. While the warm water coursed around them, she felt a buildup of arousal within her that seemed insane and yet so wonderful she wanted to experience it forever.</p><p>Their hands moved upon one another. They found the soap, used it, lost it, crashed into one another finding it again. Suds covered them, making their flesh slick and sleek, and then the water rinsed off the suds, and they were together again, just holding each other for a moment beneath the spray. She laid her head against his neck and felt the throb of his pulse. She felt his hand slide down her hip, between her thighs. He lifted her, with the water still sending out spray and steam; he held her high, then brought her down, guiding her down on him. She wound her arms around his neck and her legs around his waist, and he balanced against the fiberglass of the shower as he eased completely into her, his eyes on hers. Then he began to move.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if it was him, if it was the simple fact that they were there, just as they began, with the pounding sound, water and steam, but nothing had ever seemed more erotic to her, and the way that he moved was an arousal unlike any other. She clung to him, arched and writhed to his lift and fall, and gave herself over to the pure carnal rawness of the experience. Far too soon she realized that she was burning and frantic and climaxing. She felt a final great thrust from him, shuddered, and eased slowly down on him, but he held her against the fiberglass until the sound of the water was just that again and the spray and the mist kept them warm, even as they cooled.</p><p>His lips found hers again, wet, hard, wonderful. He kissed her deeply, her wet hair entangled in his fingers.</p><p>He groped for the faucet at last, stopping the spray. Still nearly on top of her, his lips just inches away, he said, \u201cTry and get me out of bed at night, hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that you\u2019re quite lovely in bed, actually,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll think I\u2019m even lovelier now.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cTowels,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get towels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, that would be lovely, too.\u201d</p><p>He stepped from the shower and produced two towels, large towels, with sailing motifs. She wrapped hers around herself and stepped out into the bedroom. His private quarters were neat. He had books stacked on his bureau, most of them sea charts, or books on great sailing ships, some on diving, and one or two fiction. His furniture was solid mahogany without Victorian carving, more in an old west Mission style. It was a personal place, too, though. Not just bare. There were pictures of dive trips and sailing and foreign shores. On the dresser, too, sat a family photo: Katie and Sean, their mother and father. It was a wonderful room. Probably because she had just decided sex with Sean was wonderful, everything in the world about him was wonderful, as well.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the room?\u201d he asked. \u201cAm I passing muster?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThe room, let me see. Solid, manly furniture. Good photos. Good reading material. Sparse and neat\u2014belongs to a man, most obviously, accustomed to tight spaces on a boat. It\u2019s really unbelievable that he still messes up his laundry, but hey, in the list of could-be faults, that is quite a small one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the bed?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely macho. Studly, even. A lovely bed. Something I\u2019d actually love to try out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wait for tonight?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Why wait?</p><p>Words coming from his lips were as arousing as the most provocative touch....</p><p>And it would be rather senseless at this point to argue the feeling...</p><p>She turned into his arms. Towels were lost. What was lost from the steam and spray of the shower was found in slow discovery, touch after touch, complete intimacy. There was the wonder of finding every little scar and wound upon his body, learning where it had come from\u2014a dive into shallow water when he had been a kid; a cut from a catfish, oh, so dumb and he knew it; the only fight he\u2019d gotten into in junior high, and, of course, she should have seen the other guy. There was so much laughter, so much sensuality as she kissed each little wound, as he returned the questionnaire, as they lay entwined until the touches and kisses became breathless and ever more predetermined and purposely provocative, hot and wet and aimed at erogenous zones. They melded together again, holding still for that perfect moment as he thrust deeply into her, then letting basic instinct come into play, the renewed desperation for fulfillment. The sheets became entangled and damp, and still they lay locked together, ever moving, writhing, arching, until the sweet moment of climax burst upon them, and they fell into one another\u2019s arms, damp, depleted, sated and smiling breathlessly. Vanessa listened to the thunder of his heart as it slowed and felt her own, and they seemed to meld, as well.</p><p>She rolled away from him and jumped to her feet, heading for the door.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cWe have to start the day,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cSo we do\u2014but we could lie here a moment quietly, couldn\u2019t we?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She caught the door frame and looked back at him. \u201cMaybe you could,\u201d she said softly, and ran out, heading for the shower in Katie\u2019s room.</p><p>When the water came down on her this time, it came with the memory of joining him, and she burned beneath the water, both amazed and glad for what she had done, and yet horrified. She wasn\u2019t sure what had possessed her, but she was certain she had never done anything that had felt more perfect and right as it had progressed. It was new, it was magnificent, and all that she wanted to do was be with him, hear his voice and the laughter, and discover again and again how easy it was to lie with him, what an absolute wonder it was to get to know him.</p><p>It was crazy. She had just seduced the man who was more or less her employer, a good friend\u2019s brother and someone with whom she was about to embark on a strange mission. Not good.</p><p>Oh, yes, good, very good, but...</p><p>He was showered again and dressed for the boat when she came down. Coffee had brewed and there was a cup waiting for her by where he sat at the counter, perusing the newspaper. He signaled to it as he saw her. \u201cI just talked to David. He\u2019s gotten hold of Jay, and we\u2019re going to do some more footage at Pirate Cut. Are you a vegetarian?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat? Um, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Bacon is in the microwave and I\u2019m about to put the eggs on. We have about half an hour, then we meet them down at the docks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sounds good,\u201d Vanessa said.</p> <p>He stood and walked around to the oven, tested his fry pan and poured the egg mixture into it, then added chopped onions, peppers, mushrooms and tomato.</p><p>\u201cSo, you are a cook,\u201d she said.</p><p>He turned to her. \u201cAnd you might pop that bread in the toaster, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, aye, captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, such a reply is necessary only on a boat!\u201d he teased.</p> <p>Vanessa popped the toast into the toaster. As she did so, she had the strange sensation that something cold passed behind her.</p><p>And Sean was looking in that direction, frowning.</p><p>\u201cIs there a draft in the house?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cA ghost\u2014so I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa smiled. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very old place, you know. But I think there was a structure here before, long, long ago, when the pirates were at their heyday. Real butter? Or the fake spray stuff?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich do you prefer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal butter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the refrigerator. I heard it\u2019s not really that bad for you unless you consume the whole stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll things in moderation, so they say.\u201d</p><p>He added cheese to the omelets while she got the butter and spread it on the toast. There was orange juice in the refrigerator, and she poured a glass for each of them. He directed her to the microwave as he flipped the omelet, slid it onto a plate and separated it to slide half onto a second plate. They set it all on the counter and took their seats again.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a copy of your original script with you?\u201d he asked her. \u201cThe script you wrote for the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s still in my computer,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>\u201cCan you give me a rundown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe started from Key West, with three couples meeting up to take a trip out to Haunt Island. The usual college-age crew\u2014Jay was hoping to reel in the seventeen-to twenty-one-year-old crowd. There was the good girl, the one you liked, the nerd...you know, the usual slasher cast. We had permits, of course, and filmed them getting together at the dock. They went diving at Pirate Cut, and they made fun of the story of Dona Isabella, and drew up silly pictures of Mad Miller and Kitty Cutlass. Then they did this ridiculous thing, like a game of Bloody Mary, but they called up Mad Miller. The first death occurs when one of the kids sees a woman floating in the water and goes to help her, but when he turns her over, her face is skeletal and eaten away. When he shrieks and tries to get away, the sea ghost of Mad Miller drags him down, cutting him up in the water. We\u2019re talking true teen-slasher flick,\u201d she said, grimacing apologetically.</p><p>\u201cI understand someone trying to break in\u2014and make a living,\u201d Sean said. \u201cMany a director has cut his teeth on a slasher flick, and some have made very respectable livings on that alone.\u201d He seemed thoughtful as he munched on his toast. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the rest on board are terrified, of course, and they try to perform a ritual that will let the poor murdered Dona Isabella rest\u2014and send Mad Miller and Kitty Cutlass to hell. One by one they end up dead as the boat limps toward the closest land\u2014Haunt Island. Of course, the heroine, Georgia Dare, is something of a scholar and she discovers that Haunt Island was where everyone was massacred. In the script, Mad Miller and Kitty Cutlass come after them, but Georgia and her boyfriend\u2014Travis, of course\u2014find a way to raise the massacred dead, and they come to life and destroy Mad Miller and Kitty Cutlass, and then sink back into the sand. Simple, basic\u2014some history, some ridiculous witchery, even if I did write it myself\u2014good, gory teen fare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat schedule did you follow filming?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI have that in my notebook, too. Oddly enough, most of the scenes were in order, and that was because we were so cost-conscious that we didn\u2019t want to pay actors when we didn\u2019t need them,\u201d Vanessa explained. \u201cObviously, we filmed the scenes at Pirate Cut first, and then we filmed at a few of the reefs up by Key Largo, and then made our way over to South Bimini and finally Haunt Island. When Carlos and Georgia left on the night she was killed, they were supposedly heading straight for Miami.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t believe that Carlos Roca was a brilliant psychopath, pretending to be a great guy and savoring all the possibilities when Georgia went nuts and wanted to go home?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. If he were that good an actor, he would have been in front of the camera, would have been there for years, and garnered a few Oscars,\u201d Vanessa said with certainty. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing, of course\u2014he\u2019s gone. He can\u2019t defend himself. I don\u2019t know what I really even think that we can get out of this, but Carlos is another reason I\u2019d so desperately love to find the truth. He might be a victim, too, and stand accused for this in the memory of his family and loved ones. It isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may do this and wind up with nothing more than an interesting documentary that merely gives rise to more questions,\u201d Sean warned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than anyone else is doing right now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTrue. But, objectively, I can\u2019t blame the Coast Guard, the Bahamian police, the FBI or any other law-enforcement agency. They\u2019ve hit a brick wall. It\u2019s impossible to drain the ocean\u2014by today\u2019s technology, at any rate. I\u2019m sure that all over the Southeastern United States and at Caribbean ports, people are still on the lookout for the boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight\u2014and how hard do you think they\u2019re looking now? People forget, and they move on. Other crimes happen. It\u2019s sad, but true,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cAnd by the way, you do make an excellent omelet.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYep, I do dishes well, too. It\u2019s only the laundry thing that escaped me. But how about you clean up for me, I\u2019ll get David on the phone, gather some supplies and meet you down at the dock. We\u2019ll get your buddy Jay out there as well today, and I\u2019ll interview both of you while we\u2019re on the Conch Fritter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great at dishes,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He set his in the sink. He carefully kept his distance from her. He wanted the day to be productive. At this moment, touching her would be counterproductive.</p><p>It was a beautiful day. Calm seas, bright sun, cool air.</p><p>Jay was called upon to act as cameraman, though David and Sean set up the shot. They spoke about beginning their documentary. They were both excellent speakers, and it was a really good and casual segment, explaining that they were going to follow the legend and speaking about the events that had occurred on the recent film shoot. They talked about the fact that Vanessa was Katie\u2019s friend and had come to them, and how they were they hoping to shed some light on the mystery.</p><p>Sean then repositioned himself and the camera so that he in turn could interview Jay about the film. Sean explained to David where he would want sea charts and other visual aids edited in, and they all seemed to be getting along quite well.</p><p>Katie had come on board with David, so there were five of them out. When they were ready to go into the water, Katie determined that she was just going to lie in the sun\u2014she was tired. It was a busy time at O\u2019Hara\u2019s, and she was trying to make sure that Clarinda would be ready to take over for her when they set out through the Bermuda Triangle for the Bahamas.</p><p>On film again, Sean explained that they were looking for good footage of the \u201cbones,\u201d or the wreck field of the Santa Geneva. Over the years, with storms and currents, wreckage could move for miles. The initial sinking or breakup of a ship could begin the process, and time could keep it going into eternity. The site was fairly shallow, and it was popular with divers; you would think it had been picked clean by salvage divers in the eighteenth century, and yet still more relics had been found in the present, including the mermaid pendant Vanessa had discovered.</p><p>Jay paired up with David, and Vanessa naturally paired up with Sean.</p><p>It was cool in the water, but Vanessa\u2019s skin was still enough for her. Sean and the other men also opted for skins.</p><p>Vanessa was thrilled that the sea was clear that day and the visibility was amazing. She hovered with Sean just below the surface, trying to capture the enormity of the spread of the wreck over the years, and the size and shape of the ship itself. Overlays could be edited in that would describe the Santa Geneva when she was afloat\u2014and how she had been blasted by the pirate ship and came to sink and break up, forced onto the reef now known as Pirate Cut.</p><p>The ship had sunk north to south, and it was actually from a position of about five feet below the surface that Vanessa discovered she was getting the best long shot of the bones of the ship. It was amazing to see the shape and tragically disjointed outline of what had once been a regal and majestic sailing ship. She moved slowly and smoothly over the bones of the wreckage, keeping a straight sweep of the site, and then panning in slowly to show what divers saw as they got closer. If it wasn\u2019t known that a great ship had gone down, a diver might have explored the wreckage for a long time without knowing what it was when he got too close.</p><p>She adjusted the zoom, and it was then that she saw something from the periphery of her eyes. The figurehead.</p><p>A chilling sensation burned through her as cold and hot as dry ice.</p><p>She drew the camera away and looked down at the site. The Santa Geneva seemed settled, at peace, in her sunken graveyard.</p><p>How many had died in this area? The pirates had given the ship a vicious cannon salvo; they had boarded to kill and maim with cutlasses and pistols, and kidnapped Dona Isabella for the ransom she would bring. Those who had fought, who had perished in the water, were here somewhere, now long gone, flesh eaten, bones bleached and disarticulated, food for the creatures of the sea. Ghosts and memories were all that remained.</p><p>Vanessa looked through the lens again.</p><p>And there she was, hazy at first, seeming to look up from jagged coral and sand, the myriad of fish in their amazing colors\u2014and the remains of the deck of the Santa Geneva far below. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vanessa wanted to scream but knew she\u2019d choke, spitting out her regulator. She wanted to give a swift kick with her flippers, burst up the few feet to the surface, leave the water and never come near the reef again.</p><p>But it went against everything she had been fighting to do!</p><p>Maybe she had let it all play on her mind too much; the nightmares were always tearing into her life, and she wasn\u2019t crazy at all, she was simply finding ways to seek and find anything that she could.</p> <p>The image of the figurehead was probably some other minor clue that went into the fantastic computer of the human brain and manifested in an eerie manner.</p><p>She had to believe that, and she had to follow the figurehead, because, so far, it had led her to a mermaid pendant, and it might lead her to...</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let it scare her. She had to believe in a logical explanation.</p><p>She kicked, and her body surged into the depths rather than surfacing.</p><p>She was about fifty yards west of where she had found the locket. She eased more air out of her BCV to settle on the bottom. It seemed that she was near the body, or actual remaining structure of the wreck. Jagged and beautiful coral rose to her right\u2014the drop-off pitched to a hundred feet and then two hundred feet to her left.</p> <p>She began to move the sand, not knowing what she was looking for. There wasn\u2019t a spark of light\u2014the reflection of the sun on an object\u2014or anything to suggest that she would make a find.</p><p>She felt Sean come down near her, concerned\u2014she had made a swift descent, but they were still no more than fifty feet down.</p><p>He tapped her shoulder.</p><p>She looked at him and smiled, and returned to her task of shifting sand.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat and thundered. After several minutes, she touched something. Something hard.</p><p>She turned. She could see Sean\u2019s eyes behind his mask. He was staring at her with great concern. She caught his hand and brought it down to the sand.</p> <p>He felt what she felt. He still frowned, but he seemed incredulous, as well.</p><p>He began working in the sand. She carefully set the shoulder strap of the camera around her and began to dig, as well.</p><p>Whatever they had discovered, it was large. A fair amount of work brought them to realize that they had found the top of something. It was about five feet by three, and appeared to go deeply into the sand. With what they had\u2014their hands\u2014they weren\u2019t going to be able to dig it out.</p><p>Sean motioned to her that they needed to surface. She nodded.</p><p>He went up first on the dive ladder; she knew that he did so should she need help with the weight of her tank. She was good, though, and seldom needed help, but she allowed him to steady her as she climbed up. Katie came aft where they stood, helping each other remove their tanks and vests.</p><p>\u201cI was about to come after you,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cDavid and Jay have been up\u2014they\u2019re in the cabin. David was convinced you knew your air consumption.... I guess you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found something,\u201d Vanessa told Katie breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Katie asked.</p> <p>\u201cAh\u2014something?\u201d Sean said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cAs in? A cannon? An anchor? A big fish?\u201d Katie asked, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sean said. He went over to the ice chest for water, brought out two and tossed one to Vanessa. \u201cWe have to go back down. I have two blowers. I don\u2019t know if it will be enough, but it will definitely help. Whatever it is, it\u2019s buried deep. I honestly think it\u2019s a treasure chest. To the best of my knowledge, gold and jewels have been brought up many times, but treasure chests...I think only one or two have ever come up. This is buried. It\u2019s like it sank into the sand, and because of that, it\u2019s preserved. It\u2019s the right size, and it seems that it was wood, covered in leather. I believe the leather is disintegrating, but the chest is very solid. Lead-lined maybe. I\u2019ve got to tell David.\u201d He paused, turned, took Vanessa\u2019s cheeks between his hands and kissed her quickly on the lips.</p><p>Katie stared with surprise.</p><p>Sean, oblivious, headed for the cabin.</p><p>Katie stared at Vanessa. \u201cI guess you two are getting along all right.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa nodded. She felt something at her back and swung around, but no one was there. Katie, watching her, looked guilty suddenly.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. This boat just gets...strange drafts, I guess,\u201d she said.</p><p>Katie gasped suddenly. \u201cA treasure chest! Do you think he\u2019s right?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s something\u2014it\u2019s hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDigging in the sand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know where to dig in the sand?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something just led me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Like...something led you to the mermaid pendant?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa shrugged, wishing that Katie wasn\u2019t looking at her so probingly. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Katie nodded, frowning. The three men appeared, coming from the cabin. \u201cNew tanks, all of us, and two blowers...if it\u2019s heavy, we\u2019re probably going to need some kind of winch and tackle,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cI think we should go for it now,\u201d Sean said. \u201cThis could be the find of the century. All right, the Atocha was probably the find of the century. But...no. We go for it now. We can set up a winch. We\u2019re talking fifty feet down. I have enough rope to set up a winch. Katie may not be able to handle it alone.... Four of us will go down and set it\u2014and someone will come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take the blower first?\u201d David asked.</p><p>Sean grinned. \u201cYeah\u2014we\u2019ll make sure we do have something,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do. I know we do. The pendant Vanessa found was real\u2014it belonged to Dona Isabella. Jaden said it\u2019s a beautiful piece. I don\u2019t know exactly what we\u2019ve got\u2014or what Vanessa has. Rule of thumb is twenty-five percent to the state, but every find is subject to maritime law, and we are in Florida waters. Let\u2019s go down\u2014\u201d He paused. \u201cVanessa? You good for a second dive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Sean secured his portable blowers and checked that they were clean and ready for use, murmuring that it had been a long time since he\u2019d had them out.</p><p>Within minutes, they were diving in, one by one, David and Sean carrying the handheld blowers, which looked like vacuum cleaners. Sean had a keen sense of direction and led the way, never glancing at his compass. When they reached the object, David and Jay ran their hands over it.</p><p>Sean motioned Jay and Vanessa out of the way and he and David went to work on opposite sides of the object. Little by little, they began to create wedges.</p><p>Sand flew in a fury.</p><p>Then both turned the blowers off and waited. Sand settled.</p><p>And there it was. It still needed a great deal of digging to come free, but it was evident that they had indeed made a discovery.</p><p>It was a chest. A pirate\u2019s chest.</p><p>A treasure chest.</p><p>8</p><p>David wound up working with Katie on deck. Vanessa helped, but Jay and Sean seemed to have a system for rigging the rope around the chest, and she hovered within easy call if they beckoned for her assistance. Eventually, the sand was dug out enough; rope was gotten around the chest, and Sean tugged on the rope, letting David know it was time to work the winch.</p><p>They guided the chest as it began a slow and careful ascent to the surface.</p><p>When they breached the water, there were several hectic moments as they moved as quickly as they could to board the boat, shed their gear and guide the heavy chest aboard, as well.</p><p>When they were finished, they all collapsed on the deck. Jay began to laugh; it was contagious. Then there were high fives all around, and David went down and broke out the beer.</p><p>\u201cNot to ruin this party, but we still don\u2019t know what we have,\u201d Katie pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Sean said. He ruffled his sister\u2019s hair. \u201cIt\u2019s treasure. Come on, be a ray of sunshine, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure I like treasure,\u201d Katie said, frowning. \u201cWell, it\u2019s Vanessa\u2019s treasure.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a group treasure, whatever it is!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou found it,\u201d Katie reminded her.</p><p>Sean had gone to the chest. The old, encrusted lock that held it closed was firmly in place. It seemed to be sealed as tightly as if the long-ago owners had welded it shut.</p><p>\u201cWe can break the lock, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to help. The damned thing is heavy as hell\u2014and it looks like they might have welded it or something. They wanted it to be sealed, watertight,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe can take it to Jaden and Ted. They\u2019ll know the best thing to do,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll know, yes,\u201d Katie said. \u201cAnd we should be getting back in. We\u2019re going to lose the sun any minute. And I have to go to work.\u201d</p><p>Sean smiled. \u201cAre you afraid of the dark, Katie? You never were. Work! You work all the time. You can be a little late. This is a treasure chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know it\u2019s a chest. I\u2019m so excited. But we\u2019re not going to open it here,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Vanessa realized that she, too, wanted to be back onshore. There was something about the trunk that suddenly made her feel uncomfortable. It was wet, dark with age, still covered in sand, but the lock, encrusted, seemed somehow ominous. She felt ridiculously superstitious. Someone had locked the trunk carefully. They had sealed it.</p><p>For a reason.</p><p>What the hell was in it?</p><p>Yes, it did look like it belonged in a Robert Louis Stevenson novel. Or in Mel Fisher\u2019s museum. It was dome-topped and handsome, even in its current state. Maybe it was just the way Katie was acting.</p><p>Vanessa wished that she had never found it.</p><p>The strangest thing was that she wasn\u2019t certain she felt the same way as Katie. Katie seemed scared. Vanessa wasn\u2019t certain that she was scared. Yes, yes, she was scared. The chest was...</p><p>An instrument...of something else? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ridiculous. None of them even knew what was in it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll head in right now,\u201d Sean assured his sister. He seemed puzzled by her reaction and paused to give her a hug. \u201cIt may be treasure,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd it may not,\u201d she told him. She waved a hand in the air. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s documents. A captain\u2019s log, something like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo me, that would be a greater treasure,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cPieces of paper?\u201d Jay queried glumly.</p><p>Sean laughed. \u201cCome on, you must know the value of that kind of paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Historic!\u201d Jay said. \u201cI say it\u2019s going to be pieces of eight! Gold and silver ingots. We know the Santa Geneva sank there. And she had come from Columbia to Cuba\u2014and to Key West to bring Dona Isabella and others back to Spain. There had to have been great treasures on the ship!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say that it\u2019s going to be gold and silver because the damned thing is heavy as hell,\u201d Sean said.</p> <p>Katie moved back by Vanessa. She waved a hand in the air. \u201cBoys, boys! Bring this boat back in\u2014or I\u2019ll take the helm!\u201d</p><p>Sean grinned at her and started the engines.</p><p>Vanessa glanced at her. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want you driving his boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019d let me, but I hit the dock once. It was rather an expensive error,\u201d Katie said. She tried to grin. The grin failed.</p><p>Sean, David and Jay remained excited. Sean was at the helm, but David and Jay hovered with him. They gestured as they spoke, all enthusiastic.</p><p>Vanessa jumped off the boat quickly to help with the ties when they arrived at the dock. By then, she didn\u2019t even want to be on the boat with the chest. It was ridiculous, but she felt uneasy. It was so stupid! She didn\u2019t usually let herself behave so ridiculously. Even when they had found the bodies of Travis and Georgia...or what had remained of them, she hadn\u2019t been uneasy. She had been horrified, and then angry. They had been so young. They had been so cruelly robbed of their lives. And someone was getting away with it.</p> <p>She was tired. Certainly, that was it.</p><p>As if reading her mind, Sean looked over at her. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHey\u2014I\u2019m going to run back to the inn and get the rest of my things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two coming by tonight?\u201d Katie asked. \u201cI\u2019m going to change for work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home soon,\u201d David promised, pausing to kiss her, smiling and smoothing her hair back.</p><p>\u201cBoys, boys\u2014take your time. Vanessa and I will be fine,\u201d Katie assured him. She looked at Vanessa. \u201cWe can walk part of the way together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Vanessa said.</p> <p>She was on the dock; Sean was on the boat. He smiled at her. \u201cI won\u2019t be all that long, really. I\u2019ll come to the inn and get you. We definitely need a big drink at ye olde family bar tonight!\u201d</p><p>She was glad to see him so enthusiastic.</p><p>Jay was staring at her, too. He gave her a thumbs-up, glad because she was proving that the two of them were worth something.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think our problem is?\u201d Vanessa asked Katie as they started toward Front Street.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014weird, isn\u2019t it? I was as excited as anyone when we started\u2014then it came aboard. Creepy. Hey, we are probably idiots. If that thing is filled with treasure, even after the state gets hold of it, we\u2019ll be in nice shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, all of us are working. None of us is desperate for a treasure. Okay, maybe Jay. He went through a serious funk after...after everything with the movie went so badly. He didn\u2019t work a lot. I think he\u2019s been working lately, but...not doing what he wants. Underwater weddings, scuba trips...just enough to keep going. He thought we would have been in the big bucks once the movie went to a distributor. But then it was all so horrible...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll leave it to the boys,\u201d Katie said, rolling her eyes. \u201cAnd Jaden and Ted have worked with some of the most amazing finds. Treasure after treasure. They\u2019ll get it unsealed without compromising anything. Now, that is amazing! Sealed and preserved. We need to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Vanessa said. She wrinkled her face in perplexity and stopped to stare at Katie. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd. I was excited. Now I\u2019m not. What made the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...I don\u2019t know. Maybe we should go back tomorrow to see Marty\u2014he\u2019ll be getting his shows going and all by now. We\u2019ll get him to talk about Dona Isabella. Maybe that will help us somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did a lot of research\u2014I was nuts about the legend. It was so tragic. I\u2019m not sure what else Marty can tell us,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t hurt, right?\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t hurt,\u201d Vanessa agreed.</p><p>She was surprised when Katie wrapped her arms around herself, shivering. \u201cSorry\u2014goose bumps. I\u2019m glad Sean is coming back for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be fine,\u201d Vanessa said. She was glad, too.</p><p>\u201cCome into Katie-oke. That\u2019ll make you feel normal!\u201d Katie assured her.</p><p>Vanessa nodded. She and Katie hugged quickly, then went their separate ways.</p><p>She was glad to head down Duval. The tourists and bright lights helped her shake her feelings of unease.</p><p>She was surprised when she hesitated as she neared her inn and decided she\u2019d like a break instead of going right inside.</p><p>She walked onto the patio restaurant next to the shop and decided that she\u2019d like one drink. There was a small empty table and she sat at it. Despite the fact that it was busy, a waitress came her way fairly quickly, and she opted for a whiskey with cola.</p><p>Her drink came and she sipped it, watching the activity. Yes, Pirates in Paradise was happening. A trio, dressed as pirates, was playing back at the small bandstand.</p><p>She smiled, closed her eyes for a moment and sipped her drink. She opened her eyes, feeling more relaxed and focused on taking in her environment.</p><p>The next table was filled with would-be pirates. It was fun to see the different ensembles. Women were fond of the corsets\u2014which could be bought on Front Street or on the grounds of Fort Taylor. The skirts were in a multitude of colors and lengths. Despite the fact that Key West pirates most often appeared to be very authentic, a few women were in short, sexy costumes from well-known short, sexy costume manufacturers.</p><p>Some wore them better than others.</p><p>Everyone seemed to have a good time, though.</p><p>As she casually surveyed a group at a nearby table, a woman turned toward her.</p><p>She was a wench.</p><p>A well-done wench.</p><p>She was a pretty woman with strawberry-blond hair that was wild and curled down her back. She wore no hat of any kind. Her blouse, beneath her corset, was billowing and a shade of off-white that looked to be unbleached cotton. Her skirt was long, but with ties that could hike it up so that it wouldn\u2019t constantly sweep the ground.</p><p>She looked a bit tired, a bit worn.</p><p>And she looked right at Vanessa.</p><p>Vanessa smiled in return.</p><p>The woman\u2019s mouth moved as she spoke. She was saying something to Vanessa. The beat to \u201cJoy to the World\u201d was pounding in the distance, and there was a great deal of conversation and laughter all around them.</p><p>And yet Vanessa thought that she heard her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what it seems. Help me, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>She was a stranger; it couldn\u2019t be what she was saying. Frowning, Vanessa rose, ready to walk over to the woman and introduce herself, prove that she was saying something else.</p><p>She stood. A heavyset man in a giant frock coat walked between the tables.</p><p>Vanessa knew that he didn\u2019t see her; politely, she gave way.</p><p>But as she headed for the other table, she stopped. The chair where the strawberry blonde had been sitting was empty.</p><p>Vanessa looked around; she had to be somewhere nearby.</p><p>She would just ask the people where their friend had gone. The chair she had vacated was quickly filled by the man in the giant frock coat. She approached the group, who looked at her with friendly smiles.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d said one of the women, her smile open and generous.</p><p>\u201cHi, all. You look great,\u201d Vanessa told them.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the man in the giant frock coat said. He stood. \u201cCare to join us? This is great for us\u2014we\u2019re having the time of our lives. Jessy\u2014that\u2019s my wife over there\u2014teaches high school history, so for history buffs, this is just cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get you a drink?\u201d another woman asked politely. \u201cI\u2019m Gena, Jessy\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Introductions went around.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you so much on the drink. Actually, I was looking for your friend. She was trying to tell me something, and I couldn\u2019t hear her,\u201d Vanessa explained.</p><p>\u201cOur friend?\u201d Jessy asked. \u201cWe\u2019re all here. Oh, I mean, we\u2019re meeting all kinds of new friends\u2014this is like grown-up costume-party fun right along with a fabulous learning experience! Like minds and all that. But...our whole group is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a woman...sitting here,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cA strawberry blonde.\u201d</p><p>They all stared at her.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Gena said suddenly. \u201cI think I might know who you mean, but I\u2019m afraid she isn\u2019t our friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d her sister asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, she was around... I don\u2019t know who she is,\u201d Gena explained. \u201cBut she sure looked great! Kind of like a prostitute of old. I saw her, but she wasn\u2019t one of our friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was sitting right here,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>They all looked at her blankly, probably regretting that they had asked her over.</p><p>At least Gena had seen the woman, too.</p><p>She smiled and rose. \u201cAh, well, I must have been mistaken. Thank you\u2014and have a wonderful time!\u201d</p><p>They assured her that they would.</p><p>Vanessa turned around, returned quickly to her own table and set money on her check. She picked up her drink, drained it and left. She really needed to wash off the salt. She wanted to shower. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wanted Sean to come back for her. She wanted to be with him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with it,\u201d Bartholomew said flatly, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell? Both Katie and Vanessa reacted to it\u2014and you should trust Katie\u2019s very acute sixth sense!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, genius, you were around when it all happened. You tell me what\u2019s wrong with the trunk!\u201d Sean said. He was aggravated. What was the matter with all of them? It was the find of a lifetime. He wanted to be excited about it. In fact, he realized, he\u2019d been so damned excited, they hadn\u2019t filmed any of it, except when Vanessa had first found the damned thing.</p> <p>\u201cI was around at the time, yes. I didn\u2019t run in the same circles as Dona Isabella. I knew that she was a beauty\u2014I saw her in the streets. She was surrounded by servants. She had a grand house. Her husband never came from Spain, and she controlled all his properties here. Now, I did meet Mad Miller, and in my mind, he wasn\u2019t so mad. And Kitty Cutlass...well, if she went crazy and killed a bunch of people, it was only because she was madly in love with Mad Miller. But this trunk...you found it away from the ship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot far from the debris field. It wasn\u2019t on coral\u2014or in the remains of the ship. But I don\u2019t know what you think that means. Debris travels. It can spread out for miles\u2014you know that.\u201d Sean paused and looked toward the dock. David and Jay were there; they had called Jaden and Ted, and the couple was coming with their truck to bring the chest back to their place of business. They would study and analyze it and figure out how to open it with the most integrity toward the chest itself and whatever just might be inside. Ted also knew a great deal more about reporting finds to the state and the legal filing that needed to be done.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t like it,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not to like about the possibility of a cache of historical coins?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Bartholomew shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to make a fortune. You\u2019re a lucky man. You do what you love for a living, and you make a good living at it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat from a pirate,\u201d Sean moaned.</p><p>\u201cPrivateer,\u201d Bartholomew said irritably.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2014I don\u2019t need a hoard of riches. It\u2019s not that, Bartholomew. I believe in learning about the past\u2014I believe in museums. I believe in finding out the truth about what happened, and every little clue gives us something more on that end. What\u2019s bothering you? What do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a ghost. I don\u2019t feel. Well, not really,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certainly ready at all times to give an opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I do have a...oh, all right, I have a feeling. But I don\u2019t really understand it. Is it Pandora\u2019s box?\u201d Bartholomew asked softly. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. But it is something...that may change things. Does that make any sense?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt may change the way we look at the past,\u201d Sean suggested.</p><p>Bartholomew shrugged. \u201cI think your friend onshore is already counting his riches,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jay stood with David, still gesturing, excited.</p><p>As Sean watched, he saw Ted and Jaden arrive with their truck. A fair group of tourists and locals had formed in the parking lot beyond the restaurant and the docks, all looking anxiously to see what was going on.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201d Jay called, spinning around to make sure that Sean had heard him.</p><p>Sean nodded. David and Jay returned to the boat, hopping onto the deck. Now that it was out of the water, the chest was manageable, just awkward, especially with three of them. But Ted came hurrying from the passenger side of the truck, leaving Jaden to maneuver it as close to the end of the dock as she could.</p><p>\u201cCool! Cool, oh my God! Cool!\u201d Ted announced, jumping on the deck of the Conch Fritter. \u201cEvery man to an edge. We\u2019ll get her to our place. I can\u2019t wait, I can\u2019t wait. I want to keep it in a mist until we see how it will do out of the water. This is amazing. Cool, cool, cool!\u201d</p><p>They hunkered down, the four of them. Between them, the weight didn\u2019t seem that bad. Sean estimated that whatever was actually inside the chest weighed between a hundred and a hundred and twenty pounds.</p> <p>They moved easily enough with it\u2014moving quickly. They got it onto a tarp Ted had stretched out over the bed of the truck.</p><p>\u201cSean, your find, you go with Ted,\u201d David said. \u201cI\u2019ll hose down and secure the Conch Fritter. Then I\u2019ll head straight over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll help David,\u201d Jay said without enthusiasm.</p><p>David laughed. \u201cNo, go with Sean. Never mind\u2014stay with me. We\u2019ll both get there faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s do it!\u201d Jay said.</p><p>Before Sean could crawl into the cab, Jay was racing back to the Conch Fritter.</p><p>Sean slid in next to Jaden, leaning forward between the driver and passenger seats. She gave him a kiss on the cheek and grinned. \u201cYou are on a roll!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa is on a roll. I have no idea how she found it,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ted climbed in and slammed the door. \u201cDrive, woman, drive!\u201d he said.</p><p>In a matter of minutes they were back at the shop. They didn\u2019t have to worry about weight or statistics; Ted and Jaden had carts and ramps, and they quickly had it down, still on a tarp, in one of their temperature-controlled rooms where the air was heavy with moisture.</p><p>Jaden and Ted looked over the trunk and discussed the best way to attack it. Obviously, they didn\u2019t have a key, and if they did, the lock was probably too degraded to open with it. They did, however, have a friend who was a locksmith.</p><p>He was called.</p><p>They were going to have to wait.</p><p>If they were going to have to wait, Sean wanted to bring Vanessa back.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019m going to call David,\u201d he told Ted. \u201cI\u2019ll run and grab a quick shower, stop by for Vanessa, and we\u2019ll all meet back here in an hour. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour?\u201d Ted said. He loved the old, treasure and a mystery.</p><p>\u201cTed, we have to wait for the locksmith,\u201d Jaden reminded him.</p><p>\u201cWe could just need a little oil,\u201d Ted said hopefully. \u201cYou know what works wonders? Olive oil, not that I was really thinking about olive oil on this. WD-40.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do it right. Run on, Sean. I\u2019ll chill some champagne!\u201d Jaden said happily.</p><p>Vanessa told herself that she wasn\u2019t afraid of her own room. She was. She didn\u2019t want to be alone anymore. She just wanted to go back to Sean\u2019s. She\u2019d get the rest of her things later.</p><p>She showered fast, scrubbed her face, towel dried her body and her hair, dressed in an A-line knit dress and sandals and ran back down the stairs. The sun was setting, and it would be dark soon. She was glad she was on Duval Street\u2014and that pirates and wenches and drunken frat boys were plying the sidewalk.</p><p>She headed into the little bar again but ordered a soda. She could still feel the warmth of the whiskey and didn\u2019t want to appear to be as inebriated as the frat boys. It was while she was there, idly sitting on one of the four stools in the place and watching the crowd, that she nearly choked and fell off.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t seeing any kind of an apparition.</p><p>No one dressed in pirate attire.</p><p>To her amazement, Zoe Cally and Barry Melkie, props, costumes, makeup and sound on their ill-fated film, stood in front of the Irish bar, drinking beer, deep in conversation.</p><p>She jumped up and ran across the street. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Zoe turned to look at her. She was a pretty girl, small and delicate, with large brown eyes and light hair. She smiled, and the smile was bright and welcoming.</p><p>\u201cVanessa!\u201d Zoe cried with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cHey, you!\u201d Barry said. He picked her up to give her a huge bear hug. He was a big man, about six foot three and well muscled, in his midthirties.</p><p>Barry set her down, grinning as broadly as Zoe. \u201cThis is unbelievable! How cool. We were just talking about you and Jay, and thinking that we should call you.\u201d</p><p>Zoe laughed. \u201cWe were talking because we read an advertisement. There are these guys planning a documentary on weird stuff in Key West and environs,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know!\u201d Vanessa said. She started to speak again, but Zoe interrupted her enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cImagine our surprise when they called us!\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>\u201cHey, let me buy you a beer, Vanessa,\u201d Barry said. \u201cWe\u2019ll explain.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa explained how she and Jay were already working with Sean and David. \u201cSean just called you and my Lord, you got here quickly!\u201d she said.</p><p>Zoe giggled. \u201cWe were close. We got here last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd guess what? I mean, I think this was all really supposed to happen. I have already called the kids,\u201d Barry said proudly.</p><p>\u201cThe kids?\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cThe kids\u2014our kids, our grad students. You know, both those bozos managed to graduate and get work, can you imagine?\u201d Barry asked.</p><p>Vanessa felt her heart sinking. \u201cYou mean Bill Hinton and Jake Magnoli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course, what other kids did we work with?\u201d Zoe asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cVanessa, come on, let me buy you a beer,\u201d Barry said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t right now. I\u2019m waiting for Sean,\u201d Vanessa explained.</p><p>\u201cAnd Jay?\u201d Zoe asked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cAnd Jay,\u201d she said.</p><p>Zoe smiled. \u201cI am so glad. I\u2019m so glad we were already heading here. This is going to be so important, so cathartic, for all of us. We were there! We saw Travis and Georgia. Vanessa, you of all people must understand how we feel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Vanessa agreed softly.</p><p>\u201cThis is an amazing opportunity. We\u2019ve all been ripped apart by nightmares. We\u2019ve all been like zombies since it happened,\u201d Barry said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re happy, right?\u201d Zoe asked. \u201cYou want to work with us again? We were all giving our hearts to that project of Jay\u2019s!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course I\u2019d want to work with you again. I came at Sean O\u2019Hara full blast, but then Jay showed up, and I had no idea Jay was coming, but it looked as if I had planned a way to wheedle everyone in,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled now that they\u2019re fascinated by the whole project and want all of us to be crew\u2014and to be interviewed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so cool. So great,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>\u201cDo they know that you\u2019re here yet?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t think so,\u201d Barry said.</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to do some catching up and all. We\u2019ve been on separate projects,\u201d Zoe said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been on separate projects, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why don\u2019t you do some catching up with us?\u201d Barry asked Vanessa.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t right now. But Sean will be glad to hear that you\u2019re here in Key West and that you\u2019re gung-ho with their plan. Look, there\u2019s a bar called O\u2019Hara\u2019s down on the other end of Duval. Show up down there around ten o\u2019clock and I\u2019ll introduce you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, sounds great,\u201d Zoe said.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, later,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>Zoe slipped her arm through Barry\u2019s and they headed off, waving. Vanessa wandered back across the street to the patio restaurant.</p><p>She felt acutely uncomfortable, and she wasn\u2019t sure why. After all, Sean had said just last night that he\u2019d ask Liam to get hold of the others.</p><p>She ordered another drink.</p><p>There were the key words. Just last night.</p><p>And they were already here.</p> <p>Well, it made sense, really. She had desperately wanted to reach Sean and David when she had heard about their project and that they were hiring crew. So...</p><p>To her surprise, she had to call out to Sean to stop him from heading around her building to the stairs to the upper stories. He had showered and changed into jeans and a short-sleeved cotton shirt, so he had evidently been home.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he said, surprised to see her waiting for him at the bar.</p><p>\u201cDid you open the trunk?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Jaden and Ted wanted to call a locksmith, so I decided the group should get together for the grand opening. David and I are partners and Katie is his...well, those two will wind up married, and she\u2019s my sister. You discovered the chest. And Jay\u2014well, as I said, you discovered the chest, and you brought Jay in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring Jay in,\u201d Vanessa protested. She winced inwardly. She was aggravated. Sean kept speaking casually, but it was apparent that he believed that she had brought Jay in on the project. Jay was her friend, but she hadn\u2019t brought him in on the project. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that in a bad way,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve known him forever. He is a good friend. But I didn\u2019t bring him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it would hardly seem fair to exclude one person who was on the Conch Fritter today, would it?\u201d Sean asked her.</p><p>Vanessa smiled. The more she was with him, the more she liked him. Which was good, of course. The sexual attraction was so strong, but really liking someone was...important.</p> <p>Did he really like her? Would he do so if he knew that she saw strange things in the water? He knew about the nightmares, of course.</p><p>But she had been through an enormous trauma. Any psychiatrist would say so.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s head on over to the shop!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, but she pulled back a minute, her hand on his arm. \u201cWait. Zoe Cally and Barry are here.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up with surprise. \u201cWow. I just asked Liam to try to reach them last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were coming here to ask you for work,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cSo where are they now?\u201d he asked. His eyes were narrowed, and he was staring at her strangely. Maybe he was just staring at her, and she felt guilty. She shouldn\u2019t feel guilty. She hadn\u2019t done anything.</p><p>\u201cI told them to come to O\u2019Hara\u2019s tonight,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAll right. That was definitely fast. Let\u2019s go see about the trunk.\u201d</p><p>He slipped an arm around her shoulders. He frowned, and she turned, certain there was someone behind her.</p><p>But there was no one.</p><p>As they walked, the sun sank completely, and the majestic colors that had filled the western sky faded away. A misty gray followed the sunset, twilight, with darkness coming quickly.</p><p>She had never been afraid of the dark.</p><p>She was glad of Sean\u2019s arm around her shoulders.</p><p>And for how long would that be? she wondered. He didn\u2019t seem to be the type of man who would want a woman long who was afraid of the dark, afraid of her own shadow, afraid of being alone in broad daylight.</p><p>She was uncertain about her feelings regarding the trunk. She knew that Sean was excited, and she wanted to feel the same way. The odd thing was that she was now feeling more confused than ever. At first, she had felt that the object was...</p><p>Evil.</p><p>Now, she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Object. Inorganic. Not good or evil!</p><p>They came around the corner and headed to the front door of the shop. Sean knocked, since it was closed for actual business, and Jaden came around to let them in. She didn\u2019t seem disturbed at all, but excited.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t opened the chest!\u201d she said. \u201cRicky\u2014he\u2019s our locksmith\u2014he got the old lock open without destroying it. David and Ted are breaking the seal. Oh, lordy, lordy, this is exciting! I\u2019ve never, never seen anything like it! Oh, and Ted called a maritime lawyer he knows, so the claim is being filed. It\u2019s amazing! Just the chest is amazing!\u201d</p><p>Vanessa smiled. \u201cWonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get in,\u201d Sean said. He looked at Vanessa. \u201cHey, I don\u2019t know your dousing secret, but it\u2019s unbelievable. The trunk, and its contents, are yours.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHey, I\u2019m one of the crew. I\u2019m grateful that we\u2019re doing this. I remain in your debt.\u201d</p><p>He touched her face. \u201cNo debt,\u201d he said softly. \u201cNo one forced my hand\u2014I chose to set off in your direction, and I think it\u2019s going to be a great decision.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Jaden urged.</p><p>They walked on through to the workroom. Ricky was working extremely carefully with crowbars, small hammers and chisels.</p><p>Katie was standing back with Jay. Her arms were crossed over her chest. She tried to offer a cheerful smile as they arrived.</p><p>\u201cOh, while they\u2019re finishing up, Vanessa, you haven\u2019t even seen the piece you found the other day!\u201d Jaden said.</p><p>She went over to a wall safe and spun the lock. She brought out a piece set in a bed of velvet and brought it to Vanessa to show it to her.</p><p>Vanessa smiled and looked.</p><p>It was the mermaid. The mermaid of which she had bought a copy the other day, the pendant that had hung around the neck of Dona Isabella.</p><p>This one was, however, far more ornate. Emeralds blazed from the eyes, rubies adorned her scales. The mermaid was large and heavy, and the gold in the workmanship was rich and deep.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Jaden said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t really want to touch it,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cSticky fingers\u2014body oils, whatever!\u201d she explained quickly. \u201cFunny thing\u2014I purchased a copy from one of the pirate vendors the other day, and I saw the picture of Dona Isabella wearing the pendant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really is a museum piece,\u201d Jaden said.</p><p>They were all startled by a sudden jerking sound\u2014and a very strange sound, an expulsion of air as soft as a sigh.</p><p>Ricky moved back.</p><p>A mist of time escaped the trunk, was visible for a split second, and then evaporated into the air.</p><p>\u201cThink there might have been a dangerous buildup of gas?\u201d Ted asked. \u201cWow, sorry, a little late for me to think of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrank up the air purifiers,\u201d Sean suggested. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anything lethal just escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can lift the lid,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cGo for it,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cVanessa?\u201d David said, looking at her. He smiled. \u201cYour discovery.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou and Sean are leading the adventure.\u201d</p><p>Sean stepped forward and shrugged at David.</p><p>They each reached for a side of the lid. And lifted.</p><p>They were both dead silent, staring downward into the chest.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, come on, what is it?\u201d Ted demanded.</p><p>Still, neither man moved. Ted went rushing over and looked down, as well. \u201cHoly shit!\u201d he exclaimed\u2014his voice filled with horror, not wonder.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Katie asked weakly.</p><p>Jay walked up next. He clapped his hand over his mouth and turned away.</p><p>Vanessa knew from Jay\u2019s reaction that it was bad. She steeled herself and walked forward and looked down into a chest.</p><p>At first she didn\u2019t realize what she was seeing.</p><p>And then she did.</p><p>The chest contained the oddly mummified and distorted remains of a human body. The clothing remained; the head was at an awkward angle. A hat still sat upon a skeletal head. The skin was dark and stretched over the frame, and the fabric of the clothing was stained, probably by the body fluids that had oozed from the corpse soon after death.</p><p>The eye sockets were empty.</p><p>And yet they seemed to stare and tear into Vanessa\u2019s heart.</p><p>All she could remember at that moment were Sean\u2019s earlier words.</p><p>The trunk, and its contents, are yours.</p><p>9</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dona Isabella,\u201d Marty said knowingly.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be Dona Isabella. She wasn\u2019t killed until the pirates reached Haunt Island,\u201d David said. \u201cAccording to legend, at any rate. Although, frankly, everything about what happened is legend\u2014after the pirate ship attacked the Santa Geneva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait, and that\u2019s all there is to it\u2014hope that the forensic anthropologist can help us,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a treasure,\u201d Jay said mournfully.</p><p>\u201cIf the body sheds light on history, the find is a treasure,\u201d Sean said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were gathered at O\u2019Hara\u2019s. The trunk and body were locked in the workroom at the shop, and they were all lined up at the bar.</p><p>Vanessa was next to Sean. He had worried about her at first\u2014neither she nor Katie had seemed thrilled about the discovery from the start. But oddly enough, once she had seen what was in the trunk, she had seemed more relaxed. Maybe she had somehow intuited that they weren\u2019t going to bring in a stash of silver and gold, and maybe she felt that, this way, eventually, Dona Isabella would get the funeral she deserved\u2014belatedly\u2014and that there would be some kind of finality for someone, at least.</p><p>She had been fine in the showroom, and fine on the walk here. She had applauded and laughed with the rest of them when they had come in to the sounds of a singer doing a version of a Denis Leary number that was tawdry to say the least, but very well done.</p> <p>Now, at the bar, she was nervously drinking a Scottish single-malt whiskey.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the legend has been all wrong\u2014maybe Dona Isabella survived the massacre and was later murdered and tossed over the remains of the Santa Geneva,\u201d Jay suggested.</p><p>Sean looked at Vanessa. She didn\u2019t seem to be listening.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not Dona Isabella, but Jim Morrison of the Doors,\u201d he said, touching Vanessa\u2019s hand.</p><p>She started, and looked at him. \u201cWell, of course, that\u2019s a theory,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cA penny for your thoughts. A gold cob, rather,\u201d he said.</p><p>She arched a brow, opened her mouth and shut it. She tried to speak again. Before she could, Jay exclaimed, \u201cWhy, as I live and breathe. Hail, hail, the gang\u2019s all here!\u201d</p><p>Sean spun around on his stool. Four people had just come into O\u2019Hara\u2019s. There was a tiny, pretty woman; a tall, broad-shouldered and all-around big man; and two more men who appeared to be in their early twenties, average in height and size, both with sun-bleached brown hair.</p><p>\u201cYour crew?\u201d Sean asked Vanessa.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cZoe Cally, Barry Melkie, Bill Hinton and Jake Magnoli. Jake is taller and tends to slouch, and he\u2019s no relation to Bill, though they do look kind of like two peas in a pod, in a way. Barry is the really tall guy, and Zoe is the woman. Obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that they were all here,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cNeither did I. But Zoe and Barry told me earlier that they\u2019d gotten hold of the kids.\u201d</p><p>He knew the names. He\u2019d looked up what he could find on the film crew and the events that had occurred around the filming. She had mentioned the names as well, telling him what she had seen and experienced the night of the murders.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea that Bill and Jake were already here,\u201d Vanessa added. \u201cThey had heard about your documentary, too. Before you had Liam find them all and call them, they all planned to come and try to get work with you.\u201d</p><p>Sean was surprised to feel irritated.</p><p>This was so...pat.</p><p>He\u2019d thought they\u2019d have to hunt the crew down. He looked over at Vanessa, and he wondered if he hadn\u2019t fallen into what she wanted as easily as any idiot.</p><p>Jay was by David. He looked stunned, and he stared at Vanessa. \u201cHey, wait, I didn\u2019t even know those guys were in Key West,\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cVanessa did,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There must have been something in his voice that accused her\u2014or else she felt guilty about the situation.</p><p>Because she had planned it all this way from the beginning, and he had walked into it just the way she had intended all along?</p><p>It was probably a good thing that he\u2019d never wanted to be an actor.</p><p>His face apparently gave away his thoughts. Vanessa was up in an instant, but she didn\u2019t turn on him first. She looked at Jay, and then at him.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Jay, don\u2019t you understand? They think it was set up that you showed up down here, too.\u201d She stood tall and angry, and tossed a length of her hair over her shoulder as she spoke. \u201cWhat? Are you all suddenly the KGB or the CIA? Why does something have to be a setup? Why isn\u2019t it obvious to you all that something absolutely horrible happened? Two people were murdered. Maybe three. Two people we knew well\u2014we\u2019d been working with them for weeks. We found them, we saw them dead in the sand. Is it so odd that, hearing about your project, this group has all found its way to you?\u201d</p><p>David was staring at Vanessa, surprised. He turned to Sean. \u201cI thought you had Liam try to reach the rest of the crew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said.</p><p>Vanessa flushed. She winced. \u201cI don\u2019t know how everyone managed to be here so quickly. I\u2019m sorry. I... Oh, never mind. It is going to work out best this way.\u201d</p><p>By then, the group was coming their way, having seen Vanessa and Jay. Zoe Cally came forward with a huge, trusting smile.</p><p>As if she hadn\u2019t any inkling they might not be wanted.</p><p>\u201cThere are large tables out back in the patio area. We\u2019ll head out there,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go talk where we can hear.\u201d</p><p>A would-be soprano was belting out a number from Phantom that was far out of her range and it seemed to him to be nothing more than a very loud screech at the moment.</p><p>He headed out back, waving to the others to follow him.</p><p>Clarinda, Jamie\u2019s favorite server and Katie\u2019s close friend, stopped him as he headed out. \u201cSean, should I set you all up out there? Do you want dinner and drinks, and should I be steering other people away?\u201d</p><p>He paused, feeling a break in his temper at last. \u201cYeah, thanks, Clarinda, that would be great.\u201d Come to think of it, they hadn\u2019t eaten.</p><p>The contents of the chest had made them all forget the fact that they hadn\u2019t had dinner.</p><p>She smiled sympathetically and moved on; Clarinda would have known, from Katie, what they had discovered in their \u201ctreasure\u201d find.</p><p>He walked on out to the patio. It was typical Key West, lots of shrubs and trees surrounding Cuban tile flooring and wooden tables, some round, some square, some oblong. Umbrellas over the tables shaded them from heat during the day and were enough shelter against rain when it was light. He stood by the table, waiting.</p><p>The group began to trail out, Vanessa in the lead. Once they could hear, she began the introductions.</p><p>There was a large crowd outside by then, so it seemed. Vanessa, Jay and the film crew, himself, David, Jaden and Ted. Jaden and Ted were quiet, watching, as if they were suddenly part of an unexpected reality TV show.</p><p>Vanessa was quiet after the introductions, taking a seat at one of the long, oblong tables.</p><p>\u201cYou all know what we\u2019re planning on doing, right?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Barry said. \u201cIt\u2019s great. We\u2019re so pleased. We were all going to ask you guys for work anyway, and then we talked to your cousin, Liam, and he explained that you wanted those of us who were involved to talk about what happened on camera. But we can help you enormously in other ways,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you all work well together. And that\u2019s great. But what we really want is to get each one\u2019s perspective of what went on at Haunt Island.\u201d</p><p>Zoe began speaking quickly. \u201cWe\u2019re so grateful for this opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Clarinda came out in the midst of it all.</p><p>\u201cOkay, guys, let me get your orders in. The place is getting busy,\u201d she said.</p><p>Beer seemed to be the main order for the night, and O\u2019Hara\u2019s offered a vast variety. There was confusion as people took seats so that she could take food orders.</p><p>Sean wound up at the head of the table at one end, David at the other. They did resemble some kind of strange patriarchs in a ragtag family.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already started filming,\u201d Jay told the newcomers excitedly. \u201cAnd guess what? Vanessa found a corpse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA corpse?\u201d Zoe demanded, staring down the table at Vanessa.</p><p>\u201cWe thought we had a treasure chest. It was a corpse,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was a chest\u2014it just wasn\u2019t filled with treasure,\u201d Jay said. \u201cIt held a corpse. But you know what? We think it might be Dona Isabella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything yet,\u201d Jaden protested softly. She joined the discussion with enthusiasm. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything, really, but the preservation is remarkable. Somehow, when the poor woman was murdered and stuffed in the chest, she became mummified. The chest was sealed, as if...as if...oh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe someone felt remorse and wanted to see that she was preserved in her tomb in the sea. It\u2019s eerie. She\u2019s all there...clothes and all, and she\u2019s at an strange angle...neck broken, at least that\u2019s what it looks like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDona Isabella? I thought she died during the massacre on Haunt Island, or if not, when the pirate ship went down southwest of the Bahamas,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>\u201cEverything about Mad Miller, Kitty Cutlass and Dona Isabella is pure speculation, really,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cThere were one or two survivors who actually made it to shore when the Santa Geneva went down. They were the ones who told of the pirate attack. The Santa Geneva was accosted, there was some kind of communication between Mad Miller and her captain, and then the Santa Geneva was fired upon. Before she sank, the pirates boarded, cutting down the crew and kidnapping Dona Isabella. We know, too, that there was a massacre on Haunt Island, because the Bahamians found the remains. They knew that the pirate ship had come there, and that it had sailed. We know that it went down in a hurricane, because it was seen by an American ship when that ship barely survived the same storm. In fact, sailors swore that the pirate ship went down when a massive burst of fire flared in the sky. If the Bermuda Triangle had been labeled the Bermuda Triangle back then, it might have taken the blame. They called it an act of God. At least they didn\u2019t think that aliens came down and swept up the pirate ship.\u201d</p><p>Zoe giggled. \u201cWell, if aliens came down, they missed poor Dona Isabella\u2019s treasure-chest tomb. Hey, I know debris travels, but not that far. The Santa Geneva went down off Key West, and the pirate ship\u2014however it went!\u2014perished off of South Bimini and Haunt Island. So the story is all wrong somewhere along the line.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf that is Dona Isabella,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>Jay laughed, pretended a shiver and let out an \u201cOooooh! Well, of course, it has to be Dona Isabella. And her evil is rising\u2014that\u2019s why you two were afraid of the chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid of the chest,\u201d Vanessa said, her tone aggravated.</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jay said with a shrug.</p><p>Food came. The conversation changed to where everyone was staying on the island\u2014Bill and Jake had taken rooms at the Banyan while Barry and Zoe were in the guesthouses on Duval, a couple blocks down from where Vanessa was staying.</p><p>Everyone talked about different projects. Barry admitted that he had looked up information on David and Sean and been impressed with their separate bodies of work. The evening wore on, then Jaden and Ted called it a night, promising to call Sean and David the minute they heard from Tara Aislinn, the woman who was coming down from the University of Florida, the forensic anthropologist they had reached who was fascinated by the find and delighted to come down and examine the body in the chest.</p><p>Before the group broke up, Sean said, \u201cDavid and I are going to do some planning tomorrow. We\u2019ll call you when we\u2019re set with the decision on when to leave.\u201d</p><p>Bill and Zoe decided to roam Duval and Barry went back to his room. Jay asked Vanessa if she wanted a walk down the street; he was tired and leaving. To Sean\u2019s surprise, she stood and agreed.</p> <p>David and Sean stood, as well. Vanessa came around the table and gave David a kiss on the cheek. As she neared him, Sean saw that her eyes were sharp.</p><p>He stopped her and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that look for?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and said softly, \u201cYou think that I set this up. You still say that I brought Jay in all the time, and I saw how suspicious you were earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it, Vanessa. They were all here already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it?\u201d she inquired, her voice rising.</p><p>\u201cAdmit that...it all looks suspicious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever it looks like, it isn\u2019t. And I guess I want more faith. You stared at me tonight as if you were suddenly certain that I\u2019d planned the entire thing, our old crew taking over your project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, it\u2019s strange, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk,\u201d he said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. Not tonight. I need some time. We can talk tomorrow. Tonight, well, tonight I need to take a look at everything that\u2019s gone on.\u201d</p><p>He was hurt, angry\u2014and baffled, still feeling himself to be the injured party. He was doing exactly what she wanted.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t ready to throw it all over, and he wasn\u2019t thinking about the project.</p><p>Vanessa...</p> <p>The ego in him wanted to shrug and tell her that it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to talk about anything intimate, if those were her feelings.</p><p>But he realized, too, that she must certainly have her own pride.</p><p>And he knew, too, that \u201ctalking tomorrow\u201d was better than a real break. He\u2019d give her the space she needed.</p><p>He was startled as she walked on by him, waiting for Jay. She was truly upset.</p><p>Jay gave David a cheery good-night and shook Sean\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat a day, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, what a day.\u201d</p><p>Jay hesitated. \u201cHonest to God, this wasn\u2019t any kind of a setup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that it was,\u201d Sean told him.</p><p>Jay shrugged. \u201cI saw the way that you looked at Vanessa.\u201d</p><p>Lord. Were his suspicions\u2014his thoughts\u2014really that apparent? Even Jay had read his expression.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken,\u201d he lied.</p><p>Jay shrugged.</p><p>Vanessa was waiting for Jay on the sidewalk. He joined her, and Sean watched as they started north on Duval together.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was interesting,\u201d David commented.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014doesn\u2019t it feel a bit weird to you? First Vanessa shows up, pitching her slant to our project, then Jay. Then we think that it might make for a really interesting piece and put out a call to find the rest of the crew, and almost instantaneously they all show up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no,\u201d David said. He shrugged. \u201cMaybe they did all hear about it and contacted one another. I don\u2019t find it all that odd if they did. Trust me, I know. Events can change your life and haunt you day after day.\u201d</p><p>David Beckett had once stood accused of murder\u2014if not by law, in the minds of many people who had heard what had happened.</p><p>Sean let out a long breath.</p><p>Back then, he and David had been friends. Close friends. And he hadn\u2019t known what to believe. All he had known was that he had wanted to get away from home, and for years and years he had traveled, staying mainly away from home. Knowing the truth about the past\u2014even though he had not been directly involved, like David\u2014had changed everything.</p><p>And it was true, too, that he had returned home in all haste when he had heard that David Beckett was here. And then he had been glad as hell, because he had found that David and his sister had become a duo.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t care one way or another,\u201d David said. \u201cHere\u2019s what I care about\u2014Liam doing background checks on them, finding out their work schedules\u2014or with the young ones, their graduation status\u2014whether they\u2019ve really got the credentials they claim, all that. Parking tickets are okay\u2014I get enough of those myself. But nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. You know that you\u2019re more intrigued by this now than ever,\u201d David said. \u201cAnd hell, Vanessa Loren is like a damned dousing rod. One day, a pendant. The next, a chest. With a body. Let\u2019s face it, we\u2019re in it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Marty? And Jamie? Are they in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were in from the beginning, too. I say we get Liam on the background checks and plan to head out soon. I\u2019ll warn Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>She had just walked away.</p><p>Clarinda came out to finish clearing the table. \u201cHey, this is really getting wild, huh? All these people\u2014and a body!\u201d She shivered, placing empty glasses on her tray.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very old body, Clarinda,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Katie came out the back door and strode toward them. Sean and David had taken their chairs again\u2014at opposite ends of the long oblong table.</p><p>\u201cWell. I guess you two scared everyone off,\u201d she said. She frowned and looked at Sean. \u201cWhere\u2019s Vanessa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe went to her room.\u201d</p><p>Katie\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing. She chose to go home,\u201d he said, irritated. He didn\u2019t feel like explaining himself to his sister. Somewhere in his mind, he recognized the double standard\u2014he had felt like a pit bull when he had first found out about David and Katie.</p><p>\u201cYou must have done something,\u201d Katie persisted.</p><p>He stood. \u201cKatie, you and Jamie set me up with her\u2014under false pretenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mention that she was a friend of yours\u2014you had Jamie call me in to talk to her, and you knew all along what she wanted,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, let\u2019s not have a sibling war here,\u201d David protested.</p><p>\u201cNo war,\u201d Sean said. \u201cAll I know is that Key West is suddenly hosting a whole crew of people\u2014who, incidentally, were all on that island when the murders happened\u2014and it all started with your friend, Miss Loren, and now she\u2019s mad at me for what I consider a perfectly reasonable question about how it all came to happen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably accused her\u2014basically\u2014of being a liar,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cI did not,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen you implied that she was a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you related to here?\u201d Sean demanded.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I\u2019m going to go and get some sleep. We\u2019ll talk in the morning. Oh\u2014Katie, sign the bill to me, will you, please. And make sure that you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of Clarinda. Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he managed, waving to the two of them.</p><p>As he walked the back way to his house, he wondered if he had been unreasonable.</p><p>But there was something everyone did seem to be forgetting.</p><p>Those six people had been on Haunt Island when Georgia and Travis had been murdered, decapitated and chopped into pieces.</p><p>Filming a horror movie that had turned very real.</p><p>Jay was cheerful as they walked. \u201cYou seem to have some kind of a regular homing beacon for finding things on that wreck. Wonder who the body is. Think it could really be Dona Isabella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t care right now. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d They had reached Vanessa\u2019s inn. She gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk tomorrow, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, kid. Sleep well.\u201d He started away and turned back. \u201cHey, Nessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, kid. As a friend, you know.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cLove you, too. Good night.\u201d</p><p>Upstairs, Vanessa was glad that her room was on Duval, and that she could hear the faint sounds of music, laughter and conversation. She turned on the lights, wondering if she had done the right thing or not. She cared about Sean, she was attracted to him in a way she might never have been to anyone before, but he had looked at her with suspicion when all four of the others had walked in.</p><p>And he had been the one to say that he wanted them all!</p><p>Even if they hadn\u2019t known each other long, they had known each other well, and it was disturbing to her to know someone that well and not be trusted by him.</p><p>They might have gotten together too heavily and too fast. They needed the night apart.</p><p>And she was right; she was not apologizing for what she didn\u2019t do.</p><p>That didn\u2019t change the fact that her room seemed impersonal and cold. Nor that she felt incredibly alone, which didn\u2019t usually happen to her. Normally, she liked her own company. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t change things, and she was exhausted. She changed into a giant T-shirt, scrubbed her face and teeth and headed to bed.</p><p>She turned off the lights and tried to listen to the revelry from Duval Street.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough.</p> <p>She turned on MTV\u2014music and videos. The two just might lull her to sleep.</p><p>She did fall asleep. And for a while, it was wonderful.</p><p>And then the dreams came again.</p><p>There was Georgia Dare\u2019s head and sand.</p><p>Georgia\u2019s lips were moving. She was talking.</p> <p>\u201cOh, please! Listen. If you\u2019ll just pay attention! You know now that I wasn\u2019t being silly and hysterical and there were no jokes being played!\u201d</p><p>One of Georgia\u2019s disarticulated arms moved in the sand; she waved her well-manicured fingers in the air.</p><p>\u201cListen...pay attention, oh, please, Vanessa, you can do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Travis begged, his mouth moving. He moaned as his head rolled in the sand.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do!\u201d Vanessa protested.</p><p>She felt as if she were in a wind tunnel then, being sucked away from them. She was out on the sea, and then she was in the water, and she had a camera in her hand.</p> <p>The figurehead appeared before her. It seemed that it, too, had arms, and that the head was real and the entire thing was an animate object\u2014a person.</p><p>She saw the face on it that she had always seen.</p><p>That of Dona Isabella.</p><p>The figurehead was smiling and beckoning to her.</p><p>She protested, speaking, or telling the figurehead how she felt in her mind, she wasn\u2019t even sure.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to find more bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want the truth,\u201d the figurehead said to her.</p><p>\u201cThere should be justice.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly, the image of the face began to change. It morphed, and it seemed that its cheeks struggled to stay cheeks.</p><p>Brows became higher and more arched and changed again.</p><p>The nose and mouth went through transformations.</p><p>The figurehead had changed. It held a different face. But she knew that face, too.</p><p>She had seen it that afternoon. She had seen it on the woman who had tried to talk to her. The pirate woman who had been sitting at the table on the patio.</p><p>The woman who had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cStop, please, stop, you\u2019re being led, you must take care, you don\u2019t understand the innocent!\u201d the figurehead told her.</p><p>Then she thought she heard a terrible laughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to help you! I have helped you. Listen...listen...listen...your friends have pleaded with you, you must listen. Once you didn\u2019t pay heed.\u201d</p><p>The face on the figurehead began to morph again.</p><p>Then she saw...</p><p>The horrible, mummified, darkened, distorted and decaying face of the woman they had found in the sunken chest.</p><p>10</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s another one,\u201d David said. He tapped on his computer screen. \u201cAnother incident that might prove that what happened to the film crew wasn\u2019t so bizarre. Bring up the Herald, December twentieth, last year.\u201d</p><p>Sean typed in the key words and waited for Google to bring up the paper and the date, and glanced over at David. They were working together at the Beckett mansion, computers at opposite ends of the table, maps and charts spread out between them.</p><p>\u201cAny particular page?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFront page. You can\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s eyes quickly scanned the bold-type headline. \u201cModern-Day Pirates at Work? Islanders Claim Devil\u2019s Play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see,\u201d Sean said. He read the article aloud.</p><p>\u201cOn December tenth, a charter boat, the Delphi, captained by Tom Essling, an experienced seaman, USN, disappeared while on route to the Bahamas. Captain Essling left Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on December tenth with his first mate and wife of thirty years, Sharon Biddle Essling, and four passengers for a cruise down the Keys due south and southwest, with stops at Islamorada and Key West. As per plan, Captain Essling docked in Key West for a two-day stay, and began his journey east and across the Straits of Florida, an area that\u2019s also known as the New Bahama Channel, the body of water that connects the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic and continues eastward, beginning the Gulf Stream and separating Florida and the Keys from the Bahamas, the Great Bahama and Little Bahama banks. The length of the straits extends for more than three hundred miles and enters through the region known as the Bermuda Triangle. The width is 60 miles in areas and approximately 100 in others. The greatest depth of the channel has been sounded at 6,000 feet.</p><p>\u201cOn December 18, all contact with the charter boat was lost soon after the Delphi sailed due east of Miami, approaching the southern Bahamas. Relatives were concerned because the captain excused himself in the middle of a phone call and never came back on. None aboard answered cell phones, and radio contact could not be made. American Coast Guard and Bahamian officials began a search that continued with daybreak. Many speculate that the Bermuda Triangle has taken more victims, while others rationalize that traffic has been heavy through the straits since the beginning of the passage of Spanish treasure fleets, has always been heavy, naturally accounting for more misfortune. Until early in the nineteenth century, the region was constantly plagued by pirates, a rising concern among seamen and carriers as piracy resurges in contemporary times, even within such heavily traveled waters.\u201d</p><p>Sean glanced at the sea chart spread out on the table between them. He stood, glancing at his computer, checking latitude and longitude on the charter ship\u2019s last known location.</p><p>\u201cThis disappearance\u2014last contact with the boat was right about where the Mad Miller\u2019s pirate ship went down, right where the pirates met their demise,\u201d Sean told David.</p><p>\u201cInteresting. I thought I had another, but they caught the culprits. Idiots pirated another charter boat and threw the crew overboard. They wanted to hijack it to Cuba. They didn\u2019t realize it needed gas,\u201d David said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Bartholomew mused, twirling a lock of ghostly hair\u2014great hair at that\u2014as he leaned against the table, \u201cthere is something to be said for the Bermuda Triangle. Maybe it emits...evil,\u201d he suggested. \u201cEvil creates a vortex, and men become mad in that vortex, and begin to rip one another asunder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBartholomew, Mad Miller\u2019s ship went down in a storm,\u201d Sean reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI believe that something happens in that area,\u201d David said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s evil oozing out of the earth. There is a scientific explanation.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew studied his fingers and said dryly, \u201cYes, of course. And I\u2019m here\u2014through the effects of man\u2019s science. You see me, some people don\u2019t. Ah! There\u2019s a genetic trait that allows certain eyes to pick out roving ectoplasm in the air!\u201d</p><p>Sean sat back in chair, nearly grinning. \u201cBartholomew, you may have something there. It is possible that some people are born with something within their genes that we haven\u2019t discovered as yet.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew threw his hands into the air. \u201cSomething that can be developed? Such as a talent? My friend, ye of little faith, who could not see or hear me for the longest time? Ah, trust is something that cannot be touched, either, and you needed proof rather than trust your own sister for a very long time. Everything is not science, indeed, it is not, my ever wary and doubting friend. Take faith\u2014faith is belief in the unseen. If you have any kind of faith, you already believe in the unseen. We all believe in good\u2014and trust me, I believe in the evil that lies in the hearts of mankind! Anyway, here\u2019s what throws me. I knew Kitty Cutlass, and I knew Mad Miller, and yes, Mad Miller turned to piracy, but the legend that has come down about him is pure bunk\u2014which I\u2019ve told you. If he slaughtered men in the water and murdered Dona Isabella in a rage, it would be a surprise to me. And Kitty! The most naive harlot I ever did come across!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaive harlots can be jealous and vengeful,\u201d Sean commented.</p><p>\u201cTrue, maybe,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cYou saw the chest\u2014tell me something, Bartholomew. Was that Dona Isabella? You may not have known her as an acquaintance or even a friend, but you saw her around town,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWe did not socialize,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cI spent my time with the English and Americans, while Dona Isabella was the elite of the remaining Spanish society. But yes, I saw her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Bartholomew shuddered. \u201cI didn\u2019t stare into the chest, my good fellow! That was a horrendous sight, what was once life...so heinously destroyed and mangled and...ghastly! And if I had stared and stared, the way that the decay had set in and the bones had mummified and the fabric of the clothing had clotted with blood and ooze...I\u2019d not have recognized my own dear mother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard any more from Jaden and Ted?\u201d David asked Sean. \u201cWhen is the forensic anthropologist due?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater today, I believe,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI talked to Ted earlier\u2014a Dr. Tara Aislinn is due in with her colleague, Dr. Latham. I believe they\u2019re planning on bringing the body back to a lab in Gainesville. They have the facilities for all the testing they want to do. They\u2019re extremely excited, they can find out about dental hygiene, diet, health, parasites\u2014all manner of information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw today\u2019s paper?\u201d he asked Sean.</p><p>Sean nodded.</p><p>Neither of them had accepted an interview, and to Sean\u2019s knowledge, neither had Katie, Jay or Vanessa. But it had been apparent yesterday that they had made a discovery, and there was an article stating that local divers had found a historical artifact and the object was under investigation now.</p><p>That afternoon, one of them would take an interview so that the concept that they were \u201ctreasure hunting\u201d would not be taken out of context.</p><p>David\u2019s cell phone rang and he picked it up. He listened for a moment and looked at Sean, nodding.</p><p>He hung up.</p><p>\u201cThat was Liam. They checked out\u2014the film crew, that is. The two grad students, Bill and Jake. And Barry Melkie has worked for several major motion-picture companies, and Zoe, though not as well-known, has certainly had an excellent employment record. There\u2019s not so much as a night in jail, a dismissed charge or a single mark.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re just seeking truth,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>Sean started to speak, but he could have sworn that he heard Bartholomew mutter, \u201cDumb ass!\u201d just beneath his breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>\u201cPardon?\u201d Bartholomew said innocently.</p><p>\u201cYou just called me a dumb ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I? I didn\u2019t mean to speak aloud, which, sadly, in most cases, with most people, I actually don\u2019t,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>Sean rose and approached Bartholomew. \u201cIs it possible you could go haunt someone else for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. There seems nothing I can do about the fact that you\u2014behave like a dumb ass.\u201d</p> <p>Sean let out a groan of aggravation. \u201cBecause?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat young woman did nothing to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, excuse me. Are you missing the fact that two people were heinously killed?\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew looked away. \u201cYes, there is that. But you know that she had nothing to do with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do I know that? Maybe she was the murderer, maybe Jay is a maniacal killer\u2014maybe one of the others,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cThey were there,\u201d David agreed.</p> <p>\u201cBut do you really believe that bringing them all in was some kind of a setup?\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cIf so, you are certainly thinking and behaving as\u2014a dumb ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBartholomew\u2014\u201d Sean began.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, fine! Remember, my friends, you may need me. But for now, I\u2019ll go haunt someone else!\u201d Bartholomew responded, aggravated. Shoulders high, posture proud, he strode through the room\u2014and through the front door.</p><p>\u201cThey check out,\u201d David said to Sean, when Bartholomew was gone. \u201cSo what do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo boats,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWhich is what we\u2019ve always planned, Conch Fritter and Jamie\u2019s Claddagh. Jamie can captain his own boat, and he\u2019s a hell of a dive master. Katie and you with Jamie, and I\u2019ll take Ted and Jaden, and we\u2019ll bring Marty along, as long as he\u2019s still interested, and, of course, Liam. Four of us on each boat. We\u2019ll split up the six from the original trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that they were involved in a conspiracy\u2014all of them\u2014to kill their leading couple and leave them outrageously staged in the sand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But two people died. Somebody killed them.\u201d</p><p>David shook his head. \u201cThere have been a lot of disappearances and bad things happening out in that area\u2014we\u2019ve just dug up reports of several that occurred in the last couple of years. And it\u2019s not like there\u2019s one bad guy out there. There are probably a lot of less than honest people plying a pirating trade in the straits. Drug runners, people who smuggle cargo, taking them for whatever they might have, to get them into the United States. Whoever committed the crimes may be long gone, killing people in the streets of Venezuela for all we know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThose two weren\u2019t just murdered,\u201d Sean argued. \u201cThey were displayed. They were displayed in a way that played into the movie being made.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cAs if someone didn\u2019t want the movie made? God knows\u2014but whatever did or didn\u2019t happen, I think we need to keep the original six split up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d David said. \u201cSo when do you want to head out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDay after tomorrow. I want to revise the original shooting schedule and make sure that we have both boats stocked. And\u2014\u201d he hesitated and shrugged \u201c\u2014I want to spend some time at the shooting range with Liam\u2014it\u2019s been a long time since I shot at something with anything other than a camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think we\u2019ll come across trouble?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cI really want to be prepared\u2014hell, in the last few years, from what we\u2019ve seen, too many charters and pleasure boats have been lost. Even without what happened with the film crew, I think it might have been a nice wake-up call to be ready\u2014for anything,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>His cell started ringing. He picked it up. Liam was on the line.</p><p>\u201cIs David with you?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cPut the phone on speaker, will you, please?\u201d</p><p>He did so.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if this means anything or not,\u201d Liam said. \u201cBut I have a report on my desk about another boat that has disappeared\u2014with all four aboard. She\u2019s called the Happy-Me. She\u2019s a thirty-footer that can sleep six, top-of-the-line radio, sonar, all that. She was owned by a retired couple, Jenny and Mark Houghton, who were traveling with another couple, Dale and Gabby Johnson. They were headed out for a couple of weeks, stopping different places. They had notified the Bahamian authorities that they\u2019d be visiting a few different ports in the Bahamas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have they been missing?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cA couple of days,\u201d Liam told him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still the possibility that they\u2019re fine, that they had trouble, that they\u2019re on an island, waiting for a search party,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the possibility. But the couples\u2019 children have been calling every law-enforcement agency in the area. One of the daughters says she knows that her parents are dead. They never failed to check in,\u201d Liam told them.</p><p>\u201cAre there search parties out there?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Liam said. \u201cCoast Guard, Bahamians, volunteer rescue societies. But there\u2019s been no sight of the boat or any survivors. Of course, it might have no connection with Haunt Island as well, but Haunt Island was on their agenda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Liam,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWe were just reading about another disappearance in the area. A boat called the Delphi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Delphi went missing a year ago,\u201d Liam said. \u201cSo, two years ago, the film crew is attacked. Last year around the same time, a boat goes missing. And now another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere have been other boats that have vanished,\u201d David pointed out.</p><p>\u201cRight. But these two went down somewhere near Haunt Island,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cIf this one is down\u2014we don\u2019t actually know that yet,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>Sean was thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>Sean looked at David. \u201cSo I say that we really have to be prepared for anything and keep our eyes open at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear anything about the body in the chest yet?\u201d Zoe asked Vanessa.</p><p>Vanessa shook her head. She and Zoe were down by Fort Zachary Taylor, cruising through the many booths the vendors had set up near the \u201cpirate\u201d campgrounds.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I believe that the person Jaden contacted is on the way down but is planning on bringing the body back to a lab at the university,\u201d she said. They were at a booth that displayed books\u2014some old rare, and very expensive, and some copies\u2014sea charts and maps. One large map that included the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean ports, Florida and the Bahamas was hung on a supporting beam of the booth. It was large and glass-encased, and Zoe paused, looking at it and shivering. \u201cI think I\u2019m crazy myself!\u201d she said. She followed a path from Key West, up around the islands to Miami, and then across to Bimini. \u201cThat\u2019s it\u2014that\u2019s our route. Look at all the little red crosses on it! Those are all ships that have gone down or disappeared over the last decades\u2014and centuries! I think I\u2019m crazy, wanting to do this. No, I have to do this. I can\u2019t wait to actually sleep again.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa was silent. Yes, she still had to do this, too. But now...she felt a strange numbness. She didn\u2019t date easily; she didn\u2019t fall for people...she wasn\u2019t good at accepting a casual drink. She had never gone out and slept with a man on a first, second, or even third date. But she had felt something about Sean, as if there were something real and deep that made intimacy heady and natural, and something that should have...</p><p>Should have been allowed to mature into more. She felt ridiculously empty and alone, and something inside her ached, and she still felt that she had to hold the distance, because it was wrong not to be trusted, and worse to want someone so badly that she might not care....</p><p>She realized she was staring blankly at the chart, lost in her thoughts, which had nothing to do with shipwrecks, when she heard her name called.</p><p>\u201cVanessa!\u201d</p><p>She turned around to see that Katie was hurrying toward her through the crowd.</p><p>Katie\u2014dressed up in pirate attire that appeared authentic and still attractive. She wasn\u2019t dressed as a wench\u2014no heaving bosom above a low-cut shirt and corset\u2014but more like a man, in breeches, buckled boots, a poet\u2019s shirt and frock coat, and an over-the-shoulder holster that carried several pistols and ammunition, while the broad leather belt wrapped around her hips held a sailor\u2019s cutlass.</p><p>Vanessa laughed, seeing her. \u201cWow! You look great. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you. Hey, Zoe, how are you?\u201d she asked, acknowledging Zoe.</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks. And you do look great. I costume people, and I couldn\u2019t have done better,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>Katie rolled her eyes. \u201cThis is Pirates in Paradise. You have avid historians around here. Vanessa, Marty sent me out to ask you to come and be a part of the program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cKatie, I don\u2019t know anything about what they\u2019re doing, I\u2019d be a bump on the log, and it would just be...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be silly, Vanessa!\u201d Zoe said, enthused. \u201cCome on, you\u2019ve played a monster, a corpse and...and a body a zillion times. Why not find out about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Katie drew her along. Vanessa did her best to lag. She liked being behind a camera. She loved being the eye that found the visions.</p><p>But Katie was determined. They came to Marty\u2019s booth, and he greeted her with a huge kiss and was pleased to meet Zoe. \u201cIt\u2019s the trial\u2014just respond as you would if you\u2019d been arrested,\u201d Marty said. \u201cAh, come now, I did tell you girls that I might need some help.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhose trial? If it\u2019s Anne Bonny and Mary Reid, I don\u2019t know enough of the history\u2014\u201d</p><p>Marty shook his head. \u201cLook, everyone knows that a body was found, and everyone knows that Sean and David and crew are about to set off to explore the Mad Miller legend. It\u2019s a mock trial, and you\u2019re going to be Kitty Cutlass\u2014and you just respond however you feel you should. It\u2019s based on the premise that Kitty Cutlass was saved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Katie is a performer\u2014she\u2019d make a far better Kitty Cutlass,\u201d Vanessa argued.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the narrator,\u201d Katie said. \u201cOh, come on, Vanessa. It will be fun. It will take the...well, it will occupy your mind while we all...wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Vanessa began.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, please!\u201d Zoe said. \u201cI\u2019ll help get you all set. Marty, are there costumes somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat\u2014just go down the path there to my friend Sally, the one dressed up as Queen Isabella. She\u2019ll give you everything that you need.\u201d</p><p>Despite her protests, Vanessa soon found herself dressed up as Kitty Cutlass. She was not given a chaste costume like Katie\u2019s. She was in a low-cut blouse with flaring white sleeves, a workaday corset and a billowing skirt and petticoat. Zoe arranged her hair so it was halfway tied high on her head, but with curling blond tendrils around her face.</p> <p>She did not get any kind of holster\u2014she had been stripped of her weapons.</p><p>She got handcuffs.</p><p>A large area of park had been set up for readings and theatrics; there was a modular stage, simple, with a judge\u2019s bench and just a few stark wooden pews, and a box for the defendant. Vanessa was surprised to see Jamie O\u2019Hara dressed up as the judge, sitting behind the bench. Marty himself was the prosecutor, Katie the narrator and, apparently, she didn\u2019t have a defense attorney.</p><p>She was led through the crowd by a couple of Marty\u2019s cronies. She was stunned to see that a full audience had gathered around and that, while they awaited the beginning of the mock might-have-been trial, they were chatting, arguing amiably amongst themselves and giving their opinions. There were avid-eyed children lined up and seated Indian-style before the stage.</p><p>Katie introduced the situation in her little speech, and then explained what might have happened had Kitty Cutlass, a woman who was a known accomplice of Mad Miller and accused of the murder of Dona Isabella, been saved from the sinking of the pirate ship and brought in to face the music\u2014the law!</p><p>Vanessa, rudely cast into the little box on the stage, almost jumped when Marty began his prosecutorial tirade of her horrible crimes.</p> <p>Listening to him, she suddenly found herself ready to enter into the game. She didn\u2019t interrupt him; she waited until he was done and denied everything, assuring him that every shred of evidence he had against her was hearsay, circumstantial and in no way proof of any evil deed she might have performed. She had been guilty of loving Mad Miller, and nothing more. And they were wrong about Mad Miller, too. He had never been a murderer. Rather, he had been a man drawn to the life, eager for the rewards of the trade, but a man without a shred of bloodlust in his body.</p><p>As she spoke, she looked out at the audience at various times, demanding that they give an opinion. It had all been made up, conjured out of thin air, because every single fact that they were bringing forward was nothing more than speculation.</p><p>Jamie O\u2019Hara raged from behind the bench that he would give the prisoner a chance\u2014he would listen to thoughts and recommendations of her peers since the prosecution had failed woefully in bringing forth the burden of proof.</p><p>As she looked out then, Vanessa froze.</p><p>Many men were dressed as pirates. Many women were wenches, ladies and female pirates, and even the children in the crowd were in various stages of fun costume dress.</p><p>But there was one man standing behind the proceedings. He had a rich, full black beard and a headful of curly, almost ink-black hair. He was a tall man, and sturdy and strong. He had been watching from behind a group to the far rear, close to a row of merchants, which ended at a large growth of pines that grew raggedly before giving way to the white sands of the beach.</p><p>Her jaw dropped.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen him with long hair or a beard.</p> <p>But she knew him.</p><p>It was Carlos Roca.</p><p>His eyes, she was certain, met hers across the distance.</p><p>She cried out, ready to run after him.</p><p>But, of course, everyone thought it was part of the theatrics. She nearly shouted his name, but refrained, and when she tried to burst out of the box, Jamie O\u2019Hara thundered his gavel on the bench, and Marty\u2019s friends came rushing up to secure the prisoner in the docket.</p><p>She flushed, angry, feeling ridiculously desperate, and yet...</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to shout his name.</p><p>And...</p><p>He was gone. Where he had stood, there was another man. Another pirate, quite a dandy of a pirate, really. This one had really rich long hair, queued at his nape, and he wore a cocked and sweeping plumed hat. His frock coat was brocade, his stockings and breeches were amazingly authentic. His face was aristocratic and handsome, and he was frowning at her as if she had truly lost her mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat say you?\u201d Jamie O\u2019Hara roared.</p><p>\u201cGuilty! I believed her until she tried to run!\u201d a boy cried from the front row.</p><p>\u201cGuilty! And sentencing for pirates, be they men or women, is that they be hanged from the neck until dead!\u201d Jamie O\u2019Hara roared with glee.</p><p>She felt blank, numb and disturbed. Had she been mistaken? Had she seen Carlos because...</p><p>Had she seen him because of this charade, because she wanted to see him, she had admired and cared about Carlos, and...</p><p>Her jaw fell open. The man who had taken his place seemed to be staring straight into her eyes, as well. He stiffened.</p><p>And seemed to disappear, as if he were fog.</p><p>Her knees felt like rubber. The world around her seemed to be a fog. She was going to pass out!</p><p>Good God! She didn\u2019t pass out. She wasn\u2019t the kind to be afraid of her own shadow, she had faced nightmares and the tricks the mind could play again and again. She wasn\u2019t weak, and she wasn\u2019t going to fall apart.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d she suddenly shouted, remembering all that she could of pirate history.</p><p>To her surprise, everyone went still. The audience was dead silent.</p><p>\u201cI cannot be hanged at this time. I plead my belly!\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant!\u201d someone in the crowd said. And there was laughter, and then applause.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, we shall see! Sentence to be carried out when the condemned is delivered of her child, and so be it!\u201d Jamie announced. His gavel slammed down again, and the charade was over. Marty hugged her and told her she was great, and Katie and Jamie were grinning proudly at her. Audience members greeted them all, asking pirate questions, and she stood and listened and spoke, and wasn\u2019t sure what she said, or what she heard.</p><p>She was searching the audience.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see Carlos Roca.</p><p>Nor did she see the \u201cpirate\u201d who had seemed to disappear into thin air.</p><p>Eventually, she made it back to Queen Isabella\u2019s costume booth and the little makeshift tent where she had changed. Back in her clothing, she came out to find that Katie and Zoe were deep in conversation with Marty.</p><p>\u201cI just talked to my brother. He and David spent a lot of the day working, looking up all kinds of things and planning what they want to do. It\u2019s a go with a schedule\u2014the crews are all set. We\u2019ll be heading out on two boats, Sean\u2019s and my uncle Jamie\u2019s. Jamie is coming, of course, captaining his boat. Marty is coming, Liam and I, and Sean and David and Ted and Jaden. And your six, Vanessa. You and Jay, Barry, Jake, Zoe and Bill. We\u2019ll set out the day after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Vanessa!\u201d Zoe said, throwing her arms around her. \u201cThis is wonderful. Maybe...maybe we\u2019ll figure things out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost likely we won\u2019t,\u201d Vanessa said. She didn\u2019t know why she was now being disparaging. This might well be their only hope, considering the fact that no one else was still actively investigating and they all knew that there were still dozens of unanswered mysteries. \u201cI mean, we can only go through the motions, and try to remember every little thing, and see if there isn\u2019t something, some clue somewhere, that everyone has missed. And still, we may not find what we\u2019re looking for...or even the kind of peace and closure it seems that we\u2019re all hoping to find somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we may!\u201d Zoe argued. \u201cI\u2019m so excited. I\u2019m going\u2014I\u2019m going to go and find Barry and let him know when we\u2019re leaving right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, great,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cAnd I guess you\u2019re in touch with Bill and Jake somehow? Better let them know, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it!\u201d Zoe said happily.</p><p>\u201cAh, for me?\u201d Marty said, his eyes sparkling. \u201cA chance of a lifetime! On the trail of one of the most infamous pirate tales ever!\u201d</p><p>Vanessa tried to smile for him.</p><p>She had come here for this. And now...now she wasn\u2019t sure about anything.</p><p>Katie turned to Vanessa. \u201cSean wanted to speak to you. I told him you were changing and that I\u2019d have you call him.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa nodded. Her heart seemed to take a little leap, and she wanted to kick herself. He probably wanted to give her a list of rules.</p><p>\u201cSure. But, Katie, I\u2019m going to head back to my room for a bit first\u2014too much costume and makeup for me. I need a shower. Oh\u2014thank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank me?\u201d Katie said, laughing. \u201cSee, you are a ham, and you didn\u2019t even know it. You were great.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa shook her head. \u201cNo. Thank you. For influencing David, for introducing me to Jamie\u2014I\u2019m not sure I broached it all right with your brother, but this...well, if anything can be discovered, I think that this is the crew to do it.\u201d</p><p>Katie grinned happily. \u201cSure. And hey, I\u2019m on this adventure, too!\u201d</p><p>Adventure...</p><p>Vanessa wasn\u2019t at all sure she saw it that way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a wave, she headed out of the park, leaving all the pirate booths behind her. As she watched, she searched the crowds. Had she imagined them both?</p><p>Many a big tall man with dark hair might look like Carlos Roca.</p><p>And in the midst of would-be pirates, imagining another pirate...</p> <p>Face it: she wasn\u2019t getting enough sleep.</p><p>It was a long walk back to her room, but Vanessa was almost glad of it. She needed to walk, to stride, to burn more energy.</p><p>She needed to call Sean.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready to do so.</p><p>Reaching Duval and starting toward the north end, she realized that she was looking in shops and bars. She couldn\u2019t shake the belief that she had seen Carlos Roca.</p> <p>But if Carlos was alive, then...</p><p>Did that mean he had murdered the others?</p><p>As she neared her inn, she glanced across the street at a group of \u201cpirates\u201d gathered in front of the Irish bar across the street.</p><p>One relaxed against the door frame, watching the band, listening to the music. He had dark hair. He was the man she had thought had to be Carlos Roca.</p><p>He looked at her. He looked straight at her.</p><p>It was Carlos Roca. It had to be Carlos Roca. It was his face.</p> <p>He turned and disappeared into the bar.</p><p>11</p><p>\u201cCarlos, no! Wait, stay! It\u2019s me, Vanessa!\u201d she cried. She raced across the street. It seemed that pirates had spread across the place, and she tried to excuse herself and wend her way through big frock coats, big hair and bigger hats. She made her way through the bar, searching faces to see Carlos\u2019s once again.</p><p>But she walked all way through to the emergency exit, and he wasn\u2019t there. She burst into the kitchen, only to be shown out. The place was ridiculously crowded, and she realized he might have walked out through the gift shop, slipped through another wall of pirates when she wasn\u2019t looking.</p><p>At last she gave up and walked her way through the pirates once again to the street.</p><p>She walked across, and straight into Sean.</p><p>He was standing in front of her inn, leaning against the wall, as if he had been there for some time. He seemed curious that she had come from the Irish bar, and was probably impatient, as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been calling you,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have thought that you might have been more interested in everything going on. Especially as far as getting ready to head out\u2014with your friends all involved now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Sean, they\u2019re my friends, but not my friends. Jay, yes, I\u2019ve known forever. And I like the others, but I didn\u2019t bring them here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not holding any of it against you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow magnanimous,\u201d she murmured, looking away. She wanted to shout that she thought she had seen Carlos Roca. She might have been wrong. And if she\u2019d seen Carlos, everyone would decide that, since he was alive, he was guilty. Until she saw him, really saw him, she couldn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>What if he was guilty? What if he had seen her, and knew that she had seen him? What if? He had seen her, he had looked straight at her before disappearing.</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d she asked him. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day, and I\u2019d really like to take a shower, if you\u2019ll excuse me. I\u2019ll be ready to work whenever you need anything, but for now...\u201d</p><p>She started to walk by him. He blocked her path. She looked up and was surprised to see that his golden eyes were opened wide and that everything about him was just slightly awkward. \u201cVanessa...I\u2019m not good at this. And I\u2019d like you to understand how things looked.... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She was startled by the apology. It was amazing, coming from him under the circumstances.</p><p>Maybe he just missed the sex. But then again, so did she.</p><p>And still...</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t lie, Sean,\u201d she said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t accuse you of lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, actually you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m sorry. Okay, I\u2019m not good at this...I don\u2019t know what else to say,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ll ask you again, see it from my side.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and smiled slowly. \u201cJust say that you know that I don\u2019t lie, and that you\u2019ll believe in me in the future. That will work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that you don\u2019t lie. I\u2019ll believe you in the future,\u201d he said, his smile broad.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said softly. They stood there for a moment, looking at one another, not quite touching, and yet...</p><p>\u201cI played a pirate about to be hanged today,\u201d she told him. \u201cI really need a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t invited me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on up.\u201d</p><p>Maybe showers were destined to be something special between them. And maybe there was something that was just right, amazing, or the intangible bit of animal magnetism, chemistry, or whatever it was that made one person choose another over others. There was nothing awkward in her room, and there was no pretense between either of them. When she walked into the shower, she knew he was behind her. She turned into his arms, euphoric with the feeling that he was there, hard-bodied, rock-solid, vibrant, hot and real. Thoughts and fears left her mind for excruciating moments as she simply lost herself in the beauty and urgency of touch, running her hands down the wet sleekness of his flesh, his sex, along his spine and buttocks, and feeling the deep thrust and hot persistence of his kiss, his tongue and his hands upon her.</p><p>They made love with the rush of the water and then, still enwrapped and absorbed in one another, they found towels and made their way to the bed. Once there, he started with a kiss again, hovering over her, golden eyes burning into hers, and then that kiss, his mouth on hers, and then moving to her throat, where he paused, feeling the thunder of her pulse, and moved on, sending a streak of lightning through her as he teased a breast and trailed his kisses onward again. His caresses were slow, a touch of agony in the midst of exhilaration and wonder. He touched and teased, drawing to a point of complete intimacy, and she twisted and writhed until her frantic energy and demand brought him back to her, and they locked together in a storm of frenetic energy that brought her to a point of climax after climax, shuddering in his arms.</p><p>He held her close then, murmuring, his kisses tender.</p><p>Eventually, their bodies cooled. Their hearts beat at normal rates, and the ragged sound of their breath was no longer a cacophony in the room.</p><p>He held her against him and then groaned softly. \u201cStrange. I don\u2019t want to get up. I\u2019m starving, and there are things to do, and I don\u2019t ever want to leave this bed.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOf course you do. Eventually, you\u2019d get bored here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the sun froze over,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She stroked his face. \u201cThat was good. That makes up for your rather stilted apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, that was real and heartfelt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could order food to be brought here,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded and turned from her for a moment, staring at the ceiling. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to go over to Ted and Jaden\u2019s workshop\u2014the doctor of forensic anthropology arrived, and she\u2019s been studying the trunk as we found it. She\u2019ll give us what she can before she does all the tests on the body. Anything in the sea that long\u2014even mummified, as the body appears\u2014is very fragile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Vanessa said. She hesitated, wondering why she was so uneasy about the trunk.</p><p>Pandora\u2019s box? If so, it was already open.</p><p>And yet, it hadn\u2019t been something actually evil that she felt, just as if the chest was going to be a catalyst, and she wasn\u2019t sure if she liked what it might cause to come about.</p><p>\u201cDo you not want to come over there with me?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course I want to come,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThen I guess we have to get moving.\u201d He stood, his back to her. \u201cYou know, I think you should get the tail end of your things out of here for good.\u201d</p><p>She rose as well, coming around to look at him. \u201cYou want me to come over because I\u2019ll be safer? Or because you want me there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say both, and that\u2019s pretty obvious,\u201d he said. She smiled.</p><p>She was glad to be invited.</p><p>Ecstatic, actually!</p><p>And it was true that she didn\u2019t want to be here alone. She had horrendous nightmares, she saw figureheads in the water, and on top of that, she kept thinking that she saw Carlos Roca and an unknown pirate who looked at her\u2014and then faded into the air.</p><p>Really. They were going to have to lock her up soon.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cLet\u2019s grab pizza downstairs and then get over to Ted and Jaden\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Tara Aislinn was in her midfifties, an energetic and enthusiastic woman who greeted Sean and Vanessa with real warmth. Her colleague, Ned Latham, was more subdued but apparently just as eager to be there. They had studied the chest and the victim within but hadn\u2019t taken the body from the chest. They had come down in their van and, with permission, of course, would be moving the chest and the body to the lab in Gainesville.</p><p>Liam and David had come and gone, Sean discovered. They were late, of course, really late, but in his mind, that was fine. He hadn\u2019t been in a serious relationship in a long time; he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever been in a relationship where he\u2019d felt so lost and empty when it seemed that it had ended. David and Liam were capable, as were Jaden and Ted, and he knew that he\u2019d never understand half of what the scientists could learn from the body, so everything had gone in the right direction without him.</p><p>\u201cDavid is calling the media and letting them know what it was you brought out of the water,\u201d Jaden told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly is he telling them?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Dr. Aislinn laughed softy. \u201cJust that we have arrived and are taking the chest and the body, and that we believe that the chest is early eighteen hundreds, and that a unique set of circumstances have preserved the body of a woman who died in the early eighteen hundreds, as well. More details will follow after we have conducted out tests.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd what can you really tell us?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cThat she\u2019s not Dona Isabella!\u201d Jaden burst out.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Vanessa said.</p> <p>\u201cCome, come, I\u2019ll show you,\u201d Dr. Aislinn said. \u201cDr. Latham, if you\u2019ll assist me?\u201d</p><p>They walked over to the chest and Latham carefully opened it and offered Dr. Aislinn a set of latex gloves from his pocket. After pulling them on, she reached in and touched the woman\u2019s bodice. \u201cThis is cotton, and if you\u2019ll notice\u2014it\u2019s difficult to see with the staining. If you\u2019ll hold the flashlight up, Dr. Latham?\u2014that\u2019s home sewing. Dr. Latham, the hands if you will? I can\u2019t draw them out\u2014we\u2019d break up the mummy\u2014but you\u2019ll note the nails. They\u2019re chipped and broken, and not the nails of a lady. Whoever this woman was, she didn\u2019t grow up in the lap of luxury. From what I\u2019ve learned about this story, your Dona Isabella was supposedly killed on Haunt Island\u2014or she went down with the ship in the storm. I don\u2019t know who this is, but it\u2019s not a lady of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you date the corpse to a certain age?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cNot without a more comprehensive examination,\u201d Dr. Aislinn said. \u201cBut...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cMy guess? Between twenty and thirty. I\u2019m going to need X-rays of the teeth and skull, the hips\u2014all those things help establish age. However, I think you\u2019ve found a pirate\u2019s wench, perhaps a poor girl traveling as a maid or a servant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hope to be able to give you a great deal more,\u201d Dr. Latham said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re disappointed that it wasn\u2019t a chest of gold doubloons, but this is just an amazing scientific find!\u201d Dr. Aislinn said. She looked at Vanessa. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary. I heard you also discovered the pendant\u2014the exquisite mermaid pendant\u2014that Ted showed me earlier. You\u2019re quite an amazing woman, Miss Loren. You might have missed your calling as a salvage diver or treasure seeker!\u201d</p><p>To Sean\u2019s surprise, Vanessa\u2019s smile seemed forced and her face seemed pale.</p><p>\u201cOh, I rather like what I do,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find these relics?\u201d Dr. Latham asked.</p><p>\u201cBeginner\u2019s luck,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t looking? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Dr. Aislinn said. \u201cYou have made an absolutely amazing discovery here. The mermaid pendant, of course, is beautiful. But the body! We can\u2019t thank you enough. We\u2019re delighted to be doing the research!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait!\u201d Ted said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell them the most gruesome part yet.\u201d He looked at Sean and Vanessa and shook his head. \u201cI mean, we know that the pirates could be violent. And what with the story of Haunt Island, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising.\u201d</p><p>Jaden said, \u201cHorrible, just horrible. But\u2014of course, long over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sean demanded.</p><p>\u201cAt first,\u201d Dr. Aislinn said, \u201cI thought that someone must have cared for this young woman deeply. Most of the time, those who died at sea were wrapped in shrouds\u2014if that!\u2014and sent overboard. This young woman was sealed in a chest. I thought that we\u2019d discover that the cause of death had been consumption or the ravages of some other disease. But look at the neck\u2014that\u2019s not just decayed fabric there, or a shawl or scarf or any other such object. She was strangled. That\u2019s the fabric with which she was strangled. I\u2019m not sure what it is yet. We\u2019ll know when we take a sample.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was murdered,\u201d Vanessa murmured.</p><p>\u201cAs you said,\u201d Sean noted, \u201cviolence was common, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s curious,\u201d Dr. Latham commented.</p><p>\u201cPirates blew one another to bits with cannons. They slashed with swords and cutlasses, and they shot one another with their pistols. It\u2019s unusual that they would have strangled a woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe must have made someone very angry,\u201d Jaden said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be just fascinating to try to discover just who she was!\u201d Dr. Aislinn said. \u201cOf course, I understand all of you are heading out soon to start filming\u2014a most fascinating documentary, I must say! But I\u2019ll be in touch constantly by cell phone, and you can reach me anytime you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sean told her.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Ted said, \u201cwe\u2019re packing her up\u2014the chest and the mummy\u2014in the university van tomorrow morning. Tara and Dr. Latham are leaving then. But Jaden and I are about to take them out for a night on the town, Key West\u2013style. Can you join us?\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t have a chance to reply.</p><p>Vanessa spoke quickly. \u201cOh, thank you, and I hope you\u2019ll forgive me. It\u2019s been a long day, and I didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep last night, I\u2019m afraid. But hey, you guys\u2014take them to O\u2019Hara\u2019s. They\u2019ll have a great time there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Hara\u2019s?\u201d Dr. Aislinn said, grinning and looking at Sean.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my uncle\u2019s place, and you will have a great time,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cSean, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m really exhausted, but you, of course, are more than welcome to join them,\u201d Vanessa said quickly.</p><p>She seldom looked vulnerable; for some reason that night she did. Sean felt a surge of tenderness, wanting to make sure that she was safe and warm and protected at all times.</p><p>\u201cSorry, all, and forgive me, too. These have been really long days. My uncle\u2019s place has good food, reasonable drinks, and my sister is doing karaoke tonight. It\u2019s a bit of a walk down Duval,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I do love walking, and I don\u2019t get down here nearly enough!\u201d Dr. Aislinn said.</p><p>Sean and Vanessa left, thanking them again. As they walked down the street, he took her hand\u2014it was crowded that night. Girls were out in skimpy outfits and wench attire; some men were still in pirate costume while others were in jeans and T-shirts. It was Key West. A little cool that night for anything so simple as body paint, but anything might have been worn along Duval.</p><p>Vanessa was quiet, and she still seemed disturbed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She made a face. \u201cThe body is creepy. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re taking it to Gainesville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really creepy. It\u2019s another mystery. We\u2014you\u2014found a pendant, which did belong to Dona Isabella, at least according to historical sketches. Then, we\u2014you\u2014find a body in a chest, and it proves not to be Dona Isabella. That\u2019s interesting. I don\u2019t remember anything about a maid traveling with her, though, of course, a woman of her stature probably did travel with a servant. Ah, maybe Mad Miller threatened her by killing the maid, and then gave her something of a decent burial. Or, God knows, maybe Kitty Cutlass did the deed.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll have to see what they discover. Both of those doctors seemed fascinated and thrilled, so it was an incredible discovery.\u201d</p><p>She was silent.</p><p>\u201cHey, you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only person who makes incredible finds who seems depressed by their talent. The pendant...well, I can see that as a fluke. But none of that chest was showing above the sand. How in hell did you become so certain there was something there?\u201d</p><p>She paused and stopped walking and stared at him. \u201cYou really want to know? If you make fun of me now, I\u2019ll never forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not make fun of you.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath, her eyes sharp on his. \u201cI keep thinking that I see a figurehead in the water. I dream about it, actually. It\u2019s scary and creepy. It has Dona Isabella\u2019s face.\u201d</p><p>He felt his lips start to twitch and remembered he had promised not to make fun of her.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he managed to say.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe a word,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that!\u201d he protested quickly. He started walking again, eager to get to his home on Elizabeth Street before he somehow managed to lose her once again. \u201cHere\u2019s what I think,\u201d he said, still holding her hand, and swinging their arms easily between them as they walked. \u201cThe story goes that poor Dona Isabella was kidnapped from her transport to Spain by Mad Miller and his pirates. She was forced to Haunt Island and either murdered by Mad Miller or Kitty Cutlass, or still a prisoner\u2014probably one who was raped and abused\u2014when the pirate ship went down in the storm. So you see the face of Dona Isabella because you feel such sympathy for her. And it would be natural that you see the face in the water\u2014as a figurehead\u2014when you are instinctively honing in on something. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsychology 101?\u201d she asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cThe mind can do amazing things,\u201d he told her. \u201cThen, face it, you\u2019ve had horrible nightmares since your friends were murdered on Haunt Island\u2014and you found them. There are all kinds of wonderful defense mechanisms in the mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if the spirit of Dona Isabella is lurking in the water?\u201d Vanessa asked. \u201cOr...worse! What if Mad Miller is a decayed old pirate like Geoffrey Rush in Pirates of the Caribbean?\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>Then he realized that she was serious.</p><p>\u201cI remember one time, when Katie and I were small, and we were at the old cemetery, bringing flowers to the grave of one of my mom\u2019s friends. Katie was acting nervous. My dad told her that the dead were the safest people in the world\u2014that they couldn\u2019t hurt anyone. He told her that she had to learn to be very smart and wary and savvy\u2014it was the living who hurt one another.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOf course. I didn\u2019t think that Mad Miller or Kitty Cutlass rose out of the sea to kill and dismember Georgia and Travis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. It\u2019s sad to say, because I know you liked him, that most probably Carlos Roca was responsible.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to start, and to shudder.</p><p>He set his arm around her and pulled her close. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI just\u2014 I doubt it. All right, I know that there have been horrible serial killers who had neighbors who had sincerely believed they were just nice, quiet people. But I knew Carlos. And I don\u2019t think so\u2014no matter how it looked.\u201d</p><p>They had reached the house and he opened the door, drawing her in. He locked the door and asked, \u201cDo you want something to drink? A shot of...something. Kahl\u00faa and cream, cup of tea, water, cola, soda...?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cHmm. Tea and whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old Irish remedy for anything that ails you,\u201d he said. He walked into the kitchen and put the kettle on.</p><p>As the water boiled, he tried to casually look around the house for Bartholomew. The ghost was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Probably out with his lady in white, Lucinda, the new love of his life.</p><p>Probably still angry with him.</p> <p>That was all right; he didn\u2019t want to be haunted that night.</p><p>The water boiled. Vanessa got out two cups and he procured the tea cups and the whiskey. When both were prepared, he suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s take them up to bed.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>He meant to have a little finesse. Give her a few minutes, watch a bit of a late-night comedy. But they were still too new to one another. Once they had shed their clothing, they made love. He couldn\u2019t bemoan his lack of subtle courtesy, because she was so passionate, so urgent, and completely and erotically seductive. She seemed to come beneath his very skin. It was one thing to feel the ultimate in climax and satiation. Sex was instinct, it was breathing, it happened all the time. But it was something else to feel the wonder when he lay with her after, something else to feel that nothing in the world could ever be so complete, so fulfilling...even so necessary.</p><p>They drank their tea then, cold, and though she kept drifting to sleep at his side, she would awake again and again with a start.</p><p>He found the remote and at long last turned on a late-night talk show. The noise seemed to soothe her.</p> <p>She slept next to him as if he were a bastion against the edge of eternal darkness.</p><p>Waking with Sean was amazing; she had felt his body and warmth throughout the night, and she had slept deeply. She opened her eyes and felt wonderful. He had been on his stomach at an angle, and she had been sleeping against his back. Great back, broad shoulders, long clean lines, bronze flesh. She drew her finger down the length of his spine delicately, waking him immediately.</p><p>He woke well, too. It was all so new and amazing, of course. He turned and took her into his arms, a wicked look in his eyes, and they made love to start the day.</p><p>Afterward, Vanessa headed to Katie\u2019s room to shower and leave Sean in his own space, and once she was dressed, she came downstairs and to the back of the house where he\u2019d set up his office. He was there already, telling her that coffee was poured and that when she was ready, they\u2019d go over the shooting schedule and she could tell him anything that she thought he might have missed.</p><p>Walking into the kitchen while reading the schedule that Sean had printed for her, she stopped, stunned\u2014as if she\u2019d been hit by a brick.</p><p>For a moment\u2014just for a moment\u2014she thought that she saw the pirate again. Tall, lean, dashing, rich black hair, plumed hat, standing thoughtfully by the dining-room window, staring out at the day.</p><p>She saw him in such detail!</p><p>And then he was gone.</p> <p>She blinked. There was nothing there. Sun streaming in played on the dust motes in the air.</p><p>She hurried over to the coffeepot and poured a large cup. She nearly scalded her throat in her hurry to drink it down.</p><p>Now she was seeing things nearly on an hourly basis. And after such a miraculous night of deep and undisturbed sleep.</p><p>Sean walked into the kitchen to pour himself more coffee. He frowned, looking at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You look\u2014scared.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWith you in the room? Never,\u201d she said with a laugh. She walked over and hugged him and drew away quickly. \u201cI had another thought that we might add in on your schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Sean said, smiling. \u201cWhat scene would you add?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJay and me at night, walking down to where we saw nothing. Where I found the bodies the next morning. Very descriptive without being gruesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it. Write it in. Obviously, we\u2019ll film hours that we\u2019ll wind up editing out, but any scene that you think might enhance the project, just tell me.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa lowered her head and smiled. It was amazing that he might have hurt her so much and made her so angry\u2014and that, as far as a working relationship went, he was completely confident and comfortable. He knew what he wanted; he knew where he was going. It occurred to her then that they both wanted the same thing. She hoped they made an excellent documentary that was engrossing and made others think, as well.</p><p>Until that moment, she realized, she\u2019d been thinking of her own agenda.</p><p>The phone rang, causing her to nearly jump out of her skin.</p><p>Sean arched a brow to her. \u201cHey, telephone. It\u2019s a landline\u2014remember those? Granted, we don\u2019t use them much anymore.\u201d He walked over to answer it.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be so jumpy. They would lock her up\u2014before they could even get to the project.</p><p>Sean answered the phone. He frowned and reached into his pocket. \u201cSorry, forgot to plug it in last night.\u201d He glanced at Vanessa and smiled. \u201cI got distracted,\u201d he said.</p><p>Then his smile faded. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d he said.</p><p>He listened again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d he said.</p><p>He hung up and stared thoughtfully at Vanessa.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe body was stolen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading out to meet Liam. I won\u2019t be long. The body was stolen out of the university van. The problem is, no one knows when. They\u2019d packed it up this morning, and Doctors Aislinn and Latham were at a Cracker Barrel in the middle of the state when they decided to check to make sure that the chest wasn\u2019t moving around too much. Well, it wasn\u2019t moving. It was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone stole the body out of the van?\u201d she repeated incredulously.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWho in the hell would want to steal a mummified body?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s my question,\u201d he said. \u201cWho in hell would even know that it was there to be stolen?\u201d</p><p>Liam was in his office, filling out paperwork. He looked up the minute Sean came in and glumly waved toward a chair on the other side of his desk.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Sean asked him.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2014this may be worse than the damned Bermuda Triangle. Most of the time, we can\u2019t even find a stolen car, and then we find them half the time because they have LoJack, but they\u2019re stripped. But this isn\u2019t a car we\u2019re looking for, it\u2019s a chest with a body in it! This is going to be impossible. They don\u2019t know when it happened. They had just left a Cracker Barrel in the center of the state when Dr. Latham decided to check on their cargo. So\u2014they\u2019d stopped for breakfast in Florida City. The van might have been broken into then. It could have happened when they pulled off a few times along the way. So, it might have been stolen anywhere from Key West to Orlando. They believed that their cargo was safe\u2014who tries to steal a corpse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything we can do?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cWe have reports filled out and sent around the state,\u201d Liam said. \u201cThey\u2019ve dusted for fingerprints. The lock was sprung with a pick, but that doesn\u2019t really help any. The door could still be secured, so it doesn\u2019t mean that the chest was stolen later than earlier.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSomeone must have thought it was a treasure chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was an article that ran in the paper this morning\u2014David talked to a reporter last night, and I believe it went around on the wire and on the Internet. The article announced that it was a body that had been found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the thieves weren\u2019t on the Internet, and God knows, they probably didn\u2019t read the newspaper, either,\u201d Liam said. \u201cThe officers here are livid, of course. Keys police tend to be very territorial\u2014they take the theft personally. She was our creepy old body, the way they look at it. They\u2019ll be doing everything they can, searching for anything suspicious. Obviously, you need a reason to stop people and search their trucks or vans, but we\u2019re good and subtle around here\u2014learned a lot from the drug traffic. Someone may just find the chest somewhere\u2014I mean, once they\u2019ve discovered they haven\u2019t any gold, silver or precious gems, they may just abandon the chest.\u201d</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think that the body was stolen on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? By gang members? Like some kind of initiation? If we have a large clan of devil worshipers down here, I don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was gang members or devil worshipers. I think it was someone...I don\u2019t know. Someone involved, somehow,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cAnd recently, two unexplained disappearances,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cWe may be getting into something very bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am a cop. It\u2019s the kind of thing I\u2019m supposed to be doing,\u201d Liam said dryly.</p><p>\u201cAre you set for tomorrow?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cI am\u2014shifts covered for two weeks,\u201d Liam told him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to go for some target practice sometime before tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarget practice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while for me,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cYou are really expecting trouble,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2014now a nearly two-hundred-year-old body has been stolen. Yes, I guess I am expecting trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you still want to proceed?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean hesitated. \u201cI think I feel now more than ever that we have to,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe stealing the body was someone\u2019s idea of a prank. And maybe there is something here that we\u2019re not seeing\u2014but maybe we\u2019re close, and there was something we weren\u2019t meant to discover. I don\u2019t know. Not much makes sense yet. But yes. With what and who we have\u2014hell, yes, we have to move forward now.\u201d</p><p>While Sean was gone, Vanessa continued to study the schedule, adding in notes and suggestions. She liked reviewing his work, and going over all the notes he had made about supplies, lighting and editing in the scenes that would go with the narrative.</p><p>She rose at one point, realizing that they\u2019d had coffee but not breakfast. Now it was nearly lunchtime, and she was hungry.</p> <p>She heard the sound of the air-conditioner kicking on as she walked to the kitchen. It might be late fall, but the day was growing warm. The sun was bright outside, casting the dancing rays of rebounding sunlight into the room to play with dust motes in the air again.</p><p>She froze again.</p><p>He was there again.</p><p>Someone by the window. Someone in pirate attire.</p><p>She nearly screamed. She felt again the weakness of her legs buckling.</p> <p>At first, her mind raced in a somewhat rational direction.</p><p>Carlos. It was Carlos Roca. She had seen him, and he was real, and she was wrong, and Sean was right, and he was guilty of murder, and now he had come for her.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Carlos.</p><p>It was the pirate\u2014the dandy pirate.</p><p>The tall, striking fellow with the sweeping hat and brocade coat. The one she had seen yesterday, and then briefly again just this morning.</p><p>She would blink, and he would go away. He wasn\u2019t real. He was her mind playing tricks.</p> <p>Really no. She was seeing things.</p><p>But she blinked, and this time he remained. She realized that he was staring at her with equal consternation. He jumped up, his eyes locked with hers, and gasped.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d he cried.</p><p>She was hearing things, as well as seeing them. Not just a figurehead through a camera lens. Oh, no, this was much worse. This was a walking, talking pirate ghost.</p><p>In her room.</p><p>She let out a weak scream.</p><p>He let out a weak scream.</p><p>Her mouth worked hard.</p> <p>\u201cMad Miller!\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cGood God, no!\u201d the apparition replied in horror.</p><p>Replied. It was talking to her, the images talked to her now, even when she was awake.</p><p>She fell back against the door, her hand flying to her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not there,\u201d she gasped out.</p><p>\u201cMy God! You can see me!\u201d he cried. \u201cYou can really see me!\u201d</p><p>Her knees were really buckling now. And he seemed to be fading in and out, and she wasn\u2019t sure what she saw, or what she heard.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cA friend, I swear. All right, I\u2019m dead, I\u2019m a ghost\u2014but I\u2019m a friend, honest to God, please don\u2019t scream again!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>So much for being strong. So much for being the kind of woman who just didn\u2019t pass out.</p><p>She slumped against the wall and sank to the floor, entering a sweet world of darkness and silence.</p><p>12</p><p>As he headed back to his house, Sean tried not to dwell on the stolen corpse. He called different suppliers, making sure that everything was set for them to leave in the morning. He had a few calls to make, since they needed everything from diving supplies to film, memory cards, backup equipment and groceries.</p><p>David called to let him know that he and Jamie were at the dock and that things were coming as promised.</p><p>He tried calling Vanessa, but she didn\u2019t pick up.</p><p>She was at his house\u2014locked in.</p><p>But he found himself hurrying. He didn\u2019t know why the theft of the body disturbed him so much. Liam had been right\u2014it had probably been some kind of a prank. Or, God knew, maybe an eccentric collector had decided that he just had to have a mummified murder victim from the early eighteen hundreds.</p><p>Still, as he neared his house, he was almost running. It occurred to him that he\u2019d been gone a long time. Liam had not been able to leave the station then\u2014he\u2019d been tying up his paperwork and transferring his workload to other detectives throughout the day in preparation for taking his vacation time with Sean and David and the crew.</p><p>An hour at the range had been good. He\u2019d always had a clear eye and a steady aim, but since guns weren\u2019t in his workaday world, he hadn\u2019t carried one in a long time.</p><p>The day\u2019s events at the fort and beach would be drawing to a close, but there would be parties, lectures and \u201cpirate\u201d entertainment as the night arrived. Once again, pirates and their consorts would be roaming the streets. At the moment, it was one of the most beautiful times of the day; there was nothing like a Key West sunset. The bright sunlight gave way to a gentle, pale yellow, and the brilliant blue of the sky overhead became a silver-gray. Then the sun started down, and it seemed that the horizon and everything around was shot full with a palette of unbelievable colors, from deep magenta to the most delicate pink, shimmering gold to gentle rose. It was most amazing to watch the sun set over the water, but to Sean, the colors were still visible, and the colors were what created the beauty.</p><p>The brighter shades were just giving way to violet, silver and gray when he reached his house. Once there, he bounded up the walk and fitted his key into the lock, calling Vanessa\u2019s name.</p><p>In the foyer, he paused, calling her name again.</p><p>Vanessa was there. She walked to the foyer from the center of the house and the kitchen and dining-room area.</p><p>She stared at him with immense eyes that seemed to accuse him of the foulest of heinous deeds.</p><p>\u201cSean,\u201d she said.</p><p>He noticed that she had shampooed her hair and that she was wearing a white halter dress that showed off the tan of her skin.</p><p>\u201cAre we going somewhere?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Bon voyage party at O\u2019Hara\u2019s. All of our friends will be joining us,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt will be Katie\u2019s last night for now, so she\u2019s going to be there in case Clarinda needs her. David said as long as we\u2019re all ready and aboard by ten we\u2019ll be fine...oh, and Marty has turned his booth over to his friend for pirate fest\u2014you have been gone awhile. Did you learn anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The police barely know where to start searching for the chest. I went\u2014I went to target practice with Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having guns aboard?\u201d she asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cThink about it. Yes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, we don\u2019t have to leave right away. Come in and sit down and let\u2019s talk for a minute, shall we? Sit, please. Can I get you something? It is your house, of course. Thank goodness, the choices here are much broader than what I have up in my room. Beer? Wine? Soda, soda and whiskey, or whiskey. Rum! That\u2019s right. It\u2019s a pirate drink. Strange, I\u2019ve had this growing affection for a good stiff drink from just about the time I arrived here.\u201d</p><p>She was definitely behaving strangely, and yet she certainly seemed stone-cold sober.</p><p>He followed her to the dining room. He noticed that Bartholomew was there. He was seated at the dining-room table. He looked at Sean with a guilty expression.</p><p>Sean frowned, feeling a sensation of dread.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a beer,\u201d Sean said. \u201cBut I can get it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, let me. Sit,\u201d she said.</p><p>He took a chair at the end of the table. Bartholomew\u2014for once\u2014was silent.</p><p>Vanessa set a beer in front of him. She had taken one for herself, and walked around to take a seat at the other end of the dining-room table.</p><p>\u201cSean, I mentioned to you that I see a figurehead\u2014with Dona Isabella\u2019s face on it\u2014in the water, and it leads me to things beneath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said slowly. Carefully.</p><p>She learned toward him, eyes snapping with light and anger. \u201cYou hypocrite!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me everything is a trick of the mind\u2014when you live with a ghost!\u201d</p><p>He was certain that his jaw fell. Then, of course, he gave himself away by staring at Bartholomew. She saw him! She saw Bartholomew.</p><p>\u201cWhat a jerk!\u201d she told him. \u201cYou might have mentioned your pirate friend to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivateer,\u201d Bartholomew said, but weakly.</p><p>\u201cYou see him,\u201d he said, his voice just as pale.</p><p>\u201cYes, and he nearly gave me a heart attack. You should have told me. When I saw him, I thought that he might have been Mad Miller\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was terribly insulting,\u201d Bartholomew interjected.</p><p>\u201cHow was I supposed to know?\u201d Vanessa snapped to him. She wagged a finger at Sean. \u201cYou should have told me!\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth but no sound came. He cleared his throat and tried again. \u201cYou would have thought that I was crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s great. Instead, I\u2019ve been thinking that I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can see him\u2014clearly?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s far more perceptive than you\u2019ll ever be,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much,\u201d Sean said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou want everything to be black and white,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cYou want science and explanations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is probably a science to everything,\u201d Sean said. He looked at Bartholomew. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t figured it all out yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not\u2014I hope something is left to a\u2014a dimension of faith, or the next world, be it Heaven or Hell,\u201d Bartholomew said earnestly. \u201cGod forbid someone discovers how to force a soul to stay on this earthly plain.\u201d</p><p>Sean looked from Bartholomew to Vanessa. \u201cYou hear him clearly, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly. Actually, we had a lovely discussion this afternoon. He\u2019s been around watching out for me a great deal of the time. I kept feeling as if there were...something. Of course, I didn\u2019t believe in ghosts,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cYou are not all sharing a mental experience, or conjuring the same imaginary friend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vanessa smiled and laughed easily. \u201cNo. Now I know,\u201d she told him. She spoke to him fondly.</p><p>Well.</p><p>\u201cYou...should have told me that you...that you knew there might be some things that were\u2014unexplainable,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cIt would have helped me a lot.\u201d</p> <p>He got up and walked around the table to her, taking her hands. \u201cVanessa...trust me, if I hadn\u2019t thought that...well, seriously, you know...most people can\u2019t see Bartholomew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, I was stunned,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014think we\u2019re at a point where we need to trust one another,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>He kissed her gently on the lips. \u201cYes, but you must understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I do. Just as you really need to understand that I came here not knowing that Jay and the others would show up\u2014and that when you think about it, it\u2019s not odd at all,\u201d she said solemnly.</p> <p>He pulled her to her feet. He smoothed her hair back. \u201cI\u2019ll never doubt you again,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cOh, good God,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cI thought we were going out.\u201d</p><p>They both turned to look at him.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I\u2019m going out.\u201d He looked at them, shook his head and made a tsking sound. \u201cI shall see you when you get there.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa wound her arms around Sean\u2019s neck and kissed him. A few minutes later, he told her huskily that if they were going to leave, they needed to go. And they did.</p><p>O\u2019Hara\u2019s was insane that night, inside. People had heard about the excitement of finding a pendant from the ill-fated Santa Geneva that had once graced the neck of Dona Isabella, and then the discovery of a body in a chest\u2014and the theft of the body in the trunk. For a while, as everyone arrived, they stayed inside, but when they had all gathered at last, Jamie suggested the patio, a private area in the back, and they all agreed.</p> <p>Everyone in their group who would be heading out the following day was there.</p><p>Clarinda was doing her first night as a karaoke hostess, and despite her innate shyness, she was doing very well.</p><p>They could hear the singers and the music faintly, and the night was typically beautiful, not really cool but not hot.</p><p>Vanessa sipped a Guinness, enjoying the taste and leaned back against Sean, oddly relaxed. She\u2019d seen a ghost.</p><p>And the ghost had proved to be real, or a real mass hallucination. Apparently, Bartholomew had actually been Katie\u2019s ghost and helped out in David\u2019s time of trouble; though Liam wasn\u2019t really in on actually seeing and conversing with the ghost, he knew there was something.</p><p>And as crazy as it sounded, she wasn\u2019t frightened anymore\u2014she was in awe. It was actually something of a dream come true, actually conversing with someone who had lived almost two centuries ago. He had told her his own sad story, which had connected bizarrely with David\u2019s, and then he had told her that somehow, he knew it just wasn\u2019t right for him to leave yet\u2014follow the light to wherever it might bring him\u2014because he felt he was still needed on Earth. Which was really fine now, because after years and years and years, he had finally met the lady in white, his Lucinda, who had been a lonely figure walking up and down Duval and haunting the cemetery for years\u2014afraid to reach out to others. Bartholomew had no explanation as to why some people had a sense of something, and some actually saw ghosts. Some saw particular ghosts and not others and, of course, there were plenty of ghosts to be seen! The streets of Key West were often riddled with ghosts; after all, people had been dying there forever.</p><p>Bartholomew hadn\u2019t come to O\u2019Hara\u2019s with them; he was determined to join the film project, and so he would spend the night with his beautiful Lucinda.</p><p>Vanessa was leaning against Sean. They sat at one of the benches horse-style and it was easy and comfortable to lean against his back.</p> <p>Sean and David had spent some time delineating duties for each member of the crew and assigning boats. Then Sean lifted his beer. \u201cTo success\u2014and safety!\u201d he said.</p><p>They all toasted.</p><p>The conversation turned to the chest Vanessa had discovered\u2014and the stolen mummified body.</p><p>\u201cWhat if,\u201d Jay said, thinking as he went, \u201cwhat if...what if it was Dona Isabella? The anthropologist might have been wrong. Maybe they dressed her up in peasant garb. Maybe she broke free herself, and was going to come after everyone in...revenge for what happened to her?\u201d he asked, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cJay!\u201d Vanessa snapped. \u201cThat\u2019s...ridiculous. Mummies don\u2019t come to life, and why would Dona Isabella want revenge on anyone living? You\u2019re talking as if you\u2019re plotting out another horror movie, and we\u2019re doing a documentary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be a great and creepy premise,\u201d Barry said.</p><p>\u201cA sequel!\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>Vanessa glared at her. \u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be a sequel\u2014there was never really a movie. Therefore, you can\u2019t have a sequel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, actually...\u201d Jay said.</p><p>Vanessa felt her muscles tighten up with tension. It had been a nice night\u2014thus far. Sipping Guinness, munching on O\u2019Hara\u2019s specials such as Shillelagh Sticks\u2014rolled and baked corned beef in pastry\u2014and Tam O Shanters\u2014something like sliders. Such a nice night. She\u2019d been so amazed\u2014and pleased\u2014about Bartholomew. She\u2019d been so happy to be with Sean. And now...</p><p>\u201cJay, what are you talking about?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He flushed, and lifted his hands uneasily. \u201cI\u2019ve had a call from a rep with a national distributor. He thinks we have a surefire hit\u2014especially with everything else that went on.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa sat up, staring at Jay. \u201cJay\u2014our lead actors were murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad things have happened before and movies have still come out and been very successful\u2014and it was really a wonderful chance for fans to say goodbye,\u201d Jay said, defending himself.</p><p>\u201cWhen the leads were murdered?\u201d Vanessa asked icily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure somewhere along the line, yes...but think of the real things out there! Poor Heather O\u2019Rourke of Poltergeist died very young\u2014and they\u2019ve used her scenes in tacky advertisements! When they filmed the Twilight Movie years ago, a star and two children were killed, and it aired. People said goodbye to Bruce Lee, Brandon Lee, Heath Ledger and many more actors when their movies aired after their deaths.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa felt Sean holding her back, but she stood anyway, walking over to Jay. \u201cThat would be the height of bad taste, and I put my money into that film, too, and I won\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great for you\u2014you\u2019ve hit jobs that pay well. I need to make some money, Nessa,\u201d Jay pleaded.</p><p>\u201cJay, it\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Sean stepped into it then. \u201cWell, the surviving members of your crew are here, Jay. Why don\u2019t you find out how they all feel?\u201d</p><p>Bill spoke up first. \u201cAll right, I was more or less a lowly production assistant on the shoot. But...I liked Georgia and Travis. And they have family living now. Family\u2014who might be hurt.\u201d</p><p>Barry cleared his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I feel. Georgia wanted to be a star. And she survived in the movie. She might be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Georgia was sweet. Dumb, but sweet,\u201d Zoe said. \u201cBut Travis...Travis was a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe!\u201d Bill gasped, horrified.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry\u2014it\u2019s horrible that he died the way he did, yes. But was he a nice guy? No!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy money was in it, Jay,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cAnd I say no.\u201d</p><p>Jay inhaled and stared at her. He exhaled and took a long sip of his beer, and looked at her again. \u201cWhat if we find out what happened?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe all came here. We heard about Sean and David and their project, and we all came here. Doesn\u2019t that mean something? We all care, we were all horrified. Vanessa, I own the majority share\u2014fifty-one percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slimy basta\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cWait, please!\u201d Jay said. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we can discover on this documentary project. And then, if there\u2019s really a story to be told about what happened to us, it would only be right to release the movie that we filmed.\u201d</p><p>Sean leaned forward. \u201cJay, if you want to throw threats around, you\u2019ll note that David and I own this particular project.\u201d</p><p>Jay\u2019s jaw fell. He hadn\u2019t thought that he might get kicked off the new project.</p><p>Sean smiled pleasantly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t draw up any contracts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not threatening anyone. I\u2019m just...I\u2019m just mentioning facts,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>\u201cAnd so am I,\u201d Sean told him politely.</p><p>Jay looked at Vanessa pleadingly. \u201cWill you think about it when this project is done?\u201d</p><p>The conversation had been bouncing between them with everyone there staring at them. She didn\u2019t want to get into a huge fight with Jay that would naturally begin to involve all the others. The whole project could become an antagonistic disaster by the morning. She didn\u2019t want any hostility on the trip or involved with the filming.</p><p>For a moment, Vanessa felt the silence that fell among the group.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens on this trip. If we find out something new about what happened, if there is a prayer of solving the murders, then I\u2019ll think about it. But if we find nothing at all and their deaths remain mysteries, Jay\u2014please. Let\u2019s shelve it.\u201d</p><p>Jay looked at her, then looked away. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise,\u201d Vanessa insisted.</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d he said dourly.</p><p>There was a silence again. Then Katie stood, raising her glass. \u201cHere\u2019s to great camaraderie and a wonderful work experience. Here\u2019s to tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>Again, glasses clinked, and they all toasted one another. The joy of the evening had faded, though, and soon, one by one, they were taking leave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As they walked home, Sean told Vanessa, \u201cYou know, I can fire his ass now, if you want.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and flashed a smile. \u201cNo, Jay is good. And he promised, and he is my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your broke friend, it sounds like. And in a way, he has a point. I agree with you, but he has a point. Here\u2019s the thing that I\u2019ll say in his defense\u2014he didn\u2019t try to cash in on a tragedy. He had invested his life\u2019s savings into that movie. He didn\u2019t rush out and try to give it to anyone right after it happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s right?\u201d Vanessa protested.</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cMe? I don\u2019t think I could do it\u2014not when both of the victims were so young, not when they had family still living.\u201d He slipped his arm around her. \u201cTitanic the musical played on Broadway. I thought that a musical based on such a horrific event was in terrible taste. Katie wanted to see it, so the family went. And it was actually something that I wound up enjoying, that gave a certain honorable memorial to many of the people involved. Much better than the movie!\u201d he told her, smiling gently.</p><p>\u201cSean\u2014this was a slasher flick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Anyway, let\u2019s get home and get some sleep, shall we?\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t get to sleep right away. They made love again, and it still seemed so amazing and new, and there was still so much they had to learn about one another. When she drifted to sleep, she was warm, secure and comfortable, and being with him seemed like a bastion against the world. It was ridiculous to think that she could actually fall in love with anyone so quickly, and yet, in the time they had known one another, she had come to realize that now she couldn\u2019t imagine a time without him. She had let her pride stand in the way once\u2014he had been a jerk\u2014but he had proven himself, coming to her, and she thought that finding the right relationship had been as hard in the past for him as it had been for her, none of which mattered, because when she was with him, feeling his warmth and the vibrant pulse of his heart so near to hers, she didn\u2019t envision the future beyond tomorrow.</p> <p>She should have slept as sweetly and deeply as she had the night before.</p><p>But the dreams came again, though they took a different twist.</p><p>She was back at O\u2019Hara\u2019s, sitting on the bench at the patio, and Jay was speaking again.</p><p>\u201cWhat if the mummy came to, and broke out...\u201d</p><p>Then she was walking down Duval, and it was odd, because no one was there.</p><p>She was alone.</p> <p>And then she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>The streets were filled with pirates. She told herself that naturally the pirates were there. Pirates in Paradise was happening, and there were events to the last minute, and even then, some people stayed and dressed up, loath to get back to reality.</p><p>But they weren\u2019t real pirates.</p><p>They were ghosts.</p><p>Ghosts existed.</p><p>They walked along, some in a hurry, some strolling together. Some talked and teased with wenches, some joked with one another. They strode, they swaggered, and one limped on a peg leg. They paid her no heed.</p><p>Then she heard carriage wheels. They seemed to come slowly, ominously. The sky blackened and a chill fog sprang out from the sea. The mist whirled in shades of gray, and the clip-clop of the horse\u2019s hooves came ever more slowly.</p><p>She turned, aware that the carriage was coming to a halt, and that it was coming to a halt near her.</p> <p>Or perhaps it was coming for her.</p><p>A woman, an elegant woman in silk and high fashion, stepped from the carriage, her every movement in slow motion. She looked straight at Vanessa, and Vanessa knew her. She knew the mermaid pendant the woman wore around her neck, and she knew the face\u2014she had seen it on a figurehead that had led her to strange discoveries beneath the sea.</p><p>\u201cYou must help. You must listen. You must find the truth,\u201d the woman said. She smiled at Vanessa, and produced a hatbox. She opened the hatbox, and lifted something.</p><p>It was Georgia Dare\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cVanessa!\u201d Georgia cried to her pathetically.</p><p>Dona Isabella let the head fall back into the hatbox. She looked around her. Vanessa did the same. The pirates on the street were changing. They seemed to turn into black ooze. They cried out and screamed, and seemed as if they were moving in a black, malevolent mass toward the woman and the carriage.</p><p>The wind began to whip up. Vanessa knew that she had to wake up; the evil pirates were coming for Dona Isabella, but she was in their way.</p><p>\u201cHere, here!\u201d came a cry.</p><p>She turned.</p><p>And it was the mummy. The mummy from the pirate\u2019s chest.</p><p>The face was leathered and dark and decayed. The hands were bony, with dead skin stretched out over them far too tightly. The clothing was stained and ripped, and the eye sockets were empty, nothing but black stygian pits.</p><p>\u201cCome, come!\u201d the mummy cried.</p><p>Her jaw fell open in horror. The bony fingers were coming closer and closer to her.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Someone was behind her. She felt the presence and spun around in terror.</p><p>The street was still dark; the carriage bearing Dona Isabella away was beginning to move. It was still in slow motion, yet it was trying so hard to pick up speed. Dona Isabella was running now from the wrath of the pirates. She sought escape, as she hadn\u2019t found in the past.</p><p>Vanessa thought that she should have leaped into the carriage.</p><p>Because now she was caught between the mummy...</p><p>And the living, breathing man behind her.</p><p>Carlos Roca. She stared at him.</p><p>\u201cAm I seeing you? Are you dead? Did you kill them, Carlos, did you have us all fooled?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He stood there, frozen in silence.</p><p>\u201cI am alive,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd I am innocent.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the black shadows. \u201cCome with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, come quickly!\u201d the mummy begged.</p><p>She spun around. The mummy was there. So pathetic. So sad.</p><p>\u201cVanessa, you know me!\u201d Carlos said.</p><p>Yes, she knew him, and he was there. Was he really alive, and was he running, too, or was he part of a black swirling mass of ooze and evil that was winding slowly down the street, ready to devour her...?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d the mummy said.</p><p>And the dead, leathered fingers, bones sticking out, nearly touched her.... She screamed.</p><p>And awoke.</p><p>And Sean was with her, holding her in his arms, smoothing back her damp hair, whispering words of assurance.</p><p>She felt the terror of the dream slip away from her, and she felt the strength of his arms. She ceased to shake and she turned him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry...I didn\u2019t think...when I was with you...\u201d</p><p>He touched her face. \u201cI\u2019m not the monster in the dream, right?\u201d</p><p>She laughed shakily. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s much better to have nightmares with me than without me, right? Although,\u201d he admitted, \u201cthese nightmares seem to plague you so cruelly, a therapist might be in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a therapist once,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>He rocked with her in silence for a minute, then said, \u201cThen somehow, we have to find the truth. Catch a killer. And put the past to rest.\u201d</p><p>The morning was a whirlwind of activity. There were dozens of air tanks that needed to be stowed, and though David had overseen the loading of the boats with grocery supplies, ice, film, memory cards, cords, computer needs, batteries, flashlights, flares and every conceivable necessity, they all had their personal gear to stow, as well.</p><p>Jamie had David and Katie, Liam, Barry and Bill and Jake aboard the Claddagh. Sean had Vanessa, Jay, Ted and Jaden, Marty and Zoe aboard the Conch Fritter.</p><p>And Bartholomew, of course.</p><p>The boats would follow one another through the day, hugging the Intracoastal up to Jewfish Creek, and heading out to the Atlantic at Key Largo. David and Barry would take turns with the camera during the day on the Claddagh while Sean, Jay, and Vanessa would trade off on the Conch Fritter. They would drop anchor that night southwest of Miami, and in the morning start filming at the first reef where the previous crew had begun their offshore work. Sean felt that he had had enough of Pirate\u2019s Cut and that they should start filming in other areas. He had the Marty footage and the footage that Vanessa and Jay had already shot at Pirate Cut.</p><p>The first day was easy; it was getting to know the boat, the equipment and one another.</p><p>The boats met up at about 4:30 p.m., and tied on together\u2014Sean wanted footage taken on board that night. He and David took turns in front of the camera, describing the voyage and their plans, and the film taken would be edited in with the shots they\u2019d taken of leaving port that morning.</p><p>Jamie O\u2019Hara had a portable barbecue grill that extended from the boat\u2019s hull, and that night, the Claddagh\u2019s crew was responsible for dinner. While Jamie and David barbecued, Katie and Bill prepared salads and green beans. Barry kept the camera going as they cooked and the group settled around to eat.</p><p>He took beautiful shots as the sun fell.</p><p>Vanessa enjoyed dinner; they all piled aboard the hull and deck of the Claddagh for their first major meal together, and she sat back with Katie, enjoying the light sway of the boat in the still night. That morning, the nightmare had all but faded away, and yet she was left to wonder if she had really seen Carlos Roca, if her dreams weren\u2019t some kind of a warning.</p><p>And if she should tell Sean that she had seen him.</p><p>But everyone seemed to think that he had to be guilty. If she told anyone else at all\u2014even Sean\u2014and he appeared again somewhere, someone might shoot to kill.</p><p>She had to have imagined Carlos.</p><p>Except that she hadn\u2019t imagined a dead pirate.</p><p>Odd, but true.</p><p>And Bartholomew was there. He hadn\u2019t come across to the Claddagh. He stood at the bow of the Conch Fritter, just looking out over the sea. She wondered what he was thinking or feeling, or if\u2014without flesh and substance\u2014he couldn\u2019t feel, and yet she thought that he could. She decided then that the soul had to consist of both intelligence and the heart, and it was rather sad, because pain could then remain long after death. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marty played his guitar and sang on deck, and Katie joined him. Bill and Zoe engaged in a game of chess. Jamie, Liam, David and Sean closed themselves away in the cabin of the Claddagh for about an hour, planning and charting, and when they were through, Vanessa was ready to return to the Conch Fritter and head into bed.</p><p>It was nice to sleep with the captain, she decided. The master cabin very comfortable. Marty was given the convertible couch in the main cabin, while Ted and Jaden were portside and Jay and Zoe were in the slim bunks on the starboard side.</p><p>Vanessa went to bed by herself because Sean took first watch on the Conch Fritter while Liam took first watch on the Claddagh.</p> <p>Watches were in four-hour shifts. As she curled comfortably into the master cabin\u2019s bed, Vanessa realized that the schedule for watch duty included everyone\u2014but someone in Sean\u2019s group would be on one of the decks at all times.</p><p>Did he distrust someone he had hired on? she wondered. Or was he always that careful and wary?</p><p>She thought about Jay wanting to sell their film; a major distributor could mean really decent money, and she knew that he needed the money\u2014and that he still had dreams of producing and directing his own films.</p><p>It just disturbed her.</p><p>She stared at the small table by the bed that held a reading lamp. She noticed that there was a newspaper there, beneath one of Sean\u2019s books. She glanced at the book and noticed that it was on the numerous wrecks in the area. She pulled out the newspaper beneath it.</p> <p>The headline on the page read, \u201cMissing!\u201d</p><p>Beneath it was a picture of two couples standing on a dock. They wore white casual boating clothes and hats, and they were all older, attractive people with happy smiles.</p><p>Sean had told her about more disappearances. Disappearances in the area. She scanned the article. Both Mark Houghton and Dale Johnson were experienced captains. They loved traveling together, and though they had made more distant trips, they were sun and warm-water people and set off every couple of months together to tour a part of the Caribbean.</p><p>They enjoyed camping on Haunt Island.</p><p>She winced and set the article down. She\u2019d been so busy lately that she hadn\u2019t seen anything on the disappearance. Of course Sean had known about it.</p><p>There had always been disappearances. But now this. A year after the Delphi.</p> <p>Two years after the murders of Travis and Georgia.</p><p>She closed her eyes and tried to sleep.</p><p>A while later, she felt Sean crawling in beside her, and she sidled up against the warmth of his naked length and lay awake for a very long time.</p><p>The sun was rising in the east.</p><p>It was almost morning, almost time for their first dive as a complete crew.</p><p>She wondered if she was afraid.</p><p>No, Vanessa thought. She wasn\u2019t afraid of diving. She wasn\u2019t afraid of figureheads in the water, or even the absurdity of her dreams.</p><p>She was afraid of reaching Haunt Island.</p> <p>13</p><p>The dive that morning was beautiful and uneventful. They went down to several of the wrecks on the Shipwreck Trail in Biscayne National Park. Reefs were beautiful, and though modern technology helped, ships and boats still had to be wary. The Alicia, built in Scotland, had slammed into the Ajax reef and the outline of the ship hosted a massive ecosystem of brilliantly colored fish, rays, nurse sharks, groupers and more. It was a beautiful wreck to film, and it was one that Vanessa had filmed before. They had shot scenes of their characters off enjoying themselves before they had stumbled upon the legend and the horror of the ghosts who had come back to tear them to shreds.</p><p>That afternoon, they docked at Dinner Key in Miami, since they would begin the voyage across the straits\u2014in the Bermuda Triangle\u2014to reach Haunt Island in the morning. They had a late lunch at Monty\u2019s on the water, and after, Sean announced that they were all welcome to do what they wished as long as they were aboard and ready to leave again first thing in the morning.</p><p>Vanessa was surprised when Sean suggested that she and Katie and whoever else wanted to should explore the area, go to a club, do something enjoyable.</p><p>He didn\u2019t tell her what he had planned. She decided to ask him point-blank\u2014they were supposed to be trusting one another.</p><p>\u201cSo? Where are you going, what are you up to?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>Sean hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m off to see a Coast Guard friend of Liam\u2019s,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI should come,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s told us that they didn\u2019t get anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you seeing him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m hoping to trigger something. Spend the afternoon and evening with Zoe and Katie\u2014and whoever you wish. Jamie won\u2019t leave his boat, and Marty has determined that he\u2019s going to keep watch over the Conch Fritter. Ted and Jaden have some friends to see. So...Katie will stick with you like glue,\u201d he said.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be careful here, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to be careful everywhere,\u201d he assured her. \u201cJust stay in public places, and call me if anything disturbs you at all. At all\u2014okay?\u201d</p><p>As the others left one by one, Jay told Vanessa, \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to hear any more of your ideas.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cThere\u2019s a beautiful little park just north of here, and it has great views of the bay and bridges and downtown Miami. I\u2019d like to take some footage of you there, talking about the time we spent in Miami, and how this had been Georgia\u2019s destination the night she\u2014died.\u201d</p><p>She started to protest. Katie was at her side. \u201cActually, it doesn\u2019t sound like a terrible idea,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can grab a cab and get there while it\u2019s still daylight. And it\u2019s not the Keys, but it\u2019s a beautiful day, and it should be fine footage. I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Katie assured her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll come,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Barry, Ted\u2014Bill. What are you doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a theater up the street,\u201d Bill said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d take in a movie\u2014okay, and do some barhopping in Coconut Grove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarry?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThe barhopping sounded good to me, too.\u201d</p><p>Jake told them, \u201cI\u2019ll come with you. I guess we need two cabs, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo big deal, it\u2019s right down the street,\u201d Jay told them.</p><p>They left the restaurant and easily hailed cabs.</p><p>The park was beautiful. There were wide-open spaces, and areas for volleyball, little pavilions for picnics and separations that were composed of overgrown trees and rich foliage. Beautiful bougainvillea crawled over the pavilions, and majestic oaks vied with palms. They were on a deepwater channel, but the view of the water was spectacular, and as they arrived, the colorful lights of downtown Miami were just beginning to grace the skyscrapers in the distance.</p><p>Jay found the perfect place for her to stand. She was on a small mound with bougainvillea and the richness of the foliage to her left as she faced him while a view of the water, the bridge and downtown were just over her shoulder.</p><p>Jay set her up where he wanted her and gave her directions. She told him that they hadn\u2019t come up with any kind of a script and he told her just to talk. She\u2019d seen Sean do it, easily and naturally, and she tried to emulate what he did. Actually, it was easy. She just talked.</p><p>\u201cOne more time,\u201d Jay told her. \u201cAnd...action.\u201d</p><p>She started to talk.</p><p>She looked at Zoe, who smiled at her with a thumbs-up gesture. Katie nodded, as well.</p><p>The sun was setting in the west, away from the water. The sky was beautiful and the night was balmy. She looked toward the foliage near the entry of the park, and she fell silent.</p><p>There he was.</p><p>He was in jeans, a T-shirt and a windbreaker. His hair was long, but he had shaved the beard.</p><p>Carlos Roca.</p><p>He stood on the path, watching her.</p><p>He beckoned to her.</p><p>But then he saw the others start to stare at Vanessa in her sudden, still silence, and twist to see what had caused her reaction.</p><p>He turned his back and moved quickly down the path to the right, into the concealment of the rich foliage.</p><p>\u201cVanessa, I just wanted one more take!\u201d Jay said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa ignored him.</p><p>And ran after Carlos Roca.</p><p>They met Andy Jimena at the yacht club where the Coast Guardsman kept a membership. It was beautiful, on the bay, and afforded a view of a host of sailboats and pleasure craft. Jimena was an experienced officer who had been with the patrol boat asked in by the Bahamian government. He was fifty, graying and still as sturdy as a rock.</p><p>He and his crew had arrived on the island late in the afternoon after the heads and arms of the murder victims had been found onshore.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much I need to tell you all about the way the sea and the sand can hide evidence, or how deep the channel can be in places and how wind and weather can wreck anything on the sand. I\u2019m telling you, here were the problems\u2014the sand on the beach by the victims was dead dry. There were no prints. No footprints whatsoever. Obviously, someone put those bodies there. We found some smashed bracken nearby and further inland, so I\u2019m assuming that Travis was murdered earlier, and that the killer was either Carlos Roca and he came back with Georgia, killed her, too, cut up the bodies and escaped in the night, or\u2014there had been someone else on the island, that person had a boat, maybe something really small, got in, killed Travis, pirated Carlos Roca, killed him and the actress, and went back to pose the bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the people on the island?\u201d Sean asked him.</p><p>Jimena shrugged. \u201cThey all looked as if they were shell-shocked. Lewis Sanderson, a Bahamian national and guide, was with them, and he was in control but equally horrified. The tents the film crew slept in were all near one another. Apparently, they\u2019d been working all day, work was over, they were about to split open some champagne, and Georgia came down the beach screaming. Sanderson said that he walked down the beach with Jay Allen and Vanessa Loren and that they found nothing\u2014except that someone had been digging in the sand, right where the heads and arms were found later. We searched the shoreline and the surrounding water. We sent out divers. We never found the rest of the bodies, Carlos Roca or the boat. Bahamian officials questioned everyone on that island, and although it\u2019s a sovereign country, the Bahamians invited the FBI in and their men questioned everyone involved, as well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo what did you believe in the end?\u201d Liam asked him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see...one woman told me that alien monsters lived in the Bermuda Triangle and that they rose from the depths to kill. But that\u2019s not what I believe. I believe that the most logical answer is that Carlos Roca killed the actor\u2014Travis\u2014and came back to camp and behaved normally. Then he left with the girl, killed her, came back and staged the scene\u2014and disappeared himself. It might have been hard for him at first. But there are a lot of places where you can go by boat, and I don\u2019t care how any government or law-enforcement group tries\u2014there are just miles and miles and miles of coast around here, along Florida and in the Caribbean. It\u2019s possible to disappear. And after a few years, he could establish a new name, and eventually, people would forget to look for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the others on the island?\u201d Sean persisted. Jimena frowned, having answered the question once.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working with what was left of that crew now. I\u2019d like to know what you thought of all of them\u2014and if you think it was possible that whoever carried out those murders had an accomplice,\u201d Sean explained.</p><p>Jimena arched his brows. \u201cWell...I suppose it\u2019s possible. It seemed to me that they were all in reach of one another, but...I suppose you\u2019d have to ask them all if they\u2019re really certain they were all together at the times when it occurred. I know that when the investigations took place, no one suspected the survivors of being guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that they weren\u2019t,\u201d David said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWell, no, of course not. All I can tell you is that it was...clean, if that makes sense. There were no mounds of drying blood. There were no footprints, no fingerprints, and there wasn\u2019t a murder weapon to be found, and they had to have been chopped to pieces. We searched for the boat and never found it. If you\u2019re out with that crew and you\u2019re the least bit suspicious, well\u2014I\u2019d keep one hell of a good eye on them.\u201d Solid, experienced man that Jimena was, he shuddered. \u201cThat was one hell of a scene on Haunt Island. One hell of a scene.\u201d</p><p>Soon after, they left Jimena, thanking him for his help.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s something we should start doing,\u201d Sean said as he, David and Liam headed back.</p><p>Liam looked at him sharply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve charted a number of recent disappearances. I think we might want to make another chart and do some comparisons. You\u2019re the only one with the contacts to do it, Liam,\u201d Sean told him.</p><p>\u201cAll right. What am I doing?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>Sean explained.</p><p>\u201cVanessa! Vanessa!\u201d</p> <p>It was natural, of course, that the others ran after her.</p><p>She ignored them at first, running as fast as she could to the path, and then frantically searching the smaller trails among the foliage, hoping against hope that she would find Carlos, that he would be alive and real, and ready to tell her the truth about what had happened\u2014including the fact that he was innocent.</p><p>But Carlos was nowhere to be found, and she was left on a path, frustrated and breathless.</p><p>A twig snapped behind her and she jumped, suddenly aware that the sun had fallen, she was in the midst of bushes\u2014and she was supposed to be careful and wary.</p><p>She spun around.</p><p>It was Jay.</p><p>He was angry.</p><p>He held the camera at his side. It slapped against his leg.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>He took a step toward her. In her life, she had never been afraid of Jay. She reminded herself that she had known him forever. He was the little kid her own age who lived down the street.</p><p>But she stepped back.</p><p>Jay started to lift the camera. She had the bizarre fear that he was about to crash it down on her head.</p><p>But Zoe came running down the path, crashing into Jay\u2019s back. And Jake was right behind Zoe.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jake said, trying to defuse the situation. Apparently, Jake realized that Jay was really angry.</p><p>\u201cVanessa!\u201d Zoe gasped.</p><p>Katie came running from the other direction. She was armed.</p><p>She held a giant stick in her hand.</p><p>\u201cVanessa, oh, thank God!\u201d Katie breathed.</p><p>\u201cWhat in hell were you doing?\u201d Jay demanded, still angry.</p><p>She opened her mouth. She didn\u2019t want to tell anyone about Carlos. Especially not Jay. Not at that moment.</p><p>\u201cI was imagining things,\u201d she said. \u201cSilly. Ridiculous. I\u2014I thought I saw Dona Isabella standing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jay exclaimed.</p><p>Zoe gasped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019m a little unnerved, I guess. Finding a corpse, finding out the corpse was stolen. I\u2019m sorry, guys, really, I saw a lady standing here and thought it was Dona Isabella. Actually, I scared the poor woman half to death. She was a young Cuban woman, strikingly beautiful, just like Dona Isabella,\u201d Vanessa said. The lying was coming too easily, but then, she had thought once that she\u2019d seen Dona Isabella, or she did see her often, her face carved as a figurehead, in her dreams... Maybe reality and imagination were blending so that the line was barely there anymore, this lie was coming so easily.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord, oh, Lord!\u201d Zoe exclaimed, horrified.</p><p>Maybe she should have said that she\u2019d seen Carlos Roca. Jay was staring at her as if she was crazy, and Zoe looked terrified.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, I ruined your brilliant idea. It\u2019s getting really dark, they must be about to send the rangers in to close this place, and I want to get back to the boats,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jay looked at her and then sighed. \u201cWell, the first take was good. And when you took off, I wound up with some fantastic shots of the sky. But get a grip, girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Jay, just give me a break, okay?\u201d Vanessa asked. She cursed herself. Surely she could have thought of a different lie! One that wasn\u2019t\u2014supernatural.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, oh, God!\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s a cute little restaurant bar just down from Dinner Key marina\u2014we\u2019ll go and indulge in big stiff drinks and feel better all the way around!\u201d Jake suggested.</p><p>Vanessa didn\u2019t want a drink. She wanted to be away from all of them. Except for Katie.</p><p>But Katie wanted peace and happiness all the way round. \u201cOne big stiff drink apiece,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a long day tomorrow. One big friendly drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Vanessa will start seeing little green people, aliens in the Bermuda Triangle,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>Jake punched Jay in the arm\u2014not hard, but soundly. \u201cJay, stop!\u201d</p><p>Jay stared at Jake. He had a superior, angry look in his eyes for a moment. The look seemed to say Hey, I\u2019m a director/producer, I\u2019m the boss.</p><p>But Jay wasn\u2019t a producer/director on this shoot.</p><p>He let out a breath suddenly. \u201cJake, thanks\u2014I needed that,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cVanessa, I\u2019m sorry. I was just\u2014 You looked so beautiful there, your hair kind of floating in the breeze, with the lights and the bridge and the foliage. And it was forlorn, it had...oh, well. I\u2019m a great editor. I\u2019ll make it work, and Sean and David will love it.\u201d</p><p>He was Jay again. The Jay she had known forever. She felt silly, being afraid of him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get that drink,\u201d she said.</p><p>They had fun. Vanessa was pleased that she hadn\u2019t insisted she was going back.</p><p>The bar was composed of a small number of tables with palm-frond shelters over them, their waitress was nice, and a single guitarist played and sang.</p><p>When they returned to the boat, Marty was on deck, taking his guard duty very seriously.</p><p>\u201cAhoy, who goes there?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s us\u2014we\u2019re back,\u201d Vanessa told him. She was capable of jumping down to the deck, as were Zoe and Jay, but Marty rose, ever the gentleman, to help them on board.</p><p>\u201cAre the guys back yet, Marty?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>\u201cJaden and Ted came back half an hour ago, and they\u2019re both in bed. Sean, Liam and David are still out, but they\u2019ll be along soon, I warrant,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019ll be right here, right here on deck, if you need me, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Marty,\u201d she told him. \u201cI guess I am calling it a night. Good night, Jay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Vanessa,\u201d Jay said. \u201cI\u2019ll hang out here with Marty a bit, I guess.\u201d He was silent, looking at her. \u201cGood night,\u201d he said again, and then, his back to Marty, he mouthed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and nodded. \u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>In the master\u2019s cabin, she started. Bartholomew was next to the bed, one ghostly buckle-shoe foot upon it as he stood in a Captain Morgan stance. He gave her a start, and she thought again that she was having trouble with reality and fiction or imagination.</p><p>He was a ghost, he was real. As real as a ghost could be. Others saw him.</p><p>He was glaring at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He shook his head, and then wagged a finger at her.</p><p>\u201cI followed you today,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou did? Well, that was...nice of you? Or nosy of you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He sighed, set his foot on the floor and walked to her. It was odd. She could feel him. At first, she had thought that he was cold. A cold breeze.</p><p>But now she thought that he offered a strange warmth. She saw his eyes, and he was concerned. Bartholomew liked her. She was glad.</p><p>She would have liked him.</p><p>\u201cVanessa, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking, but you have to tell Sean the truth,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cWhat truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Carlos Roca was in the park, following you. At least, I think that\u2019s who it is. And he was in Key West, too, at the pirate festivities. He\u2019s been watching you\u2014and following you,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>Vanessa gasped. She sank down on the bed in the cabin, and Bartholomew sank down beside her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s real,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bartholomew said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReal\u2014and alive?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>\u201cThe man was no ghost. Trust me, sadly, I know,\u201d Bartholomew said. He sighed. \u201cObviously, I can tell Sean and David, because they have a right to know. But I really don\u2019t like telling tales when it\u2019s someone else\u2019s business. But people were killed. They might have been killed by Carlos Roca. The man might be stalking you. You might be his next intended victim. Vanessa, this is scary. Terrifying. And I think you\u2019ve suspected that he\u2019s out there. Why haven\u2019t you told Sean?\u201d</p><p>She was about to answer when she heard Jay\u2019s voice, whispering to her from just beyond the door. \u201cVanessa? Is something wrong? Are you all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine, Jay!\u201d she replied in a loud whisper. \u201cFine\u2014I was singing, that\u2019s all. Sorry!\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNow you\u2019re singing! Night, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight!\u201d</p><p>Vanessa waited until she heard him move away and then she whispered to Bartholomew. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it. I really can\u2019t. What if Carlos is trying to reach me because he is innocent, because he needs my help, because he suspects or knows what really happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou still need to tell Sean. Look, there are other lives at stake here,\u201d he reminded her.</p> <p>He touched her cheek with a ghostly hand. She thought that she could feel the warmth and tenderness. \u201cI\u2019m going topside, help old Marty keep watch,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded. He stood and looked at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded, and disappeared through the door.</p><p>Sean was surprised and glad when he arrived back on the boat to find that Vanessa was awake. She stirred when he quietly entered the cabin and stripped down to join her in bed.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said softly.</p> <p>She smiled in the dim light that filtered through from the dock.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t on guard duty,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTed is taking a turn,\u201d he told her. \u201cHad to get Marty to get some sleep,\u201d he added dryly. \u201cDid you have a nice night? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>She studied him carefully. \u201cWe went to a park. Jay took some footage. Let\u2019s see, Bill and Barry went barhopping, but Zoe, Jay, Jake, Katie and I went to a park. Jay had an idea for a scene, and he\u2019s all excited. He thinks you\u2019re going to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably will. He\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>She was still searching out his eyes. He smiled and kissed her lips. She drew the covers more tightly around her and she frowned, trying to understand her sudden reticence with him.</p><p>She let out a deep, pent-up breath. \u201cSean, I saw Carlos Roca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He sat up, staring at her, trying to fathom her eyes in the shadows.</p> <p>\u201cActually, I had just thought that I\u2019d seen Carlos, but...Bartholomew was with us, following us, and he said that it was Carlos Roca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the man has been hiding in Miami,\u201d Sean said, \u201chiding in plain sight.\u201d He started to rise.</p><p>\u201cSean, wait. Where are you going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTo notify the authorities,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut what if he\u2019s in hiding\u2014because he\u2019s innocent?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>\u201cVanessa, if he\u2019s innocent, he\u2019ll be able to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? We both know that he looks guilty as hell, and that innocent men do go to prison,\u201d she argued.</p><p>He stared down at her and shook his head sadly. \u201cVanessa, I have to notify the authorities. If he\u2019s been living here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been living here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? How do you know? Did he accost you?\u201d he asked, coming down beside her again, drawing her to him. \u201cDid he hurt you, did he threaten you, did\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no. I never got close to him. But he was in Key West.\u201d</p><p>He eased away, trying to study her face again. \u201cYou saw him in Key West, and you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that I had seen him. I thought that I might have seen him,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then, God knows what I see anymore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he is following you,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that. And if he is, I swear, I think it\u2019s because he needs help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa, what happened to the trust thing that was supposed to be going on between us?\u201d he asked her softly.</p><p>\u201cI do trust you. I just know how you feel.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have told me now\u2014except that Bartholomew saw him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ghost,\u201d she reminded him dryly.</p><p>He stood. He reached for his jeans again. \u201cSean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa, I\u2019m really sorry. The authorities have to know,\u201d he told her. He walked to the deck. Ted was leaning back on the aft cushions, watching the stars\u2014and the dock.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA Carlos Roca sighting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going up to radio the Coast Guard and let the police know that the man was seen in Miami.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoca?\u201d Ted sat up straight. \u201cDo you think... Wow. Do you think he\u2019ll come after the rest of that crew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTed, we\u2019re traveling the way we are just to make sure we don\u2019t have trouble and that no one can take us by surprise. But if you\u2019re worried about you and Jaden, I can leave you here and you can get a rental car to take home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No,\u201d Ted told him. \u201cWe\u2019re on this. We\u2019ve discussed it. We\u2019re with you all the way. And I\u2019m ready. Trust me. I\u2019m ready.\u201d He showed Sean that he had a speargun down by his side. \u201cI know how to use this faster than a winking eye, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>He radioed the Coast Guard first, and then called the police, and then David. Bartholomew was seated in the companion seat, aware of Ted just below.</p><p>\u201cShe told you,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>Sean nodded.</p><p>Bartholomew looked out at the water, at the various boats docked at the public marina. \u201cYou had to know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be on deck,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>Sean smiled. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He went back down, telling Ted that he\u2019d spell him in three hours.</p><p>He went back to his cabin.</p><p>Vanessa\u2019s eyes were closed. He didn\u2019t think that she was sleeping, but he lay down beside her without touching her.</p><p>A moment later she spoke in the darkness. \u201cYou called the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She was silent, staying on her own side of the bed. He didn\u2019t press the matter. He had done what he had to do, even if he understood that the man had been her friend and she believed in him.</p><p>But everyone on that island had been her friend. She trusted them all.</p><p>And the more he thought about it all, the more he learned, Sean didn\u2019t believe that there had been someone in a boat who had slipped onto the island, killed Travis, gone after Carlos Roca and Georgia, killed Georgia, dismembered two bodies, and escaped with the boat and Carlos Roca, who was now miraculously alive and well.</p><p>That was too suspect.</p><p>Someone in that film crew had been guilty. Someone knew more than they were saying. And with the violence and brutality of the murders, he doubted that it was someone who had killed only once, for a purpose. That someone had killed before, had probably killed again, and would keep killing. It seemed likely that maybe that person was involved in a murder conspiracy with Carlos Roca.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAre you sorry that I called the police\u2014or sorry that you didn\u2019t tell me earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d she said after a moment.</p><p>He rolled toward her and reached for her, pulling her into his arms. \u201cPlease understand. It\u2019s a dangerous world out there,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she told him gravely.</p><p>He nodded. He wasn\u2019t sure what else to say. He kissed her. And then he knew that he\u2019d have to leave soon enough, take his turn on guard duty.</p><p>He made love to her, slowly, tenderly, and she responded, making love in turn, her kisses gentle, her whispers soft...her movement fluid. They winced together at one point\u2014it was a boat, and they were trying to be quiet, and they were, but...</p><p>They lay together afterward, and the boat rocked gently, and he heard a distant bell.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that it will matter that I called the Miami police,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I think he\u2019s already out there. Carlos Roca knows where we\u2019re going, he knows our route, and he knows we\u2019re headed for Haunt Island.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s already on his way.\u201d</p><p>14</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head straight on over, set up camp on the island and work backward from there,\u201d Sean suggested. He and David had met at the breakfast bar near the marina. He opened the book he kept on their schedule with relevant sea charts and maps. \u201cWe\u2019re clear with the Bahamian authorities, and I started doing calculations on what I could find regarding the current at the time, the time of year and the storm\u2014and I think that once the pirate ship started to take on water and break up during the storm, it would have been forced out of the deep water where it was always assumed to have sunk, and that the debris field would stretch out not far from the first drop-off to the southwest of Haunt Island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the logic of getting there, setting up a base and moving on from Haunt Island,\u201d David said. \u201cYou like the split that we have of people? Yesterday was the first time it seemed you didn\u2019t trust everyone with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I don\u2019t trust anyone right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially Carlos Roca? And you really think that Vanessa saw him\u2014and that it was him?\u201d</p><p>Sean shrugged, looking toward the marina. \u201cThere are just so many factors in this situation that make no sense. I\u2019m going to try to get Vanessa to take me through it all again, step by step, from earlier in the afternoon before Georgia Dare came running down the beach. The thing is, I don\u2019t think that one person could have done all this. I think that if Carlos was guilty, he had to have had an accomplice. If he wasn\u2019t guilty, two people had to be involved. Yes, it\u2019s possible that there was a boat at anchor near the island that was hidden from view behind palms or foliage or even the curve of the shoreline. But the thing is\u2014why? Don\u2019t you think that someone must have had a reason\u2014no matter how psychotic\u2014to butcher bodies and leave them on display?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s the outside chance that an islander, dismayed with what they were doing on Haunt Island, lay in wait, and that the murders were because of outrage over making a film based on the massacre,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cYes, there\u2019s an outside chance,\u201d Sean agreed. \u201cI know that Liam ran everything he could on Lew Sanderson, the Bahamian guide who was with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man is squeaky-clean. He\u2019s worked with dignitaries from around the world. He\u2019s a family man, married twenty years, two children, and known for helping out in times of distress, such as doing volunteer road work and clearance after storms. His neighbors love him\u2014he\u2019s an open book, so it seems,\u201d David said. He drummed his fingers on the breakfast table. \u201cI think your idea of matching up people and places over the last two years is a good one, and I know that Liam is on the computer now. It doesn\u2019t seem possible to me that someone could commit such a horrible crime, then go back to a normal life as if nothing ever happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s my point. And I still say...I don\u2019t know, we\u2019re missing something, and I think it has to do with the why, and if we could just figure that out, we\u2019d discover the who.\u201d</p><p>David leaned back, shaking his head. \u201cWell, there are plenty of theories. First, chalk it up to the Bermuda Triangle. Second, it is called Haunt Island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know that a ghost\u2014or even ghosts\u2014didn\u2019t commit those murders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed\u2014I\u2019m just throwing out the theories,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Sean agreed. \u201cThird theory\u2014modern-day pirates, cleverly plotting. They committed gruesome murders and stole a boat and dumped Carlos Roca\u2019s body overboard. But now Carlos Roca has been seen, so that theory is out. Okay, fourth theory. It was Carlos Roca, and he had friends\u2014modern-day pirates\u2014in on it. Fifth theory, Carlos was innocent, and he was hit on the head and is walking around suffering from amnesia. But that\u2019s unlikely, considering the fact that there was an intensive manhunt going on for him after it first happened. Sixth theory\u2014someone on the film crew was in on it with Carlos Roca. That\u2019s why he\u2019s alive and well, it\u2019s how he managed to stay \u2018missing\u2019 all this time, and it\u2019s why he seems to be following us now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re still back to why,\u201d David said. \u201cAll those people had good careers. What would make a professional with no record whatsoever suddenly commit murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something we have to find out,\u201d Sean said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting, though. All of us so close together. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to stay. The film crew\u2014or at least the majority of it\u2014wasn\u2019t expecting anything bad to happen. They were working. They were in a place that was a pristine hangout for boaters. There was no reason to expect anything. And we know damned well that bad things happen. So...\u201d Sean hesitated. \u201cMaybe Katie should stay here, in Miami,\u201d he said. \u201cI asked Ted last night...but he wants in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie won\u2019t go back\u2014you know your sister,\u201d David said. \u201cLook, I really think that we\u2019re dealing with cowards here. The whole company wasn\u2019t killed. Travis was probably taken by surprise. And as far as Carlos and Georgia and the boat...well, any way you look at it, it was one man who was the surprise, or was taken from the back in the dark. We\u2019ll be all right. Marty and Jamie are fierce old pirates, we\u2019ve got Liam, you and me. Once we\u2019re on the island, we\u2019ll have perimeter, with one us on guard at all times, maybe two of us. So here\u2019s the thing. We do it or we don\u2019t. And at this point, I say we do it.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded and called for the check.</p><p>It was a beautiful day for the trip across the straits from Miami to Haunt Island. The boats moved parallel across fairly calm seas, the sky was a pristine blue with only a few puffs of white clouds, and the sun shone down brilliantly throughout the day.</p><p>Seated in the companion seat, Vanessa was glad enough to laze the time away. Marty took the helm several times, and Jay and Sean spent the hours filming the voyage. Sean did a few minutes on the straits, the proximity of the Bahamas to Florida, and how the voyage would have been different in the eighteen hundreds when the wind played such an important role in travel. They pointed out the area where Mad Miller\u2019s pirate ship had supposedly gone down, and Sean gave his calculations on the currents of the time, estimating that the debris field had to extend farther than it had often been presumed.</p> <p>Vanessa was roused for a few moments to do a two-minute take on her research regarding Dona Isabella, Mad Miller and Kitty Cutlass, and how they had followed the same path when they had been making the film.</p><p>She was surprised when Sean filmed Jay, asking him about his feelings on the distribution of the film. Jay sounded sincere when he said that he believed that Georgia and Travis would have wanted it shown\u2014they had been actors, after all\u2014and that he hoped they could find the truth, see that the murderer was punished and be able to distribute the film feeling that they had justice and closure at last.</p><p>Jay\u2019s speech seemed heartfelt.</p><p>From her comfortable perch, a warm poncho around her shoulders against the chill of the wind, Vanessa observed Sean\u2019s questions as he interviewed Zoe and Jake, wanting to know everything that had happened on the island the day that Georgia and Travis had been murdered. Jake had been in charge of props, and he explained that it was easy to understand why they had all dismissed Georgia\u2019s fears\u2014any one of them might have played a prank.</p><p>When she had come screaming down the sand, he had been in his little tent, getting ready to come on out and share the champagne.</p><p>Zoe talked about her love of the period costumes and relayed the story about the afternoon when they\u2019d dressed Vanessa up as a deceased Dona Isabella and gotten a bit carried away, forgetting that she was floating in the ocean in heavy materials. She had last seen Travis that afternoon, when they had filmed the scene in which help had come to the island at last. She, too, had been in her tent, pleased with the film and hoping for great distribution and big notches on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for future work.</p><p>Vanessa noted that Bartholomew was silent, watching their destination before them and listening intently to the interviews. He seemed thoughtful.</p><p>They arrived at the island at just about three that afternoon.</p> <p>She rose and went aft, watching as they came upon Haunt Island and trying to remember when she had been there last. Now it all seemed such a blur. The island appeared lovely and tropical, totally benign in the bright sunlit day. She had thought she would feel something. She had thought that she\u2019d be afraid. She wasn\u2019t. It was just an island.</p><p>Lew Sanderson was standing at the end of the dock, waiting to greet them. He waved a welcome and caught the ties as the Conch Fritter drew in first. Vanessa hopped to the dock and was enveloped in a huge hug by the big man.</p><p>It felt good.</p><p>The Claddagh pulled into the dockage behind the Conch Fritter. Vanessa and Lew caught her ties, and soon everyone was standing on the dock. Lew greeted those he knew and met those he didn\u2019t, and the next two hours were spent setting up camp on the island. There was nothing terribly rustic about camping on the island; the tents were large, the camp bunks were not uncomfortable, they had an impressive barbecue area and a battery-operated coffeemaker, not to mention that showers could be had back at the boats\u2014they were well supplied.</p><p>By the time all the work was done, they were exhausted, and Vanessa thought that they might have forgotten that terrible things had happened here. They had all seemed to work very well together, hauling boxes and bags to the beach, setting up the tents and then, when all was done, digging a pit and starting a fire on the beach. Sean had brought a good supply of torches as well, and as darkness settled, their area of the beach was still aglow. The sea remained calm and easy and the sound of the waves was lulling. She was amazed to enjoy the glow and the company as they worked together and finally sat down to a meal.</p><p>She, Jay, Sean and Barry had taken turns with cameras during the day, documenting their setup. She forgot that Barry was still filming as dinnertime rolled around\u2014Zoe in charge that night, supervising Bill fondly as she barbecued hot dogs and hamburgers and warmed baked beans in a huge pot, and announcing\u2014with a smile for the camera\u2014that she also had spinach so that they could make certain the meal was healthful. They had to keep up their strength, of course.</p><p>Then they sat by the fire, eating. It seemed relaxed. But Vanessa was aware that five people had subtly been changing an important position throughout the day. Guard duty. As Sean took a seat beside her, she saw that his uncle Jamie was standing at the perimeter of the group, watching the dock, the sea and the foliage. He was wearing a windbreaker, and she thought there was a bulge beneath his arm. Jamie was carrying a gun.</p><p>If there was tension within their group, Lew Sanderson didn\u2019t seem to know it. He entertained them with a Bahamian tale about a talking raccoon, and they all laughed, and then he told them another story, his face dark and mysterious as it was caught in the glow of the fire. \u201cThey say we are in the Bermuda Triangle, but long before it had such a name, the people here knew that there was something special about the air. The earth herself is mysterious, and as man has come to learn all about technology and science, he has often forgotten that no matter how far we go, we are dots in the universe, and the universe itself is a mystery. Now, you know, my ancestors who came to these islands came as slaves, and they brought with them a certain magic that belonged to their ancestors. They were open to the world, open to life and death, and aware that all things were not to be seen. Nowadays, we claim that there are underwater forces here. There are the currents, there are the wicked wonders and destruction of the storms and hurricanes that ravage the area. Ah, yes! There are magnetic forces in the earth as well, and they cause confusion, the horizon itself can trick a pilot or a captain. But my people believed that there were gods and devils that dwelled on earth, between the realms of life and death. Forces, for good and for evil. Kiandra, the sea god, once appeared as an ugly thing in need before two sisters. The first spurned him and married a handsome man. The second felt pity, fed him and married him, and went to live with him in his fine kingdom in the sea, bearing many children. The handsome man the sister married proved to be a kishi, an evil devil or demon. She had a child with a human head and a hyena head, and in the end, her husband devoured her. Her spirit remained, evil and bitter, and when Africans came here, many believed that what we call the Bermuda Triangle now was where the first sister\u2019s bitter soul came to dwell and that now, while the sea god Kiandra and his wife seek to save those who travel the sea, the evil sister\u2019s influence can make men crazy, can make the evil dead within the ocean rise and cause all kinds of havoc. There are those who believe that the magnetic forces that cause compasses to spin and ships and planes to go astray are merely the toys of the spirit of the evil sister, and that she teases her prey before she kills, just like a great cat of the sea.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zoe laughed softy, but the sound seemed a little nervous. \u201cLew! You don\u2019t believe that story, do you?\u201d</p><p>Lew smiled. \u201cIt is a tale, it is a legend. All people have tales and legends, and perhaps they come from a grain of truth.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI do believe in good and evil, and they dwell within all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn that, I\u2019ll have more coffee!\u201d Bill said. He stood, and having been sitting next to Zoe, he asked her, \u201cZoe, more coffee? You\u2019re shivering.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI admit to being a little nervous,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019ll protect you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Watching them, Vanessa smiled. She hadn\u2019t realized\u2014though perhaps she should have\u2014that Bill seemed to have a crush on Zoe. Ah, the slightly older woman. She smiled back at Bill. Maybe Zoe had a crush on the younger man, as well. \u201cThanks,\u201d Zoe said. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that!\u201d</p><p>Well, that was good. Zoe would have Bill with her, and she wouldn\u2019t be as nervous, and there was always safety in numbers.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m just calling it a night,\u201d Katie said, yawning. \u201cI imagine we want to start out on a dive pretty early?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cActually, I was thinking just after twelve tomorrow,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI want to take some footage with the original film crew, each person talking a bit more about what they did. And we\u2019ll take a walk down the beach, see what we see. Maybe discern if another boat might have come in during the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a boat had to have come in\u2014I think,\u201d Barry said. He was frowning. \u201cI mean, if a boat didn\u2019t come in, it means...Carlos...or...\u201d He fell silent.</p><p>The group was silent.</p><p>The fire snapped and crackled.</p><p>\u201cOne of us will be on guard all night, every night,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cOne of us?\u201d Jake asked.</p> <p>\u201cOne of us who wasn\u2019t with the original crew,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>There was silence again. \u201cWell, good night, all,\u201d Katie said, and she left the group.</p><p>Sean rose and talked to Marty for a moment. The others began to rise and murmur good-nights and head for their tents.</p><p>Vanessa realized that Marty was going to bed; that Sean was taking the first watch.</p><p>He looked at her and she smiled, nodded and turned to head for their tent. She slipped inside and almost started\u2014she still wasn\u2019t accustomed to Bartholomew showing up all the time.</p><p>\u201cSean is on first watch,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She sat at the foot of her canvas bunk, smiling. \u201cAnd you\u2019re watching over me?\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cHey, I can watch over you at least. And I can make a few things happen. I can push buttons...I can trip people. I\u2019m not bad at manifestations, but...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>\u201cI was listening to that fellow tonight, the Bahamian, Lew Sanderson,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cHe was telling a story,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cAn African legend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. But often...well, gods and goddesses, angels and demons...it\u2019s strange how the world can be so different, and yet so much the same. The Norse had Odin, the Romans, Jupiter, and the Greeks had Zeus, and he was nearly one and the same. The Christian, Jewish and Muslim faiths recognize one God, but he lives in Heaven with the angels, and the angels often have characteristics that line up with the lesser gods in other religions.\u201d</p><p>She was startled at first that he seemed so philosophical, but then she realized that he was seriously troubled by Lew\u2019s story.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the fact that people here thought the bitter sister\u2019s soul haunted the ocean, while many people now believe there\u2019s something eerie about the Bermuda Triangle?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>He nodded. He stared at her. \u201cWell, I told you\u2014the legend that has come down about Mad Miller and Kitty Cutlass...well, there\u2019s just something wrong with it. Mad Miller got his name because another fellow was making fun of him one day and called him mad because he was...well, he was a bit of a fop. He hated blood. And Kitty...Kitty was in love with Mad Miller because he was the best thing that ever came along in her sad and pathetic life. You were making a film about them and Dona Isabella. I was thinking that...well, obviously, I\u2019m still around, and maybe they are, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBartholomew, we\u2019ve all agreed that ghosts couldn\u2019t have committed the murders,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cI mean, thank God...thank God we do have you, because we know what ghosts can and can\u2019t do. And I always believed that ghosts stayed behind because...they were lost, or they needed help, or justice, or they stayed behind to help others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean maybe? You are a ghost!\u201d Vanessa reminded him.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I have all the answers. Hey, I was a decent fellow in life. I\u2019m a damned decent fellow in death. But perhaps, if you were a bastard in life, you stay a bastard in death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep telling me that Mad Miller was basically a prissy-ass pansy,\u201d Vanessa said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, though your language is quite colorful,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m perplexed,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cAh, well, you had best get some sleep. I think you\u2019ll need it in the days to come.\u201d He stood. \u201cI\u2019ll be near,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>She smiled, thanked him and bid him good-night.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he was gone and she lay back and watched the fire dancing on the canvas of the tent that she felt alone and uneasy\u2014and suddenly fully aware of the last time she had lain in a tent on the beach at Haunt Island.</p><p>She remembered dreaming first that Georgia had come to her. She had almost heard the young woman\u2019s voice in the shadows of the night as tears streamed down her cheeks.</p><p>I told you there were monsters.</p><p>Then Georgia\u2019s image had faded, and she must have seen the shadows against the canvas of the tent even in her sleep, because they had seemed like giant monsters rising from the sea, made of seaweed, forming arms, reaching into the sky.</p><p>She sighed and lay awake, and thought that she would do so until Sean\u2019s watch was over.</p><p>But somewhere along the line, she fell asleep, and she didn\u2019t dream. She was vaguely aware of Sean coming into the tent, and she was comfortably aware that she tried to get close to him.</p><p>Then she let out a startled little cry\u2014completely unaware that she had fallen.</p><p>\u201cVanessa!\u201d It was Sean\u2019s voice, and a light suddenly flared in their little tent. She was on the ground between the two cots. They\u2019d been pushed together, but in trying to get too close, she had wedged them apart.</p><p>Sean was stretched out on his own, flashlight in one hand as he smiled and reached for her hand with the other.</p><p>She grimaced ruefully. \u201cI suppose I forgot where we were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>There was a chorus of voices just outside the tent. She scrambled up, glad that she had chosen to sleep in an encompassing flannel gown. She pushed open the flap to the tent just as Katie was nervously opening it.</p><p>\u201cVanessa!\u201d Katie said.</p><p>David was behind her, Liam was behind him, and it seemed that everyone was gathered outside their little tent.</p><p>\u201cYou screamed!\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>Barry cleared his throat. \u201cUm, it didn\u2019t sound like a scream of...um, er, happiness.\u201d</p><p>Sean was behind her then. \u201cSorry, all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell off the cot,\u201d Vanessa said, aware of the flush that was rising to her cheeks like fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bill said, and then started to laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord! You scared us silly,\u201d Zoe said, laughing, as well.</p><p>\u201cNo more even slightly scary stories around the campfire,\u201d Lew Sanderson said, shaking his head. \u201cMay I suggest you pull the cot mattresses down and leave them on the sand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea, Lew, thanks,\u201d Sean said. \u201cForgive us, folks, and get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>The good thing was that everyone seemed to be amused. The negative, of course, was seeing just how on edge they had all been.</p><p>And probably would remain.</p><p>Sean looked down at her, his grin broad. He pulled her into his arms. \u201cLet\u2019s get those mattresses down, huh? We\u2019ll fold up the bunks\u2014I think we\u2019ll wind up with more room.\u201d</p><p>She agreed. It was really late; they were both exhausted, and aware of the thinness of the canvas that separated them from the others.</p><p>And still...</p><p>It was good to be close. Seaweed monsters were just shadows on canvas, and Georgia Dare did not return that night with tears streaming down her face to plague Vanessa\u2019s dreams.</p><p>She thought the morning might be bad as well, with the interviews on the beach. But the sun was shining, the day was bright, and it was hard to imagine that anything horrible had happened in such a beautiful place on such a pristine beach.</p><p>They were surrounded by people.</p><p>That was good.</p><p>Marty and Jamie O\u2019Hara seemed large, wise and imposing, and as she watched the men, naturally taking positions that seemed to guard the group from opposite angles, she realized that they had been asked along from the very beginning because Sean had felt that he needed a security force of those he knew and trusted. They were able seaman, divers and outdoorsmen, but they took no part in any of the filming. They simply watched, interested.</p><p>The only one missing during the morning was Liam. Sean told her he was doing some work on his computer on the boat. He didn\u2019t mention what. But Liam was a police officer, and he had taken leave at a time when the force was short, and she assumed he was keeping in contact with his colleagues, keeping up on events in Key West.</p><p>She was interviewed with Jay, who was matter-of-fact. She spoke about seeing the heads when she had come down the beach. Jay walked to the sand and winced as he told about his disbelief at what they had come upon.</p><p>They were all quiet and somewhat mournful when they finished the segment. They walked back to the encampment in comparative silence. Once there, however, everyone set about the business of a light lunch, since they\u2019d head out to the reefs and an afternoon dive soon after. Zoe and Katie went about setting out the sandwich meats, cheeses, lettuce, tomatoes and condiments, but everyone helped themselves, and everyone picked up after themselves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was decided that Lew, Marty, Ted, Jaden and Zoe would stay behind to keep an eye on the encampment. They would take out Jamie\u2019s boat, the Claddagh, because he had recently purchased new sonar equipment, and Sean and David were eager to see if his calculations might be right, if they might find some of the debris from the pirate ship in shallower water.</p><p>There was an hour of busywork, coming and going from the Conch Fritter and the Claddagh as they transferred dive equipment and supplies from one boat to the other, but in the end, once again, it seemed that they all moved smoothly.</p><p>As the divers and crew climbed aboard, Vanessa noted that Bill looked forlornly back at Zoe, and that Zoe smiled and waved.</p> <p>The romance was blooming.</p><p>Bartholomew seemed torn. At the last minute, however, he came aboard the boat.</p><p>They set out, running slowly due southwest of the island. Sean grew excited at a blip on the screen, but a study of the sea charts showed that it was a World War II ship that had gone down in 1943; at war\u2019s end, it was already becoming part of a growing reef.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Sean said. \u201cUncle Jamie, let\u2019s bring her around. If there is something here, that could be a reason that it has never been found!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, good call\u2014worth an exploration, at least,\u201d David said. \u201cThat happened with the old British ship Renegade in the Bay of Bengal. She had twisted beneath a trawler that went down several hundred years later.\u201d</p> <p>Barry was filming the discussion. \u201cWow, yeah, we might have found something!\u201d</p><p>His excitement was such that he forgot that he was filming.</p><p>\u201cAhem, camera, my friend!\u201d Jay reminded him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s break out the diving gear and the casements for the cameras,\u201d Sean said. \u201cDavid, obviously, you and Katie. Jamie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be aboard, keeping watch on the line and my boat!\u201d Jamie said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou want me on board or in the water?\u201d Jay asked.</p> <p>Sean seemed to hesitate for just a second.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t trust Jay! Vanessa thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Barry asked.</p><p>\u201cBarry, you\u2019re up here, camera ready, with Jamie,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Barry frowned. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the soundman, Barry, and you\u2019re good with a camera, too. Be ready when we come up,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want me?\u201d Bill asked.</p><p>\u201cMake it a threesome with Vanessa and me,\u201d Sean said. \u201cAnd, Jake\u2014you tag on with Katie and David.\u201d</p> <p>He had done it again, Vanessa realized\u2014divided the old group. Jamie would watch Barry. Marty was onshore, along with Ted and Jaden, keeping an eye on Lew and Zoe. Liam\u2014David\u2019s cousin and Sean\u2019s close friend\u2014would be watching Jay. David would have his eye on Jake.</p><p>Barry seemed unhappy but resigned. He brightened while the others got into their gear and asked Jamie if he had any fishing equipment.</p><p>Jamie scowled. \u201cYou\u2019ll be catching the divers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Barry protested. \u201cI\u2019ll be catching fresh fish for dinner!\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head but assured Barry he had fishing equipment, but that Barry needed to remember that he was in charge of filming when the divers surfaced.</p><p>As Vanessa slipped her mask and regulator on and held the mask in place in order to slip over the hull backward, she noticed Bartholomew. He was standing aft, looking back at the island.</p><p>As they descended, the water was clear and beautiful until they reached thirty-three feet and paused to pressurize. Another twenty feet down, and while visibility was still good, the sunlight didn\u2019t penetrate as well.</p><p>Vanessa saw the hull of the old World War II vessel and followed Sean around the portside, aware that Bill was keeping pace with her. Sean had the camera, and Vanessa was glad.</p><p>It was the camera lens that seemed to play tricks on her.</p><p>Sean motioned Bill, instructing him down to the sand where something peculiar seemed to be stuck just beneath the vessel.</p><p>It was while they were occupied that Vanessa saw the figurehead.</p><p>It was just feet in front of the men. She wouldn\u2019t be leaving her partners to follow it, to see if it was real.</p><p>To see if it led her to an old treasure again, a pendant.</p><p>Or a dead body.</p><p>She moved toward it in the water and realized that it was actually within a torn segment of the World War II ship\u2019s hull. No. She wasn\u2019t going to follow\u2014not without her fellow divers knowing that she was entering the wreck.</p><p>She turned, giving a massive kick with her flippers, only to realize that she was already inside the ship. She moved toward the hole through which she had entered, only to discover that the ship seemed to have shifted; the entryway\u2014the exit!\u2014was no more.</p><p>And there was no figurehead to be seen.</p><p>For a split second, she nearly panicked.</p><p>It had all scrambled her mind; she was going ever-so-slightly crazy\u2014and now it was going to trap her and kill her.</p><p>She braced herself, checked her air gauge and her compass, and knew that her partners weren\u2019t far away. She moved in the opposite direction from the false lure of the figurehead with the face of Dona Isabella that didn\u2019t really exist.</p><p>The tear in the giant craft was just ahead of her. As she reached it, she saw that the ship had probably been sunk by a torpedo\u2014there was a giant hole extending beneath its watery graveyard in the sand. And beneath it...</p><p>There was something.</p><p>It looked like a broken shaft of wood. There were clumps and lumps all over it, encrusted in barnacles and sea growth. She reached for it with gloved hands and struggled to pull it free. It gave, but it was heavy.</p><p>She banged against the hull of the ship with her dive knife. A second later, Sean came through water toward her, his eyes showing concern through his mask.</p><p>She\u2019d never let him know that she had nearly panicked, and thought herself trapped!</p><p>She smiled around her regulator and gave him an okay signal. He saw what she had.</p><p>He lifted the camera as Bill moved himself through the water to help her grasp the heavy object. He signed to her, and they carried it between them with Sean following. They made their way to the anchor line and moved up to thirty-three feet, waited and moved up again, following the line.</p><p>The others had seen them. They begin to ascend, as well.</p><p>Jamie was at the dive platform, ready to help them. Vanessa heard Barry say a quick \u201cOh, shit!\u201d And then he had a camera rolling. Bill climbed out first and shed his tank and BCV in order to help Jamie shift the piece from the dive platform to the boat. Katie followed, throwing her flippers on board and hauling herself up. Sean was quickly behind her, and she reached for the camera. Soon, they were aboard, and the piece she had found was lying on the stern section of the deck with the group gathered around to stare at it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a piece of a mast,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>\u201cAnd the clumps?\u201d Barry asked.</p><p>Jamie stared at Barry, grinning, and then looked at Sean. \u201cTed and Jaden will have some work to do tonight. Look at the circular patterns. You\u2019ve found a stash of coins, my friends. Gold and silver, I\u2019d wager. And if I\u2019m right, and if our experts can clean them and give us some dates, I think we\u2019ll find that you\u2019re right, Sean. We\u2019ve come upon a debris field of the pirate ship, if not the pirate ship itself.\u201d</p><p>Sean turned to Vanessa and pulled her close, planting a huge kiss on her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing!\u201d he told her.</p><p>She smiled uneasily.</p><p>She had followed the figurehead again.</p><p>But the figurehead had nearly trapped her that day. Had it been leading her to treasure?</p><p>Or trying to lure her to her death?</p><p>15</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Jaden cried, delighted with the discovery. \u201cTed, look...it\u2019s definitely a cache of coins. I\u2019d say it is a piece of the mast. Maybe the new wreck crushed the old wreck. I think that Sean was right, and that it was a long debris field...and still, what\u2019s left of the pirate hull might be there...it\u2019s possible. It\u2019s certainly not impossible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is really fabulous,\u201d Ted said. \u201cThe last time I saw something like this it was...wow, it was a display from the Atocha.\u201d He turned to Jaden. \u201cWe can get started. We brought supplies. I can\u2019t wait to see the dates on the coins and find out what was on that ship. I can\u2019t wait to see the coins. I think there are definitely some cobs attached there\u2014those are bits taken off the gold bars. They could have been stolen from anyone, French, English, Spanish or Americans!\u201d he said excitedly.</p><p>They were back on the beach and the heavy piece of mast with its encrusted treasure lay in the center of a tarp while they gathered around it and stared.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Zoe breathed, looking at Vanessa. \u201cAnd you found this, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less. I was diving with Sean and Bill,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cYou really missed your calling,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bahamian or International waters?\u201d Jay asked, looking at Lew.</p><p>Lew smiled broadly. \u201cBahamian! Yeah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, there goes the treasure,\u201d Jay said sadly.</p><p>Vanessa stepped back, not really thrilled with the fact that she had once again discovered a find in the water. She couldn\u2019t help but think about Lew\u2019s story\u2014and the things Bartholomew had said.</p><p>But...</p><p>Say there was a ghost that somehow haunted her in the water. First off, why would Dona Isabella, so cruelly taken and murdered, want to cause evil to anyone?</p><p>And second, ghosts didn\u2019t have the power to do what had been done.</p><p>She realized that she had backed out of the group, and she was sorry that Sean was so concerned with safety that they couldn\u2019t possibly have a minute alone. Not alone, maybe. But...with just Katie and David.</p><p>She started as she stood in the back of the group\u2014something had hit her on the back. She spun around and looked down. A tiny pinecone lay there in the sand. She frowned, and then looked up.</p><p>Carlos Roca.</p><p>She stared at him. He was real. Alive\u2014and on the island. She couldn\u2019t begin to fathom how he had followed them so easily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unless, of course, he was good at that kind of thing.</p><p>She looked at him, at the misery in his eyes, at the pleading within them. She saw that his face had grown gaunt; he looked like a man haunted by a million demons.</p><p>He was beckoning to her. He drew a finger to his lips.</p> <p>She\u2019d be crazy to walk to him in the brush. Alone.</p><p>She winced. She wondered if there was such a thing as instinct, and if her belief in the man was actually crazy. After all, he was there.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been killed.</p><p>She turned, thinking she could grab Katie or someone.</p><p>They were all still discussing the coins. Jaden was explaining how many people used something like an electrode to clean such pieces, but they had always had good luck with certain chemical washes and delicate handwork.</p> <p>Everyone was staring at the treasure thoughtfully or looking at Jaden.</p><p>She hesitated and then took another step back, and another. And when no one noticed her moving at that point, she turned and headed into the brush and the pines.</p><p>She had unbuckled her dive knife earlier and shoved it into the pocket of her jeans, and she had her jeans on now....</p><p>Right. Like a dive knife could save her against the maniac who had decapitated and dismembered two people!</p><p>She entered a tree-shaded trail, and felt as if a mist and darkness gathered around her. It did not; it was just that the sun wasn\u2019t penetrating through the pines.</p><p>\u201cCarlos?\u201d she said softly.</p> <p>He stepped out in front of her.</p><p>\u201cJesus Cristo!\u201d he said, and crossed himself. \u201cI have been waiting for you. I have tried so hard to reach you. I need for you to understand.\u201d</p><p>There had been so much commotion over Vanessa\u2019s discovery that they had finally broken to go about different tasks when Sean realized that he didn\u2019t see Vanessa anywhere in the group. He saw Katie laying towels over one of the support ropes for her tent to dry, and he hurried over to her. \u201cKatie! Where\u2019s Vanessa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Well, she was there with the rest of us, listening to Jaden, and then...\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed away and she stared at him with fear in her eyes.</p><p>Sean was afraid that she was going to scream or alert the others. He was terrified that she had been dragged into the pine woods and brush, and he quickly looked around the encampment, searching for members of the original film team.</p><p>Zoe was with Bill, preparing the barbecue. Barry was showing Jay the fish he had caught that afternoon while they\u2019d been diving\u2014two snappers and a medium-size grouper.</p><p>David came over as he searched the group.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cVanessa,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you search.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I\u2019ll find her. Make sure that everyone else stays around here, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. If you\u2019re not back in ten minutes, though, I\u2019ll send Liam and Jamie after you.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded and hurried back toward the pines. There was a trail\u2014small and overgrown, but it had been traveled recently.</p><p>He ran down the trail, afraid to call her name and afraid not to, his heart thundering. He reminded himself that he was certain that the murders had not been committed by one person alone, that whoever had done it had to have had some assistance.</p><p>And they were all back at the beach. All of them except for Vanessa. Lew Sanderson had been there as well, rinsing dive gear with Jamie on the Claddagh. Carlos Roca.</p><p>He was alive. He had been in Key West. He had followed them to Miami.</p><p>And now he was here. On the island.</p><p>And he had Vanessa.</p><p>He drew out the .38 Special he had stuffed under his jacket and kept moving as quietly as he could along the trail. Visions of what might have happened plagued the back of his mind.</p><p>Vanessa. Down on the sand, beautiful blond hair trailing out over it.</p><p>Eyes open with horror...</p><p>He was about to scream out her name, scream with a desperation that would be heard throughout the island.</p><p>He bit back the cry and hurried onward, then paused, listening.</p><p>He heard conversation. Hushed. Two people. Whispering. To his right.</p><p>He broke through the trees and brush then and burst upon the two of them\u2014Vanessa, perfectly fine, standing in the clearing with her arm on Carlos Roca\u2019s shoulder, as if she had been urging him to do something.</p><p>He aimed the .38 Special at Carlos Roca\u2019s head and said flatly, \u201cI spent time at target practice before the trip. At this distance, I can guarantee a clean shot between your eyes. Step away from Vanessa. Now.\u201d</p><p>Roca instantly moved to do so.</p><p>And Vanessa stepped in front of him, lifting a pleading hand to Sean.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, please, Sean! Carlos is innocent. He\u2019s been desperate all this time. He\u2019s been following us\u2014at great risk to himself\u2014determined to keep anything horrible from happening again.\u201d</p><p>Sean grated down on his teeth, tension bracing his muscles. \u201cVanessa, get away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean! You have to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Carlos, we\u2019ll walk back to the encampment. And you can talk to everyone there.\u201d</p><p>Carlos looked at Vanessa.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sean, please, no!\u201d Vanessa begged.</p><p>He eased the gun down, still ready to lift it again if need be. He didn\u2019t want to keep it aimed at Vanessa.</p><p>\u201cPlease! Sean!\u201d Vanessa pleaded again, wincing. \u201cSean\u2014we can\u2019t let anyone know that Carlos is here. He\u2019s watching...watching after us. Sean, listen to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of them,\u201d Carlos said quietly and with dignity. \u201cIt\u2019s one of them. We were barely out at sea when I was attacked at the helm. I never saw who was there. I was struck so hard I went down. I was tossed overboard, and somehow, by the grace of God, the cold woke me up. I was dazed, my head was bleeding. I don\u2019t remember much else. I swam. I found a piece of driftwood and clung to it. I came to on one of the small islands, tended by a fisherman\u2019s wife. Then, I found out that I was wanted for murder. I have a Bahamian friend who got me a false ID claiming that I\u2019m a fisherman from the Dominican Republic. I have been trying to find out what did happen ever since, lying low...and studying disappearances in the air and acts of piracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should we believe you?\u201d Sean asked, not moving, his voice cold and steely. \u201cWhy should I believe that this isn\u2019t a game you\u2019re playing, that you don\u2019t have an accomplice among the crew, and that if I keep the secret that you\u2019re here, you won\u2019t be waiting for the right time to kill again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask Lew,\u201d Carlos said quietly. \u201cI told you, I came to on a Bahamian island. The people who found me were decent people. They contacted him and got him to come to me. He was there to see the fifty stitches in my head. He knows that I\u2019m telling the truth. The night I left with Georgia, one of them either hid on the boat or found a way onto the boat. I was attacked from behind. God help me, the person just wanted Georgia. I sleep at night, still hearing her screaming!\u201d</p><p>Sean still stared at Carlos. He saw that Vanessa believed in the man, believed with every fiber of her being.</p><p>She had from the start.</p><p>If he was innocent, he was a valuable ally on the island. He was the unknown that they could have in their favor.</p><p>And if he wasn\u2019t...</p><p>He was aware that Bartholomew was at his side.</p><p>\u201cI believe he\u2019s telling the truth. I followed Vanessa into the woods. There were tears in his eyes. He pleaded. No man is that good an actor,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cSomeone was on the boat. When you left, who did you see on the dock?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cVanessa and Jay. I saw them both,\u201d Carlos said.</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t mean that either of them was innocent\u2014they might have been an accomplice to whomever slipped aboard. Or are you certain that they slipped aboard before you left? Could someone have come broadside and slipped on?\u201d</p><p>Carlos took a deep breath. \u201cIt was night. I was moving slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to make a decision,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cSomeone will be coming after you within a few minutes now.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa came hurrying toward him. She caught his hand and stared into his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s telling the truth. I know that he\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he grated.</p><p>\u201cI know. I know!\u201d she said, slamming a fist against her chest. \u201cSometimes...you know.\u201d</p><p>Sean stared at Carlos over Vanessa\u2019s head. \u201cIf you\u2019re not telling the truth, you\u2019re a dead man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am telling the truth. And I am watching. And I am waiting, unknown now, to find out who did this. Because they are here, and they will strike again,\u201d Carlos said.</p><p>Sean winced and turned, sliding the safety on and the gun beneath his jacket and waistband, and taking Vanessa\u2019s hand. When they neared the beach, he slowed his pace and came out of the trees calmly, hoping no one but Katie and David had noticed their absence.</p><p>Miraculously, it seemed that no one had. Zoe, Barry, Bill and Jake were standing around the barbecue, chatting excitedly. Jay was staring out at the water. Jamie, Marty, Ted and Jaden were still inspecting the mast and the cache of coins.</p><p>Only Liam stood tensely with Katie and David, trying to pretend casual conversation.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need somewhere alone\u2014guaranteed alone,\u201d Sean said quietly. \u201cLiam, how have you been doing on that task I asked you about yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully, I\u2019ll have some information back by the morning,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need it,\u201d Sean told him.</p><p>Liam looked at Vanessa, frowning. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a walk to the Conch Fritter,\u201d he suggested. He turned and stared at Vanessa. \u201cAll of us!\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and the group walked toward the boat.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Barry called after them.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Sean yelled back.</p><p>\u201cBring another bag of charcoal, will you please?\u201d Barry asked.</p><p>Sean nodded.</p><p>Aboard the boat, he looked back to shore, assuring himself that the others had remained behind. Then he looked at Vanessa. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell them? You\u2019re the one with complete faith.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared at him, and then at David, Liam and Katie. \u201cCarlos Roca is on the island.\u201d</p><p>Liam stiffened. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll figure out a way to keep you safe while we flush him out. No one is more fierce at protection than Jamie O\u2019Hara, and between Sean, David and me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Liam, no!\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cHe\u2019s hiding. He\u2019s watching out\u2014for us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe said he was attacked on the ship, and he knows it had to be by one of the crew. He was struck on the head. He says Lew Sanderson will vouch for all this. He\u2019s been keeping his secret all this time. He was tossed overboard, assumed dead or left to drown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cVanessa, can Lew actually be an alibi? You don\u2019t know that Lew wasn\u2019t guilty,\u201d Liam pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOh, please, I can\u2019t believe that Carlos is lying.\u201d She stared at them all. \u201cAsk Bartholomew! Your friendly neighborhood ghost believes in him. We all know that faith can\u2019t be held or seen, and I have faith in Carlos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right, Vanessa,\u201d Liam said softly. \u201cI really hope you\u2019re right. If not, you\u2019ve just fed into the psychosis of a savage murderer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVanessa?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Uncle Jamie what\u2019s going on, and he\u2019ll let Marty know,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>David nodded. \u201cWhat do you think he\u2019s waiting for?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe murderers to show themselves,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cAnd how will they do that?\u201d Liam asked dryly.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll try to find a way to separate someone from the rest\u2014and murder them, as well,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cSomehow, we\u2019ll have to find a way to bait them.\u201d</p><p>That night, Vanessa knew that Sean was still angry with her.</p><p>He played his part well in front of others, but she knew. She knew the tension that knotted his body, and she knew the tone of his voice.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they had gone to bed for the night that she realized just how angry.</p><p>\u201cFirst you lied to me about him,\u201d he told her, keeping his distance, arms locked behind his head as he stared up at their canvas roof. \u201cYou lied about seeing him. Then you did the most horrendously stupid thing in the world. You walked off into the woods.\u201d He stared at her then. \u201cDon\u2019t! Don\u2019t even try to get mad at me for saying it was horrendously stupid because you know it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know it was stupid,\u201d she said softly. \u201cSean, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cSorry? Vanessa...that can\u2019t always cut it, you know,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She fell silent for a moment, aware of his distance. \u201cWant me to sleep somewhere else?\u201d she asked, praying that he would say no.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m angry, Vanessa. Furious. You risked your life, you risked other lives. I\u2019m disturbed about this trust thing we\u2019ve got going\u2014or not going. But your plan is to walk away anytime it gets rough between us. No. I don\u2019t want you to go away\u2014and I don\u2019t want you running away from me when I\u2019m right to be angry.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, not knowing what to say. She could have told him that she was pretty sure that she never wanted to leave.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t know if that would be right at the moment.</p><p>She eased down by his side and laid her head on his chest.</p><p>After a moment, she felt his hand on her hair. And in time, he drew her to him.</p><p>That night, she dreamed. In the dream, she was still in his arms. She woke because there was a woman in the tent, standing before her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid, and she didn\u2019t know why she wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><p>She had seen the woman before, on a crowded afternoon in Key West, when pirates and wenches were everywhere.</p><p>She should be afraid. She was certain that the woman was Kitty Cutlass. Pretty, not quite beautiful. Not dressed elegantly. Worn, tired.</p><p>\u201cPlease, if you would just understand,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI think I do,\u201d Vanessa told her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill Dona Isabella. Dona Isabella planned the attack. The ship had riches on it that were supposed to go with her to her husband in Spain. She didn\u2019t want to go to Spain, and she didn\u2019t want her husband. She arranged with Mad Miller that he should attack the ship, but...she wanted to control the pirates, and she didn\u2019t want you. You were the body in the chest, Kitty. It was you.\u201d</p><p>The woman, the ghost in front of her, smiled sadly.</p><p>\u201cShe is evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is dead now, too, Kitty,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cShe died in the storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvil doesn\u2019t die,\u201d Kitty said. \u201cYou must be careful. Evil doesn\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>Kitty faded away.</p><p>A few moments later, Vanessa awoke. She looked around the tent and realized quickly that there was no place for anyone to hide in the small tent.</p><p>She lay back and listened to Sean\u2019s breathing, felt his warmth and the pulse of his heart.</p><p>She wondered if she had been guessing at the truth all along, and if the figurehead image of Dona Isabella leading her into a trap that day hadn\u2019t finally made it clear in her mind.</p><p>Then she had straightened it all out in a dream.</p><p>Either that, or...</p><p>The ghost of Kitty Cutlass had been in her tent.</p><p>Either way, she felt that it was important that she knew what had happened. Somehow, letting everyone know the truth was going to help them solve the mystery.</p><p>In the morning, Sean announced that he wanted to make another trip out to the site where Vanessa had found the broken shaft of old mast with the encrusted coins, but that they\u2019d start out again just after noon\u2014first, they would set up to film Ted and Jaden working with the heavy cache of broken mast and encrusted coins. Ted said he\u2019d be the display hands\u2014Jaden would do the talking.</p><p>He and Jaden had freed and cleaned a few of the coins, and Jaden was happy to display them and happy to talk about what they had found and what they had done. \u201cThis was someone\u2019s personal treasure, I believe, before it became the property of the pirate crew,\u201d Jaden said, speaking to the camera. \u201cWe have a mixture here of gold and silver, and coins that show different mint marks, beneath different rulers. This coin bears a mark showing that it was minted in Peru, and here we have one that is very old, and I\u2019m still working very delicately to see if we still have a mint mark. I would judge it was one of the first coins to come out of the mines of South America. This is why I think that the pirates didn\u2019t actually amass the treasure, but that in sinking the Santa Geneva, they happened upon a collection of personal riches belonging to Dona Isabella\u2019s husband and traveling back to Spain with her.\u201d</p><p>Jaden displayed her work and spoke of the patience that was needed. Different people worked in different ways when working with centuries-old salvage, but she had Ted had both grown up in Key West and had worked with Jaden\u2019s father, a salvage expert from the time he was a child, to learn their craft.</p><p>When they finished with the segment, Vanessa asked Sean if she could put forth a theory. He was surprised, but shrugged and told her that she was certainly welcome to do so.</p><p>\u201cWalking along the beach?\u201d Jay suggested.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Vanessa agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll use two handhelds?\u201d Jay asked Sean.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll observe on this,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Vanessa was aware that the group was mostly together, and that was what she wanted. Marty and Liam were at the boats, and Jamie had remained at the encampment while Ted and Jaden continued to work with the treasure.</p><p>But Jay was filming and Barry had the second camera while Bill and Jake held the light shield. Zoe was hovering, just in case she was needed. David walked with Sean, discussing shots and angles, and Katie followed, curious to hear Vanessa\u2019s theory. Lew walked behind as well, arms crossed over his chest. He was watching out for everyone, and watching the terrain around them. Sean hadn\u2019t said so, but she was pretty sure that he had found a few moments during the activity of the first filming to casually corner Lew\u2014and demand to know what he knew about Carlos Roca.</p><p>It seemed that whatever Lew had told Sean, it had satisfied him.</p><p>There had been no call for a manhunt to drag Carlos out of the pine and shrub forest, nor had there been any suggestion that they weren\u2019t alone on the island.</p><p>She wondered if what she was about to do was crazy, or necessary.</p><p>She walked slowly along the beach, almost unaware of the cameras or the reflector shield being wielded by Bill and Jake. \u201cYesterday,\u201d she began, \u201cwe made an amazing find. People often wonder why, when a wreck has rested in the ocean so long and we have so much advanced equipment to put to work in the oceans these days, it hasn\u2019t been previously discovered. As Sean O\u2019Hara noted, we have to remember that conditions in the past might have been different, and that the ocean is always shifting and hiding her treasures. What we refer to as the Bermuda Triangle is a busy area where currents and weather are particularly active and where, perhaps, there are major magnetic fields at work. Basically, it\u2019s natural phenomena that dictate what happens beneath the waves. Mad Miller\u2019s pirate ship was taken down by a force of nature. And the force of nature, over the years, shifted the wreckage, and created a long debris field. Despite sonar, seagoing robots and other technical devices, treasures and wrecks can hide in plain sight. As in this case, the great metal hull of a World War II ship has hidden a great deal of the wreckage. What we have discovered this time is treasure. It\u2019s my belief that we have imagined the real story of Mad Miller, Kitty Cutlass and Dona Isabella wrong. We saw what happened as Dona Isabella would have wanted the world to see it. She was a beautiful woman, a proud and haughty woman. She lived life as she chose in Key West in luxury. She traveled the Caribbean, and she took on lovers as she chose, all with her husband\u2019s riches. I believe that she made a deal with Mad Miller. Somewhere, she met the pirate. She told him the course of the Santa Geneva and what riches the ship would carry. In return, they would split the bounty. It would be assumed that she\u2019d died in captivity\u2014but not until a ransom had been paid. Dona Isabella would then take on a new identity and live richly\u2014without the yoke of her husband\u2019s financial power over her\u2014wherever she chose. I can\u2019t imagine just what seductive power or force the woman wielded, because earlier, at the site of the Santa Geneva wreck, we pulled up a chest that held the body of a murdered woman. The \u2018treasure chest\u2019 of her body was stolen somewhere en route to a lab in Gainesville, but the experts noted immediately that she was not decked out in great finery. It\u2019s my belief that Dona Isabella was entranced with the pirate way of life and perhaps with Mad Miller himself. Either on her own\u2014or with his blessing\u2014Dona Isabella murdered the one person who stood in her way in the act of completely subduing the pirate Mad Miller to her total control. In remorse, Mad Miller saw to it that Kitty Cutlass went to the bottom of the sea in a sealed tomb. With Dona Isabella now calling the shots like a true pirate queen, she and the remaining crews of the ships sailed on to Haunt Island, where the massacre of all those who would not bow down before her took place. She was truly in her power when she and Mad Miller then set sail again, only to sail into the embrace of a massive storm, and a watery graveyard for all aboard. How furious she must have been\u2014furious with God and the heavens. She had at last obtained freedom, power and control\u2014only to fall victim to the revenge of the sea herself. Once, Africans brought to these islands believed that the tempest within this area\u2014now known as the Bermuda Triangle\u2014was caused by the bitter fury of a woman who had not been kind, while her sister had taken pity on a poor and broken man who proved to be a god. The haughty sister married a rich and handsome man who turned out to be a demon who killed her and devoured her. Her fury caused the thunder and waves and strange phenomena that brought down ships and planes. Perhaps, in later years, sailors\u2014pirates, patriots, merchants and pleasure seekers\u2014might well find that same evil spirit rests in the bitter and furious soul of the heartless woman who murdered for power and riches.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stopped walking, and smiled.</p><p>Jay lowered the camera and looked into her eyes. The reflector shields fell, and Sean came walking toward her, taking her by the shoulders, his grin deep, his eyes admiring.</p><p>\u201cFantastic!\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d Katie gasped. \u201cThat\u2019s brilliant, Vanessa, and you probably got it all right after all these years of us believing that Kitty Cutlass was a murderess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes perfect sense,\u201d David agreed.</p><p>\u201cBut wait\u2014I\u2019m confused,\u201d Zoe said. \u201cYou found Dona Isabella\u2019s pendant. That was the first find that you made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014I\u2019m sure she purposely lost that pendant, and someone was supposed to have found it years and years before I did. When salvage divers came out to the wreck, they would believe that the pendant was wrenched from her neck in the struggle. Maybe they wouldn\u2019t find it, but the seeds were planted for her story\u2014the story she wanted people to believe\u2014to come to light. Of course, this is my theory. I\u2019m not sure that I can prove it in any way, and the body is gone now, but from what Dr. Aislinn said when we did have the body, it seems likely that it was Kitty Cutlass,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord, and what a cool bit!\u201d Barry said to her, grinning. \u201cDona Isabella can be seen as the evil that lurks in the Bermuda Triangle. I love it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter all these years of man being man, war and devastation, I\u2019m sure a lot of evil energy went down in the ocean,\u201d Sean said dryly.</p><p>\u201cEvil is in the mind, really, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jay asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd in idle hands, right?\u201d Zoe asked, grimacing.</p><p>\u201cWell, in the mind\u2014and in the hands of those it inhabits, I guess,\u201d Barry noted, grinning. He frowned and stared at Vanessa. \u201cYou\u2019re not suggesting that the evil spirit of Dona Isabella came up from the sea to somehow decapitate and dismember Georgia and Travis.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa shook her head. \u201cHey\u2014I just put forth a new theory, that\u2019s all. A theory. We\u2019ve always worked on theories and suppositions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d Bill Hinton said, nodding in thought.</p> <p>\u201cCreepy,\u201d Barry said.</p><p>\u201cAh, but it\u2019s all in the mind, really, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jay asked. He looked at Vanessa, frowning. \u201cIn an odd way, maybe Dona Isabella was getting her evil revenge. You wrote our script, relying on supposed history and legend. Maybe Dona Isabella wanted it all remembered that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy kill Georgia and Travis\u2014if evil ghosts of the past had anything to do with it?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Jay said, shrugging. He rolled his eyes. \u201cMaybe evil spirits demand sacrifices!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman hands committed murder,\u201d Sean said. \u201cAnyway, let\u2019s get back to working on what we\u2019ve begun to find. Light lunch again, and an afternoon dive. That was great footage, Vanessa, great. I loved it. Let\u2019s see what else we can find.\u201d</p><p>While lunch was being prepared, Sean went aboard the Conch Fritter, where Liam had been on the computer using his various contacts to try to track the movement of the original film crew in more detail over the last two years when the other two boats disappeared.</p><p>\u201cSome of this we knew. Vanessa has been doing commercial shoots. Three of the others, Barry Melkie, Bill Hinton and Zoe Cally, were part of a crew that filmed in the Bahamas. Jay hasn\u2019t done as well as the others. He\u2019s had a few dry spells in there. So really, anyone could have easily been around when the other disappearances occurred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know. I guess it\u2019s still not proof of anything. And I\u2019m still trying to figure out why. Vanessa\u2019s theory on Dona Isabella being in collusion with Mad Miller was fascinating, and rings true, and it had all kinds of motive\u2014for Dona Isabella. I don\u2019t see the motive in the killings now\u2014if, indeed, some of these disappearances were caused by the same murderer or murderers who killed Georgia and Travis,\u201d Sean said, perplexed. \u201cThere was no financial gain, not that I can see. The deaths of Georgia and Travis put Jay into financial difficulty. It\u2019s true that the water can be rough around here and that ships have disappeared in the area forever, but other disappearances now might be related. David and I read about the Delphi. It seemed it disappeared into thin air, and the boat was captained by an experienced man. There should have been a distress call, something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make a distress call if you\u2019re taken by surprise,\u201d Liam pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWe could still be way off course,\u201d Sean said. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. And Carlos thought someone was aboard the boat because he was knocked out\u2014taken by surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re not being taken in by Carlos,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we are.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI think that the man is telling the truth, and that someone with us is guilty. Carlos Roca is convinced someone on the island at the time was involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking a leap of faith to believe in Carlos Roca,\u201d Liam noted.</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cYes and no,\u201d he said softly. \u201cVanessa has...something. Like Katie. The thing I always wanted to deny. Until Bartholomew. Now I know that things do exist that we can\u2019t see. She has instincts and...something. I trust that something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope you\u2019re right,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>Everyone wanted to dive that day. Sean, however, didn\u2019t want to leave the encampment alone, nor did he want to leave Ted and Jaden alone to keep guard. In the end, it was agreed both boats would go out that day with Jamie O\u2019Hara remaining topside on his Claddagh and David and Katie remaining topside on the Conch Fritter.</p><p>They followed one another going down, but the World War II vessel was a huge hulk, and they split to follow it around in different directions. Vanessa led, bringing her partners around to the gash in the giant hull that had probably caused its sinking. They began to explore the area, Sean turning the camera on the wreck and then the different divers.</p><p>Vanessa realized that they were in an equipment room, and she began to study the dials and levers on one side of the wall. She followed them to the sandy bottom, where in some places they were on the ocean floor and in others she heard the metallic clink of the vessel\u2019s flooring. She kept searching the flooring, aware that her fellow divers were near.</p><p>She found an uneven patch in the sand and started carefully moving the sand around it. She grew excited as she realized that she had come across something. There was a piece of something that glittered. She moved more sand and realized that one object was laid atop another. She picked up the first and was surprised to see that it was a knife. It wasn\u2019t old; the hilt was wearing and the blade was dull and crusted, but it was a modern diving knife. She slipped it into her belt and looked at the object beneath it. It was long and wedged tightly between the rip in the hull\u2019s floor and the sand.</p><p>She looked for the others and saw that Zoe was at a hatch, struggling with the door. She swam toward her just as the door gave.</p><p>Vanessa ducked the massive sheet of steel that seemed to have some kind of spring; Barry, shooting ahead of her, did not.</p><p>She heard the thud as he crashed, headfirst, into the steel.</p><p>He shot back, his regulator falling from his mouth. She realized that he was unconscious and hurried toward him, catching his drifting weight and gripping her backup regulator to force it immediately into his mouth. Zoe shot for her, trying to help, but she was panicking and in the way. Sean let the camera fall, suspended, to his side, shooting toward them. He signaled that they needed to surface, which, of course, they knew.</p><p>Decompression time had to be taken, but between them, they kept the air going into Barry\u2019s lungs and bubbles coming out into the water. When they surfaced, Zoe began to shout, drawing David\u2019s attention. He was quickly at the dive platform with Katie, and between them they got Barry\u2019s body on deck, stripped of dive gear and wrapped in a towel.</p><p>Sean stood over him and looked the ten feet over to the Claddagh. The other divers were up, and Liam shouted over to Sean. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarry took a beating from a spring-loaded hatch,\u201d Sean cried.</p><p>\u201cIt was my fault. I should have known,\u201d Zoe moaned. She was flustered, fluttering over Barry, trying to touch him, whispering that she was sorry.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got to get to medical care,\u201d Sean said. \u201cHe might have had some oxygen deprivation, though Vanessa got to him quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tie up and take Barry on board the Claddagh. She\u2019s got a bit of speed on your Sunray, Sean. I\u2019ll radio ahead and they\u2019ll be ready for him in Bimini,\u201d Jamie called to him.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Sean conceded.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I did this,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>\u201cZoe, you didn\u2019t do it\u2014the door sprang right when Barry was heading for it,\u201d Vanessa said. She glanced at Sean and realized that he thought that Zoe\u2019s ministrations might prove to be too much for the poor man. \u201cBarry will be fine. Jamie\u2019s boat is fast. We\u2019ve got him breathing, and he has a weak but steady pulse going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab the bumpers,\u201d Jamie called to his crew aboard the Claddagh.</p><p>Vanessa and Jay ran to do the same for the Conch Fritter. A few minutes later, Barry was aboard the Claddagh, and it was agreed that David and Katie would go with him while the rest of the crew came aboard the Conch Fritter to head back to the island.</p><p>Vanessa watched the Claddagh sail away, and she waved to Katie and David.</p><p>She felt a chill.</p><p>They would be all right. They had to be all right. They were close to Bimini, it was still daylight and there were three of them aboard with Barry.</p><p>She still felt an ominous sense of dread that something horrible would happen before she saw them again. The sea wind suddenly seemed chill, and when she turned away, she felt the strange sting of tears in her eyes.</p><p>16</p><p>\u201cBarry could die,\u201d Zoe said, watching as the Claddagh disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to die,\u201d Vanessa assured her, giving her shoulders a hug. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zoe looked at her and tried to smile. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t find a thing,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>Vanessa tried to brighten. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>They all looked at her.</p> <p>\u201cWell, of course you did,\u201d Jay said. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She looked around at the faces. Sean was just waiting, Liam at his side. Bill, Jake, Jay and Zoe were wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t true. She knew that she had found a modern dive knife. Maybe it wasn\u2019t indicative of anything\u2014perhaps a diver had lost it. But for some reason, she decided not to tell them all about the knife\u2014just what was beneath it.</p><p>\u201cThe floor was uneven, and it was all crusted...I think it might have been what remained of a sword or a cutlass. I didn\u2019t have time to try to figure it out\u2014Barry was hit. But we can find out tomorrow. I know exactly where it is,\u201d Vanessa said. She smiled. She was proud of this find. She hadn\u2019t seen a ghostly figurehead in the water. She had found it on her own.</p> <p>She saw that Bartholomew was standing just behind Liam and Sean; he watched her solemnly.</p><p>\u201cIt might have been German, or fairly modern,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was impossible to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go back down right now,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not today,\u201d Sean said. \u201cToday, we had a member of our crew injured. We\u2019ll head back and let the others know what happened, and wait to hear about Barry\u2019s condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you are worried he could die!\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>\u201cNo. He just needs care. But this is it for the day,\u201d Sean said. He headed to the helm. Vanessa came and curled up on the companion seat, hugging a throw around her shoulders\u2014she hadn\u2019t been able to shake the chill that had seized her as she had waved goodbye to Katie.</p> <p>She was anxious to hear that the Claddagh had arrived safely in Bimini.</p><p>Liam was seated aft.</p><p>Watching, she thought.</p><p>Watching Zoe, Bill and Jake.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have far to come in to the island, but she decided that the demand for a freshwater shower on the one boat might be high that night, and she slipped off the seat, telling Sean that she was going to take a quick shower. It was good, though quick. Zoe followed her lead while the guys washed off on the deck, using the equipment hose.</p><p>She felt better once she was dressed in jeans and a sweater. And in another few minutes, she heard Sean calling for the ties and the bumpers. They had returned to Haunt Island.</p><p>A fire had been built and the barbecue had been set to blaze and dinner put on in their absence. Jaden, busy flipping thin flank steaks, was horrified when she heard about Barry, and Ted had to take the barbecue fork from her hand to save a piece of meat.</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident,\u201d Jay said, \u201cnothing but an accident.\u201d He set a hand gently on Zoe\u2019s shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d Vanessa added.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll call soon,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Vanessa felt she had to escape for a few moments at least. She murmured something about needing to put a few things away in her tent. She glanced at Sean, hoping that he would follow her.</p><p>She started entering the tent. Bartholomew had preceded her entry and was seated on the ground, Indian-style, hands folded prayer-fashion and tapping his lower jaw. He started to rise when he saw her, but she shook her head and sank down beside him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking all day,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your theory is right. It has to be. I told you\u2014I knew them, Mad Miller and Kitty...and they weren\u2019t evil or cruel. Mad Miller must have made a financial agreement with Dona Isabella. She traveled a lot\u2014they could have met at several ports. He was...he was soft. Once he had stopped her ship, she took control. She insisted it be sunk, and she murdered Kitty. It all makes sense now.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa shook her head. \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t make sense. I kept seeing Dona Isabella\u2019s face on a figurehead\u2014she was the one leading me around.\u201d</p><p>The tent flap opened and they started, but it was Sean, and evidently he had heard them.</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cWhatever type of spirit she is, she\u2019s been playing with you. She\u2019s been leading you. She wanted you to find the pendant, because that lent credence to the tale. That would bring everyone aboard to follow this whole route again. And\u2014just in case it didn\u2019t\u2014she then had you find the body. She probably didn\u2019t realize that a forensic anthropologist would immediately realize that it was the wrong body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the body disappeared,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cShe led you\u2014and she\u2019s leading someone else,\u201d Sean said. Bartholomew nodded.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Vanessa said, and dug into her bag. \u201cI did pick up something today, but no one led me to it. It was in the gap in the ship, on top of the object I was describing.\u201d She produced the knife and showed it to Sean. He studied it, rolling it over in his hand and chipping at the crust on it.</p><p>\u201cT-B-E,\u201d Sean read. \u201cTom Essling,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>\u201cTom Essling\u2014he was captain of a boat that disappeared in that area just last year. If we further our search, I have a feeling we\u2019ll find his boat, the Delphi, too,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>\u201cSo...someone has been pirating other vessels near here. Someone maybe using Haunt Island as their base, as if it\u2019s their...their home fort,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s all supposition,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. I know she\u2019s right,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cBut I\u2019m watching...I\u2019m always watching, and I can\u2019t figure it out yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it has been figured out to this,\u201d Sean said. \u201cSomeone here knows much more than he or she is saying. Someone is\u2014\u201d He broke off, looking at Vanessa. \u201cA killer, I believe,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>From outside the tent, they heard Jaden call out loudly. \u201cDinner, folks, dinner! Come and get it now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go on out,\u201d Sean told Vanessa. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep up all appearances.\u201d</p><p>As they walked over to the barbecue area, Vanessa asked Sean, \u201cDavid hasn\u2019t called yet. Why hasn\u2019t David called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Unless what Barry had done had been an act. Barry was a big man, muscular, powerful. The kind who could wield a knife and a bone saw, if needed. What if he had been pretending the entire event, and he had known that they would save him, bring him to the surface.</p><p>And rush him to a hospital.</p><p>She began to fear that Barry would suddenly rise, taking David and Jamie by surprise. He would attack from the rear, when they weren\u2019t expecting it. He would toss them overboard as he had done with Carlos, and then he would come for Katie....</p><p>She clenched her fists, knowing that she was letting her imagination run away from her.</p><p>But she was scared.</p><p>And she wanted David to call, or Katie, or anyone.</p><p>Jaden and Ted tried to be cheerful and upbeat as they doled out dinner. Marty, however, appeared wary and watchful.</p><p>Lew Sanderson sat on the beach alone, watching the others as they ate.</p><p>Liam stayed on one side of the group and Sean on the other.</p><p>When Sean\u2019s cell phone started ringing, they all jumped. He answered it quickly, and then breathed a sigh of relief as he looked at the others.</p><p>\u201cThey are in Bimini, and the doctors believe that Barry will pull through,\u201d he told them.</p><p>It seemed that everyone let out a sigh. And then they began to chat with relief, and in a few minutes, they were even joking with one another.</p><p>David, Jamie and Katie wouldn\u2019t return until the next morning, which meant that Sean had lost three of the people he trusted most for the night.</p><p>Lew\u2014he thought he trusted, but he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Ted and Jaden he trusted, but they were really scholars, not fighters, though Ted did know how to use a speargun.</p><p>Carlos was an unknown element in the whole game.</p><p>Still, he had himself and Liam and Marty. And they were guarding a tiny blonde woman and two twenty-somethings who didn\u2019t appear to be musclemen.</p><p>Maybe there was something he still wasn\u2019t seeing. One of the group had been involved, but they\u2019d had outside help.</p><p>Everyone seemed tired that night. He told Liam about the knife they had found, and they both knew that they\u2019d be searching for the Delphi the next day.</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cWe all stay on guard. Marty, Ted, you and I. And Lew. But I\u2019m uneasy now, and we\u2019ll actually be watching Lew, as well. I\u2019m thinking that when David and Katie and my uncle Jamie return, it may be time to put an end to this. I think a killer is in reach, but I don\u2019t want to risk anyone else\u2019s life. We need a larger crew\u2014a totally trustworthy crew. Anyway, we\u2019ll each take a few hours, and stand guard in threes through the night,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cYou want some time first?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks. I\u2019d like that,\u201d Sean admitted.</p><p>Vanessa was already in their little tent. She had seemed chilled during the day, and was wearing her flannel nightdress again. He smiled at her, coming in to zip the flap on the tent.</p><p>He came to her, taking her by the shoulders, and she looked up at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cThese are really tight quarters,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd we are really, really close to other tents, but...\u201d</p><p>He loved her smile, loved her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re very good at whispered conversations,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere are many ways to communicate, you know.\u201d</p><p>Her arms wrapped around him. She drew him down with her to the thin mattresses on the canvas floor of the tent and he reflected that it was really one of the finest beds he\u2019d ever seen. Any bed was fine, if Vanessa was there. He cupped her face in his hands and kissed her slowly, and she slid her fingers beneath his shirt, teasing the flesh of his abdomen, then drawing the shirt up and over his head. They came together again, and she felt his blood begin to burn as her fingers dipped into the waistband of his jeans. She went still as she felt his gun. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m damned glad you have it. And I\u2019m definitely glad it was a gun. It seemed a very strange place to have such a body part,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you body parts,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>\u201cPromises, promises...\u201d</p><p>They quickly grew breathless and winced here and there, pressing their fingers to each other\u2019s lips, smiling, laughing, making love just a bit awkwardly and with just a bit of difficulty and yet finding that the smiles, the whispered warnings and the laughter itself made the moment sweeter and more frantic, and even in hushed gasps the moment of climax incredible and shattering. Then they lay together, damp and breathing deeply, hearts thundering, interlocked, and strangely silent.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Vanessa whispered.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI just...I...I needed this time,\u201d he said. He\u2019d never realized that he didn\u2019t know how to speak to a woman. Not true, speech had been easy. But he had never intended to become involved, never realized that he could feel that he needed to wake up with someone every morning. He let out a breath and turned to her and just let the words come. \u201cI think I love you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI think I love you, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think...I think that when this is over you shouldn\u2019t leave,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that we should both see where this thinking is going. I think the thinking could become certainty.\u201d</p><p>She brushed her lips against his, and her eyes, so dark and beautiful a blue in the shadows, met his. \u201cI think that I\u2019ll be here,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to leave her; he had to. He knew that he was right, that even if the three of them guarding the place appeared to be overkill, it was necessary.</p><p>He rose, reaching for his clothes and dressing quickly in the cramped quarters. Vanessa slipped back into the flannel gown. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet some sleep. Tomorrow will be a long day, and...well, you are distracting,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He unzipped the flap on the tent and slipped away.</p><p>Despite everything that had happened during the day\u2014or perhaps because of it\u2014Vanessa found herself falling into a deep sleep almost immediately after Sean left her.</p><p>For a while, even in sleep, she knew the comfort of the sweet rest.</p><p>Then she felt as if she was being touched.</p><p>She opened her eyes. It was dark in the tent, though the many torches set into the sand kept the area light enough. Strange patterns and shadows were dispersed between faint lights.</p><p>She must have still been sleeping. She could see a face. It wasn\u2019t the face that had been on the figurehead, not that of Dona Isabella.</p> <p>It was the face of the blonde woman, not as pretty, just a little worn. Kitty. Kitty Cutlass.</p><p>And her eyes were tinged with worry now.</p><p>She was dreaming again, of course.</p><p>\u201cCome, come...come on. You must leave, please, hurry!\u201d the woman warned her.</p><p>She had been sleeping so, so deeply....</p><p>She was still struggling to rise when she saw another face.</p><p>Zoe\u2019s. Zoe was shaking her and half sobbing, very softly. \u201cVanessa, you have to come. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa sat up instantly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bill...he\u2019s... Please, you can\u2019t wake the others. You can\u2019t let...you can\u2019t let Lew see us. You have to come quickly. He knows something, and if you let out the alarm, Lew will come and kill him. Please, Vanessa, hurry! Be silent.\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed down Zoe\u2019s delicate cheeks. \u201cAll right, all right, Zoe. We have to get to Sean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but after you see Bill. You\u2019ll have to make Sean understand!\u201d</p><p>She slipped quietly out of the tent with Zoe, her heart racing. Lew? She had trusted him! He had a family, little children...</p><p>She crept low, but they had barely gone a few steps before she heard Sean\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cHey. What\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Zoe stared at him without speaking.</p><p>\u201cSean,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou need to be quiet and not raise an alarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Sean repeated.</p><p>\u201cZoe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe\u2019s tired of waiting and being pushed around,\u201d Zoe said flatly. Her voice was deep and coarse and dry, and not her at all.</p><p>Sean drew his gun but not quickly enough. Vanessa felt the steel prod of Zoe\u2019s weapon at her back. \u201cSet it down, Sean. Shooting Vanessa will be a piece of cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, what do you think you\u2019ll accomplish?\u201d Sean asked her.</p><p>\u201cSatisfaction\u2014and her rewards,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t get off this island alive,\u201d Sean argued.</p><p>\u201cPut your gun down, Sean. I\u2019m good with weapons. This is a Magnum .45\u2014Vanessa\u2019s entire chest will burst out in your face, and it will be all your fault,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>\u201cShoot her, too, Sean,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cShe intends to kill me in the end anyway!\u201d</p><p>They could both sense Zoe\u2019s delicate finger on the trigger. Sean set his gun on the ground.</p><p>\u201cNow step out of my way,\u201d Zoe said. \u201cVanessa and I have a little business together.\u201d</p><p>By then, the others had come running.</p><p>Ted with his speargun, Liam with his police revolver. But Zoe was calm and resolved. \u201cPut the weapons down. I cannot tell you what it will look like if I fire into Vanessa\u2019s flesh and blood and bone!\u201d She said the last with relish.</p><p>Liam held on to his gun for a moment.</p><p>Suddenly, he stiffened.</p><p>\u201cDown, my friendly neighborhood cop,\u201d Bill Hinton said. \u201cSet it down, come on now, good cop! Zoe, go on, take her. I\u2019ve got the situation here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no!\u201d Liam said. He spun quickly, but not quickly enough. Bill Hinton brought the butt of his gun down on Liam\u2019s head with a savage vengeance and turned to shoot at Marty\u2019s foot. Marty, stunned, let out a roar of pain and fell to the sand.</p><p>\u201cI said to drop all the weapons!\u201d Bill thundered. He turned his gun on Jaden. \u201cShe\u2019ll look great with a shattered kneecap!\u201d</p><p>The entire group was still. \u201cTake her, and I\u2019ll be right behind,\u201d Bill said, his voice bizarrely gentle as he spoke to Zoe.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going for a little walk in the woods.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was racing. She saw the trapped fury in Sean\u2019s eyes, and she was afraid that he\u2019d wind up dead in the sand himself if she didn\u2019t defuse the immediate situation. \u201cPlease, stand back,\u201d she begged Sean. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to be all right. She couldn\u2019t believe that Zoe\u2014who had cried in fear of what she had done to Barry that day\u2014could be this person. But she had been fooled\u2014Zoe was petite, delicate. Zoe was a murderess, apparently. And she had probably managed to spring the door on purpose, knowing it would bring a weakening of the ranks.</p><p>Zoe dragged her into the trail where she had first traveled to find Carlos.</p><p>Zoe meant to kill her, just as she had killed Georgia Dare. It wasn\u2019t for money. It was because she had become strangely...possessed.</p><p>Sean made a dive into the sand, rolling to retrieve his weapon.</p><p>In all honesty, he wasn\u2019t sure if he would make it or not.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Just as Bill started to rage at him, his attention distracted as he tried to take aim at Sean, something came leaping from the tent behind Liam\u2019s prone body\u2014something! A whir of motion and of fury.</p><p>Sean got his hands on his gun just as Carlos Roca brought Bill down to the ground. Bill twisted, trying to aim his gun at Carlos Roca\u2019s face.</p><p>Sean fired, as carefully as he could, praying that his aim would be true.</p><p>It was. Bill Hinton screamed in agony as his hand exploded and his gun went flying. Carlos Roca did not find mercy at that cry of pain. He slammed a bone-crunching fist into Hinton\u2019s face, and the cry was cut off cleanly. Hinton was out.</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d Jaden cried, almost sinking to her knees, then rising, going one way, and then the other, not certain whether to see to Liam or Marty first.</p><p>\u201cLiam!\u201d Ted suggested, and they crossed one another as Ted raced to Marty and Jaden hurried on to Liam.</p><p>Jake Magnoli stood in the middle of the group, his jaw wide with astonishment and horror.</p><p>\u201cZoe? Bill?\u201d he breathed.</p><p>Jay had been frozen in place. He moved, pacing, looking at Sean. \u201cShe\u2019s crazy. She\u2019s got to be crazy. She\u2019s got Vanessa. Why Vanessa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to hurry, track them, run...!\u201d Lew Sanderson cried.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, we have to track them, but she can\u2019t see us,\u201d Sean said. \u201cShe\u2019ll kill. I know she\u2019ll kill. We have to take her by surprise.\u201d He looked up. Bartholomew was at the start of the trail. He looked at Sean, and he began to run into the darkness of the pines.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t hear us, she can\u2019t see us!\u201d Sean said. \u201cCarlos...come. Lew and the rest of you, stay here. Help Liam and Marty. Call for the authorities!\u201d</p><p>He ran toward the trail, his heart thundering.</p><p>Zoe? Zoe Cally? The little bitty blonde...</p><p>The little bitty bloodthirsty blonde.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I admit to being incredibly confused,\u201d Vanessa said, trying to keep her voice calm and her words conversational. \u201cI did figure out the truth behind Dona Isabella, right? What I\u2019m trying to understand is how on earth you came to be so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy?\u201d Zoe asked. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy. She\u2019s here. She is the power of the sea. Eventually, she\u2019ll reward us, and we\u2019ll live like royalty within her realm!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? She made you kill people. You ruined your own work with the movie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right! The only people who would have made money on that movie were you and Jay,\u201d Zoe said. \u201cWhile Dona Isabella...you must understand. She thrives on blood, she needs so much blood in the sea. Souls are good, too, but she really likes a good machete massacre.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe thrives on blood?\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cZoe, when did you start this? How? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? I was chosen, don\u2019t you see? I knew the legend, good God, we all knew the legend. I used to love to come here and wonder what it was like in my own mind. And I sat here once and she came to me, and I knew. I knew what she wanted. She needed to be fed lots of blood. Then there was a bit filmed here for one of the history channels...let me see, that was four or five years ago. Bill was playing a bit part, and I saw that he would have loved to have been a pirate. It was so easy then....\u201d She broke off, laughing softly. \u201cWe had to learn, of course. We started with a girl who was diving here...a Bahamian. We didn\u2019t really know what we were doing and it was a very messy murder, but luckily, no one was around. And I\u2019m so good with costumes and makeup, when the film that you and Jay were doing came up, well...it was just brilliant. Wonderful! We became pirates. Travis was easy. We terrified him before we killed him. And then we got on board the boat when Carlos tried to take Georgia away. Oh, it was so much fun. And the more blood Dona Isabella got, the more power she had, the more power she gave to us! But you! You went and found the trunk. That was very tricky, because we had to pretend to be just hanging around Key West while we caught up with that doctor and her assistant and stole it back, then got a boat and dumped it back out at sea...but we\u2019re wonderful at getting rid of things in the sea. The sea is merciless, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year ago, you killed the people on the Delphi. And you just killed more people, those retired people, on the Happy-Me.\u201d</p> <p>Zoe appeared indignant. \u201cDona Isabella needed her strength for this.\u201d She smiled. \u201cSometimes you have to seize your chances when they appear. Picking off retirees on boats that are just anchored here? Now and then you can have fun. You can do the whole pirate thing. Ghosts rising from the sea in flesh and blood with machetes!\u201d She smiled, so proud of herself. \u201cAll you need is a place to run, excellent diving abilities and sheer talent. Oh, Vanessa! Murder is really ridiculously easy. The tricky part, always, was pulling off the crimes and then being back to appear to be innocent as hell. Actually, the hardest night was when we both had to slip out of our tents to catch up with Georgia and Carlos when they left that night. Catch up with them and get back into our own tents so we could wake up in horror and come see what had happened, what was lying on the sand. But it was wonderful!\u201d</p><p>Zoe might have been describing an incredible trip abroad, or a loving sexual encounter. She appeared ecstatic.</p><p>Vanessa tried to keep her talking.</p><p>\u201cZoe, you need to stop now. I\u2019ll help you. If not, you\u2019ll wind up arrested. You may get the needle instead of life in prison,\u201d Vanessa warned. She could still feel the prod of the gun so sharply against her back.</p><p>\u201cNo. Dona Isabella will protect me,\u201d Zoe said. \u201cWon\u2019t you?\u201d Zoe smiled slyly at Vanessa, then looked to her side.</p> <p>Vanessa looked, too.</p><p>And there she was. The ghost of Dona Isabella, haughty, proud and cruel, and highly amused as they walked through the pines.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Vanessa said, \u201cwill surely rot in all the fires of hell, and soon.\u201d</p><p>Zoe looked shocked. \u201cYou see her?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Dona Isabella looked furious. She spoke with a sultry voice, pleasantly, despite her words. \u201cZoe will kill you slowly, Vanessa. Slowly. You will bleed into the sand and into the sea.\u201d</p><p>Zoe looked distracted for a minute. \u201cWhere\u2019s Bill?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s dead,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cYou think those men just let a boy playing with a gun stop them?\u201d</p><p>The nose of the gun pressed harder.</p><p>Vanessa realized that they were coming through the trees to the other side of the island. When they reached the sand, she thought, she would be in trouble.</p><p>The moon was out, and they neared the water. She could hear the waves, the sound lulling. They were about to break through the trees. They did.</p><p>To Vanessa\u2019s surprise, they came to a sudden halt. \u201cAh, well, if it isn\u2019t the Spanish whore of all time!\u201d came a voice.</p><p>Bartholomew. The ghost was awaiting them.</p><p>\u201cPirate scum!\u201d Dona Isabella said. \u201cGo\u2014out of my way. Push through him. Just push through him. He is nothing but a mass in the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you are,\u201d Vanessa said.</p> <p>She was stunned when the ghost swung about, when she saw hands of mist come toward her and encircle her throat. She felt the pinch...</p><p>And then she refused to do so.</p><p>\u201cYou bitch! You let her go!\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>Zoe let out a little cry, thrusting Vanessa forward so that she fell onto the sand. She lifted the gun, but her hand was shaking as Bartholomew pitched himself at Dona Isabella and the spirits went flying downward in the night in a mist of white and sand.</p><p>And just as they did, Vanessa heard something like a whir, a motion so fast it seemed more ethereal than the ghostly specters in the sand.</p><p>Sean.</p><p>He flew into Zoe so fast, pitching himself from the trees, that she didn\u2019t even have a split second to pull the trigger. She fell to the earth, and Jay, behind Sean, swept up her gun. Zoe began to toss and writhe and scream incoherently.</p><p>Sean kept her down.</p><p>Lew Sanderson walked out of the trail and approached the ghosts locked in combat on the sand. And he began to speak, too, some kind of an ancient dialect, his booming voice rising over Zoe\u2019s desperate tirade and screams.</p><p>Then Lew\u2019s words changed to Latin, and he lifted a cross, speaking the same words over and over. He reached into his pocket. From the sand, Vanessa stared at him, afraid that he had a gun, that he would begin to shoot needlessly at the mist...</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t a gun. It was a vial of water, and he sprinkled it again and again....</p><p>Suddenly, a piercing scream of agony and terror erupted from the sand. Vanessa looked toward the sea. It seemed that her monsters had risen, but they were seaweed monsters of darkness and fire....</p><p>Black mist rose like fierce, roiling thunderclouds, seeming both unreal and with substance, a viscous mass that steadily came forward.</p><p>Dona Isabella stared at it, screaming in a rage. Words of protest tumbled from her mouth.</p><p>It seemed that thunder roared, silencing her.</p><p>She backed away.</p><p>But it did no good.</p><p>The darkness had come for her.</p><p>The black, roiling mass washed its way over the shoreline, an unstoppable army of oily shadows, somehow alive and furious, bearing red eyes that spoke of all the demons of hell.</p><p>Coming for Dona Isabella.</p><p>The mass enveloped her. She screamed and writhed, but to no avail. She became part of the mass, and it ripped her from shore, bearing her back to the water again.</p><p>Vanessa blinked. It was over; she was gone. Her heart flew to her throat because she didn\u2019t see Bartholomew, either. All there was to be seen was Zoe, now suddenly silent, almost catatonic.</p><p>Lew turned to them. \u201cShe is gone,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>Jay blinked. \u201cWho is gone?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what he had seen. Now, as the waves lapped gently again, as the moon rode over the water, Vanessa wasn\u2019t sure, either.</p><p>Lew Sanderson stooped down by Zoe. \u201cI will take her. She will go to the Bahamian authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd perhaps face charges elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Sean left Zoe to Lew.</p><p>He walked to Vanessa, caught her hand and drew her up into his arms. He was shaking.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to think anymore. I know that I love you,\u201d he said, and he drew her hard against him, still shaking as he held her there.</p><p>The remains of the Happy-Me were found the following week, and the Delphi was found two weeks later. Once in custody, Bill and Zoe seemed to have no problem talking, even though most of the law-enforcement officials they spilled their souls to thought they were crazy.</p><p>It was Dona Isabella. She taught them how to be pirates. She helped them slip aboard boats, kill the crew one by one and make them disappear into the ocean.</p><p>The film shoot had been so easy. They had made a point of switching places constantly, so that neither could really be accused. For instance, Zoe had made certain that Bill was working when she took down the Delphi, just as Bill had made sure that Zoe was seen at the time he lured Travis out to the sand during the making of the horror movie. Travis! Conceited oaf. He had died quickly and easily. And it was bizarre that the authorities had never found the machete that they had used to cut up the bodies\u2014they had left it hidden in the pine forest on the island. They had sunk Jay\u2019s boat\u2014as they sank all the boats, stealing off them little by little. They weren\u2019t bad people\u2014they were chosen. They were chosen by Dona Isabella to help her rule the sea.</p><p>There were a dozen times when Vanessa wanted to turn to Sean and say, \u201cDid that really happen? Did we see what we saw? Did an evil ghost walk the world just as easily as the pained spirits of those who had been wronged, or who sought to help others?\u201d</p><p>She never spoke. Maybe they both knew that the world was composed of good and evil. As Bartholomew had suggested, good men were good men.</p><p>And evil men\u2014and women\u2014were evil.</p><p>Just how crazy had Zoe become?</p><p>And did it make them all a little mad?</p><p>They were questions that haunted Vanessa at first. But they weren\u2019t about to stop her from living her life, from being with Sean. Barry healed quickly, and Marty was thrilled to walk around with a cane for a while. Liam came to before the authorities even arrived, furious with himself for having fallen prey to a pathetic little bastard like Bill Hinton.</p><p>But they had survived, and they had found a certain truth\u2014if not the total truth. No one would really know what had happened on the pirate ship\u2014and man might never really know what had caused hundreds of years of wild weather and strange occurrences in the Bermuda Triangle.</p><p>They didn\u2019t expect to solve that riddle.</p><p>They weren\u2019t salvage divers, either. They were filmmakers.</p><p>And so they became the filmmakers who worked with the salvage divers who brought up the pirate ship. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vanessa still had a strange knack for finding treasure. She\u2019d be led sometimes by a gentle presence in the water\u2014a blonde woman who had worked too hard in life, fallen in love with a pirate and been murdered for that love. Kitty Cutlass.</p><p>She had feared for Bartholomew that night. But he had joined her later in the confusion on the shore, and he had assured her that he was not going to the place that was now hosting Dona Isabella. He wouldn\u2019t say more, just that he was destined for a better end, and that he was actually quite anxious to get back to Key West.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before they had a break and spent time in the city. And it was at dinner at O\u2019Hara\u2019s where she saw that Bartholomew was really all right. He had been sitting with them idly at the bar, and then...</p> <p>His Lucinda, his lady in white, came by, and he was gone, hurrying out to the street to meet her, where he held her tenderly in his arms, where their eyes met, and he kissed her.</p><p>\u201cVery romantic!\u201d she said, pleased.</p><p>Sean pulled her into his arms. \u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll show you romantic.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, and slipped from the bar stool.</p><p>She turned into his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t need to think much at all anymore, Sean O\u2019Hara.
