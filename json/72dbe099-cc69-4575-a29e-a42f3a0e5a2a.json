Or he\u2019d once dated her older sister.</p><p>Or his little sister was her best friend. She fell for him hard the day she\u2019d fallen off her horse.</p> <p>That hot, dusty afternoon teased the edges of her memory. She\u2019d been clip-clopping along on the gravel road connecting the Foster and McKay ranches when a rattler spooked her pony and bucked her off. She\u2019d twisted her ankle on the unexpected dismount, unable to scramble away from either the angry snake or the truck barreling toward her.</p><p>Her life flashed before her eyes.</p><p>But the tires on a big Ford dually locked up and the truck skidded to a stop. A young man jumped out, swooped in and picked her up. His work-roughed hands tenderly brushed rocks from her knees and wiped the tears from her dirty face. He carried her to the passenger side of his truck, burned rubber over the snake and drove her home, keeping hold of her hand as she sobbed.</p><p>Amy Jo had a devil of a time climbing out of his rig, not because of the injury to her ankle, but mostly because she hadn\u2019t wanted to get out. She remembered sitting in that truck cab, surrounded by the scent of horses, of chewing tobacco, of hay, dust and the underlying tangy aroma of his cologne, and she\u2019d wanted to stay right there with him forever.</p><p>With his dark good looks, bold smile and gentle ways, Cord had become her ideal, her dream, her savior, her prince charming in battered cowboy boots and a sweat-stained white Stetson.</p> <p>No man had ever held a candle to him.</p><p>She\u2019d been a whopping five years old at the time.</p><p>So, Amy Jo secretly worshipped Cord McKay throughout the years. Even after he moved to Seattle. Even after he returned to Wyoming married to a floozy from the West Coast. Even after the woman birthed a son. Even after the idiot abandoned Cord and their baby Ky.</p><p>She\u2019d especially loved Cord then because she\u2019d ached to pick up the pieces of his broken life. To make him whole. To crack the bitter shell he\u2019d erected around his heart.</p><p>To show him real, everlasting love was worth waiting for. In her core, her heart, her very soul, Amy Jo knew she was meant to be that one special woman.</p><p>Problem was she hadn\u2019t been a woman at the time either; she\u2019d been a shy eighteen-year-old girl.</p> <p>Too young.</p><p>The other problem was Cord hadn\u2019t seen her beyond the clumsy blonde pig-tailed friend of his little sister. Or as a family acquaintance with a neighboring ranch. Or recently as his son\u2019s babysitter.</p><p>That\u2019d been the worst kind of torture. Being in Cord\u2019s house. Hearing Ky rambling from sunup to sundown about his father. Seeing Cord\u2019s unmade bed\u2014one side rumpled, one side pristine. His lone coffee cup in the sink. Catching a whiff of his shaving cream as she lingered in front of the same bathroom mirror he used every day.</p><p>Seemed Amy Jo spent her life waiting for her chronological age to catch up with the age of her soul. Waiting for other people to believe she was old enough to know her own mind, even when she\u2019d made it up at the tender age of five.</p><p>Now that she was twenty-two, she could stake her claim.</p><p>Standing in front of her bedroom mirror, she adjusted her cleavage in the skin-tight shirt the color of ripe apricots. She applied a coat of shiny pink lip-gloss. Finger combed her hair and inhaled a deep breath.</p><p>In all the hours she\u2019d fantasized about Cord McKay, he\u2019d never really noticed her.</p><p>Come hell or high water, Amy Jo would change that tonight.</p> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>Cord McKay scowled at his beer. He scowled at everyone in the whole damn bar.</p><p>Why had he come here?</p><p>Right. No reason to be home, sitting alone, wondering what the hell to do with himself. Couldn\u2019t do chores at night or else he\u2019d be doing that. He\u2019d rattled around the empty house for the last two days at loose ends.</p><p>Earlier, when he\u2019d slipped on a Matchbox car and nearly fell on his ass, he\u2019d automatically yelled, \u201cKy, come down here right now and pick this up...\u201d The silence hit him like a load of hay bales. His son wasn\u2019t there. Ky wouldn\u2019t be around for another forty-two days.</p><p>Not that Cord was counting or anything.</p><p>The band struck up a cover of George Strait\u2019s \u201cAll My Exes Live In Texas\u201d and boots thumped as dancers crowded the tiny wooden dance floor.</p><p>Cord upended his beer and tugged his Stetson down his forehead a notch. His ex didn\u2019t live in West Texas, rather on the West Coast. The twangy tune served as a reminder of the disturbing events of the last month.</p><p>Ky\u2019s mother, Marla, had called out of the blue, demanding to see their son.</p><p>The son she\u2019d abandoned.</p><p>Naturally, Cord flat-out refused. Then Marla turned nasty and threatened to drag Cord to court, throwing around words like \u201cjoint custody\u201d and \u201cparental rights\u201d. Words that sent shudders down his spine and ice into his soul.</p><p>Kyler McKay was his son. His. Marla had handed over Ky\u2019s care to him the day he\u2019d been born. She\u2019d lasted six months after Ky\u2019s birth before she\u2019d hightailed it back to Seattle for a temporary separation. A tearful Marla returned to Wyoming a year later with her tail tucked between her legs, full of apologies, proclaiming she\u2019d changed, wanting another chance to make things\u2014their marriage and motherhood\u2014work.</p><p>She\u2019d only lasted three weeks that time.</p><p>Cord had filed for divorce. Marla hadn\u2019t contested it, as she hadn\u2019t contested his demand of full, sole, permanent custody of Ky.</p><p>No doubt he struggled as a single parent, but luckily his family lived nearby and they helped him out. Consequently, Ky was a happy, bright, well-adjusted, four-year-old boy surrounded by uncles, aunts and grandparents. Ky didn\u2019t need a mother and they sure as shootin\u2019 didn\u2019t need her. Cord had told Marla as much over the phone.</p><p>But Marla wouldn\u2019t back down about the visitation rights. Cord took the matter to his attorney. The lawyer\u2019s advice was to let the boy stay with his mother for the seven-week period she\u2019d requested. It surprised Cord when his own mother sided with the lawyer, claiming it would be good for both Ky and Cord.</p><p>Seven days ago he and Ky had hopped a plane and flew to Seattle. Cord insisted on being there as a safety net before he passed Ky over to Marla, a mother Ky didn\u2019t remember at all.</p><p>Leaving his son in the care of a virtual stranger hundreds of miles from home was the hardest thing Cord had ever done. A million bad scenarios raced through his mind.</p><p>He\u2019d almost turned around and flew right back to Seattle after he\u2019d landed in Cheyenne.</p><p>Let his brothers and cousins run the massive McKay ranch for a few weeks. God knew, Cord had pulled their weight more than a time or two. They owed him.</p><p>Cord\u2019s mother talked him into coming home, giving Ky time to adjust before making a rash decision. Ky seemed fine whenever Cord talked to him on the phone, which had calmed his fears somewhat.</p><p>Somewhat. Damn, he missed his kid something fierce.</p><p>So, here he was killing time in the local honky-tonk, wondering how he\u2019d get through the next month and a half without going insane. Wondering if the next time he stumbled over one of Ky\u2019s toys whether he\u2019d break down and bawl like a lost calf.</p><p>The chair next to Cord\u2019s squeaked as a big body flopped beside him. He tilted his hat up and saw his cousin Kade\u2019s shit-eating grin.</p><p>\u201cFancy seein\u2019 you here, Cord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know you ain\u2019t here trollin\u2019 for a piece of ass.\u201d Kade\u2019s dark eyebrows rose in challenge. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>Kade\u2019s baritone laugh boomed. \u201cYou talk to Ky today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. How\u2019s the little guy doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Misses his horse more than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a typical McKay response. How\u2019re you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, ain\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust mean you\u2019re bored already, huh?\u201d Kade\u2019s gaze swept the bar. \u201cWho you here with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt is supposed to show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll show up late, if at all.\u201d Kade snorted. \u201cLast I knew he was hookin\u2019 up with some stripper from Lusk. I swear he\u2019s nailin\u2019 three-quarters of the women in the tri-county area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes, I\u2019m jealous. He gets more pussy in a week than I get in a year.\u201d</p><p>The haggard waitress dropped off a fresh beer and took Kade\u2019s order. Cord asked,</p><p>\u201cIs Kane here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. He\u2019s got a hot date. Everyone is gettin\u2019 laid but us, cuz.\u201d He shot Cord a devious look. \u201cUnless you\u2019re lyin\u2019 to yourself, me, and your mama on why you\u2019re really here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hardly. I don\u2019t have time for the bullshit that goes along with the privilege of gettin\u2019 my rocks off once or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, that\u2019s harsh. You tellin\u2019 me you wouldn\u2019t make time if someone came along?\u201d</p><p>Cord\u2019s beer stopped halfway to his mouth. His attention wandered to a woman swinging her hips on the dance floor.</p><p>Oh yeah. He\u2019d make time for her in a fucking heartbeat.</p><p>Holy hell. Her legs went on forever. His gaze started at the heels of her high-heeled silver boots, gradually traveling up along the sexy line of those shapely legs, ending at her luscious ass barely hidden beneath an extremely short denim skirt. When her dance partner twirled her, Cord caught a glimpse of bright red bikini panties.</p><p>Lust whomped him in the gut.</p><p>He\u2019d been so busy checking out her ass he hadn\u2019t seen her face. Her backside faced him\u2014not that he was complaining\u2014and a cheap straw cowboy hat covered her head. Her strong, tanned arms slid around the wide shoulders of the lucky cowboy as she sashayed closer to grind her pelvis against his. The cowboy whooped, clamping his hands on her ass in a dirty dancing move that\u2019d make Patrick Swayze jealous.</p><p>It caused a burst of envy in Cord too. Nonchalantly he asked, \u201cKade, who\u2019s the chick on the dance floor?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one with the never endin\u2019 legs puttin\u2019 on the show in the miniskirt.\u201d</p><p>Kade squinted. \u201cYou mean AJ?\u201d</p> <p>AJ? Not a familiar name. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s quite the dancer, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure is.\u201d</p><p>AJ performed a shimmy-shake with her hips, while snaking her arms above her head.</p><p>The movement caused her tight lace shirt to slide up, exposing the smooth curve of her lower back.</p> <p>Cord withheld a groan. Nothing was sexier than that dimpled section of a woman\u2019s back above her ass. Nothing.</p><p>With the exception of those unbelievably hot legs.</p><p>Every wicked undulation of her hips resulted in the fringe on her skirt swishing across the back of her firm thighs. He\u2019d never been jealous of a skirt before now, but he sure as hell was right then.</p><p>\u201cShe seein\u2019 the guy she\u2019s dancin\u2019 with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMikey? Nah. Not for lack of tryin\u2019 on his part. AJ doesn\u2019t lack for partners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s sweet as the day is long. How your sister hasn\u2019t corrupted her is beyond me.</p><p>She ain\u2019t as wild as Keely, but ain\u2019t for want of volunteers to take her for a walk on the wild side.\u201d</p><p>Walk? Hell, Cord would take her for a ride on the wild side. Binding her mile-long legs around his waist as he drove into her hard and fast. Feeling those slender thighs draped over his shoulders as she rode his face.</p><p>Jesus. Been an ice age since he\u2019d had a woman, especially a buckle bunny cowboy-toy like her\u2014built for speed with curves that\u2019d lead a man straight into temptation.</p><p>Cord nursed his beer, his eyes never straying from her twisting form. Still, something about her seemed...familiar.</p><p>AJ threw back her head and laughed. Her straw hat tumbled to the floor.</p><p>Come on, baby doll, bend over and pick it up.</p><p>She twirled his direction and Cord finally saw her face.</p> <p>If his lips weren\u2019t pressed against the beer bottle, his jaw would\u2019ve smacked his knees.</p><p>The blonde sexpot with the killer legs and fantastic ass was none other than little Amy Jo Foster. His astonished gaze zeroed in on the cleavage spilling out of her V-necked blouse.</p><p>Nothing little about her now.</p><p>Talk about degenerate behavior. He\u2019d been ogling his much-younger sister\u2019s best friend. His son\u2019s former babysitter.</p><p>Christ on a crutch.</p><p>Good thing she\u2019d never waltzed into his house dressed like that\u2014a sex kitten on the prowl. He\u2019d\u2019ve been arrested for his lewd thoughts alone. Dammit, why couldn\u2019t he stop wondering whether her nipples were pale pink like her lips or cherry red like her undies?</p><p>Amy Jo\u2019s large silvery-gray eyes met his for a moment. The come-hither smolder she aimed at him nearly knocked him off his damn barstool.</p><p>Where\u2019d she learn that \u201cfuck me now, Big Daddy\u201d stare? She was too damn young.</p><p>She\u2019s old enough.</p><p>And he was old enough to know better.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>Amy Jo shrieked as Mikey lifted her up, gifting Cord with another glimpse of those sexy panties.</p><p>Cord bristled at seeing Amy Jo manhandled. Oh, he\u2019d teach that pup with the roving paws a thing or two about manners.</p><p>Right. You\u2019d love a chance to teach her a thing or two about how a real man would handle her.</p><p>Before Cord\u2019s butt left the chair to rescue her, Amy Jo broke Mikey\u2019s hold and stooped over to retrieve her hat. This time when their eyes met, she licked her lips and smiled seductively. Wantonly. Like she was picturing him buck-assed nekkid in just his damn hat.</p><p>Another wave of lust heated his balls. Then he knew the kiss she\u2019d given him at Carter and Macie\u2019s wedding reception last year hadn\u2019t been a result of too much champagne.</p><p>His brain flashed back to the wedding dance at the Bar 9. The early autumn night held a bite of chill as the evening\u2019s festivities were winding down. Dozens of couples boot-scooted on an improvised dance floor beneath a white tent. He\u2019d drifted off, preferring to drink a Fat Tire beer alone. Amusing himself by watching Ky and a couple of boys chasing giggling girls around in the preschool version of two-stepping.</p><p>A swish of fabric caught his attention. He turned when Amy Jo sidled up, wearing an ankle length dress the color of sunshine, which fit the fresh, clean, sunshiny scent flowing from her.</p><p>He managed a smile. \u201cAmy Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that was you, hiding over here all by your lonesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStory of my life.\u201d</p><p>Silence stretched as thorny as the rose bushes lining the walkway.</p><p>Cord shifted his stance. Lately, being around Amy Jo made him feel like a tongue-tied fool. He couldn\u2019t tell her how pretty she looked without sounding like a total letch.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t mention how goddamn good she smelled without coming across like a deranged bloodhound, or worse\u2014some kind of hopeful horndog.</p><p>When in doubt...\u201cNice night,\u201d he offered lamely.</p><p>\u201cThat it is.\u201d She shivered discreetly. \u201cIf a bit chilly.\u201d</p><p>Should he act gentlemanly and offer her his suit coat? Nah. She\u2019d probably think he was an old coot.</p><p>Which he was.</p><p>Dammit. Say something. Anything.</p><p>\u201cYou havin\u2019 fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Weddings are always fun, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Cord bit back a smart retort and swigged his beer.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you out there cutting a rug like the rest of your McKay brothers and cousins?\u201d</p><p>With his beer bottle, Cord gestured to Ky and the kids. \u201cSomeone\u2019s gotta keep an eye on them so they don\u2019t dunk each other in the stock tank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always the responsible one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I reckon it goes with the territory of bein\u2019 the oldest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t just the providence of the oldest child to be forced into responsibility.\u201d She sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever want to...\u201d</p><p>He gave her a strange look. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>A smile bloomed on her face before it faded. \u201cNever mind. Ky did a great job as ring bearer today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he did, besides refusin\u2019 to let go of Callie Morgan\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say as I blame him. A cute girl who can rope and ride as well as he can?\u201d</p><p>Amy Jo\u2019s trill of laughter was as sweet and fleeting as the evening breeze. \u201cPoor boy is smitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to be an epidemic in the McKay family of late.\u201d He glanced over to see his brother Colby and his wife Channing slow dancing, as well as the newlywed couple Carter and Macie entwined together, lost to everything but each other. A feeling close to jealousy tightened his stomach.</p><p>Not jealousy. Just indigestion.</p><p>Get a grip, McKay. This happily-ever-after wedding bullshit is addling your brain.</p><p>During his silent bout of self-pity, Amy Jo glided in front of him. Right in front of him. Lord. She was nearly as tall as he was in those ridiculously sexy yellow high heels.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you smitten, Cord McKay?\u201d</p><p>Cord had nothing to say to that. He studied her, half-wary, half-curious about her intentions.</p><p>\u201cYou could be smitten with me.\u201d Keeping their gazes locked, she slowly angled forward and kissed him. Just a feather-light press of her soft mouth to his. As his lips were getting with the program, she withdrew slightly, letting their heated breath mingle for a second before she sank her teeth into his bottom lip. She gave a playful tug, followed by a thorough flick of her wet tongue to soothe the sting. \u201cBecause I\u2019m definitely smitten with you.\u201d She sauntered toward the tent in a cloud of chiffon and pure temptation.</p><p>Cord remembered licking his lip, realizing she tasted as warm and sweet as autumn sunshine. He\u2019d been too stunned to chase after her, chalking up the teasing kiss and challenging words to booze and the party atmosphere.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought about it again until now. As a matter of fact, he hadn\u2019t seen Amy Jo since she\u2019d moved to Denver last year to attend massage therapy school with his sister.</p><p>His mother kept him updated on Keely\u2019s exploits, which usually included tidbits on Amy Jo and her family.</p><p>His mother relayed the turn of bad luck in regard to Amy Jo\u2019s mother, Florence.</p><p>Evidently she\u2019d fallen from her horse and broken her leg. Amy Jo\u2019s older sister, Jenn, called Amy Jo home temporarily to help out with Florence\u2019s recovery.</p><p>Just how temporary was the situation?</p><p>The McKay\u2019s association with the Fosters spanned several decades. After Floyd Foster died four years back, Cord and his dad made a generous offer to buy the Foster ranch outright. But as Florence\u2019s only grandchildren lived nearby, she wasn\u2019t ready to sell the family homestead. And the McKays could afford to wait until she was.</p><p>Maybe the time had come.</p><p>A flash of metallic fringe brought his awareness back to Amy Jo exiting the dance floor. Cord sat up, straightening his hat, fully expecting she\u2019d stroll to his table to flirt with him. Or at least beg him to dance with her. Or make good on the sultry promises she\u2019d offered him with her smoky eyes. He\u2019d be polite, but he\u2019d gently discourage her attentions.</p><p>But Amy Jo flounced to the bar.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Cord\u2019s eyes narrowed as the bartender rang a cowbell and lined up a full shot glass.</p><p>Amy Jo slapped a five on the bartop. A group of young cowboys egged her on. She clasped her hands behind her back, bent forward, slid her lips down the shot glass and tipped her head, gulping the cloudy white liquid without using her hands.</p><p>Her throng of admirers whooped and hollered. Crumpled bills piled up on the bar napkin next to a bottle of Budweiser.</p><p>Amy Jo returned the glass to the bar the same way she\u2019d taken it. She made a show of smoothing the bills and secreting them in her bra. Her sleek platinum hair tumbled over her left shoulder as she turned to smile at a guy creeping up behind her.</p><p>A small drop of milky liquid clung to the corner of her mouth. Sweet Jesus, it looked like a drop of...</p><p>Her smoking hot gaze hooked Cord\u2019s. She brought her finger to that spot, wiped the droplet and sucked her fingertip between her full pink lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His cock went hard as a fencepost.</p><p>Then Amy Jo whirled around and ignored him.</p><p>The little cock tease.

Man, you okay?\u201d</p><p>Startled, Cord looked at Kade and was glad his cousin couldn\u2019t see the hard-on he was sporting under the table. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooked pretty pissed off there for a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thinkin\u2019 about another beer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re buyin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>By the time the round arrived, so had his brother Colt, with a tiny, curvy brunette on his arm with tits the size of watermelons, who appeared to be about fifteen.</p><p>Like you have any place to judge, pervert, lusting after your kid\u2019s babysitter.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late. Was a little distracted.\u201d He gave the woman a drunken leer, snagged an extra chair and they sat\u2014with her straddled across his lap. \u201cThis is Jasmine. Jasmine this is my older brother Cord, and my cousin, Kade McKay.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine studied them both carefully before a brazen smile stretched her glossed up lips. \u201cThey cloning Chippendale cowboys in Wyoming now? All you big, gorgeous McKay guys look alike.\u201d</p><p>Cord and Kade scoffed at the Chippendales comment.</p> <p>\u201cNot clones, but Kade has an identical twin brother, Kane,\u201d Colt offered.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jasmine batted her fake eyelashes. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be packed between hot lookin\u2019 twins. Mmm. My kind of cowboy sandwich\u2014with lots of beefcake.\u201d</p><p>Kade choked on his beer.</p><p>Cord frowned.</p><p>Jasmine cranked her head around to smile at Colt. \u201cDo your other brothers look like you and your cousin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby does. Cam and Carter take after our ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity. You ain\u2019t pulling my leg? Kade looks like he could be your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe look alike because our fathers are twins who married sisters, so we\u2019re double cousins,\u201d Colt explained.</p> <p>\u201cDouble. Mmm. Another one of my fav-o-rite words.\u201d Jasmine slunk across the table like a stripper in heat as she sought Kade\u2019s attention. \u201cSo you up for a little double trouble, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>Kade shot Colt a hopeful look. \u201cFor real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Jasmine has lots of energy and some...interestin\u2019 ideas. She\u2019s told me she\u2019s up for anything tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Any kind of rodeo you\u2019re up for,\u201d Jasmine cooed. \u201cI\u2019m itchin\u2019 to ride. Or be rode. Or whatever.\u201d</p><p>Kade grinned. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine squealed, \u201cYee-haw! Let\u2019s hit the road before he changes his mind, partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool beans. We\u2019ll meet you at the Boars Nest, Kade.\u201d Colt winked at Cord as they stood. He clamped Jasmine to his side since the woman was practically dry humping his leg. \u201cSorry, bro. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Kade downed his beer and threw a ten on the table. \u201cHate to bail, but you know how it goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t. You get offered threesomes often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no. Why do you think I said yes so damn fast?\u201d He clapped Cord on the back and disappeared out the side entrance.</p><p>Cord slouched in his seat. The bad idea to drown his sorrows was getting worse by the minute. Talk about being out of date and out of place. Things\u2019d changed since he\u2019d been on the dating scene.</p><p>No they haven\u2019t. You\u2019re just blocking out some of the raunchier moments from your misspent youth.</p><p>Maybe that was true. But he still felt damn old at thirty-five. And he noticed Jasmine didn\u2019t ask him to join in their fun and games\u2014not that he would\u2019ve if she had asked.</p><p>Who was he kidding? He\u2019d\u2019ve done it in a New York minute.</p><p>He sighed, primed to leave, when Amy Jo darted onto the dance floor with some fresh-faced buck who had three extra pairs of hands.</p><p>Rather than go home to watch lousy TV alone, he settled in and watched her. She\u2019d two-step a couple of numbers with one guy, flit to the bar for a fresh drink, and drag a new dance partner to the floor.</p><p>Cord hid in the darkened corner for over an hour, tracking every enticing sway of her slim hips, every smooth glide of those long legs, every exaggerated shoulder roll, every sexy chest shimmy, every toss of that sleek platinum hair. Not once did Amy Jo acknowledge him, even though she was as hyper-aware of him as he was of her.</p><p>Her sexy little ass shake turned him on more than if she\u2019d have been buck-ass naked grinding her crotch on a brass stripper\u2019s pole.</p><p>When she was alone at the bar Cord moseyed up behind her. \u201cEvenin\u2019 Amy Jo.\u201d</p><p>She tossed him a quick grin and granted him a not so quick once over. \u201cSurprised to see you in here, Cord. And it\u2019s AJ now, not Amy Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mistake. Why the name change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew attitude, new name.\u201d She resumed drinking her beer.</p><p>Cord scooted close enough to catch a whiff of her sunshiny scent. He noticed sweat beading on the curve of her neck below her ear and had the strangest desire to place his mouth there and gently suck the salty droplets clean away.</p><p>A beat passed and she didn\u2019t acknowledge him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you liked to dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d like to learn. Every. Damn. Thing.</p><p>\u201cWho are you here with?\u201d</p><p>Amy Jo\u2014AJ\u2014faced him fully. \u201cWho are you here with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat why you came looking for me? Can\u2019t find anyone better to hang out with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Didn\u2019t know you thought so highly of me.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>The classic brush off\u2014a pointed reminder on why he avoided the bar scene. He flashed her a fake smile. \u201cAnyway. I came by to say hello. I\u2019m headin\u2019 home and I wondered if you needed a lift.\u201d</p><p>AJ arched a slim brow. \u201cYou offering to give me a ride, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>Cord curbed his response, you can ride me any time, any place, as long as you want, cowgirl, and cleared the lust from his throat. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The band announced the next tune, Willie Nelson\u2019s \u201cAlways On My Mind\u201d and AJ</p><p>shook her head at yet another eager, happy-handed cowboy approaching her for a dance.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the offer, but no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? You\u2019ve been drinkin\u2019 pretty heavily the last couple of hours. Probably shouldn\u2019t be drivin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know how much I\u2019ve been drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been watchin\u2019 you. Closely. Every step and every sip, darlin\u2019. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off you and you damn well know it.\u201d Her confidence slipped; he moved in. \u201cYou like that I\u2019ve been watchin\u2019 you, sweet Amy Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ,\u201d she corrected softly.</p><p>\u201cYou like that I\u2019ve been watchin\u2019 you, sweet AJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo while you were watching, did you see anything you liked, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d His gaze landed on her lush mouth.</p><p>\u201cRight. Give me a break.\u201d</p><p>Cord managed to drag his eyes back to hers. \u201cYou callin\u2019 me a liar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m calling your bluff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning, I know you\u2019ll look your fill, burn my clothes away with your sexy eyes, but you\u2019re too damn polite to do anything more than gawk at me.\u201d</p><p>Cord nearly choked, \u201cPolite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolite. Responsible. Chicken. Whatever.\u201d She stared at his lips and ran her pink tongue over her teeth. \u201cTell me, Cord, don\u2019t you ever just wanna say to hell with what\u2019s expected of you and do what makes you feel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery damn day.\u201d</p><p>She reached up, letting her fingers fiddle with a button near his shirt collar. \u201cThen tell me why you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you anything you wanna know, baby doll, as long as you answer a question for me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>When AJ\u2019s lust-filled eyes met his, it took every ounce of restraint not to smash his mouth to hers, hike up that sassy excuse of a skirt, spread those silky thighs wide, and nail her against the closest paneled wall.</p><p>Focus.</p><p>\u201cCan I buy you a drink? Like the shot you did earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna see me do a blowjob?\u201d</p><p>Cord froze.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSee why I won forty bucks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for sayin\u2019 that raunchy word out loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. For doing it.\u201d</p><p>He lifted both brows. \u201cDoin\u2019 what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiving them a group blowjob. See, the object is the same with the drink as it is with the act, shoving the glass in your mouth as far as it\u2019ll go, keeping a tight grip with your lips. Then you tilt your head and suck hard and deep, bracing yourself for the warmth spilling down your throat as you try to swallow it all.\u201d</p><p>He growled, \u201cWhat game are you playin\u2019 with me, little girl?\u201d</p><p>AJ stood on the tips of her boots. \u201cI haven\u2019t been a little girl for a long time, Cord McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout damn time.\u201d</p><p>If he leaned in a fraction of an inch, he could lay a hungry kiss on those ripe lips, not innocent like the flirty smooch she\u2019d teased him with last year. Would this bolder AJ take the initiative?</p><p>She didn\u2019t. Instead, she lifted a shaking hand to his cheek. Her fingertips delicately traced the outline of his neatly trimmed goatee, lingering on the short hair above his upper lip. A chaste, yet erotic caress to make his cock stand up and take notice if it wasn\u2019t already rock-hard.</p><p>\u201cNo games. If you want to play with me, all you have to do is ask. I\u2019ll be here tomorrow night, waiting for your answer.\u201d</p><p>AJ spun on her bootheel and vanished into the sea of bodies on the dance floor, leaving Cord McKay absolutely pole-axed.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>When Kade walked into the Boars Nest, the old ranch house he shared with his brother Kane and his cousin Colt, the first thing he noticed was Jasmine on her knees giving Colt a blowjob. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colt\u2019s hands gripped Jasmine\u2019s head as he hammered his hips into her face. \u201cMore.</p><p>Take it all. Wider. Oh yeah, baby, here it comes. Suck it down.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a new scene. Normally the wilder stuff happened behind the bedroom doors. Threesomes were old hat for his brother Kane, and Colt, hell, even sometimes their cousin Dag, hence Kade\u2019s eagerness to participate.</p><p>Colt\u2019s neck arched and he groaned. Jasmine made happy humming noises. Then Colt\u2019s semi-erect cock slid out of her mouth. \u201cChrist, Jazz, you suck like a fuckin\u2019 dream.</p><p>Baby, that was amazin\u2019.\u201d He finally noticed Kade. \u201cHey, cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God somebody is here to fuck me.\u201d Jasmine stood and eyed Kade with a grin. She snatched a condom from the coffee table and flipped him the square package.</p><p>\u201cSlap on a love glove, cowboy, and mount up.\u201d</p><p>Already? Kade started stripping. \u201cWhere we doin\u2019 this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here for round one. We\u2019ll see how you hold up. If you got enough try to make it to round two and on to the finals.\u201d She bent over the back of the couch and waggled her ass at him. \u201cCome an\u2019 get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave at her, buddy. I need a drink.\u201d</p><p>Kade ripped open the plastic package and rolled the latex down his cock as he walked to the sofa.</p><p>Jasmine smacked her lips when she saw his dick. \u201cA bull\u2019s got nothin\u2019 on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t heard any complaints.\u201d Kade smoothed his hands up her back and rolled his hips over her ass. \u201cNeed lube, Jazz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t need sweet words or soft kisses either. I need you to fuck me hard.</p><p>Blowing Colt or watchin\u2019 someone else blow him makes me horny as shit.\u201d</p><p>Kade canted her hips, spread her pussy open with his fingers and slammed deep.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t kiddin\u2019. You are wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. More.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComin\u2019 right up.\u201d Kade pulled all the way out and thrust back in. She was so short he could hold on to her shoulders as he fucked her.</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s hand disappeared between her legs and he saw her frantically rubbing her clit.</p><p>Without missing a stroke, Kade said, \u201cYou want me to do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m better at it. You do what you\u2019re good at which is...God! Do I love a big cock. I\u2019ll bet you can go all night, cancha, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not tonight.\u201d</p><p>She choked out a smoker\u2019s rasping laugh.</p><p>Sweat poured down Kade\u2019s body. He closed his eyes. It\u2019d been a couple of months since he\u2019d had sex; he knew he wouldn\u2019t last long. Damn. Should he hold off? How much longer before she came? And why didn\u2019t he care, like he did with his other lovers?</p><p>Because this is pure animalistic fucking. You\u2019re following her lead.</p><p>Colt wandered back in, still stark naked, sipping from a bottle of vodka. He flopped on the dilapidated easy chair. \u201cJazz, baby, I\u2019m here watchin\u2019 another man rammin\u2019 his cock into your greedy pussy.\u201d</p><p>She moaned. Her hand moved faster between her legs.</p><p>\u201cI oughta come over there and shove my dick in your mouth again. That\u2019d get you off. Especially if I came on your face while he\u2019s comin\u2019 in your cunt.\u201d</p><p>Kade hissed, \u201cJesus, Colt, do you fuckin\u2019 mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves it when I give her a play-by-play of what I\u2019m gonna do to her next. She loves it even better when I watch another man or two fuckin\u2019 her.\u201d Colt tipped his bottle to Kade. \u201cBut a little pain will make her come like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine whimpered.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, she wants it. Bad. Smack her ass.\u201d</p><p>Kade kept plunging deep. He gritted out, \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, goddamn it. Smack it. Make it burn.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d stepped into the world of the surreal. He\u2019d never done anything like this. Kade released her shoulders, spread his right hand across the globe of her ass and swatted her.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it again,\u201d Colt said. \u201cLower. Harder. By her pussy.\u201d</p><p>Kade loaded up and whacked her again.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there, Colt, please. That is so good.\u201d</p><p>Colt? This chick was aware Colt wasn\u2019t the one fucking her, wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>Two hard smacks and she started to come. When her spasming pussy muscles clamped down on his cock, he blew like a geyser.</p><p>After his head quit spinning, he staggered back. Whoa. Getting off besides by his own hand was always good, but that was...weird. Disjointed. Fast.</p><p>Colt went to Jasmine. Kade disposed of the condom and grabbed a beer from the kitchen.</p><p>When he returned to the living room, Jasmine was reclined on the coffee table, her legs spread wide. Colt was on his knees with his face buried in her pussy.</p><p>From where he stood, he saw Colt\u2019s head moving and Jasmine\u2019s absolute rapture.</p><p>Colt twisted and plucked Jasmine\u2019s big nipples with one hand and had three fingers plunging in and out of her ass. The scene shouldn\u2019t have turned Kade on, but it did. His cock stirred. By the time Colt made her come, Kade was completely hard again.</p><p>Jasmine sat up with a shameless smile. \u201cReady for round two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatcha got in mind?\u201d</p><p>Colt grabbed two condoms and tossed him one. \u201cShe wants both of us at the same time, you fuckin\u2019 her tits, me in her ass. Lube is right here. Let\u2019s take this in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>In Colt\u2019s room, Jasmine stretched out on the bed, letting her legs dangle to the floor.</p><p>Kade straddled her waist and she played with her nipples as he lubed the valley of her cleavage.</p><p>Looking at her face, Kade realized he hadn\u2019t kissed her. He didn\u2019t want to kiss her.</p><p>Colt said, \u201cReady, Jazz baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born ready.\u201d She arched when Colt impaled her. \u201cOh that\u2019s good. Better than your fingers. Better than that dildo you used last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, that wasn\u2019t a dildo, that was your buddy Leroy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains his limp dick then.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed and Kade was clueless as to why that was so damn funny.</p><p>Kade held her tits together and eased his cock into the channel he\u2019d created. Oh man.</p><p>The lube made it slippery. She was a much tighter fit here than her cunt. As he glided in and out, his balls brushed her belly. He said, \u201cPinch your nipples harder.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine liked being told what to do. She tried to lick the cockhead with his every upstroke. When she began to moan, he glanced over his shoulder and saw Colt playing with her clit as his cock tunneled in and out of her ass.</p><p>Colt grinned drunkenly at Kade. \u201cAin\u2019t this great? Ain\u2019t Jazz the best ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s somethin\u2019 all right.\u201d</p><p>Colt thrust so hard the next four times, Jasmine\u2019s body slid up the bed.</p><p>\u201cWait. This isn\u2019t working for me, fellas.\u201d</p><p>Kade and Colt both stopped moving.</p><p>She slapped Kade\u2019s ass. \u201cScoot up. Let\u2019s see how much of that big dick I can get in my mouth. Then I can play with your balls. God, I love fat, furry balls like these.\u201d</p><p>He positioned his knees beside her head. He put his hands flat on the mattress and slowly fed his cock into her eager mouth. Jesus. It was fucking hot to watch the length disappear until her nose was buried in his pubic hair and his heavy balls dangled by her chin.</p><p>When he eased back, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t suck, but I can do this.\u201d She rolled his sac between her fingers like she was throwing dice.</p><p>\u201cDamn. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>She giggled.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten into a steady rhythm, a fast plunge past the soft palate to the back of her throat, followed by the teasing scrape of her teeth as he withdrew. Sweat dripped down his chest and landed on her forehead. It was right there. Right there. He said, \u201cSuck it now. Suck it hard.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine hollowed her cheeks and wormed two fingers in his ass as he started to come.</p><p>\u201cMotherfuckin\u2019 hell, woman, what are you doin\u2019!\u201d</p><p>She giggled again and pumped her fingers deep as his cock emptied.</p><p>The bedroom door burst open.</p><p>Kane said, \u201cWell, well, what do we have here? A fuckin\u2019 party? Can I join in?\u201d</p><p>Colt laughed. \u201cAlways room for one more, eh Jazz?\u201d</p><p>She moaned around Kade\u2019s cock and it sent a tingle straight to his balls. He tried to pull out but she bit down, evidently wanting his cock right where it was.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pay no mind to me, I\u2019ll just be getting acquainted with this pretty pussy. Oh look. It\u2019s all wet. Has it been cryin\u2019 for someone to pay attention to it?\u201d</p><p>Kade glanced over his shoulder as his twin dropped to his knees beside the bed and started slurping Jasmine\u2019s clit.</p><p>She arched her neck and Kade eased his throbbing dick out of her mouth past those deadly teeth. \u201cGod, yes, suck hard. Fuck my pussy with your fingers too,\u201d she said to Kane.</p><p>Kane bit and sucked her clit, ramming what looked like his whole hand in her cunt.</p><p>Jasmine screamed; Kane kept sucking and Colt said, \u201cJesus. I can feel her comin\u2019.</p><p>Her ass is tightenin\u2019 around my cock like a fuckin\u2019 vise. Can\u2019t hold off.\u201d He groaned and threw his head back.</p><p>Kade scooted off the bed and whipped the spent condom in the trash.</p><p>Colt dismounted like he\u2019d hopped off a buckin\u2019 horse and clapped Kane on the back.</p><p>\u201cTime for double trouble. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d He stumbled from the room with his bottle.</p><p>Then Kade noticed not only was Kane naked, he already wore a condom.</p><p>Jasmine sat up. \u201cYou guys really are identical.\u201d Her gaze lingered on Kane\u2019s cock.</p><p>\u201cIn every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how unbelievably fuckin\u2019 hot it is how much you love givin\u2019 and takin\u2019 pleasure? Very few women are so uninhibited. You\u2019re the ultimate fantasy woman.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, Kane. Lay it on a little thick why don\u2019t you? He didn\u2019t need to bother. Jasmine was a sure thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why did that bother him? Isn\u2019t that what he was supposed to want? Wasn\u2019t that why he was here?</p><p>But he missed the burning glances. The flirtatious banter. The accidental touches.</p><p>That slow build up of lust until you hit the combustion point. That was his ultimate fantasy these days.</p><p>\u201cFar as fantasies go, I have one of being fucked at the same time by identical twins.</p><p>Looking over my shoulder and seeing the face of the man taking my ass is the same face as the man that\u2019s in front of me fucking my pussy.\u201d</p><p>Kane grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s your lucky day. The McKay twins are here to make your dream come true.\u201d He leaned forward and gave her a sloppy, noisy kiss.</p><p>Whoa. Kade had no desire to kiss Jasmine. Ever.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make you a Jazz sandwich,\u201d Kane teased.</p><p>She giggled.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro, you mind takin\u2019 the rear? I wanna suck these titties while I\u2019m hittin\u2019 the fuckin\u2019 Jazz-pot here.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine giggled again.</p><p>His brother tossed him a condom.</p><p>Kade lay back on the bed, resting on his elbows. Jasmine threw a leg over Kade\u2019s hip, aligning her hole with Kade\u2019s cock. Kade pulled her ass cheeks wide and pushed the broad head past that puckered pink opening and into the channel.</p><p>She made a happy sounding moan and leaned back, putting her hands on the mattress by Kade\u2019s ribs and bounced on his dick like it was a pogo stick.</p><p>Kane aimed and drove into her pussy. He set the rhythm, he\u2019d thrust forward then Kade would bump his hips back. Kane lifted Jasmine\u2019s tits and slurped her nipples.</p><p>Jasmine was into it; Kane was into it. Kade just wanted the whole fucking thing to end. What\u2019d started out as a sexy romp had become tiresome. Emotionless. A into B\u2014</p><p>then B switches places and C goes into B. It was mechanical sex. No anticipation. No lingering touches or unexpected caresses or slow, sweet kisses. No...connection.</p><p>Christ. He must be a fucking wussy-loser if he\u2019d rather be rolling in the sheets playing kissy-face with some nameless woman than participating in a threesome with an uninhibited stripper.</p><p>The action increased. Kane pumped his hips, Jasmine started to come, Kane shouted and came.</p><p>Kade wondered if they\u2019d notice that he hadn\u2019t come. In fact, his dick was semi-soft.</p><p>Jasmine laughed, lifted off Kade\u2019s pole and rolled onto Kane, keeping his cock inside her, biting his neck like a pesky little dog.</p><p>Definitely time to go.</p> <p>He met his cousin at the door. A bleary eyed Colt swayed into the doorframe and swigged the last of the vodka, before tossing the bottle to the floor. \u201cYou leavin\u2019 already?</p><p>We\u2019re just gettin\u2019 started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wore me out. See you guys in the mornin\u2019.\u201d Kade showered and locked himself in his room. When he heard Jasmine screaming and the headboard banging into the wall again, he inserted his ear buds and cranked up his iPod.</p><p>The next morning Kade rolled out of bed at five-thirty. He started the coffee and shoveled down a bowl of Lucky Charms. The house was disgusting. Dirty dishes piled on the counters. Empty beer bottles and cans everywhere. The garbage overflowed in the corner. He was half-afraid he\u2019d see spent condoms and empty wrappers in the living room.</p><p>His brother stumbled in and headed straight for the coffee. \u201cMan. I\u2019m gonna be draggin\u2019 ass today. What\u2019re we doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad said fixin\u2019 fence and the baler.\u201d</p><p>Kane groaned.</p><p>\u201cWhose turn is it to clean up the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Colt\u2019s probably. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of it. He can clean the place up tonight after chores or I\u2019m changin\u2019 the locks and he can sleep in the fuckin\u2019 barn like the animal he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, like that\u2019ll happen. Think he said somethin\u2019 about Jasmine bringin\u2019 some friends over tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Then I won\u2019t be stickin\u2019 around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it to Dad today, but I told Uncle Darren I\u2019d check out the problems he\u2019s havin\u2019 with that old Chevy of Grandpop\u2019s. Uncle Harland ain\u2019t any help because he\u2019s tryin\u2019 to keep an eagle eye on Dag. I\u2019m surprised Dag wadn\u2019t here last night to join in the debauchery.\u201d</p><p>His brother scowled. \u201cHe and Colt got into it last week. Knock-down, drag-out fistfight at Ziggy\u2019s. Both drunk as shit. They ain\u2019t talkin\u2019. For now. Won\u2019t last. Hell, they neither one of \u2019em probably remember. Don\u2019t know which one of \u2019em is in worse shape.</p><p>They both drink too goddamn much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t the pot callin\u2019 the kettle black, is it, bro?\u201d</p><p>Kane shook his head. \u201cI know when to stop.\u201d</p><p>Kade studied his brother. They might look exactly alike, but contrary to what Jasmine said, it wasn\u2019t like looking in a mirror. He and Kane were polar opposites in many respects.</p><p>\u201cSo how was your date with...what was her name? You were home early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkylar? Nice woman.\u201d Kane stared into his coffee cup. \u201cToo nice if you know what I mean. Probably be a dozen dinner dates before I\u2019d get invited into her bed. I decided she wasn\u2019t worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting cynical. If it ain\u2019t easy, we don\u2019t want it. And if it\u2019s too easy, it ain\u2019t worth nothin\u2019 either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself. I like havin\u2019 pussy flashed in my face all the goddamn time.</p><p>And when did you designate yourself the moral compass for the whole damn house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I realized we\u2019re all headed the wrong damn direction, Kane.\u201d</p><p>Kane blinked with confusion. \u201cYou seem to be the only one who feels that way.\u201d</p><p>They finished the pot of coffee in silence.</p><p>Colt\u2019s bedroom door was still closed as they headed out. \u201cThink we oughta wake up Sleeping Beauty?\u201d Kane asked.</p><p>\u201cNah. He deserves to get his ass chewed by Uncle Carson if he shows up late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr by Colby.\u201d</p><p>Kade grinned. \u201cOr worse yet, by Cord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, that\u2019s just plain fuckin\u2019 mean, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as mean as me callin\u2019 Aunt Carolyn and tellin\u2019 her what an animal her son\u2019s become. If she sees this place she\u2019ll blow a gasket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but then she\u2019ll tell Ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost be worth it not to live in a pigsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo which one of us is gonna talk to him about all this crap?\u201d</p><p>Kane clapped his hat on his head. \u201cI\u2019ll do it, but you\u2019ll owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. Let me think on it and get back to you.\u201d</p><p>Kade scowled. \u201cI hate it when you say that.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWhy do you think I do it?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cYou wanna dance?\u201d</p><p>AJ smiled at the hunky cowboy. \u201cThanks, but no. I\u2019m sitting this one out.\u201d</p><p>A hopeful gleam lit his eyes. \u201cMaybe later then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d If things didn\u2019t go her way.</p><p>She crossed her legs and tugged her white mini-skirt. Pulled her lacy shirt down.</p><p>Damn thing kept riding up and exposing her lower back. Her boot tapped on the metal rung of the barstool in time to the music. She tried not to look anxious, but Lord, she\u2019d been waiting for this night her whole life.</p><p>Take a deep breath. He\u2019ll show.</p><p>What if he didn\u2019t? What if Cord McKay spent the day over-analyzing her offer like he over-analyzed everything else? She imagined him tooling around in his truck, doing chores, a look of concentration on his handsome face as he convinced himself he was too old for her. He had a kid to raise, a ranch to run and no time to be messing with his little sister\u2019s best friend.</p><p>But then AJ remembered how hot Cord\u2019s eyes burned every time he\u2019d looked at her last night. He wanted her, but he didn\u2019t want to want her.</p><p>Too bad. If he did show up, she\u2019d pull out all the stops and make herself impossible to resist.</p><p>She scanned the bar. Decent crowd tonight, lots of folks she knew. Then again, she\u2019d lived in Sundance, Wyoming since birth; there were few people she didn\u2019t know. She waved at Bebe shooting pool at one of the back tables. Smiled at her buddy Liza and her fianc\u00e9 Noah cozied up in a corner booth. When AJ spun back around, her pulse leapt. Her sexy fantasy man was chatting up the bouncers as he paid the cover charge.</p><p>Cord glanced up. Their eyes met. He moseyed along, checking things out.</p><p>She drained her beer, hoping he\u2019d come to check her out.</p><p>Cord stopped in front of her. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that.\u201d Her heart thumped wildly as his big frame practically cast her in shadow.</p><p>\u201cBuy you another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right here.\u201d</p><p>He ambled away, gifting her with a glimpse of his tight buns and muscular legs encased in dark blue Wranglers. A denim shirt stretched across his wide shoulders. Oh man. Just looking at him made her melt. What would it be like to touch him? Feel that rough skin all over hers?</p><p>Barely a minute passed before Cord was back. Maybe he was anxious too. He handed her a bottle and offered a toast. \u201cTo a new attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that.\u201d</p><p>He rested his elbow on the table and studied her face as if he\u2019d never seen her before.</p><p>\u201cYou look different.\u201d</p><p>AJ resisted the urge to smooth her hair or wet her lips. \u201cBad different? Or good different?\u201d</p><p>Cord\u2019s forceful gaze traveled from her mouth to her breasts and back to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely good. Very very good.\u201d</p><p>Her belly quivered.</p><p>\u201cSo, AJ...you weren\u2019t pullin\u2019 my leg last night?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou up for some fun and games?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth was so dry she just nodded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFlattered as I am... Why me? You gotta know any one of the young guys in here would kill to have a shot at you.\u201d</p><p>AJ broke eye contact and scraped at the label on her beer bottle. Shoot. How was she supposed to answer that without giving herself away?</p><p>Cord\u2019s rough hand curled over her wrist and he idly stroked her knuckles. Her stomach jumped again. She glanced up, overwhelmed by the lust in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cJesus. You have the sexiest mouth I\u2019ve ever seen. I can\u2019t think beyond tastin\u2019 that mole by the corner of your lips. Runnin\u2019 my tongue over it. Kissin\u2019 every inch of it on the way back to kissin\u2019 every inch of your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Warning. Don\u2019t let him sweet-talk you until you get a chance to speak your piece.</p><p>She blurted, \u201cDo you wanna dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the first time I put my hands on you, I want you close. Real close. Close as we can get with our clothes on without getting kicked out for lewd behavior.\u201d</p><p>The silence between them grew. AJ felt her confidence slipping. This was not the way she\u2019d envisioned her night of seduction.</p><p>Then take charge.</p><p>She finished the beer and hopped off the barstool. \u201cI want your hands on me now, Cord.\u201d She hooked her finger in his belt loop and towed him on the dance floor to the corner farthest away from the stage.</p><p>He placed his hot palm on the small of her back, urging her lower body against his, threading the fingers of his left hand through the fingers on her right.</p><p>AJ slowly dragged her palm up Cord\u2019s arm just to feel his muscles before she rested her hand on his shoulder. \u201cIsn\u2019t this better? We can make the music fit our mood, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems you\u2019re in a reckless mood.\u201d Cord stared at her, no hint of a smile. \u201cWhy\u2019re you flirtin\u2019 with me like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides that you are one hot, sexy cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. Are you playin\u2019 some kind of game with me? Seein\u2019 if you can get the old man hot and bothered and then flit away to laugh about it with your girlfriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Geez, Cord. You have such a high opinion of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust women in general?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>AJ let her fingers trace the ridge of his collarbone. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tease you. But I will admit I have an ulterior motive in flirting with you so shamelessly.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes hardened. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want something from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you to teach me everything you know about sex.\u201d</p><p>Pause. \u201cCome again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d like to come again and again.\u201d She smiled triumphantly at his stunned expression.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better be explainin\u2019 that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I know about sex is what I\u2019ve seen in the barnyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that and some porn.\u201d</p><p>He gave her another skeptical look. \u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re sharin\u2019 this information with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s sort of embarrassing. You are looking at the only twenty-two-year-old virgin in all of Crook County.\u201d</p><p>Cord quit moving, causing AJ to stumble into him. The man was rock solid. Heck, everything about him was firm and broad and hard. Very hard. Mostly his eyes right now.</p><p>\u201cThis is some kinda joke, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She predicted he\u2019d be suspicious, but mad? Yikes. She tried to snatch her hand from his to escape, like hightail it straight for the South Dakota border and not look back.</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t, baby doll. You don\u2019t get to tell me somethin\u2019 that fogs my damn brain over and then dart away like a scared rabbit. We are gonna discuss this, in detail, right now, since you brought it up, Amy Jo.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin defiantly. \u201cIt\u2019s AJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, AJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we keep dancing? You sorta stopped.\u201d</p><p>He spun them so his back was to the room. His deep blue eyes locked on hers.</p><p>\u201cLemme get this straight. You ain\u2019t never been naked with a man. Now that you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re ready to spread your gorgeous legs, you\u2019ve picked... me to be the lucky one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The muscle in his jaw snapped. He opened his mouth. Closed it. Finally he said,</p><p>\u201cChrist almighty, do you know what that does to me? Hell. You don\u2019t, because you\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can just say no, Cord.\u201d</p><p>His lips curled oh-so-slowly, in a decidedly predatory grin. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal: I don\u2019t wanna say no.\u201d</p><p>AJ froze.</p><p>\u201cKeep dancin\u2019, you sorta stopped,\u201d he teased.</p><p>Neither spoke for a few beats as they swayed together.</p><p>Cord placed his mouth to her ear. \u201cBut before I say yes, I\u2019m curious about a couple of things.\u201d</p><p>His hot breath sent shivers down her neck, tightening her nipples against his chest.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike why you\u2019re still untouched. Because if this is a religious issue and if you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for a preacher and a weddin\u2019 ring, I ain\u2019t your man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He sighed in her hair. \u201cThen why are you innocent? You are sexy as shit.</p><p>Don\u2019t pretend there ain\u2019t been men sniffin\u2019 around.\u201d</p><p>AJ angled her head to feel Cord\u2019s smoothly shaven jaw rub over her cheek. Mmm.</p><p>He smelled good. Warm skin beneath a hint of spicy aftershave. By the way his body tensed she figured he liked it when she rubbed him like a contented cat, so she kept right on doing it.</p><p>\u201cAJ? You gonna answer that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. When did you notice I was sexy as shit, Cord McKay?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cGot me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I haven\u2019t been with a guy before because\u201d\u2014 I was too busy working my ass off\u2014\u201cI didn\u2019t date in school. When Keely and I moved to Denver there were lots of guys sniffing around, but I was embarrassed to admit I\u2019d never done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 to be ashamed of. I still don\u2019t get why me. Lots of young fellas around here\u2014\u201d</p><p>AJ stopped dancing and jerked back from him.</p><p>But his iron grip didn\u2019t waver. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no, but do not try to convince me that Mikey is a better choice for my first lover than you. Don\u2019t treat me like a child who can\u2019t choose between a grape or a cherry lollipop. I\u2019ve thought this through. If you don\u2019t want a piece of me, say so and walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a piece of you, baby doll, like you wouldn\u2019t fuckin\u2019 believe. Just had to make sure this wasn\u2019t somethin\u2019 you decided on the spur of the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen c\u2019mere. You\u2019re gonna hafta get used to havin\u2019 your body against mine.\u201d Cord pulled her even closer. \u201cGet used to feelin\u2019 my hands on you. All over you. All the time.\u201d</p><p>Her hormones did the happy dance.</p><p>The band segued into a slow, mournful ballad and AJ\u2019s eyes drifted shut. She lost herself in the sensation of finally being where she\u2019d always dreamed: in Cord McKay\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cHow much experience do you have?\u201d Cord murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou ask a lot of questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect an answer to every damn one.\u201d His lips brushed her temple. \u201cWhere all\u2019ve you been kissed besides your pretty mouth?\u201d Cord\u2019s free hand slipped up her waist to her ribcage. His thumb lightly stroked the bottom swell of her breast before sweeping higher, across her nipple, until it was a hot, tight point. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched. \u201cAh. No.\u201d</p><p>He twirled them, dancing backward, smoothly inserting his leg between hers.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d He pressed up so she was riding his thigh. \u201cYou ever had a man\u2019s mouth tastin\u2019 your sweet spot?\u201d</p><p>AJ softly moaned at the exquisite pressure and heat of his hard muscles rubbing her tender flesh. The thought of his tongue licking there made her throb with want.</p><p>\u201cYes or no?\u201d he growled.</p><p>Dizzy, she managed, \u201cN-no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas any man ever touched this pussy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve touched yourself? Made yourself come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Cord hissed. \u201cYou\u2019re drivin\u2019 me crazy, thinkin\u2019 of all the things I\u2019m gonna do to you. How many different ways I can make you come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d AJ tightened her thighs around his. \u201cShow me it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember you said that.\u201d He blew softly in her ear and she shivered like a newborn babe. \u201cSoon as this song ends, I\u2019m goin\u2019 outside. Meet me by my truck in ten minutes.</p><p>This is between you and me. No one else needs to know what we\u2019re doin\u2019. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>The final drumbeat sounded and Cord eased away from her. AJ locked her knees to keep herself upright.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes. And you\u2019d better not be wearin\u2019 them sassy panties.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Cord hadn\u2019t known what\u2019d happen tonight. Hadn\u2019t been entirely sure she\u2019d even be here. He hadn\u2019t expected AJ to ask him to teach her about sex and he sure as hell hadn\u2019t expected her to be a virgin.</p><p>A virgin.</p><p>Sweet baby Jesus. Had he ever been with a virgin?</p><p>Not that he recalled.</p><p>So why was he considering bedding the virginal AJ? She knew nothing about taking and giving pleasure. In truth, who was he to talk? Cord hadn\u2019t been in a steady sexual relationship since his ex-wife left him. Sure, in the last couple of years he\u2019d slaked his lust on rare occasions, but did that qualify him to teach her?</p><p>Hell yes. Actually, it offered the perfect chance to prove to AJ (and himself) that screaming-raw-hot sex owed nothing to love\u2014just to lust and opportunity, both of which\u2019d been sadly lacking in his life lately. With Ky gone for the next few weeks...and AJ home temporarily...it was a win/win situation for them both. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Plus, being the first man to stroke that baby soft skin everywhere, to fuck that tight pussy with his fingers, his tongue, his cock. Those possibilities stirred primitive instincts he\u2019d never believed he owned.</p><p>Cord heard bootsteps to his left. He watched AJ\u2019s approach with open appreciation.</p><p>Damn. Her ample breasts swayed provocatively. Every roll of her slender hips sent the miniscule white skirt brushing across the tops of her thighs. Would she move that sinuously under him? On top of him? On her knees before him?</p><p>\u201cI thought you might\u2019ve changed your mind,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. It\u2019s just...\u201d Her gaze flicked from him, to the cab of his pickup, to the tailgate and back to him. \u201cWhere are we doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby doll, I ain\u2019t gonna throw you up against my truck and fuck you senseless for your first time.\u201d He grinned. \u201cBut that don\u2019t mean it ain\u2019t a future possibility.\u201d</p><p>AJ stared at him with those beautiful big silvery eyes.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere. Can\u2019t touch you when you\u2019re standin\u2019 so far away.\u201d</p><p>Cord offered his hand and walked backward until they were hidden in the space where the cab of his truck ended and the truck bed of his diesel pickup started. He curled his hands around her face, bringing her lush mouth to his.</p><p>She started to twine her arms around his neck. Cord growled, \u201cKeep those hands by your side \u2019til I say otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his lips back and forth over the curved warmth of hers, then kissed a path to the tempting mole. A couple of light tongue flicks and he returned to her succulent mouth.</p><p>AJ\u2019s breathing was erratic. She\u2019d licked her lips, leaving them moist and slightly parted. Cord darted his tongue inside, groaning at the sweet taste of mint and AJ. He angled her head, nibbling, licking, coaxing her tongue to play with his. She let him do whatever he wanted, but she wasn\u2019t the eager participant he\u2019d anticipated. \u201cYou gonna kiss me back, AJ?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were a stormy gray. \u201cNot if you don\u2019t let me use my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You can use\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then her hands were gripping his hair and she smashed her mouth to his.</p><p>No gentle exploratory kiss; she thrust her tongue in and devoured him. Tasting, sucking, God, biting, taking him to a whole new level of need with her hunger. AJ held nothing back, she kept kissing him harder, urging his mouth open wider, feeding him long, deep, wet kisses, touching his face, tugging his hair when he attempted to move away, stoking the fire higher until he was afraid he\u2019d combust in his Wranglers.</p><p>Cord ripped his mouth free. \u201cTo think I was crazy about your mouth before I knew you could use your mouth like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she panted against his throat. \u201cPlease don\u2019t stop. I want you. Kiss me again. And again. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face and took her mouth in a brutal show of possession.</p><p>AJ met his demands with unrestrained passion.</p><p>He bit a path up her jawline to her ear, keeping his body against hers. \u201cNeed to touch you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHands back by your sides. That ain\u2019t a request.\u201d Cord teased her with fleeting, soft kisses, his hands slid down her throat to the buttons on her blouse. He unhooked them one by one, dragging his callused fingertips from the smooth skin of her belly to her bra.</p><p>He sprung the front clasp and peeled the lacy cups back. Her heavy breasts filled his waiting hands.</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cCord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me.\u201d His rough thumbs strummed her nipples. \u201cGod, you\u2019re so pretty. All creamy and soft and sweet.\u201d He rubbed his goatee and openmouthed kisses across the upper swells of her breasts. Cord curled his tongue around a rigid tip.</p><p>AJ arched into him.</p><p>\u201cLike that?\u201d He lapped and licked and blew a stream of air across the wet buds, but never sucked them completely. He glanced up at her when she made a frustrated noise.</p><p>Her top teeth dug into her bottom lip in her effort not to cry out. Yet her curious gaze remained on him.</p><p>Cord bent his head and suckled her. Hard. Deep. Thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cOh. I really like that.\u201d</p><p>He switched sides, taking his time, losing himself in her taste and the feel of her in his mouth. She writhed when he pushed the soft mounds of flesh together to tongue both nipples at the same time. \u201cI wanna suck these as you\u2019re ridin\u2019 me. I wanna feel these tips diggin\u2019 into my thighs as you put your mouth on me. Do you want that, AJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She bumped her hips to his; her body knew what it needed even if she wasn\u2019t sure how to get it.</p><p>As Cord kissed his way up to her neck, his hand inched down to the hem of her skirt.</p><p>A few teasing strokes and his fingers crept up the inside of her silky thigh.</p><p>AJ\u2019s whole body tensed.</p><p>\u201cOpen your legs for me, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, allowing her head to fall back against the truck as her knees widened.</p><p>His fingers brushed her naked, damp sex. \u201cYou did take off them sexy panties. Good sign that you obeyed me.\u201d He nibbled on her ear. \u201cYou are wet. Means you like what I\u2019m doin\u2019 to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open.</p><p>Cord swirled his middle finger around her opening, coating it with her juices before he pushed it inside, greedily watching her face to see her response to the intrusion.</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>\u201cDoes that hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no.\u201d</p><p>He pumped his finger in and out a couple of times before he added a second finger.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I...don\u2019t know. It feels good, but I want...more. Even when I don\u2019t know what more is.\u201d</p><p>He thrust his fingers deeper and swept his thumb across her clit. \u201cThis kinda more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That feels so good.\u201d</p><p>Cord latched on to her right nipple, suckling strongly, twisting his fingers inside her, increasing the friction on her clit. His cock was hard as a baseball bat, and he was tempted to grind it into her hip, but the only thing he cared about was making her come.</p><p>Watching her come.</p><p>Her legs shook. She started to moan. He softly bit down on her nipple. And AJ lost it. Her clit throbbed beneath his thumb. She squeezed her legs together trying to shove his fingers deeper into her channel. Her fingernails pierced the back of his neck as she urged his head closer.</p><p>It was one of the hottest things he\u2019d ever seen and he\u2019d forgotten her hands were supposed to be by her sides. So fucking unbelievable he was the first man to touch her this way.</p><p>Cord waited until she\u2019d caught her breath before he removed his hand from between her legs.</p><p>She peeked at him from beneath lowered lashes, smiling shyly. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>He pinned her arms by her side and kissed her for several long minutes. \u201cCome home with me. There\u2019s lots more I can wow you with tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want this, and I want you. I\u2019m not playing hard to get, Cord. But the reason I\u2019m home is to take care of my mom. Jenn and I trade off, depending on her schedule. She\u2019s been there all afternoon and she\u2019s leaving at eleven. Someone has to stay with Mom in case she needs something and tonight that\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Cord stared at her as she refastened her bra and buttoned her blouse. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d planned on talking to you earlier, but I forgot while we were dancing. And then we came out here and, Lord, I couldn\u2019t think straight when you started touching me.</p><p>See?\u201d She laughed and pointed at the crooked row of buttons. \u201cSo I understand if you\u2019ve changed your mind and wanna back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no, I\u2019m not backin\u2019 out. I have a ranch to run during the day anyway. Can you come to me at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably right after supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd every night after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I want all right. We need to talk about somethin\u2019 else anyway.\u201d He shoved his hand through his hair and paced. \u201cI ain\u2019t about to ruin your reputation and mine because once we start this, I know I can\u2019t keep my hands off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, yes that\u2019s bad. I can just hear the goddamn cradle robber jokes. So what happens between us stays between us and will be conducted in private. No exceptions.</p><p>We ain\u2019t gonna go dancin\u2019 or out to dinner. And it\u2019s all gotta end when Ky comes home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be headed back to school around then anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough. As far as birth control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the pill.\u201d</p><p>Cord stopped moving. \u201cA virgin on the pill? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout six months ago I was having some female issues and our school health clinician advised I get on the pill.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNo condoms. I\u2019m down with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are...clean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Cord slapped his hands beside her shoulders, caging her in. \u201cSomethin\u2019 else you oughta consider, AJ. I\u2019m demanding in bed. Very demanding. Since we\u2019ll only be spendin\u2019 a few hours a day together, I\u2019ll expect all that time will be naked time. And you better be prepared to say yes to whatever I ask or tell you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin reason.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cGot a few conditions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I won\u2019t be cooking, cleaning, washing clothes, dishes or floors\u2014even if you have some master/slave fantasy and command me to do it naked.\u201d Her silvery eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t heard the rumors about the wild McKay men and their appetite for kink, threesomes and whatever. No multiples. Just you and me. That\u2019s it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDeal. But that means you will give me control. If I\u2019m teachin\u2019 you, we\u2019ll do it my way. Anything I want, any way I want, any time, any place.\u201d Cord layered his body to hers, rubbing his cock into the soft notch between her thighs. \u201cFeel how hard I am? You did that to me, baby doll. I\u2019m gonna have to go home and jack off in the shower, imaginin\u2019 it\u2019s your hand around my cock. So when you come to me tomorrow, you\u2019ll owe me one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to pay up.\u201d AJ gave him a flirty kiss and vanished into the night.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, what time did your sister say she\u2019d be here?\u201d</p> <p>AJ glanced at the clock. Jenn was over an hour late. \u201cYou know she always runs behind.\u201d</p><p>And of all the days for Jenn to be late...AJ should\u2019ve been at Cord\u2019s house thirty minutes ago. Just thinking about what he might have planned made her heart race.</p><p>She slapped a lid on the goulash and wiped down the counters. Done. She\u2019d be in her Jeep the second Jenn and her kids arrived.</p><p>AJ carried the mug of tea to the living room, which had become a hospital room since her mother\u2019s accident. A big adjustable bed inhabited the space, seeming out of place in a room fraught with doilies, lace, and ruffles. AJ\u2019s stomach clenched to see her stalwart mother bedridden. She\u2019d never thought of Florence Foster as old\u2014even though she\u2019d recently turned seventy-one.</p><p>Age was merely a number, but AJ couldn\u2019t deny her mom was getting on in years.</p> <p>Her mother looked at least a decade younger than her biological age, but AJ noticed Florence slowing down when she\u2019d come home for visits in the last year.</p><p>Work-roughened hands reached for the mug. \u201cThank you. You\u2019re the best daughter ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that because I don\u2019t fight over the remote with you the way Jenn does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does she see in those blasted reality shows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats me.\u201d AJ smoothed the bedcovers and straightened the stack of Western Horseman magazines. \u201cYou need an extra pair of socks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop fussing, child. Lord, you\u2019re as bad as me. Now I understand how smothered you must\u2019ve felt all those years.\u201d</p> <p>AJ looked up. \u201cWhat years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were growing up, but your daddy and I couldn\u2019t help it, sugar. We were just so thrilled to have you in our life, our surprise baby, my early menopause gift. And how did we repay you? By slavin\u2019 you during your teen years.\u201d Her mother\u2019s eyes teared up behind her glasses.</p><p>\u201cMama, you trying to make me cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just feeling like an old fool. You finally get off the ranch to start your life and now you\u2019re back here again, stuck taking care of me.\u201d</p><p>She handed her a Kleenex. \u201cMy life didn\u2019t \u2018start\u2019 when I went to school in Denver.</p><p>My life has always been right here. So stop feeling guilty or I\u2019ll gorge on all the brownies to comfort myself.\u201d AJ kissed her crinkled brow. \u201cStuck. As if. Glad I still have you to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I miss your daddy every day too.\u201d</p><p>Jenn\u2019s minivan zipped up the driveway.</p> <p>\u201cI imagine you\u2019ll be off now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised Liza I\u2019d swing by and look at a couple of wedding things.\u201d A white lie.</p><p>Better than the truth of Cord McKay having his wicked way with her.</p><p>Her eight-year-old niece, Krista, shuffled in followed by her six-year-old nephew, Mason, and four-year-old Ariel. They plopped on the couch without a word\u2014which was not normal.</p><p>\u201cGuys? Why so glum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I left Alan,\u201d Jenn said from the doorway.</p><p>AJ glanced up. Jenn\u2019s face resembled a puffer-fish. Her eyes were bloodshot from crying.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys eat the ice cream bars I brought outside while I talk to Grandma and Aunt Amy Jo.\u201d</p><p>The kids escaped out the porch door.</p><p>\u201cYou left Alan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t left us first.\u201d Jenn snagged a tissue and dabbed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m tired of him being on the road all the time. Alan told me if a dispatch position opened up he\u2019d take it. The money is better and he\u2019d be home every night. Guess what? I found out he turned one down. Last year. He didn\u2019t even talk to me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. So is it okay if the kids and I stay here for awhile, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, you know this is your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Jenn said to AJ, \u201cWill you help me unload some of the stuff from the van?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d AJ looked at her mother. \u201cWill you be okay for a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Send in my babies with some of that ice cream. We\u2019ll snuggle up and have some Disney therapy.\u201d</p><p>Once they were outside, Jenn collapsed against AJ and sobbed.</p><p>AJ wanted to cry along with her, but she\u2019d have to be the strong one in the family.</p><p>Again. She should be used to it by now.</p><p>Jenn pushed back and wiped her face. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to be sorry about.\u201d AJ unloaded suitcases and boxes. \u201cWhere is everybody gonna sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d take Mama and Daddy\u2019s room since she\u2019s not sleeping in there. I\u2019ll put Krista and Ariel upstairs next to you, and Mason in the spare room, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d They carried everything into the house.</p><p>\u201cI need a drink.\u201d Jenn opened the liquor cabinet. \u201cWanna get drunk with me? I can give you all the reasons why you shouldn\u2019t ever get married.\u201d</p><p>AJ glanced at the clock. \u201cLook, sis, I have something I need to do tonight. It\u2019ll take an hour, hour and a half tops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving? But...\u201d Jenn\u2019s eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can. I promise. Then we can stay up and talk as late as you want.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and knocked back a slug of Jim Beam.</p><p>AJ grabbed her purse and was out the door.</p><p>Took ten minutes to reach Cord McKay\u2019s place.</p><p>AJ parked in front of the big house and stayed in the car, telling herself she was admiring the stunning structure, but in truth, she was scared. How would Cord react when she told him she couldn\u2019t stick around tonight? After she\u2019d bailed last night? She couldn\u2019t stand it if she\u2019d waited all this time only to have him change his mind because their damn schedules didn\u2019t mesh.</p><p>After she knocked on the screen door, he yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s open.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated in the foyer. \u201cCord?\u201d</p><p>He poked his head out and pointed to the receiver next to his ear and gave her the five-minute sign.</p><p>AJ wandered into the kitchen. She\u2019d been in this gorgeous house many times, but never when Ky wasn\u2019t underfoot. The place was huge and she knew from listening to Keely that Cord\u2019s ex-wife had demanded he build her a brand new log house with all the amenities when she\u2019d agreed to relocate to Wyoming. The house boasted a formal living room and dining room, a family room, a huge master bedroom and bathroom, five bedrooms, four bathrooms, a state of the art kitchen and an outdoor hot tub. But even the ostentatious house hadn\u2019t been enough to keep her around.</p><p>How could she walk away from the spectacular vista of gold and green fields against the backdrop of the pine-covered hills spread out beyond the sliding glass door? The view was more amazing than the house, in AJ\u2019s opinion.</p><p>Bootsteps on the wooden floors stopped behind her. \u201cSorry. I was talkin\u2019 to Ky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to be all right. They\u2019re goin\u2019 on a boat ride in the sound tomorrow, so he\u2019s pretty excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Dad doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss the squirt like I lost my right arm.\u201d</p><p>She continued to stare out the window. \u201cThis is such a beautiful view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one good thing about this damn monstrosity.\u201d Cord placed his hands on her shoulders. She jumped. \u201cRelax. What\u2019s got you so tense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily stuff. Jenn and the kids showed up, which I expected. I didn\u2019t expect her to tell me she\u2019d left her husband.\u201d</p><p>Cord\u2019s hands fell away.</p><p>Was it an automatic reaction because it brought to mind the demise of his own marriage? \u201cI\u2019m not surprised, things have been bad for awhile. Alan is constantly on the road driving truck. When he is home he\u2019s not much of a husband or father. Jenn\u2019s always pretended things\u2019d get better, but she found out he lied to her and she\u2019s fed up. She and the kids are moving in with us while she makes some decisions.\u201d</p><p>After awhile Cord said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. She needs me tonight, so I can\u2019t stay.\u201d</p><p>Cord spun her to face him. Then his hands were in her hair and his mouth was hot and demanding on hers. She sank into the kiss, twining her arms around his neck, threading her fingers through his damp hair. He herded her until her spine hit the counter.</p><p>\u201cWait, I have to go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drove all the way over here to tell me you can\u2019t stay?\u201d He nuzzled the skin below her ear. \u201cYou could\u2019ve called. Which leads me to believe you want to stick around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. But I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will stay.\u201d</p><p>His low sexy voice reverberated throughout her entire body. \u201cCord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty minutes.\u201d He tipped her chin up to gaze into her eyes. \u201cYou owe me, baby doll. I\u2019ve been thinkin\u2019 all damn day \u2019bout how bad I want your hands on me. And with the way I feel right now, it\u2019s gonna last thirty seconds.\u201d He kissed the corners of her mouth. \u201cWhich still gives us twenty-nine minutes and thirty seconds to mess around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that, um, enough time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you? Not nearly.\u201d He reversed their positions and his back rested against the counter. \u201cYou want me to teach you about sex and how to satisfy a man\u2019s needs, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndo my pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>Oh wow. Even though she\u2019d been waiting to get her hands on him forever, AJ\u2019s hands shook as she unbuckled his belt. She fumbled with the top button of his jeans.</p><p>After several frustrating attempts, she pressed her forehead to his chest, feeling embarrassed, feeling...virginal. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now, you\u2019re doin\u2019 fine.\u201d</p><p>She chanced a look at him. God, he was gorgeous. His rugged face defined masculine ferocity\u2014the hard angular edge of his jaw, and his jagged cheekbones. His blue eyes burned indigo with lust. His goatee and mustache was the perfect frame for his perfectly kissable full lips. She wanted him so much. How could she prove it? \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>He pecked her on the forehead. \u201cI plan to spend hours kissin\u2019 you, but I wanna see the look on your face when you see my cock for the first time.\u201d</p><p>Heat flooded AJ\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAh, you are so goddamn sweet when you blush like that. It\u2019s sexy as hell.\u201d</p><p>Buoyed by his enthusiasm, she reached for the tab on his zipper and tugged it down.</p><p>Her palm brushed the firm lump off to the left. She stroked it, amazed she could feel heat through the denim.</p><p>Cord sucked in a harsh breath.</p><p>AJ wrenched his pants legs until the jeans were down around his knees, leaving him in his navy blue boxer briefs. She grinned. \u201cI expected Superman underwear like Ky\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man of steel ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 on me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of looks that way.\u201d She slipped her fingers under the elastic band and stopped.</p><p>\u201cTake off your T-shirt first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna see you mostly naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember you said that when my turn comes around.\u201d Cord whipped the navy cotton over his head and chucked it on the floor.</p><p>Her eyes bugged out. \u201cNo wonder you always wear a shirt. Keeps the bulls from chasin\u2019 after you as well as the lovesick sows. Lord. I could just eat you up.\u201d AJ pressed a kiss above the brown nipple, then rubbed her lips over that smooth, warm flesh, amazed by how fast it puckered.</p> <p>Rough male hands curled over her cheeks. \u201cFocus, AJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saying the only part of you I can touch is your...?\u201d</p><p>One dark eyebrow winged up. \u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour...you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay the word, baby doll. You\u2019re gonna be handlin\u2019 it soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cock.\u201d When he pulled his underwear to his knees her eyes bugged out again.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>Cord didn\u2019t say a word. He just watched her.</p><p>AJ ran her finger up the pulsing vein from root to tip. She drew circles on the purplish head and the whole shaft jerked against his flat belly. A bead of clear liquid covered the slit. She wrapped her hand around the girth and squeezed. Hard, not unlike steel, but smooth. And hot. Heat singed her palm, zinging from his cock right to her core as if an electric current flowed between them. She moved her fist down to the thick base and back to the top.</p><p>He hissed.</p><p>She looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cJesus. You should see your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they look scared? I don\u2019t know how to tell you this, Cord, but I don\u2019t think this is gonna fit in me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cOh, it\u2019ll fit. It\u2019ll be the perfect fit, trust me.\u201d</p><p>AJ released him, letting her fingers lightly trace the length from tip to root. Touching him was making her wet and squirmy. She reached down to feel his balls. \u201cAre they always this hard and tight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when I\u2019m about to blow.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to see him blow. \u201cShow me how to make you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d Cord kissed her first, encouraging her to keep touching him by kissing her harder when she did something he liked. Then he broke his mouth free, reaching along the countertop for a bottle of olive oil and uncapped it. \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d He dribbled a few drops on her palm. \u201cSaliva is a better lubricant, but this\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>Another wave of heat blasted her as she imagined tasting him, feeling the velvety skin of that stiff rod sliding between her lips and across her tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me. You wanna know what it\u2019ll be like to have my cock in your mouth, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d</p><p>AJ gripped the base of his shaft and stroked up with her whole hand. \u201cTell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doin\u2019 it. Go a little faster. Yeah. Like that. Don\u2019t squeeze too hard unless you\u2019re tryin\u2019 to keep me from comin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. Why would I want to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t. Not this time anyway. Keep it a steady pace until I tell you to move faster. Sweep your thumb over the spot below the slit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis spot?\u201d She rubbed back and forth over the spot where the cockhead split into the shaft.</p><p>\u201cBaby doll, that feels good.\u201d</p><p>What a heady sense of power; her hand could make him whimper. Could make him thrust his hips at her for more. Why, she could probably make this big bad cowboy...beg.</p><p>Ooh and she\u2019d take such pride in cracking his tough-guy mask.</p><p>\u201cGimme that mouth,\u201d he growled, swooping down to inhale her in a sizzling meeting of lips and tongues.</p><p>Somehow she kept a uniform rhythm as he scrambled her brain with his tongue-tangling kiss until he groaned.</p><p>\u201cFaster.\u201d Cord tipped his head back. \u201cMore. Like that. Jesus. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>AJ alternated between watching his face and her hand.</p><p>\u201cHere it comes.\u201d</p><p>His cock spasmed and thick creamy liquid streamed out, landing on his belly. He arched his neck, losing himself in the moment. His fingers gripped the counter behind him until his knuckles turned white as the last spurts flowed over her hand.</p><p>She thought she might be embarrassed by the nitty gritty bodily functions of sex. But she was awestruck by the primal need his climax had brought out in her.</p><p>Cord opened his eyes. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can let go of my dick now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d AJ squeezed his shaft and he hissed again. \u201cYou\u2019re still hard. I want you to teach me some more. Show me some more. God, Cord, show me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have time. Please. I have this ache low in my\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth slammed down on hers. He kissed her until she was woozy. \u201cClothes. Off.</p><p>Now.\u201d</p><p>Her tank top hit the floor. AJ unhooked her bra, kicked her boots away, slid out of her jeans and panties.</p><p>Cord was as naked as she was when he reached for her. Then they were on the floor with Cord on top.</p><p>Oh yes, this was what she wanted, his need as escalated as hers. That heady give-it-to-me-now sensation of lust.</p><p>As his hungry mouth suckled her right breast, his hand swept over her mound and he thrust two fingers inside her pussy.</p><p>A low groan rumbled from him and vibrated against her chest. \u201cYou\u2019re so ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen put it in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I will get you off, but I am not makin\u2019 love to you for the first time on the goddamn kitchen floor, AJ. You\u2019ve waited this long, you can wait another damn day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo something!\u201d</p><p>He pinned her hands above her head. \u201cSpread your legs.\u201d</p><p>The second she was in place, he dragged his cock from the root to the tip down her cleft, keeping constant friction on her clit.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that? How \u2019bout this?\u201d He thrust faster.</p><p>\u201cOh-man-oh-man-oh-man.\u201d</p><p>Cord kissed her as he steadily rocked. And rocked. Sliding. Gliding. Changing the tempo until she was begging without saying a word.</p><p>The sensation of his solid weight, his scorching body heat and his seductive mouth, coupled with the exquisite pressure between her legs, overwhelmed her and she exploded.</p><p>When the last pulse in her clit slowed, Cord stilled. His cock jerked against her stomach leaving behind a pool of warmth.</p><p>She tried to level her breathing, but it was impossible with two hundred pounds of amorous cowboy squeezing every bit of air from her lungs.</p><p>Not that she was complaining.</p><p>Cord raised up on his elbows only high enough to suck on her nipples. \u201cHave I mentioned how much I like your tits?\u201d Using his teeth to pull her nipple into a long point, he watched it shrink and repeated the process on the other side. \u201cI could suck on them, play with them, fuck them all day long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does that work?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. How would you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck them?\u201d He grinned. \u201cI could tell you, but I\u2019d rather show you.\u201d He smooched her nose. \u201cOnce you get goin\u2019 you really ain\u2019t shy at all, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d AJ trailed her fingers over his chin. \u201cLord you have a sexy mouth, a sexy everything, Cord McKay. I like the way your facial hair feels on my skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of how good it\u2019s gonna feel rubbin\u2019 between your thighs as I\u2019m kissin\u2019 your sweet spot, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>She shivered with want.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we oughta get off the floor, huh?\u201d Cord eased back, snatched a kitchen towel and cleaned them up. Neither spoke as they dressed.</p><p>As AJ passed the hall mirror she caught sight of her reflection and nearly shrieked.</p><p>Tangled hair. Red and puffy lips. Bright eyes. She was an absolute mess.</p><p>Cord tugged her away from primping. \u201cYou look like a woman should, tousled and sexy, satisfied from good lovin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>AJ froze at the word \u201clovin\u2019\u201d.</p><p>Using that word doesn\u2019t mean he loves you.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Her eyes studied his. \u201cNo regrets? You don\u2019t look at me and feel guilty for messing around with the Swiss Miss Instant Cocoa Girl?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He scowled. \u201cNo. Who the hell ever said that about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother Colby called me that one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider the source. Colby\u2019s a bonehead. That ain\u2019t what I see at all when I look at you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, what do you see when you look at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Amy Jo, my son\u2019s babysitter. When I noticed you dancin\u2019 at the Golden Boot in that shamelessly brazen miniskirt and them naughty red panties, I started thinkin\u2019 of you in terms of us naked together. A lot.\u201d</p><p>Better than she\u2019d hoped.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see when you look at me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA hot rancher with a killer body, a wicked smile and even more wicked hands. A good man I trust.\u201d A man I\u2019ve been in love with my whole damn life.</p> <p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m too old for you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say experienced, not old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.

But your thirty minutes are up, so it\u2019ll have to wait until tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t make it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou will be here. We have a deal.

It\u2019ll give you wrinkles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d go with the gray hair Ky\u2019s givin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>She put her fingers over his lips. \u201cNot another word about being old.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Kade volunteered for all the shit jobs around the McKay ranch. He\u2019d avoided his brother and Colt when they weren\u2019t working, even crashing at his folks\u2019 house because sleeping at the Boars Nest made him uneasy.</p> <p>Part of him wondered if what he\u2019d seen really happened or if it was just another weird-assed dream fueled by alcohol.</p><p>Resting his forearm on the pitchfork, he took a breather and allowed his mind to drift. The night after the threesome with Jazz, he\u2019d gone out with his cousin Dag and they\u2019d returned to a house filled with drunken strangers. Dead tired, he\u2019d dropped into bed. Dag had decided to stick around.</p><p>A few hours later Kade had stumbled to the kitchen for a bottle of water when he saw two naked bodies fucking on the living room floor.</p><p>Guys. Going at it like animals.</p><p>A skinny man was on his knees with his bony white ass hiked high in the air, his arms stretched above his head on the floor, wrists tied with a bandana and a gag shoved in his mouth. It was so dark Kade couldn\u2019t see his face.</p><p>A bruiser with a crew cut was jacking off the skinny guy as he fucked his captive in the ass so savagely they both skidded across the carpet with dual groans of satisfaction.</p><p>By that time Kade decided he wasn\u2019t so thirsty after all. He returned to bed. No sign of the horny guys in the morning, so he wondered if it hadn\u2019t been some kind of homosexual dream. He sure wasn\u2019t gonna ask Kane or Dag or Colt if they\u2019d seen it and have them tease him for fucking ever about it.</p><p>Not that he could give a shit what went on behind people\u2019s bedroom doors in their own houses. But if what he\u2019d seen had been real? And going down front and center in his house? Different story.</p><p>His family would be appalled if they knew about the circus-like sexual situations happening at the Boars Nest on a regular basis. His cheeks burned with shame. What had he been thinking, fucking a total stranger? Then a threesome? Followed by another threesome with his twin? He didn\u2019t want to live his life being just another \u201cwild McKay boy\u201d and the butt of jokes in four counties. Kade worried no decent woman would want him if she ever got wind of his previous sexual antics.</p><p>If he was completely honest, the debauchery had stopped being fun a while ago. And it seemed the chances of him ever finding a decent woman in this small community, who not only didn\u2019t know about his every past sexual conquest, or who wouldn\u2019t automatically mix him up with his twin brother, were slim to none. He\u2019d learned enough from Cord\u2019s failed marriage that a city girl wouldn\u2019t fit here either. Basically, he was screwed on the relationship front. Not that any woman would probably believe him if he admitted he was more than ready to settle down.</p><p>With a sigh, he got back to work. There was always plenty of work on the McKay ranch.</p><p>An hour later his brother Kane called in his favor, sending him on an errand to the next town thirty-five miles from home for some special kind of lotion their mother used.</p><p>Kade parallel parked in front of DeWitt\u2019s Pharmacy. He wandered around until he found the display\u2014Sky Blue\u2014all natural ingredients\u2014locally made.</p><p>Right. Another freakazoid, Birkenstock-wearing, organic type who invaded Wyoming to bilk gullible ladies like his mama into buying beauty junk they didn\u2019t need.</p><p>He picked up a bottle of lotion. Nineteen bucks? Holy crap. He was definitely in the wrong business.</p><p>He noticed a bar of soap with the same scent as the lotion. After a quick look around to make sure no one was spying on him, he picked it up and sniffed. Not bad. Kind of tangy. Lemony. He added a can of motor oil and a package of mousetraps to the cart just so he didn\u2019t look like a total fucking pussy to the cashier.</p><p>Kade stood on the sidewalk debating on whether to have lunch first before heading home. Click click sounded and he turned to the woman in heels storming toward him.</p><p>Mercy. She was all curves: hips, ass, thighs, and breasts. He loved women who looked like women and not a skeleton with skin. Her straight brown hair had a hint of red in the bright sunlight. Kade stepped out of her way, figuring she\u2019d pass right on by.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Miss Sexy Curves bumped her pointy-toed purple shoes against his shit-covered boots and glared. \u201cYou were a total jerk to me the other night, Kane McKay. I don\u2019t appreciate you ditching me at the restaurant. What kind of shithead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Wait a second. I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014the least bit sorry, yeah, I can tell. Why are you here? Trolling for some woman who\u2019ll give you a piece of ass on the first date since I wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>That fucker Kane was such an asshole. Times like this it plain sucked they were identical twins and few people could tell them apart. This woman must be Kane\u2019s date from the other night.</p><p>His brother was an idiot too. How had he walked away from such a smoking hot firecracker?</p><p>\u201cGot nothing to say, McKay?\u201d</p><p>And he had a really good idea on what he wanted to say, and how to make this right.</p><p>No. It was a bad idea. A terrible idea.</p><p>The devil on his shoulder said: Do it. You and Kane used to switch places all the time. You\u2019re not misleading her; you\u2019re protecting the McKay name from another bit of damaging gossip.</p><p>\u201cActually, I do have somethin\u2019 to say to you.\u201d What the hell was her name again?</p><p>Something hippyishly weird. Aha. \u201cSkylar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I lost your number or I woulda called to apologize for bein\u2019 a first class jerk. But I\u2019d taken some allergy medicine and lordy, did it do a number on me. Normally I don\u2019t act like that. Not that I remember a whole helluva lot besides goin\u2019 home and crashin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Skylar looked at him skeptically.</p><p>\u201cCan I make it up to you? Buy you lunch? I swear I won\u2019t run out again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You don\u2019t mind vegetarian?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Kade slapped on a fake smile. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>She laughed; it made him think of bells. \u201cYou are such a liar. Your family raises cattle. You probably shoot vegetarians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if they\u2019re part of PETA protestin\u2019 inhuman treatment of our stock. That pisses us off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, I eat salad. Not crazy about tofu. Or beans ground up and passed off as burgers. A burger is supposed to be meat. Beans are only good in tacos and chili.\u201d Kade looked up. Damn. He\u2019d been babbling.</p><p>Her lips curled in a cat-like smile. \u201cToo bad you weren\u2019t this honest the other night. I know just the place. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Later that same afternoon Cord pushed back his hat and wiped the sweat from his brow. He looked over at his brother, who was doing more leaning in the back of the truck than working.</p><p>\u201cPull the lead out, Colt. I ain\u2019t got all goddamn day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut me some slack. I\u2019m whupped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly reason you\u2019re whupped is because you were up late last night fuckin\u2019 around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d</p><p>Not since he\u2019d been doing some fucking around himself, but no way would he share that with his smartass brother. \u201cNo. I\u2019m pissed. You\u2019ve been draggin\u2019 ass more than usual lately. I\u2019m sick of carryin\u2019 your share of the load.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of us have a life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could have a life if I wasn\u2019t so busy workin\u2019 my ass off so you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Colt straightened up and rested on the pitchfork. \u201cGot somethin\u2019 to say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sayin\u2019 it. Show up for work on time, Colt. Not hungover, not fuckin\u2019 whinin\u2019 like a toddler. And while you\u2019re at it, maybe you oughta think about the fact this is a small county. Some of the sex shit you and Kane and Kade are doin\u2019 with every woman in the tri-county area is gettin\u2019 around and before long it\u2019ll get back to Ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Like you have a right to talk. Why do you think everyone says \u2018them wild McKay boys\u2019\u2014you and Colby and Quinn wrote the damn book on bad behavior. I\u2019m just sowin\u2019 my oats, same as you guys done.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWrong.

I\u2019m gonna kick your smart ass, punk.\u201d</p> <p>Colt tossed the pitchfork aside. \u201cCome on up here and try it.\u201d</p><p>Just about that time, Colby galloped up on his horse. He reined between the two pickups and the two angry brothers. \u201cWhat the hell is goin\u2019 on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Colt. Better yet, why don\u2019t you ask him what he\u2019s done today?

I\u2019m done anyway.\u201d Colt climbed in his truck and roared off.</p><p>Cord stared after his shithead brother, mentally cataloging half a dozen crappy jobs for him to do tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really goin\u2019 on with him? Why\u2019s he bein\u2019 so damn ornery?\u201d</p><p>Cord relayed what he\u2019d seen in the Golden Boot. \u201cOnly thing he cares about is gettin\u2019 laid and gettin\u2019 drunk.

I ain\u2019t doin\u2019 any more than what I usually do\u2014which just proves that Colt ain\u2019t been doin\u2019 his share. Not just this week, either.

I even talked to Kade since he lives with him, see if he noticed anything.</p><p>Kade don\u2019t see nothin\u2019 wrong, so I dropped it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou done here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas \u2019bout to head home. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanning told me to ask you to supper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe feelin\u2019 better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Still sick as a dog. Doc says it\u2019ll pass next month. Ma says it\u2019ll pass next month.\u201d He scrubbed a hand over his jaw. \u201cHard to be excited when she\u2019s so miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gets better. And I\u2019ll bet she\u2019s happy even when she\u2019s throwin\u2019 up.\u201d</p><p>Colby smiled. \u201cTrue. Anyway, she knows you\u2019re missin\u2019 Ky, we\u2019re missin\u2019 him too.</p><p>So you wanna come over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Tell the mama-to-be thanks and I\u2019ll wait \u2019til she\u2019s feelin\u2019 up to company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough. You care if I hang around tomorrow and keep an eye on Colt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it. I\u2019m runnin\u2019 behind. Again.\u201d</p><p>Cord threw his tools in the back of his truck and started the drive home. The summer air was heavy with heat. Gnats buzzed around his head. Burrs stuck to his clothes. He was hungry. Dirty. Still, this was his favorite part of ranching, gazing across his spread, knowing he\u2019d accomplished something important during the long hours he\u2019d spent outdoors.</p><p>About this time he looked forward to cleaning up. Having a bite to eat with his son.</p><p>Playing games or watching TV before wrestling Ky into bed.</p><p>But after he\u2019d tucked Ky in for the night...that\u2019s when he felt lonely on occasion.</p><p>Not a constant ache, more along the lines of a distant memory of the throb of a broken finger. Seemed he\u2019d been alone so long he was used to it.</p><p>Yet, Cord wouldn\u2019t be alone tonight. AJ would be rolling in. AJ with her big silver eyes. AJ with her sweet smile and inquisitive nature. AJ with her hungry kisses and look of wonder.</p><p>How could she be both innocent and daring? Why had she picked him, a cranky old man with no life, according to his brother, to initiate her into the pleasures between the sheets?</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t AJ chosen Colt? He was closer to her in age. More charming. Probably had a lot of experience breaking in virgins.</p><p>But Cord knew if his brother so much as looked at AJ with lust in his eyes he\u2019d beat the living shit out of him.</p><p>Lord. Part of him was plain nervous. Just how was he supposed to pop her cherry?</p><p>Candlelight, soft music, champagne and a slow seduction? Did he have the patience to create an elaborate scene?</p><p>No. But what if that was how she\u2019d dreamed it would be?</p><p>He\u2019d never been a romantic guy. Maybe he oughta take her hard and fast in the heat of passion. Then they could try some of the more interesting scenarios he\u2019d been thinking up when he\u2019d been alone out on the range all day.</p><p>No matter what cues she gave him, Cord knew tonight was the night and he better get a move on.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>After Cord returned home, his dad swung by. They talked about the worsening situation with Colt. Discussing plans for the rest of the workweek. Ranch stuff Cord lived and breathed. Usually Cord convinced his dad to stick around for another beer, but tonight he couldn\u2019t wait for the man to leave.</p><p>And didn\u2019t that make him a selfish bastard? Did it make him a nancy boy that he\u2019d spent extra time on his appearance? Trimming his mustache and goatee. Giving himself a close shave. Plus he\u2019d changed the sheets on the bed, cleaned the bathroom and generally tidied up the rest of his house.</p><p>So where was she?</p><p>The phone rang and Cord was half-afraid to answer it, thinking AJ might be calling to cancel. But it was his mother, grilling him on Colt. As he listened to her chatter, he saw dust plumes on the main gravel road. AJ had arrived.</p><p>\u201cMa. My cell is ringin\u2019. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d He hung up and watched AJ\u2019s metallic black Jeep park in the hidden alcove next to the barn.</p><p>His heart kicked into double time. He\u2019d never been the type for unbridled affection with anyone besides his son. Why didn\u2019t he rush out to meet her? Swing her into his arms, pepper her sweet face with kisses just to hear her laugh?</p><p>Because you\u2019ll appear too eager. Too desperate.</p><p>So instead, he slouched against the newel post at the bottom of the staircase, waiting for her to come to him.</p><p>Light footsteps echoed across the porch and then two solid raps on the screen door.</p><p>Cord counted to ten and walked to the front entryway.</p><p>He smiled and opened the door, giving her a hot head-to-toe appraisal. Short pink skirt, skin-tight white T-shirt proclaiming \u201cCowgirls Ride Better Dirty\u201d and rhinestone dotted flip-flops. He experienced a twinge of guilt because she looked so young and innocent. But the guilt vanished when he saw the lust brimming in her eyes, making them as hot as liquid mercury.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby doll. Don\u2019t you look good.\u201d</p><p>AJ stared at his mouth. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I getcha a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. But aren\u2019t you gonna kiss me hello?\u201d</p><p>Cord bent down to press his lips to hers, gliding over the plump softness of her mouth a couple of times and retreated to lick his lips. \u201cMmm. You taste like lemons.\u201d He gauged her disappointment. \u201cIf I start kissin\u2019 you proper, I won\u2019t wanna stop and I ain\u2019t gonna maul you in the foyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlayin\u2019 with fire, AJ. I\u2019ll grab the beer and be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want me to come into the kitchen? I could help.\u201d</p><p>He spun back around and shook his finger at her. \u201cYou stay right there. We get into trouble in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping we get into trouble everywhere else too.\u201d AJ smiled coyly and wandered away.</p><p>Cord popped the tops on two Budweisers and tracked her to the living room. Damn, she was a bright spot of color against the dark wood and formal furniture. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the bottle from him. \u201cThanks. So, what did you do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFixed equipment. Hauled water. Dumped manure. Chewed Colt\u2019s ass. Everyday ranch stuff.\u201d He sat on the couch and put his beer on the coffee table. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDealt with Jenn after she went to the lawyer\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really goin\u2019 through with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently. She talked to Alan this morning. He doesn\u2019t seem too upset about the divorce, which is upsetting to her. It\u2019s upsetting to me too.\u201d</p><p>Several minutes passed and she didn\u2019t say another word.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>AJ abandoned her spot by the floor-to-ceiling picture windows and moved to the couch. As she attempted to plop down next to him, Cord tugged her on his lap.</p><p>\u201cI said come here.\u201d</p><p>She twisted until their bodies were matched pelvis to pelvis. She draped her arms over the back of the couch behind his head. \u201cNow that I\u2019m here, what\u2019re you gonna do with me?\u201d</p><p>Fuck you until you scream my name.</p><p>He took her mouth like he wanted to take her body\u2014a slow build up, then wham! A no-holds-barred, hot, wet, hard swamping of her senses until she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>AJ rubbed her chest to his, returning his demanding kiss\u2014her enthusiasm a contradiction to her innocence.</p><p>Cord slid his palms up the back of her sleek thighs and found only bare skin. The little minx hadn\u2019t worn panties.</p><p>He clamped his hands to her butt and lifted her slightly, changing the angle of her hips. His middle finger traced the seam of her ass down to where she was wet. He circled the opening to her sex and pushed his finger deep, feathering his thumb over her clit.</p><p>Her sexy whimper reverberated in his mouth.</p><p>As much as he loved hearing her muted surprised sounds of pleasure, he needed more. Cord moved his hand to the small of her back, scraped his teeth across her bottom lip and broke the kiss. \u201cI\u2019m gonna put my mouth on you. I wanna feel you come against my tongue.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh. I, ah. Um. Okay.\u201d</p><p>He held her hips as he rolled them until AJ\u2019s back was against the cushions. Cord slid to his knees on the floor. As he kissed her, he shoved the velvet square throw pillow underneath her ass. He tucked her skirt out of his way, baring her completely from the waist down.</p><p>\u201cKeep your hands right there and hold on.\u201d</p><p>As his palms traveled down the center of her body, Cord wished he\u2019d made her strip so he could feel every inch of her skin.</p><p>\u201cCord, I\u2019m not sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want this.\u201d He dragged openmouthed kisses from her left knee up the inside of her quivering thigh and licked the crease where thigh met hip.</p><p>She jumped.</p><p>Smiling, Cord brushed his mouth down the top of her leg, using his tongue to trace the musculature of her thighs, courtesy of the years she\u2019d spent on horseback. He used the same thorough treatment on her right leg. By the time he finished, AJ trembled.</p><p>Her glistening sex was at his mouth level. He pressed his lips to the top of her pubic bone. The soft curls covering her mound were so light blonde she appeared bare. Damn humbling to think he was the only man who\u2019d ever seen her delicate femininity. It also increased the pressure on his performance when he considered she\u2019d remember him loving her with his mouth first.</p><p>He lightly rubbed his lips above the sweet cleft and inhaled deeply. \u201cGoddamn you smell like sunshine here too. I oughta be tellin\u2019 you how pretty this pussy is, all pink and wet and soft and untried, how sexy that it\u2019s weepin\u2019 for my attention. But I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his chin and licked straight up her slit.</p><p>AJ made a strangled moan.</p><p>Cord licked her again. And again. His fingers spread her open and he burrowed his tongue deep, tasting her from the inside out. He used the very tip to trace every delectable crease and hidden fold. He suckled her lips, intentionally avoiding her clit. Then he circled kisses from the top of her pubis down and back up.</p><p>She whimpered and bumped her pelvis closer to his face.</p><p>He grinned even when his cock was so hard it hurt.</p><p>Cord savored her sweet essence, prolonging her pleasure until thick cream poured from her sex.</p><p>\u201cOh God, please, Cord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I never thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever thought what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat anything could feel this good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. And I\u2019m not even to the good part yet.\u201d The vibration made her gasp. So he did it again. Then Cord placed his mouth on her clit and sucked.</p> <p>AJ nearly shot off the couch.</p><p>He alternated little whips of his hot tongue across that inflamed pearl with deep rhythmic sucking. It didn\u2019t take long before AJ arched; he gripped her hips as her orgasm exploded in his mouth.</p><p>She screamed. And thrashed and tried to get away even as she tried to get closer.</p><p>He didn\u2019t release her until the very last pulse.</p><p>With his mouth still connected to her throbbing sex, he looked up and saw her gazing at him. Not with embarrassment, but with awe. With hunger.</p><p>\u201cCord.\u201d</p><p>The hoarse, needy way she\u2019d whispered his name sent every last bit of blood to his dick.</p><p>He gave her clit one last hard suck before he pushed back and stood. \u201cIn my bed, AJ.</p><p>Now.\u201d</p><p>Cord clasped her hand and led her upstairs.</p><p>AJ\u2019s whole body shook. With need. With surprise. With fear.</p><p>The sun was setting, softening the light filtering through the blinds to a hazy purply pink. The king-sized, four-poster bed was the centerpiece in Cord\u2019s masculine bedroom\u2014the only room he\u2019d redecorated after his wife had left. A heavy mahogany nightstand with a stained-glass lamp on top was shoved in one corner, a matching bureau took up the largest wall and an antique wooden rocking chair was in front of the bay window.</p><p>She leaned against the doorjamb to the master bath and watched Cord toeing off his Tony Lamas. He folded the comforter to the end of the bed, exposing plain white cotton sheets.</p><p>Cord faced her as he unbuttoned his crisply ironed navy blue shirt.</p><p>\u201cShould I be doing that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNext time. If you put your hands on me anywhere right now, I guarantee I\u2019ll be on you and in you before you can blink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>He growled and tossed his shirt on the dresser.</p><p>AJ stared at his chest. Man. Talk about perfect. She wanted to sink her teeth into his hard pecs. Lick his bulging biceps. Suck the flat disks and see how fast his nipples hardened. Trace the ridged lines of his ripped abdomen with her tongue. Follow that intriguing trail of dark hair from his belly button down...way down to see exactly where the hair ended. She bit her lip as he lowered the zipper on his jeans.</p><p>\u201cAJ, I\u2019m warnin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop lookin\u2019 at me like you wanna eat me alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t want me to look, Cord, you shouldn\u2019t look so damn good.\u201d</p><p>That slow, sexy grin appeared. \u201cLike what you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always liked it . \u201d Even when I was a little girl and I didn\u2019t know why I liked it so much.</p><p>His jeans hit the floor and he was buck-ass naked.</p><p>Her gaze zeroed in on his groin and her heart rate quadrupled. \u201cUmm. Wow. Did it grow? Because it looks bigger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissin\u2019 your red-hot love flower made this stem grow big and hard just for you, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>AJ managed to meet his eyes. \u201cLove flower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought maybe you wanted some kinda sweet-talkin\u2019 love words first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the next step? Because I thought we\u2019d just get naked and you\u2019d put your stem\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cord\u2019s mouth cut off additional comment. He fiddled with her rhinestone belt and her skirt thudded on the floor. He released her mouth long enough to say, \u201cLift,\u201d and yanked her T-shirt over her head. Snap. Her bra opened and he slid it off her arms. He walked her to the bed until the backs of her knees hit the mattress.</p><p>His hands kneaded her breasts and then his hot mouth enclosed her nipple.</p><p>AJ let out a squeak.</p><p>\u201cI wanna fuck you fast and get this first time out of the way so I can fuck you slow next time. Then fast the time after that. Then slow. I want to fuck you so many times in so many ways that you won\u2019t be able to sit on a horse for a goddamn week, AJ.\u201d</p><p>Liquid heat pooled between her thighs, her pulse pounded and every part of her that wasn\u2019t touching him ached to be touching him. \u201cCord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet on the bed. In the middle.\u201d</p><p>She scooted back on her elbows until her neck brushed the pillows. The cotton sheets were cool beneath her feverish skin.</p><p>Cord stood at the foot of the bed, stroking himself, eyeing her like she was the lottery, a gourmet meal, a prize-winning Thoroughbred\u2014and he held a winning ticket to all three.</p><p>As he stared at her, she wanted to tell him to hurry up; she wanted to tell him she was scared and to go slow. When he crawled across the mattress, stalking her with his big body and smoldering eyes, she knew she\u2019d made the right decision waiting for this man to introduce her to the carnal delights of sex.</p><p>He put his callused hands on the inside of her thighs and pushed them open.</p><p>The tips of her nipples tightened when Cord lowered his head and licked a path from her clit up to her mouth. Even his kiss tasted darker. As he nibbled on her lips, she heard a click and then his fingers were pushing a cold, sticky substance inside her.</p><p>She gasped softly.</p><p>\u201cJust lubrication. You\u2019re wet, but I don\u2019t wanna hurt you. Ready?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, hoping he attributed her racing heart and shaking limbs to excitement and not fear.</p><p>Cord levered himself over her and reached between them. He circled the blunt tip around her opening and then started to push his cock in.</p><p>And in.</p><p>And in.</p><p>And it still wasn\u2019t in. And what was in\u2014hurt.</p><p>His hot breath teased her ear. \u201cAJ, don\u2019t tense up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I told you it wouldn\u2019t fit.\u201d</p><p>Cord half-laughed/half-groaned. His lips feathered across her jaw to her mouth. He began to kiss her in that bone-melting way of his.</p><p>AJ slid her hands up his strong arms and into his hair. She concentrated on the feel of his silky tongue in her mouth. The glide of his rougher skin on hers. The delicious way he smelled. The cool sheets on her back. The heat of his muscled body on her front. The sounds of their labored breathing. The muted lighting and the soft mattress. The fierce need but unbelievable gentleness pouring from him.</p><p>He was rocking into her in short bursts when all of a sudden the kiss intensified. His hands pushed her hips down as his pelvis thrust up.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cOh God. That hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. I\u2019m in all the way. Just relax around me. It\u2019ll get better.\u201d</p><p>Then Cord bent his head and suckled her nipples. And kept sucking until some primitive instinct told her to move under him. He kissed her neck, returned to her nipples, nuzzling her cleavage, breathing over the damp spots he\u2019d created on her skin, kissing wherever he could reach, muttering nonsensical words against her skin. Dragging his rough fingertips up and down her shaking thighs.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cBaby doll, I\u2019ve gotta move. Wrap your legs around my waist. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>AJ was feeling less panicked but nowhere near comfortable. The second she lifted up, all the hot hardness slipped out and plunged back in.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t bad. That felt kinda...good. \u201cDo it again.\u201d</p><p>Cord pumped his hips, slowly sliding in and out. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Is it okay for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot.\u201d He pulled out. \u201cWet.\u201d He pushed in. \u201cTight.\u201d He eased out. \u201cNot just okay.</p><p>Perfect.\u201d He thrust in a little harder. \u201cSee? You are a perfect fit for me.\u201d</p><p>AJ closed her eyes, feeling the thick male part filling her, sending tingles from her core throughout her whole body. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>He increased the pace. The strokes were shorter. Deeper. His breaths near her temple were unsteady and fast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAJ. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes. Sweat trickled down Cord\u2019s face. His jaw was tight. She traced his profile, amazed by him, by this intimacy. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Cord squeezed his hands on her butt, buried his face in her throat and drove his cock inside her to the hilt.</p> <p>As he groaned, her inner tissues were so swollen and sensitized that she felt the tip of his sex twitching as he bathed her insides with his hot seed.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think of a more ideal way to lose her virginity.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Cord raised his head and gazed at AJ\u2019s face. Her long black lashes fanned her flushed cheek. Her well-kissed lips were curved into a smirk.</p><p>He tickled that sassy little mole with his beard.</p> <p>She sighed. \u201cA virgin no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m not pullin\u2019 out because I can\u2019t wait to have you again.\u201d</p><p>AJ blushed.</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d Cord rolled until his back was flat on the mattress and she was on top.</p> <p>\u201cBetter. Now I don\u2019t hafta worry I\u2019m squashin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d She laid her head on his chest and sighed again.</p><p>Such a heartfelt sigh. He knew the feeling as he let his palms drift up and down her naked back from her ass to her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your first time like?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFast. Happened in the back of a car out past the rodeo grounds when I was fifteen.\u201d</p><p>AJ looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m glad I waited. Thank you. This was...spectacular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for the fact you didn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did before when we were in the living room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat don\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good lover will always see to your needs first. Besides, I wanna feel you come around my cock. I wanna watch your face when you feel the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference in orgasms?\u201d</p><p>Right after she said that, his dick twitched to life.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cWhoa. I can feel that. I thought it\u2019d take like fifteen minutes for you to get hard again.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cWhy? Because I\u2019m old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s what it said in Cosmo. Besides, you\u2019re not old, stop saying that. God, you\u2019re twice as sexy and hot as any man...\u201d Embarrassed, she averted her gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I was likin\u2019 the way the conversation about me was goin\u2019, baby doll,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m really here with you, Cord McKay. I\u2019ve had a crush on you for so long.\u201d</p><p>Cord grinned. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But you\u2019ve never noticed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely true.\u201d He twisted a section of her baby fine hair around his index finger. \u201cWhat would you have done if I\u2019d chased after you down at Carter\u2019s wedding last year and taken you up on your offer after kissin\u2019 me so sweetly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably would\u2019ve lost my virginity in a car with you at the Bar 9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as long as we\u2019re confessing things...a couple of times when I babysat Ky?</p><p>After I put him down for his nap, I came in here and laid on your bed. Wondering what it\u2019d be like to be in this bed naked with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me stuff like that.\u201d He paused and studied her face. \u201cDid you touch yourself when you were layin\u2019 on my bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, Cord, no. I was babysitting. I imagined you touching me though. I gotta admit my imagination didn\u2019t do it justice.\u201d</p><p>He captured her face in his hands. \u201cNo need to make your imagination work when I\u2019m here. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve been fantasizin\u2019 what you\u2019d look like on top of me. Naked.\u201d He nudged her upright and murmured, \u201cSo, ride me, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>Panic flashed in her eyes. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour body will guide you better than I can. Bring your knees by my hips.\u201d</p><p>She maneuvered herself around.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Cord placed her hands on his shoulders. \u201cFast or slow as you wanna go.</p><p>You\u2019re in total control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if I do it wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo such thing as wrong. Do whatever you want. Do what feels good. I ain\u2019t gonna complain or say no.\u201d</p><p>AJ\u2019s eyes met his. \u201cWhat will you be doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatchin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>She was so tentative, hardly moving, unsure where to put her hands. Not trusting her body to find a natural rhythm. Again, her innocence was more arousing than he\u2019d expected. His thumbs rasped her nipples. He was dying to suck them until she screamed, but he worried his attention would be a bigger distraction to her sense of imbalance.</p><p>When AJ leaned over to kiss him, her clit rubbed the top of his groin. She blinked with surprise. \u201cOh. That feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen keep doin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wanna touch you. I\u2019ve been dying to get my hands all over you for so long.</p><p>Too long.\u201d</p><p>AJ ground her pelvis into his, keeping his cock deep inside as she rocked over her clit. Her hot tongue made circles around his nipples. She licked and sucked his neck and collarbone until he wanted to explode. His thighs went rigid when she bounced faster.</p><p>He clenched his ass cheeks to keep from thrusting into her, letting AJ learn how to get what her body needed.</p><p>She threw her head back, closed her eyes and gasped with surprise as she came without warning.</p><p>Cord gritted his teeth as he felt the spasms tightening around his cock. Hold off hold off. The second her eyes blinked open after the last orgasmic ripple, he flipped her on her back.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m gonna ride you.\u201d He pinned her arms above by the headboard and drove into her.</p><p>Stroke after stroke they were spiraling higher, both covered in sweat. Both breathing hard. Both lost in the moment.</p><p>He put his lips below her ear. \u201cSo fuckin\u2019 wet. So fuckin\u2019 tight. Feel how hot and hard you make me burn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me this time.\u201d He changed the angle of his hips and hammered into her.</p><p>She shrieked and he shot his load. His vision blurred, his throat closed. Her greedy sex milked every drop from his cock until he was completely inert.</p><p>Still, he sought AJ\u2019s mouth. She pressed her chest to his, breaking free of his handhold to run her hands all over his body.</p><p>Cord rested his sweaty forehead to hers. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I think you blew out all the pleasure receptors in my brain.\u201d He shifted his weight to pull out of her and she hissed.</p><p>\u201cI got a little carried away. You\u2019re probably sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that you got carried away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you don\u2019t mind. I can be rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not nearly as delicate as you think I am.\u201d AJ looked at the alarm clock on the nightstand. \u201cIs that really the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaring for my mom, remember?\u201d She bounced off the bed and snatched her clothes.</p><p>Cord returned from the bathroom with a washcloth. \u201cLet me clean you up first.\u201d He wiped between her thighs and tried not to wince at how swollen she was. \u201cThat\u2019s weird, you didn\u2019t bleed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou questioning whether I was a virgin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I\u2019ve been on horseback my whole life, which has been known to break a hymen. Plus, I\u2019ve been using tampons for years\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to get defensive.\u201d</p><p>Cord tugged his wrinkled Wranglers over his naked flanks. Part of him wished she could stay in his bed all night. Another part was glad to see her leave. A lot of shit had happened in a short amount of time and he needed some quiet time to process it all.</p><p>He followed her downstairs, flipped on the yard light and gave her a long kiss.</p><p>\u201cDrive safe. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. You will be here. Period.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cWhat would you say if I told you I was thinking about selling the ranch?\u201d</p><p>The knife in AJ\u2019s hand froze above the cutting board.</p><p>You knew this was coming.</p><p>She sliced the ham sandwich, arranged it on a plate alongside a home-canned dill pickle, tossed on a handful of potato chips and slid it in front of her mother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say the future of the ranch is your decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTelling me what I want to hear and honestly answering the question are two different things, Amy Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But Daddy left the ranch to you. Do I hope you sell it? No. But do I understand why you\u2019d want to? Yes.\u201d</p><p>AJ made her sandwich and sat down, wondering if she could swallow bread through a tight throat.</p><p>Lunch was a somber affair.</p><p>Table cleared, coffee poured, the last of the sugar cookies between them, her mother addressed the issue again, just as AJ expected she would.</p><p>\u201cNeither Jenn nor Alan showed interest in ranching. If you were married\u2014not that I\u2019m wishing you were\u2014and this place was supporting you and a husband, I wouldn\u2019t even bring it up. But with you off at school, Jenn looking at starting over someplace else, and me half-crippled, it\u2019s past time to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means you\u2019ve made your decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. After your daddy died, I promised Carson that the McKays would have first crack at buying it. No doubt they\u2019ll give us a fair price, plus they have the same philosophy about ranching, so I don\u2019t worry the land will be well cared for.\u201d</p><p>AJ stared out the window at the place she called home. The elm and cottonwood trees beyond the driveway wavered in the blustery summer wind. The midday sun bleached all color from the blue sky, but the dazzling brightness would return before sunset. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How many times had she done dishes at this old enamel sink? She\u2019d never once wondered if it\u2019d be the last time she\u2019d listen for the melodic coos of the mourning doves, or see the golden finches pecking at the bird feeders blowing in the sage-scented breeze.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably tag along with Jenn to wherever she\u2019s going. Not to live with her, but I can\u2019t imagine not seeing Krista, Mason and Ariel regularly. Does that bother you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy in the world would it bother me? I know that if I had three kids and an iffy future you\u2019d be right there with me, instead of with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstead, I have school to finish.\u201d AJ faced her mother and smiled. \u201cI won\u2019t pretend this is gonna be easy on me, Mama, because unlike you and Jenn, this is the only home I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you called Carson yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I wanted to talk to you first, since it affects you the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it. Call him after you rest.\u201d</p><p>Florence squinted at the clock. \u201cHe\u2019s probably having lunch, so I believe I\u2019ll call him now.\u201d She grabbed the cordless phone and dialed.</p><p>AJ half-listened to the conversation, wondering if Cord was chowing down at his folks\u2019 house, but she suspected the man forgot to eat if he wasn\u2019t cooking for Ky.</p><p>The phone beeped when her mom hung up.</p><p>\u201cWell? What\u2019d he say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarson will swing by around three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou relieved?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd tired. This decision has been weighing on me, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume he\u2019ll bring Cord along, since he runs as much of this part of the ranch as Carson does these days.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of Cord\u2019s name, a wave of heat flooded her body.</p><p>\u201cAmy Jo, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah, why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour cheeks are red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s hot in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly. Feels good. Always a bit cold in the front room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to adjust the air conditioner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine, I\u2019m used to it with the way the heating system in this house has never worked the way it\u2019s supposed to. Stop fussing. Get some fresh air. Work with Lucy for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna ditch you to hang with my horse, geez. I\u2019m taking care of you, remember? I\u2019ll deal with Lucy when you wake up.\u201d AJ helped her mom back into bed.</p><p>She stirred up a batch of oatmeal raisin cookies. While they were baking, she sat on the back porch and called Keely.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Keely answered. \u201cDid you do the deed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>She squealed. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God. Why didn\u2019t you tell me it\u2019d be like that? He was everything, so amazingly perfect, romantic, hot, sexy. Sweet. Intense. God is he intense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t want down and dirty details, because, eww, he\u2019s my brother, but he treated you right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnbelievably right. A couple of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much information, AJ. So now that your cherry\u2019s been popped by your dream man, you\u2019ll be moving on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiterally moving on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back there and kick Cord\u2019s ass if he pulled that typical McKay love \u2019em and leave \u2019em bullshit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, calm down. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Cord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>AJ told Keely about her mom deciding to sell the ranch and found herself sobbing out the fears and frustrations she couldn\u2019t tell anyone else.</p><p>\u201cCome on, AJ. Dad and my brothers will take good care of it, just as good as you did all those years no one knew about you being the youngest ranch hand in the county. You can stay with us whenever you wanna visit, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019ll be in the hands of total strangers who\u2019re putting up a gate and keeping you out forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when we leave Denver for Christmas, I won\u2019t be coming back here. You will be. Where will I go?\u201d</p><p>Keely was quiet. \u201cI\u2019m having a blast living in Denver, but I know I can always go home. There\u2019s never been any doubt I\u2019ll move back to Wyoming as soon as I\u2019m done with school. And I can\u2019t imagine that I won\u2019t be able to hop on a four-wheeler or a horse and high-tail it over to your place whenever I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be cheering me up, Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Back to my favorite topic: sex. So you officially seeing Cord now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn secret. We won\u2019t be two stepping at the Golden Boot. Or eating supper at the Twin Pines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably for the best. You\u2019ll get to live out your sexual fantasies with a wild McKay man and no one will be the wiser. Not that you\u2019ll have to worry about your reputation in Crook County because you won\u2019t be livin\u2019 there much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Tell me about your date with Lex the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s a serial killer. No. Don\u2019t laugh, I\u2019m serious.\u201d Keely regaled her with another dating horror story. \u201cThat\u2019s the last time I date a guy who\u2019s not a cowboy. Next time I say yes to some doofus in a three piece suit, remind me about Lex, the letch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Adam, the arrogant asshole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And Pete, the prissy prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd gorgeous Giovanni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. No. He was worth it. Being a hot, hung Italian stallion and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet he doesn\u2019t have anything on your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww! AJ, that was just...eww!\u201d</p><p>AJ laughed. \u201cYou deserved that for all the years you\u2019ve tormented me with too much information. Gotta run. The timer on my cookies just dinged.\u201d</p><p>Keely expelled a disgusted sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re already making cookies for Cord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. They\u2019re for your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad? He\u2019ll probably adopt you and disown me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis precious baby girl who drives him insane? Wrong. I\u2019m sure daddy-o will grill me on what you\u2019ve been up to. Studying, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Speaking of, when you get time off from playing Betty Crocker, I wanna run something past you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks, K.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>AJ finished a couple of things before she woke up her mother. By the time Carson McKay\u2019s pickup pulled into the yard, AJ realized she hadn\u2019t bothered to look in a mirror all day. She peeked out the window. Sure enough, Cord hopped out of the passenger\u2019s side.</p><p>Great.</p><p>\u201cAmy Jo, will you put out the creamer and sugar? Cord might use it in his coffee.\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to say Cord drank his coffee black, but she didn\u2019t want her mother getting curious about why AJ knew such things about him. Why she\u2019d always known how Cord took his coffee\u2014and every other little thing about him.</p><p>AJ welcomed the McKays into the kitchen, including Carolyn, and settled everyone with coffee and cookies. Chatting about Keely and school in Denver was easy enough. It wasn\u2019t so easy not to act stiff around Cord or overly friendly. When she sensed they wanted to get down to business, she made a break for the barn.</p><p>She saddled Lucy and took off, riding her hard. It was bittersweet; she loved the freedom of the horse zipping across the open plain as much as she hated the idea she wouldn\u2019t have the luxury much longer. What was she supposed to do with Lucy after the ranch sold? She couldn\u2019t imagine living her life without a horse. Heck, she couldn\u2019t imagine living anywhere but on a ranch.</p><p>After treating Lucy to an extended brush down and a bucket of oats, AJ dragged her tack into the barn. She\u2019d hefted the saddle on the hook when the door creaked. She spun around. A shiver went up her spine\u2014Cord stood not ten feet away from her. Burning away every stitch of her clothing with his molten eyes.</p><p>AJ wiped the sweat from her brow and straightened the blanket draped over the stall railing. She stood on tiptoe, lifting her arms to hang the halter and bridle. The motion made her shirt ride up and she felt his searing gaze roving over the exposed skin.</p><p>Then he was behind her. \u201cNeed some help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you definitely have it all.\u201d</p><p>She pivoted. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopin\u2019 to steal a kiss from my girl while they hammer out the rest of the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ.\u201d He stalked her until her back hit the post between the stalls. \u201cYour cookies were sweet, but not as sweet as the taste I\u2019ve had of you.\u201d</p><p>His lips were so close. So warm and full. And tempting. Her tongue darted out and licked the seam of his lips. Mmm. Coffee. Cookies. Cord. His breath caught, but he didn\u2019t take over, as she expected. He allowed her to explore. She slid the tip of her tongue over his teeth. Nibbled on his lower lip, then his upper lip. She kissed the corners of his mouth until he smiled. She stopped teasing and slipped her tongue inside the warm cavern.</p><p>Cord kept a firm grip on her wrists, almost as if he didn\u2019t trust himself not to touch her. The kiss went on and on, both sweet and hot, and intense and lazy.</p><p>Reluctantly she eased her mouth away. \u201cYou make my head spin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now? Yes, because my body craves the rest of that headlong rush. I want to tear off your clothes. I want you to tear off my clothes. Then we can race up to the hayloft\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Jesus, AJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what I mean? Quit kissing me like I\u2019m nekkid.\u201d She looked at the bulge in his Wranglers and a tiny surge of pride arose. \u201cI\u2019ll walk out first. Give you time to think about baseball or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou really have to stop reading Cosmo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now I can finally utilize some of those sex tips I\u2019ve been saving up.\u201d She ducked out of the barn to the sound of his frustrated male groan.</p><p>A few minutes later, Cord propped his boot on the fence next to her, which looked casual to the casual observer, but wasn\u2019t casual in the least.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I want you so fuckin\u2019 bad, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 takin\u2019 you for a roll in the hay in the barn in broad daylight might be worth someone discoverin\u2019 us.\u201d</p><p>Her hopeful sex sent a rush of wetness south.</p><p>He pointed to Lucy. \u201cEver think about breedin\u2019 her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to this year. But it\u2019d be too much work for Ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou upset about Flo sellin\u2019 the ranch?\u201d</p> <p>Yes. \u201cI\u2019m not really surprised. She isn\u2019t spry enough to run this place on her own, she wasn\u2019t years ago when they made me do it after Dad...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? After he died?\u201d</p><p>Damn. No one knew what\u2019d gone on in the years before her dad died and she intended to keep it that way. \u201cShe\u2019s been struggling since I went to school, though she doesn\u2019t want to admit it. I panic when I think how things might\u2019ve turned out if Jenn hadn\u2019t found her right away that day.\u201d AJ winced at the image of her arthritic mother laying in the pasture with a broken hip.</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath. Come on, baby doll, she\u2019s all right. So are you. Accidents are part of life. A big part of ranch life, we both know that.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence passed.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wonder if I won\u2019t be out checkin\u2019 cattle and I\u2019ll find my dad has done some fool thing and broke his fool neck. Then I\u2019m amazed that Ky hasn\u2019t busted more bones from all the stunts he\u2019s pulled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike father like son, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomethin\u2019 like that.\u201d</p><p>They talked about Ky. About the time AJ relaxed, Cord said, \u201cYou sore from last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t bother me when I rode Lucy, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m askin\u2019 purely and simply because I cannot wait to have you again. Can you come to me tonight?\u201d</p><p>AJ\u2019s belly did a little flip. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Jenn and the kids moved in, and if she\u2019s upset and needs someone to talk you, I can\u2019t blow her off to blow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmy Jo that was just plain...raunchy.\u201d He paused. \u201cI like that side of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so sure you\u2019ll get to see that side of me tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWrong. I expect to see you tonight. You\u2019d better find a way to make our deal work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I\u2019ll create a suitable penalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenalty? I didn\u2019t agree\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ah. You agreed to whatever demands I make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike if I tell you to bend over this fence, I\u2019d expect you to do it. If I decided I wanted to spank your butt until it turned the same pink as your pussy, you\u2019d let me do that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. There are consequences for disobedience. I don\u2019t see you as the disobedient type, but I hope I\u2019m wrong because dishin\u2019 out penalties oughta be interestin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you...penalized women before?\u201d</p><p>Cord stared straight ahead. \u201cWhat if I say I\u2019ve always wanted to but I\u2019ve never had a woman willin\u2019 to give me that much control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say no is a much safer answer for me than yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d like to give you something no other woman has. Do your ideas for kink go beyond spanking me?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cYou want to tie me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ, I\u2019m warnin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talkin\u2019 before you get yourself inta trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah! You can\u2019t do a damn thing to me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make you pay for it later.\u201d</p><p>She loved the dangerous glint in his eye. Loved that she could incite him to cut loose, to show a side of himself to her no one else knew. \u201cYou\u2019d like to take me to that edge. Make me beg. And isn\u2019t it just a little sweeter to know that I\u2019ve never begged another man for anything? No man has ever touched me like you plan to? Or done any of the things you\u2019re itching to do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so in for it tonight, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>AJ faced him. \u201cGo ahead and think up a penalty, cowboy, because I\u2019m telling you right now, I plan on being a little late.\u201d She whirled on her bootheel and returned to the house.</p><p>She heard him say, \u201cBig, big trouble,\u201d and she smiled.</p><p>When Jenn and the kids showed up a few hours later, AJ and Jenn struck a deal. As AJ was the daytime caretaker, she wanted her nights free. Jenn didn\u2019t argue, although AJ</p><p>sensed her disappointment that she wouldn\u2019t be around in the evenings.</p><p>Only within the safety of her room did AJ wonder what she\u2019d gotten herself into taunting Cord McKay.</p><p>You\u2019re getting exactly what you want: the full scope of his passion. You aren\u2019t a little girl or a shrinking violet; you are a woman going after what she wants. This might be all you ever get from him, so be greedy and take it while you can get it.</p><p>No fear, no apologies, and no regrets.</p><p>Words to live by.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Cord half-listened to his parents discussing the purchase of the Foster place. Yeah, it was exciting to transition from leasing the prime grazing land to owning the whole kit and caboodle. The amount they\u2019d offered Florence meant they\u2019d have to borrow money from the bank to cover the associated costs. Usually that sort of financial issue concerned Cord, but he couldn\u2019t seem to focus beyond the thought of AJ taking the penalty he planned to mete out.</p><p>To hear her talking so boldly...it\u2019d been more than he could stand. She about got her first lesson right there against the fence.</p><p>Luckily his folks chalked up his distraction to worry, which was fine by him. Better that than them seeing how desperately he wanted little Amy Jo Foster naked, tied up, trussed up, at his every wicked whim, right there in public\u2014to hell with any kind of decorum.</p><p>Chores kept him from going crazy the last few hours.</p><p>Cord sipped his beer and messed with the recording on the TV screen. He heard her tires crunch on the driveway and he couldn\u2019t help but grin with anticipation.</p><p>AJ knocked. He yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s open.\u201d</p><p>The screen door slammed and she stood in front of him looking sexy and...wary.</p><p>\u201cEvenin\u2019, baby doll. You\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be happy to hear that my chat with Jenn went well and she\u2019s agreed to take over caretaking duties when she gets home from work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich leaves you where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. Starting at around 6:00 every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 7:00 right now. Where you been?\u201d</p><p>Two spots of color dotted her cheekbones. \u201cI told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me an extra hour. Now c\u2019mere and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Her face relaxed. She bent down to brush her mouth across his. Not in a teasing manner, but tentative.</p><p>Cord kept the kiss easy. When AJ began to get more demanding, he backed off. \u201cDid you shut the front door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo shut it, make sure it\u2019s locked and come back here.\u201d</p><p>By the time she returned he\u2019d finished the beer. \u201cTake off your clothes. I wanna see nothin\u2019 but that gorgeous bare skin.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers started at her throat and worked the buttons on the sleeveless blouse until it fluttered open revealing a bra the color of sun-ripened peaches. Pop pop pop and the fly of her jeans showed a slice of skin and matching peach panties. She shimmied the jeans to the floor and stopped.</p><p>\u201cThere a problem?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cN-no. I just didn\u2019t know if you meant completely naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>AJ\u2019s whole body flushed a rosy pink as she stripped. Her platinum hair fell across her face, obscuring her expression.</p><p>\u201cBaby doll, look at me.\u201d</p><p>She tipped her head up and met his gaze.</p><p>\u201cCome sit on my lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna take your clothes off first?\u201d</p><p>Cord shook his head. He patted his thighs.</p><p>She tried to sit sideways with her left hip pressed to his, but Cord reversed her so her ass was nestled against his groin. \u201cRelax.\u201d He positioned his hands on the inside of her knees and urged them open.</p><p>AJ obediently stretched out at his command, but she was strung tight as a new roll of baling twine.</p><p>He stroked his hands down the outside of her legs.</p><p>\u201cIs this my penalty? I\u2019m naked and you\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He kissed the tender rise of her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to the penalty portion later. Right now, I\u2019m gonna touch you however I want while we watch TV.\u201d Cord grabbed the remote and hit PLAY.</p><p>The image on the screen solidified. A naked woman. On her knees and unzipping a man\u2019s pants with painstaking precision. Oohing and ahhing over the bounty she\u2019d discovered as she fondled his cock with her hand. Then she rubbed the length over her enormous tits, wiping the tip of his cockhead on the tips of her hardened red nipples. She teased his dick over her cheeks and jaw in complete ecstasy, finally stroking her full, glossy lips across his stiff prick.</p><p>AJ\u2019s breath caught.</p><p>\u201cEver watched porn with a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never given a real blowjob, have you, AJ?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWatch. Learn.\u201d He nipped her earlobe. \u201cThere will be a test later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Wow. Okay.\u201d</p><p>The woman onscreen licked up and down the man\u2019s shaft with the flat part of her tongue. Then her pink tongue flickered from root to tip in a zigzag pattern. Up and down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Faster and faster. The camera moved from her tongue to the ecstasy on the man\u2019s face and everything switched to slow motion.</p><p>AJ squirmed.</p><p>Cord cupped AJ\u2019s breasts, rasping his thumbs over her nipples until they were hard peaks. He dragged wet kisses up the side of her neck.</p><p>She turned her head to reach his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Eyes on the screen. The best part is just about to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou touching me is the best part.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>The woman on the TV worked her hand from the guy\u2019s balls to the tip in a twisting motion while suckling the purple knob. She\u2019d take a break to scrape her teeth up the vein.</p><p>AJ whispered, \u201cDoesn\u2019t that hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you bite down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201d</p><p>Cord placed her hands on AJ\u2019s bare breasts and said, \u201cTouch yourself here. Show me whatcha like.\u201d He trailed his fingers down her belly, loving how the taut skin quivered in anticipation of his touch.</p><p>\u201cCord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t close your eyes. Keep watchin\u2019. See how she takes the whole cock in her mouth? Opens her throat? Tightens her lips as she\u2019s pullin\u2019 back? See how her saliva makes his cock shiny? How much easier keepin\u2019 her mouth wet makes it glide in?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs your mouth waterin\u2019 to taste me like that?\u201d</p><p>AJ squeaked when his fingertip slid over her pubic bone and down her cleft.</p><p>\u201cDoes porn turn you on? Or is it the thought of me makin\u2019 you come that\u2019s got you all hot and bothered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. Just being with you turns me on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that sweet-talkin\u2019 will get you what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping.\u201d</p><p>Cord lost any guilty feelings about AJ picking him to take a bit of the shine off her halo. She wanted this, wanted him, she wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise. Truth be told, he was looking forward to the next few weeks in a way he\u2019d never imagined.</p> <p>He coated his finger with her wetness before pushing it inside her. She moaned softly. \u201cYou like that.\u201d He used the heel of his hand to slide side to side over her clit.</p><p>\u201cWhat about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch. He\u2019s about to come.\u201d Onscreen the guy plunged his cock into the woman\u2019s mouth and Cord matched the rhythm with his finger inside her. \u201cThis flick is a favorite of mine. Here comes the money shot, seein\u2019 him blow all over her tits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt that what you\u2019re gonna do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stroked the spot behind her pubic bone with the tip of his long middle finger.</p><p>She undulated her pelvis. \u201cCord, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me off...make me...I-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cord breathed in her ear. \u201cLike this?\u201d He increased the friction on her clit and fluttered his finger and her interior muscles quivered.</p><p>AJ flew apart.</p><p>When she drifted back, he shut off the TV. She turned and plastered her chest to his, grinding her wet sex against his crotch as she made him mindless with her frantic kisses.</p><p>\u201cMy turn.\u201d Colt looked into her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see your lips stretched around my cock. On your knees.\u201d</p><p>Without further prompting, she slid to the floor between his legs. He lifted his hips so she could tug off the fleece workout shorts. She traced the edge of her thumb over the thick vein running up his cock, sweeping it across the tip to spread the pre-come around, just as he\u2019d shown her how he\u2019d liked it.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get a failing grade on this test.\u201d</p><p>Cord laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not grading you, AJ, I was kiddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She sucked him into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>AJ released him. \u201cWhat? Did I do it wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He cupped his hands around her face. \u201cFeels so damn good, baby doll, it just startled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will I know if I\u2019m doing it right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no right. Just do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>So she did. She sucked and licked and experimented with her hands, lips, teeth and tongue until she\u2019d worked him into a frenzy of need.</p><p>Cord\u2019s body shook. His legs twitched. His nuts were as hard as rubber balls. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the erotic scene\u2014this beautiful woman on her knees before him, an intense look of concentration and innocent wonder on her face as his cock disappeared between her lips.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cFinish me.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth bobbed and she sucked harder, she circled her fingers loosely at the base of his shaft and moved in rapid, short strokes.</p><p>\u201cFaster. Yeah. Like that. There it is.\u201d</p><p>Cord pulled his cock out of her mouth and curled his big hand around her smaller one, pumping them together as he aimed and came on her chest. He groaned and closed his eyes, lost in bliss, but he sensed her studying every spurt, gauging his every reaction.</p><p>Not clinically, but with the intention to learn exactly how to please her lover.</p><p>His hand fell to his thigh. He sagged to the cushions. Talk about a fucking mindblower.</p><p>AJ licked the come from the tip of his cock.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid that hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just ultra-sensitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She licked him again. \u201cTastes kinda salty.\u201d</p><p>Cord managed a grunt.</p><p>She kissed his hipbone and rubbed her sticky breast on his thigh. \u201cThat was really hot, making you come with my mouth. You really like blowjobs, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked watching you. Seeing you lose control. Made me feel...powerful.\u201d</p><p>Not a coy thing about AJ. \u201cYou can prove your power over me any time you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long until...?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be the death of me, woman. C\u2019mere. Let\u2019s see if I can\u2019t take the edge off while my dick recovers.\u201d</p><p>She crawled on his lap. \u201cLose the shirt. I love your chest.\u201d</p><p>He whipped the T-shirt over his head and used it to wipe off her breasts.</p><p>\u201cLook at you.\u201d Her fingertips trailed over his pecs, tracing the delineated line to his navel. \u201cYou\u2019re so perfect. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here with you. Naked.\u201d She pressed her mouth to the scar below his collarbone and sucked. \u201cHaving you look at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m a porn star rodeo queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you can\u2019t wait to put your hands on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hands are on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019ll do whatever I ask you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do to you, AJ?\u201d</p><p>She licked his Adam\u2019s apple. \u201cYou smell good. Like the Wyoming sun and wind left a permanent scent on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer my question. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>Silence echoed, except for the ragged sounds of her breathing against his throat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not goin\u2019 all shy on me now, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Cord tilted her face up. \u201cDon\u2019t. I like your curiosity. Be honest about what you want.</p><p>You\u2019ve gotta know that I won\u2019t deny you a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth drifted to his ear and her soft, breathy voice sent chills across his skin. \u201cI love your mouth on me. I think you can make me come just by sucking on my nipples.</p><p>When you use your teeth? Lord, it gives me goose bumps on goose bumps. I get all wet and achy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can work with wet and achy.\u201d His hands slipped down her neck to cup the generous mounds. He held her breasts together and lapped at her nipples, one at a time, then at the same time. Suckling the tips hard, then barely at all. Tickling every sensitive inch with the soft hair of his goatee, with his hot breath, with his lips and wet tongue.</p><p>Drawing out her pleasure, trying to fit as much of her glorious tits into his mouth as possible.</p><p>Her head fell back and she moaned.</p><p>Cord teased her until his cock was ready. Until he smelled the sweet cream gathering between her thighs and she was ready. He rubbed his face against the upper swells of her chest and picked her up to position her on the plush rug in front of the couch. Pinning her arms above her head with one hand, he urged her legs around his waist.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna hurt you. Take a deep breath, baby doll, and let me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready. Don\u2019t wait. Please.\u201d</p><p>Cord gritted his teeth, aligning his cock to slide into her tight, warm channel an excruciatingly inch at a time. Once he was fully seated, sweating, breathing like a winded horse, her hands broke free from his hold and clutched his ass.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Stop?\u201d He eased back to look at her face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go slow for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re ready for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t deny me anything. I\u2019m asking you, no, telling you, Cord McKay, give me that dark passion I see burning in your eyes. I\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down until they were nose to nose. \u201cYou remember you said that when I\u2019m ridin\u2019 you hard. When I won\u2019t let you up until I\u2019ve had my fill.\u201d</p><p>She slapped his ass. Twice. \u201cStop talking.\u201d</p><p>A snarl left his throat. He plowed back into heaven. Plunge. Retreat. Sweat poured down his body as he fucked her. His eyes never left hers. \u201cToo much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou little minx.\u201d Cord unwrapped her legs from his hips, placing her ankles on his shoulders, so the backs of her thighs were pressed up his chest. He rolled his hips and drove deep.</p><p>AJ gasped.</p><p>He trapped her hands above her head, forcing a deeper angle. The sounds of slapping flesh ricocheted as Cord pushed her harder and higher. When her orgasm loomed, he twisted his pelvis so his pubic hair abraded her clit. She began to whimper. \u201cSend us both over the edge.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter.

Without decreasing his strokes, Cord brushed aside the damp hair by her cheek with his chin. He placed his mouth over her ear and sucked.</p><p>\u201cOh God. Oh God. Oh God.\u201d Her whole body stiffened as her pussy crimped around his cock like a metal vise.</p><p>His balls tightened and long, hot pulses shot out, pulses that didn\u2019t seem to end. A tingle raced straight up the center of his torso from his dick to where he felt her teeth sinking into his throat.</p><p>When he quit moving she moaned, \u201cDon\u2019t stop, I\u2019m coming again, there, like that.\u201d</p><p>Cord felt another set of rhythmic pulls and stayed with her until the final vibration.</p><p>He brought her legs down to the rug and lost himself in the sweetness of her kisses.</p><p>AJ didn\u2019t push him away. She seemed content to kiss him, caressing the planes and angles of his face. Running her fingers through his damp hair. Squeezing the muscles in his back and arms. Not only did she enjoy touching him, she understood he craved the closeness in the aftermath of loving.</p><p>When his sweaty skin began to cool and she shivered, he looked at her and saw a smirk. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that was my penalty for being late, I can pretty much guarantee I won\u2019t be on time ever again.\u201d</p><p>Cord laughed.</p><p>She outlined his mustache and goatee. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>A tiny bit of unease made him tense up. Was she going to grade him on his performance? \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs sex always like this? Needy, hot and out of control? Because I\u2019ve had three outstanding orgasms and I\u2019m sore, but I can\u2019t wait to do this with you again. Does that make me some kind of a slut? I look at you and want you like a drug?\u201d</p><p>No. That makes you perfect.</p><p>Shaking aside that thought, he said, \u201cIf there was a line of men outside the door waitin\u2019 for their turns with you, maybe that\u2019d be considered slutty behavior. However often you and I are naked together or what we do behind closed doors ain\u2019t nobody\u2019s business but ours, AJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I can ease your mind on that account.

Her arms bound behind her back with his favorite bright blue nylon rope\u2014a vivid slash of color against her pale skin. She\u2019d be bent across a hay bale in the dim light of the barn, wearing those \u201cfuck me Big Daddy\u201d high-heeled silver boots and nothing else. Her feet spread-eagled, her ripe mouth, her juicy pussy and the tiny rosette of her ass at the ideal level for his cock.</p><p>He\u2019d stroke his erection as he circled her, deciding which hole to try first. She\u2019d whimper with want, plead with her eyes, and he knew she\u2019d love whatever he did to her.</p><p>First, he\u2019d fist his hands in her baby soft hair and fuck her mouth. When his cock was good and saturated with her saliva\u2014all the lube he needed to fuck that tiny virgin portal\u2014he\u2019d move behind her. Separating those pearly white ass cheeks to watch the thick head of his cock and his blood-darkened shaft disappearing into that tight, hot hole until he was buried balls deep and her untried muscles clenched around his dick like a fucking wet dream.</p><p>\u201cCord? You gonna teach me what they are?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cNot yet. You\u2019re already earnin\u2019 an A-plus plus plus, baby doll, you\u2019re surpassin\u2019 all my expectations, but I don\u2019t wanna do too much too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you\u2019ll need to feed me soon. I didn\u2019t have time to eat before I left home and I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>When he pushed back, his sated cock slipped out easily. Lord, it turned him on to see her sex shiny-wet with the mix of their juices, knowing her pussy was all pink and puffy from him loving on her.</p><p>Fucking her. Get it right. No love involved here, old man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll use the bathroom upstairs to clean up if you wanna use the one down here.\u201d</p><p>AJ snatched her clothes and hustled down the hallway, leaving him to wonder if he\u2019d said the wrong thing.</p><p>AJ scrutinized her reflection. Swollen mouth. Swollen nipples. She wiped between her legs and winced. Yep. Swollen there too. She\u2019d brought that overwhelming show of sheer strength and power of Cord\u2019s lovemaking on herself. Not that she had regrets.</p><p>Did he? Did he know she was crazy in love with him? Why else would he send her to Ky\u2019s bathroom? The last two nights he\u2019d been so thoughtful, cleaning her up.</p><p>You\u2019re worrying too much. Cord doesn\u2019t believe in love, he believes in lust and that\u2019s all he\u2019ll see when he looks at you because he can\u2019t offer you anything else.</p><p>Cord knocked on the door. \u201cAJ? Baby doll, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Be right out.\u201d</p><p>She used another cloth to swipe her face and neck before she put her clothes back on.</p><p>He\u2019d slipped on a pair of jeans and a clean T-shirt. She found it incredibly intimate his feet were bare. The man rarely exposed his body or his thoughts, so maybe he was opening up to her a little. A tiny bit of hope surfaced again that she was making progress with him.</p><p>\u201cYou want scrambled eggs? Or a sandwich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEggs are fine, but you don\u2019t have to cook for me. I can make it myself.\u201d</p><p>He walked over and kissed her nose. \u201cSit. It\u2019ll be done in a minute.\u201d</p><p>AJ knew Cord was completely at home in a kitchen. Her father never had been. She suspected Carson McKay wasn\u2019t either. But up until a couple of weeks ago Cord had been mother and father to Ky and he\u2019d had no choice.</p><p>He slid two steaming plates piled with eggs and toast on the breakfast bar, then came around to sit beside her.</p><p>\u201cLooks good. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. You need ketchup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKy won\u2019t eat eggs without drownin\u2019 them in red goo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully my palate is more developed than a four-year-old boy\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Cord\u2019s fork stopped above his plate. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I was teasing.\u201d</p><p>They ate the rest of the meal in silence. Cord picked up the plates and shoved them in the sink next to the frying pan and the breakfast dishes.</p><p>\u201cSince you cooked you want me to do those?\u201d</p><p>A strange, tight look crossed his face. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d AJ squirted dishsoap in the sink and turned the water on. \u201cSo I know it\u2019s probably too soon, but did you and your dad talk about what you\u2019re gonna do with our ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. We\u2019ve talked about plantin\u2019 buffalo grass in the north pasture to see if it\u2019ll take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart. I\u2019ve always been worried about overgrazing in that section. My dad wasn\u2019t vigilant as far as rotation. Before you bought us out I\u2019d planned on having mom talk to you about resting the grazing field to the south this fall anyway. Looks a little rough for the wear.\u201d</p><p>Cord seemed unusually quiet, in a considering way, and AJ realized she\u2019d revealed she knew too much. She scrambled for a subject change. \u201cAs far as plans for our house?</p><p>It needs some work. Major work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we won\u2019t make any decisions until...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gone, right?\u201d She scrubbed the plates and placed them on the left side of the sink.</p><p>\u201cSorry, that was kinda thoughtless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I haven\u2019t really wrapped my head around the fact it won\u2019t be my home anymore.\u201d She dropped the cleaned forks next to the plates. \u201cKeely said I could come home with her whenever I wanted, which was sweet, but visiting won\u2019t be the same as living here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Keely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I talked to her.\u201d AJ rinsed the soap from the dishes. She reached for the dishtowel, but Cord had it in his hand and plucked up a plate to dry.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did you talk to my little sister about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come right out and ask me if I talked to her about us making mattress angels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Does she know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just fuckin\u2019 great.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around. \u201cI trust her. I don\u2019t care if you are pissed off about it. She\u2019s my best friend and I talk to her about everything that\u2019s going on in my life. The fact you\u2019re her brother doesn\u2019t matter and if it bothers you\u2014what the hell are you staring at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut down the fryin\u2019 pan, AJ. Unless you plan on smackin\u2019 me upside the head with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d AJ looked at her hand and saw she\u2019d been shaking the soap-covered cast iron pan in his face. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Cord took the pan and rinsed it. He dried it before speaking again. \u201cWould it bug you if the situations were reversed and I blabbed to your sister about everything goin\u2019 on between us?\u201d</p><p>Attempting to stay calm, AJ unplugged the sink. Rinsed out the dishrag and twisted it, spreading it out to dry over the edge of the counter before she answered him. \u201cA\u2014I don\u2019t blab; neither does Keely, so you can rest assured no one in the McKay family will find out that you and I are boinking like bunnies. B\u2014If I have to choose between screwing around in secret with you for a few weeks or having Keely as my friend for the rest of my life, then no contest, because she wins. Hands down.\u201d</p><p>AJ made it to the door before Cord caught her.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, that wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, that brooding expression darkening his handsome face, as if he expected her to say something else. To apologize for something that wasn\u2019t her fault.</p><p>\u201cThank you for tonight, Cord, it was...great. It\u2019s been a crazy day and I\u2019m a little on edge. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wasn\u2019t particularly surprised he let her go. But she was surprised by how eager she was to get away from him.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is Colt?\u201d Cord barked at Kade the next morning over the phone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know it ain\u2019t your day to watch him. No. I\u2019ll do it myself. I don\u2019t got time to ride over there and haul his drunken carcass outta bed again.\u201d</p><p>Cord clicked his cell phone off. \u201cGoddamn, he\u2019s lookin\u2019 to get his ass whupped.\u201d He threw his mug in the sink, noticing he\u2019d forgotten to dry the silverware after AJ had left.</p><p>That was another screwed up situation. Things\u2019d been going great guns last night. He hadn\u2019t blamed his sudden tension on AJ\u2019s admission that Keely knew about them. No, doing dishes together was what sent him into a belligerent retreat.</p><p>Cooking for her hadn\u2019t been a big deal. But the second she started washing plates, knowing exactly where he kept his dishrags and dish soap, a funny feeling, sort of like hope had spread inside him. Had he tossed her out? No. He\u2019d automatically reached for the dishtowel to dry. Like they\u2019d done that household task together all the time. Like it was natural. Like it was the first of many times.</p><p>Damn. That kind of easy camaraderie could get a man in trouble. Big trouble.</p><p>Especially when he\u2019d gone out of his way to avoid anything with any woman that smacked of domesticity.</p><p>Still, logic made him question how AJ\u2019s thoughtfulness was a fault. She\u2019d been raised that way. No different than her baking cookies and serving coffee to him and his folks at her mom\u2019s place. Cord knew if his ma had been here after supper, she would\u2019ve run a sinkful of soapy water and cleaned up too.</p><p>So why did it seem so much...more?</p><p>Because you could want more with AJ. She knows you, your son, your ranch, and your family. It\u2019d be easy for her just to slip into your life, swoop into your house and want to play house for keeps.</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d he said out loud. \u201cShe\u2019s leavin\u2019. End of story.\u201d</p><p>When he returned home that night to a message from AJ telling him she wouldn\u2019t be over for a couple of days, he was relieved.</p><p>As Kade pulled up in front of his house after another fantastic date with Skylar\u2014</p><p>albeit, another date in which he hadn\u2019t told her who he really was, Kade, not Kane, the blue and white lights of the TV flickered on the big picture window. Kade parked in his spot at the Boars Nest. Four other cars he didn\u2019t recognize lined the drainage ditch. Colt\u2019s truck was there. Kane\u2019s was not. Dag\u2019s was there too.</p><p>He kicked off his boots at the door and looked around. Jasmine and Colt were buck nekkid and passed out on the couch. The place was dirtier than ever. More beer cans.</p><p>Liters of the hard stuff, vodka, rum, whiskey, tequila, more whiskey, J\u00e4germeister\u2014all empty.</p><p>Pizza boxes were stacked on the floor. Bags of garbage overflowed in the kitchen.</p><p>Stinking clothes were piled on top of the washer. He sniffed and smelled pot smoke.</p><p>Fuck. Enough.</p><p>He tiptoed down the hallway to Colt\u2019s bedroom\u2014tiptoeing not out of a need to be quiet\u2014but tiptoeing because of the bags of shit piled everywhere. Plus the hall light had burned out so he couldn\u2019t see where the hell he was going.</p> <p>The door to Colt\u2019s room was cracked open and Kade poked his head in.</p><p>Holy fucking Christ.</p><p>Kade blinked because he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. If he\u2019d imbibed tonight he\u2019d blame it on booze, but he hadn\u2019t had a single glass of wine or beer with dinner.</p><p>So what he was witnessing wasn\u2019t a weird-assed dream. But his cousin, Dag, on his hands and knees, bare-assed, with another guy, spreading his cheeks wide and riding Dag\u2019s ass like Dag was a pony.</p><p>Right then he knew the skinny guy he\u2019d seen getting hammered the other night was Dag. And he knew it hadn\u2019t been a damn dream.</p><p>A Goth kid\u2014tattooed, hair dyed jet-black, couldn\u2019t have been more than nineteen and resembled a girl more than a boy, but the big cock shuttling in and out of Dag\u2019s butt definitely belonged to a guy.</p><p>And if that image wasn\u2019t bad enough, another guy was on his knees in front of Dag, sliding his cock in and out of Dag\u2019s mouth, holding Dag by the ears as he fucked Dag\u2019s face.</p><p>Not that Kade wanted to look, but sweet Jesus, that wasn\u2019t all that was going on. The crew-cut dude was in on it too. He\u2019d somehow contorted himself to noisily suck Dag\u2019s dick while the other two guys were doing their thing.</p><p>To his cousin.</p><p>His straight cousin.</p><p>Shit. Maybe Dag was drugged. He was blindfolded. Maybe he had no fucking clue what he was doing.</p><p>Kade made up his mind to break up the foursome, when the guy with his cock in Dag\u2019s mouth whined, \u201cI wish I could come on your face. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face.\u201d</p><p>Dag pulled back and slurred, \u201cYou say that every fuckin\u2019 time, Max, and you know I\u2019ll never blow you again without wearin\u2019 a fuckin\u2019 condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m blowing you without a condom,\u201d crew-cut guy said, then returned to Dag\u2019s cock, twisting his hand firmly from root to tip as he suckled the knob.</p><p>\u201cFuck him harder, Leroy. Dag\u2019s a bad boy who likes to pretend he isn\u2019t one of us.</p><p>We all know he likes it hard. And rough.\u201d Max rammed his meat back into Dag\u2019s mouth with a childish pout. Dag groaned his approval when Leroy started hammering his hips harder into Dag\u2019s ass.</p><p>Kade retreated.</p><p>He knew Colt was out of control, but to see Dag like that? Totally out of control too?</p><p>Maybe Dag was drugged, or drunk, or maybe he just liked being fucked and blown by a guy and sucking cock once in a while. Didn\u2019t change the bottom line: Kade couldn\u2019t live here anymore. The thought of moving back in with his folks at age thirty was more than a little humbling. Yet he preferred it to knowing what was going on down the hall.</p><p>Preferred it to wondering what the hell kind of kinky scene he\u2019d stumble across in his living room in the middle of the night the next time.</p><p>He threw his clothes, boots, hats, CDs, electronics, and the few toiletries he owned in three suitcases. After grabbing his bedding, he stormed out, slipped on his boots, climbed in his truck and didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>Two days later Cord clapped on his hat, loaded his pickup and drove out to check cattle before he started the dirty, daylong chore of haying.</p><p>But once he settled on the tractor, the problems of the day melted away. He focused on his task, allowing himself the secret joy of witnessing another cycle of Mother Nature.</p><p>Months back the winter snows melted, leaving what looked like barren ground. Then tiny shoots of grass poked up through the brown earth to make a living sea of green. Now he was cutting the first field of hay. He inhaled the pungent scent of alfalfa. Of hot dry dirt.</p><p>The smell of diesel and oil and overheated machinery and his own sweat.</p><p>This chunk of land was heaven on earth.</p><p>And the view. Lord, he\u2019d never tire of the scenery displayed before him. White tufts of prairie asters and clumps of silver-green sage interspersed with cheat grass. The big sky ranging in hues from powdery blue to sapphire. The crested mountains in the background\u2014towers of gray and black rock, shadowed stone. Ominous. Unyielding.</p><p>Constant. Comforting.</p><p>His gaze encompassed the treeless horizon only broken by scattered clouds and disappearing fences. This place was home. The only home he\u2019d known, in truth, the only place he\u2019d ever wanted to hang his hat. Took two long years of working on a fishing boat in Seattle to swallow his pride, mend fences with his dad and admit he longed to return to Wyoming where he belonged. The workdays were long. The winters were harsh. He\u2019d never be rich even when he slaved every damn day. But he wouldn\u2019t trade this life for anything.</p><p>Was AJ counting down the days to escape ranch work and the never-ending sink of time and money? Hours and days and years of being beholden to the weather and then to the cattle market?</p><p>Cord had little doubt she\u2019d miss the land, the people, and the connection to both.</p><p>Folks who\u2019d never had either would never understand that permanent sense of loss.</p><p>Once she graduated, would she settle down with a financially stable guy? Pop out a couple of cute kids? Entrench herself in the suburbs, drive a minivan and wear pastel colored tracksuits?</p><p>He snorted disdain. AJ was a horsewoman to the core. He couldn\u2019t help but think marrying a man without her same love of the true Western lifestyle would be akin to a slow death. Would the lack of those necessary things in her life extinguish the light in her eyes and her soul over time?</p><p>Made him uncomfortable to think along those lines, but ultimately there was nothing he could do, besides offer to marry her. Right. Then she\u2019d be more tied down than ever.</p><p>Despite her sweet words, he doubted she\u2019d welcome a permanent tie with him\u2014a thirty-five-year-old man with a kid. AJ was just starting her life and her career. She\u2019d chosen him for a bed partner because he was safe. Experienced. And handy. It was inevitable their paths would diverge and veer different directions.</p><p>Somehow he managed to put AJ out of his mind for the rest of the grueling day\u2019s work. Dissecting Colt not showing up again was pointless too. By the time he\u2019d run the John Deere out of gas and bumped his way across the various pastures to the house, Cord admitted he and Colt needed a break from each other. Working with family was tough.</p><p>He and his father had been at loggerheads for years until Cord had left for Seattle.</p><p>Sometimes the best decision to keep the peace was distance. Literally. Luckily there were plenty of other sections on the McKay ranch for his brother to work.</p><p>Cord parked in the yard at seven-thirty. No sign of AJ. No message. No note. No doubt he\u2019d think up a suitable penalty for her cheeky behavior.</p><p>After cleaning himself up, he slapped together a roast beef sandwich made from dry bread and washed it down with a Fat Tire beer. Ky was amazingly talkative and seemed to be missing him. By the time Cord hung up, he was surprised to see darkness had fallen and it was damn near nine o\u2019clock.</p><p>He sat on his couch in his dark living room, bone tired. Knowing he had another full day of the same planned for tomorrow, the best thing would be for him to crawl into bed and rest up while he could. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then again, morning wouldn\u2019t come earlier whether he stayed home or if he checked out the action at the Golden Boot.</p><p>Cord slipped on his going-to-town boots and dress hat, grabbed his keys and his wallet and made the trek into town, knowing in his present mood a run-in with either Colt or AJ spelled trouble.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of hiring a stripper for my bachelorette party.\u201d</p><p>AJ spun the bar stool with an arch look. \u201cMale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, duh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you gonna find a male stripper in this town?\u201d</p><p>Liza smirked. \u201cI have my sources.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Liza, spill it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumor has it a couple of the male strippers who travel to the venues between Cheyenne, Billings and Rapid City have been killing time in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling time with who? And how come you didn\u2019t tell me this before now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I just found out last night and you haven\u2019t been hanging out with me. A sad, sad fact, because I\u2019m about to become an old married lady.\u201d</p><p>AJ waved down the bartender for another draft beer.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha been doin\u2019?\u201d Liza stirred the Jack and Coke before taking a hefty sip from the striped straw.</p> <p>Answering\u2014 screwing around\u2014although accurate, was not an option. \u201cMy sister left her husband. She and her kids moved in with Ma and me. Which is ironic, because mom sold the ranch and she\u2019ll be moving as soon as she\u2019s able.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you are going back to Denver?\u201d</p><p>AJ nodded.</p><p>Liza squeezed AJ\u2019s hand. \u201cThat sucks. I\u2019m sorry. That mean you won\u2019t be living here at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows? Once I graduate I\u2019ll actually have a way to support myself, since the</p><p>\u2018princess and knight\u2019 scenario we dreamed up in third grade hasn\u2019t panned out for either of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself. Noah treats me like a princess even if he is welding armor rather than wearing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I am happy for you, Liza. How did we get sidetracked from the stripper story?</p> <p>Who\u2019s flashing their butt for bucks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Keely? Will she be here for the bachelorette party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot. I forgot to ask her.\u201d That was an odd question. Out of the blue. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Liza started chomping on her straw, a sure sign of distress. When they\u2019d been in school, by the end of the year everything in Liza\u2019s pencil box looked as if beavers had gnawed on it. \u201cAlong the rumor vein...I heard if Colt McKay has enough to drink he\u2019ll start stripping. Doesn\u2019t care where, or when, if it\u2019s a private gig or right out in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, Liza, you weren\u2019t thinking of hiring him for your party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no. But that\u2019s the thing. He\u2019s been everywhere with that female stripper and the male stripper I\u2019m considering is a coworker of hers. Colt is a party crasher. Keely would freak if she saw firsthand some of the rank stuff he\u2019s been doing.\u201d</p><p>AJ hadn\u2019t heard anything out of the norm where Colt was concerned, besides him hitting the bottle hard. \u201cI\u2019m sure she can\u2019t make it because of tests. A stripper? Really, Liza? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve always been the goody-two-shoes-girl-next-door. Just once, I\u2019m dying to throw an outrageous party that\u2019ll be the talk of the county for ten years. I want everyone to say, \u2018Hey, remember Liza\u2019s bachelorette bash? Now that was one helluva wild time!\u2019 instead of tea and cookies and stupid bridal shower games.\u201d</p><p>AJ empathized. Neither she nor Liza craved the attention wild child Keely McKay garnered without trying, but once in a while\u2014or once in a lifetime in Liza\u2019s case\u2014it\u2019d be fun to shatter perceptions about shy girls and cut loose in a way that\u2019d leave Keely\u2019s mouth hanging open in shock.</p><p>\u201cAJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in. You need help planning it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. I\u2019ve rented the backroom. My sister and I are making the food.\u201d A mischievous smile appeared. \u201cCocktail weenies, brats, Rocky Mountain Oysters, meatballs. We\u2019re gonna have a brat sucking and ball licking contest. And we went online and ordered a bunch of really raunchy party favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, we\u2019ve gotta have an official drink. Something super sweet with a naughty name and you won\u2019t know you\u2019ve had too much to drink until it\u2019s too late. Wyoming Doodle Whacker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. I like that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019da thunk wild women lurked beneath our pigtails and bootcut 501s a few short years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the guys in our class who voted us \u2018bland and blander\u2019. There will be something very satisfying about flipping them the bird, and slamming the door in their faces because at this party no men are allowed.\u201d</p><p>For the next hour AJ and Liza made lists, planned and laughed. Noah finished his dart league and squired Liza away, leaving AJ to fend for herself.</p><p>Not for long.</p><p>She was dancing with Mikey when Cord waltzed in. She didn\u2019t acknowledge him, since she suspected the reverse was true. AJ danced and hung out with her friends, feeling melancholy about not having many nights like this left in her hometown.</p><p>Her cell phone rang. She hustled down the hallway away from the music to try and hear Keely, but it was pointless. She turned around and saw Cord blocking the exit.</p><p>Lord. The man defined bad-boy rancher hottie, the ultimate man, in her opinion. The real deal, not some cowboy wannabe. His muscles were earned from hours of hard, physical work, not hours spent pumping iron at the gym. His steely-eyed determination was honed from spending years fighting the elements. She suppressed a soft sigh. He wore a pressed cotton shirt the color of vine-ripened tomatoes, which emphasized his</p><p>\u2018black Irish\u2019 dark good looks, crisp jeans and a straw hat. He probably smelled great too, like shaving cream and soap and the great outdoors.</p><p>Shoot. She had no experience with this stuff either. Did she ignore him? Play it cool?</p><p>Play it like a bitch on wheels? Pretend she hadn\u2019t waited at his house for over an hour for him and he never bothered to call and cancel?</p><p>While she argued with herself about an appropriate response, he said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t show up tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. I waited for you but you didn\u2019t show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you came to the Golden Boot instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you what I do?\u201d Childish, AJ. \u201cI figured you had other plans so I made some of my own. No big deal. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going steady.\u201d</p><p>His jaw went rigid. \u201cWrong. You broke the rules. Which means you\u2019ve earned another penalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it on my bill with the other ones.\u201d</p><p>He gestured to her phone with a jerk of his hat brim. \u201cWho\u2019re you talkin\u2019 to?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy stockbroker. My Microsoft stock took a huge hit today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a real riot, AJ. Who were you talkin\u2019 to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna keep asking me until I tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I was trying to talk to Keely. But don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t say a thing about you or the incredible sex we had the other night.\u201d Crap. That hadn\u2019t come out right.</p><p>Cord tipped his hat back. No smile, just a smug look. \u201cIncredible, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it was. You don\u2019t need to get cocky about it because there won\u2019t be a repeat performance tonight. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t goin\u2019 no place. Get your stuff and be out by my truck in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there an echo in here? I said no. You had your chance to be with me tonight. You blew it. Better luck tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push me, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get out of my way. Unless you want me to really push you aside and make a scene?\u201d</p><p>A hard expression flattened his lips.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so.\u201d She sidestepped him and strutted to the bar.</p><p>Nice goin\u2019 McKay. You handled that like a fuckin\u2019 pro.</p><p>Jesus. That smartypants blond was so gonna get it when he got his hands on her.</p><p>He\u2019d stick around and see what other trouble she caused, see if she provided reasons to add to her punishments.</p><p>Cord snagged a corner table near the dance floor, where he could watch the entrance, the exits and her every move. Perverted? Yep. But if she took off, he\u2019d know it. Just as well as he knew he\u2019d chase her down\u2014and guaranteed there\u2019d be hell to pay when he caught her.</p><p>He nursed a beer, keeping a mental tally of who AJ danced with and how many times. Obsessive? Yep. A feeling which didn\u2019t bother him in the least.</p><p>A couple of his dad\u2019s friends swung by to congratulate him on buying the Foster place. He shot a covert glance at AJ to see if she\u2019d figured out why so much traffic passed his table.</p><p>He shooed the guys off instead of discussing his plans for the new McKay acquisition. With AJ within earshot it seemed disrespectful. Not only that, he didn\u2019t want anyone in the community believing the Fosters had fallen on hard times and had no choice but to sell. Cord knew how much it\u2019d bug him if local folks made such assumptions about him or his family or the way they ran their operation. Gossip ruled in Crook County and the men were just as bad as the ladies.</p><p>Kade strolled in, snagged a beer and slipped into the booth seat across from him.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShitty. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShittier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Kane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell knows?\u201d Kade fiddled with the metal tab on his beer can. \u201cDid you hear I moved out of the Boars Nest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was a little fuckin\u2019 busy mowin\u2019 the goddamn south hayfield for the last couple of days to indulge in idle conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d</p><p>Cord nodded.</p><p>\u201cShit. Sorry. I woulda been over to help you, if I\u2019da known.\u201d Kade fished his can of Skoal bandits from his front pocket, shook out a pouch and passed the can across the table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cord jammed the tobacco in his cheek next to his molars. He only chewed occasionally, and only when Ky wasn\u2019t around.</p><p>Kade said, \u201cBefore you ask, no, I don\u2019t know where your stupid brother is either.</p><p>Been busy after work with Ma\u2019s side of the family. First Uncle Darren wanted my help.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed. \u201cYou know how our dads are about Uncle Harland, so I couldn\u2019t exactly tell him I\u2019ve been helpin\u2019 out Uncle H since Dag went on another bender. Spent the last coupla nights at his place. Early this mornin\u2019 I get to the northeast corner where we been fixin\u2019 fence and Kane tells me Dag had enough of Uncle H\u2019s naggin\u2019 and me tryin\u2019 to\u2014</p><p>quote \u2018be the son Dag could never be\u2019 so he packed his shit and now he\u2019s livin\u2019 at the Boars Nest in my old room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle H tell you what went on to make Dag bail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no. Truth is, I don\u2019t know why Dag\u2019d move up there besides the free-for-all-anyway you want sex. The place is a fuckin\u2019 pigsty. Kane and me cleaned it up a couple of times in the last month, Colt can\u2019t be bothered, but we ain\u2019t the ones makin\u2019 the messes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome of them people Colt has over every damn night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople like that Jasmine chick?\u201d</p><p>Kade\u2019s gaze snapped up.</p><p>\u201cI was there when she offered you and Colt a threesome, remember?\u201d Cord watched his cousin closely and sure enough, Kade blushed. \u201cEnded up bein\u2019 a foursome or more, did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I ain\u2019t gonna lie, I thought it\u2019d be hot as hell. Once in a while some variety is good, but it didn\u2019t turn out as sexy hot as it does in porn flicks. Besides, Jazz and her friends are...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFreaks. Squatters. The place is even nastier to live in than usual. Booze bottles and cans, condoms and food wrappers everywhere. Dirty clothes, dirty dishes, bags of trash.</p><p>My mama would faint if she saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means mine would too. How much has Colt been drinkin\u2019, Kade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore\u2019n I\u2019ve ever seen. I ain\u2019t so sure he\u2019s not drinkin\u2019 before work. Been signs of drugs around too. Pot, mostly. A couple of vials of other shit I didn\u2019t want to know nothin\u2019 about.\u201d</p><p>Cord tried to rein in his temper and the underlying fear for his wayward brother.</p><p>\u201cCome clean with me, no bullshit. Is Colt doin\u2019 drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doan know. I jus\u2019 know he\u2019s a train wreck waitin\u2019 to happen and I doan wanna be no place around when he finally goes off the rails.\u201d</p><p>Cord drained his beer. \u201cToo late. He\u2019s here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s surprisin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He watched Colt stop at the bar and knock back three shots of something before he carried two beers over to another table.</p><p>\u201cThink he saw us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah he saw us. I\u2019d avoid me too.\u201d Cord stood. \u201cHead on home. I\u2019ll handle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink I\u2019ll stick around.\u201d</p><p>The second Cord stopped in front of Colt\u2019s table Colt said, \u201cLook. I know you\u2019re pissed off. You\u2019ve got a right to be, okay? I had a rough fuckin\u2019 night. I blacked out.</p><p>Woke up naked in my bed around four this afternoon, hungover as hell, no idea what happened. Don\u2019t know why my cousins couldn\u2019t bother to wake me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey ain\u2019t your mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit. But it ain\u2019t like I haven\u2019t done it for them a time or two.\u201d</p><p>He studied his brother\u2019s disheveled appearance. Scraggly hair, bags under his eyes, marks on his neck. Incredibly swollen lips. \u201cDidja get punched in the mouth last night?</p><p>\u2019Cause it\u2019s puffed up like a bee sting.\u201d</p><p>Colt brushed his hand over his lips and frowned. \u201cNot that I recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems to be the problem, bro. Even if Kane and Kade and even Dag would\u2019ve been around to wake your drunken ass up, I\u2019d\u2019ve sent you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? \u2019Cause I had a little too much liquid fun last night? It ain\u2019t like you didn\u2019t do shit like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. I never once blacked out. I never once missed a day of ranch work because of drinkin\u2019 and you\u2019ve missed two this week alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d be a self-righteous prick about this.\u201d</p><p>Heavy pause. \u201cWhat the fuck did you just say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d Colt deigned to look at him. \u201cPrecious Ky\u2019s gone so you\u2019ve got nothin\u2019 else to do \u2019cept work. Some of us have a life outside of the ranch. Some of us are tryin\u2019 damn hard not to end up like you: cold, cruel, a bitter woman-hater, a fuckin\u2019 recluse, a workaholic loser with a stash of porn and a sore hand.\u201d</p><p>Never in all the years that he\u2019d been dealing with his overbearing family had he wanted to kill one of them.</p><p>Until tonight. Until now.</p><p>Cord grabbed Colt by the shirtfront and hauled Colt across the table. The second he had a free hand he punched Colt in the jaw hard enough Colt\u2019s head snapped back. A beer can crashed and rolled off the table, spewing foam everywhere.</p><p>He cocked his arm and punched Colt in the mouth, feeling the scrape of his brother\u2019s teeth on his bare knuckles. Before Colt\u2019s nose met his fist, Colt landed a blow alongside Cord\u2019s temple and nearly knocked his head from his neck.</p><p>Cord staggered back, taking Colt with him.</p><p>They crashed into another table. Bottles shattered and beer splashed on the floor.</p><p>Shirts ripped, flesh connected with flesh. Grunts, curses and groans of pain were intermingled with more curses, blood and crunching glass.</p><p>Kade intervened.</p><p>Cord forgot what a big guy Kade was until his younger cousin literally picked him up and set him aside like he was an eighty-pound hay bale, not a two-hundred-pound pissed-off man.</p><p>\u201cCord, what the hell is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat cocksucker said some shit that don\u2019t fly with me. I called him on it.\u201d</p><p>Colt laughed. Picked himself up off the floor. Fell back down in a pile.</p><p>Cord knew Colt wasn\u2019t staggering because he\u2019d thrown such accurate punches. His brother was hammered beyond all reason. Again. In public.</p><p>What were they gonna do? How had Colt gotten so hopelessly off track? How in the hell could he help him?</p><p>Once Colt made it to a chair, he spit a hunk of bloody saliva on the floor. \u201cI ain\u2019t apologizin\u2019 for nothin\u2019, bro. You\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 prick like Dad and everyone knows it\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sympathy vanished and Cord lunged for him and they were rolling around on the floor. Punching. Kicking. Bleeding.</p><p>By that time, the bouncers showed up and separated them for good. A crowd gathered. His dad\u2019s and his uncle\u2019s longtime buddies. The guy who owned the feed store.</p><p>He hoped his eyes were playing tricks on him and that wasn\u2019t the family banker back by the jukebox.</p><p>So much for not making a scene. He scanned the crowd and his gaze caught AJ\u2019s.</p><p>Hers was somber. Not full of pity or some mislaid compassion, but understanding.</p><p>For the first time he wondered why he\u2019d put up such stupid parameters of no public acknowledgment of their relationship. And like it or not, it was a relationship, a relationship based on sex, but that didn\u2019t change the basic definition of it.</p><p>Also didn\u2019t change the knowledge that he, cold, bitter, woman-hating, reclusive Cord McKay would like nothing better than to walk straight into her arms. Right here, right now, right in front of Toots the bartender, Sam the banker, Bebe the town gossip and everyone else.</p><p>Kade took him aside. \u201cHe\u2019s wasted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays he wants to press assault charges against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToots ain\u2019t callin\u2019 the sheriff. I\u2019m gonna take him home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Cord knew that wasn\u2019t enough, so he repeated it. \u201cThanks, Kade. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. But I will tell you that you\u2019re gonna hafta come up with a way to deal with him, Cord, and I doan mean with your fists. I lived with the son of a bitch and I\u2019d no idea it\u2019d gotten this bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppears he\u2019s been good at hidin\u2019 it up until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppears so. But it\u2019s out there now. Whole damn town\u2019s gonna know about it by tomorrow. I doan envy you tellin\u2019 Uncle Carson and Aunt Carolyn \u2019bout this. I\u2019d call them right away before someone else does.\u201d Kade focused on Cord\u2019s cheek. \u201cGet someone to look at that cut. You\u2019re bleedin\u2019 pretty good.\u201d</p><p>Someone. Right. He had no one.</p><p>Cord made it to the exit when he smelled her behind him. He slowly turned around and wondered if he looked as pathetic as he felt.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cSore. Pissed off. Embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured. You going home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But first I get to wake my folks up and tell \u2019em their son\u2019s a drunk and caused a scene in public. Then I get to call my brothers and my baby sis and tell them the same damn thing.\u201d He sighed. \u201cWhat the hell am I gonna do about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d AJ looked right into his eyes. \u201cI want to come home with you. No strings. I just really don\u2019t think you should be alone tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be so hard to let me take care of you? Just for one night?\u201d</p><p>Cord stared at her, wishing his hand wasn\u2019t bloody so he could touch her sweet face.</p><p>Wishing he could be a man instead of a shell of one.</p><p>\u201cCord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that, baby doll. I\u2019d like that a helluva lot more than you could ever know.</p><p>I\u2019ll see you at home.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Kade threw Colt in his pickup and he passed out before they hit the outskirts of town.</p><p>He had that same hollow feeling in his gut he\u2019d seen in Cord\u2019s eyes. Poor bastard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No extra cars were parked at the Boars Nest, just Kane\u2019s and Dag\u2019s trucks.</p><p>Great. He hadn\u2019t seen his cousin since he\u2019d inadvertently seen way more of Dag\u2019s nocturnal activities that night he\u2019d moved out. If he was lucky, maybe Dag\u2019d be passed out and he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with another fucked up situation with one of his cousins.</p><p>Colt managed to stumble into the house on his own. Kade still felt some perverse responsibility to make sure his brother was all right. After he checked on Kane and found him snoring in bed, he noticed Dag sat in the darkened living room, drinking cheap whiskey straight from the bottle.</p> <p>\u201cEvenin\u2019 cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvenin\u2019 Dag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pissed I moved inta your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just wondered why you skipped out on your dad.\u201d</p><p>Dag snorted. \u201cHe don\u2019t need me. He\u2019s got his hired hand and Chassie\u2019s squeeze, Trevor to whip the West homestead into shape.\u201d He saluted with the bottle. \u201cFuckin\u2019 place is rundown. None of the damn equipment works, and somehow the old man sees that as my fault. Even when I ain\u2019t been around for years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s blamin\u2019 you, Dag. He\u2019s old. He ain\u2019t been able to take care of that place for a long time. Since way before your mama died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe don\u2019t wanna take care of it. He ain\u2019t never wanted to be a rancher. He wanted to be a damn mechanic. But rather than stand up to granddad, he knuckled under. And instead of lettin\u2019 me pursue my dream of pro rodeo, he done the same damn thing to me.\u201d</p><p>Dag took another swig. \u201cMakin\u2019 me quit the circuit to come home to tend to forty lousy cows and two hundred acres. I could hate him for that alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>Dag sighed. \u201cI probably don\u2019t. It\u2019s just...I didn\u2019t ask for this. Ain\u2019t my fault I was born first, the only male. I ain\u2019t like you and Cord. I don\u2019t wanna spend my life a slave to the land.\u201d</p><p>Kade bristled. \u201cSo instead you\u2019re just gonna be a drunk? Carryin\u2019 on about your glorious past rodeo days? Don\u2019t you think there are times Cord and I wanna walk away?</p> <p>Say fuck it and do something easier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. You\u2019ve both got too much of that goddamn McKay pride my daddy warns me about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think my dad didn\u2019t want his sister\u2014your mother\u2014to marry a McKay? Because they don\u2019t care about no one but themselves. You ain\u2019t neighborly.</p><p>You ain\u2019t aware of nothin\u2019 that goes on outside the borders of the all important McKay Ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrunk talk. That ain\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. You\u2019ve all got too much pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have some pride than none like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck you too.\u201d</p><p>Here was the opening he\u2019d been looking for. \u201cNo thanks. But I didn\u2019t know you swung that way until I got an up close and personal view of some of your nighttime activities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you talkin\u2019 about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I can\u2019t remember shit about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been drinkin\u2019 so much you\u2019ve been blackin\u2019 out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you ever wake up with a sore mouth, a sore dick and a sore asshole with no clue of how you got it?\u201d</p><p>A hint of wariness crept into Dag\u2019s bloodshot eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re gay, Dag. But if bein\u2019 gay and bein\u2019 afraid to come out is causin\u2019 you to drink too much, you need help on a couple of different levels, cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Gay? I ain\u2019t gay. Is this some kinda joke?\u201d</p><p>Kade shook his head. \u201cI came home one night and found you in bed with not one, not two, but three guys. At first I thought you were drugged and I was gonna step in and break it up, but you appeared to be enjoyin\u2019 suckin\u2019 Max off, while Leroy fucked you in the ass. Didn\u2019t catch the name of the guy suckin\u2019 you off. Then you mentioned you\u2019d fucked and sucked both the guys before. Multiple times.\u201d</p><p>Dag\u2019s face went ghostly pale.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re gay. I do care if you\u2019re so drunk you don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re doin\u2019. I do care if you put my brother or our cousins in danger because you\u2019re habitually drunk. You are out of control, Dag. Bad.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard several times. \u201cYou ain\u2019t kiddin\u2019? You saw me?\u201d</p><p>Kade nodded.</p><p>\u201cWho knows about it? Have you told my dad what you saw me doin\u2019...with another man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Men. Who knows? Kane? Colt? Trevor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t told anyone, Dag. It ain\u2019t my business to do so.\u201d Kade stared at his cousin, who was looking more than a little forlorn.</p><p>A long pause hung between them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d kill my dad...to know I swing both ways. He\u2019s got a dream of me settlin\u2019 down with a local gal and raisin\u2019 a passel of kids on the home place. Like Colby done. That ain\u2019t me Kade. It ain\u2019t never been me. When I was on the circuit I was the real me.</p><p>Happy. Doin\u2019 what I loved. Now, I\u2019m stuck. I got no skills beyond rodeo. No place to go.</p><p>I\u2019m livin\u2019 a lie and I fuckin\u2019 hate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBooze isn\u2019t the answer. It ain\u2019t gonna make any of this go away. It\u2019ll just make you more reckless and bitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell, Dag, how am I supposed to answer that?.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m serious. If your life was a mess, what would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSober up, first. Then tell Uncle H how you feel about ranchin\u2019. If he\u2019s a jerk, have him leave the responsibilities to Chassie. Move on. As hard as it is for me to imagine leavin\u2019 here, leavin\u2019 my family, I\u2019d do it in a fuckin\u2019 heartbeat if I was as miserable as you.\u201d</p><p>Another bout of silence stretched.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll think on it.\u201d Dag gulped the last of the booze in the bottle.</p><p>\u201cYou do that. Any time you need to talk, you call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you somethin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you ain\u2019t married?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019d come out of left field. \u201cHaven\u2019t found the right woman yet.\u201d Kade thought of Skylar. Even though he\u2019d only know her for a short time she felt...right.</p><p>\u201cSo, as much as you disapprove of what me and Colt and Kane have been doin\u2019, it ain\u2019t any worse than endin\u2019 up like Cord.\u201d</p><p>Dag didn\u2019t offer any additional explanations as he shuffled off to bed.</p><p>And Kade knew Dag was actually right about one thing. He\u2019d been using his responsibilities to the ranch as an excuse to keep his life stuck in a holding pattern. He just didn\u2019t have a clue as to how to go about changing it.</p><p>He climbed in his truck and headed home.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>AJ stopped at the C-Mart for a Diet Mountain Dew and ice before she drove to Cord\u2019s place.</p><p>No yard lights were on when she started down the long driveway. She wondered if he\u2019d be embarrassed about her offer and grouchy to be the bearer of bad news to the rest of the McKays about Colt.</p><p>Why did the responsibilities always fall on his shoulders?</p><p>Keely had had major concerns about Colt\u2019s behavior for a long time. Her intuition when it came to her family was largely unrealized in the McKay clan.</p><p>Last year at Carter and Macie\u2019s wedding reception, Keely had informed Colt he\u2019d find happiness when he stopped looking for it in the bottom of a bottle or a condom box.</p><p>Colt had laughed and patted her on the head\u2014which was a typical response to her from her big, burly brothers and a reaction that drove Keely insane.</p><p>AJ shot a quick glance at Cord\u2019s dark house and dialed Keely\u2019s cell number. She answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cHey, BFF, you okay?\u201d</p><p>Keely sniffed. \u201cNo. Colt is such a dumbass. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019d do that to Cord. He worships Cord. We all do.\u201d She sniffled again. \u201cDid you see what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it awful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve never seen Cord so mad. Not his usual quiet, dangerous mad. It was his\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014I wanna rip someone\u2019s head off and watch me do it with one hand, kind of mad.</p><p>I\u2019ve only seen it once and that was enough.\u201d</p><p>AJ listened to Keely\u2019s quiet cries. \u201cI wish I was there, K, because I know how much this stuff freaks you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. But it\u2019s more important you\u2019re there for Cord. He told me you were coming over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But I knew you\u2019d go to him. I knew you wouldn\u2019t let him hurt alone.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cHe is hurting, AJ, not just where Colt punched him.</p><p>Don\u2019t let him push you away. Be there for him. Someone needs to be. Call me tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>AJ followed the curved walkway to the front door. She stepped inside. No sign of Cord in the living room. After putting the ice in the freezer, she heard the shower running upstairs.</p><p>He\u2019d left the door to the master bathroom open a crack. \u201cCord? Just wanted to let you know I\u2019m up here so you don\u2019t think I\u2019m an intruder and shoot me.\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>She saw the pile of clothes in front of the dresser. Not her place to wash them, but Cord didn\u2019t need a bloody reminder of the evening\u2019s events. She jammed them in the overflowing hamper and faced the bed. Not ideal, but it\u2019d work. She peeled back the comforter and ripped away the top sheet, shoving the pillows to the floor.</p><p>AJ made a quick trip to the kitchen for supplies. She was arranging everything on the nightstand when the bathroom door squeaked and he limped out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cord wore a towel. A small towel. Even when her hormones did the boot scootin\u2019 boogie from the sight of all that yummy bare man flesh and bulging muscles, she noticed the dejected set of his shoulders, the swollen bump on his jaw, the mouse under his eye and the cut on his cheekbone.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should see the look on your face, AJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis look?\u201d She made a funny face and his faint smile appeared.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, baby doll, you\u2019re a real laugh a minute.\u201d He kept a hand on the towel and pointed. \u201cThe bed make you so mad that you ripped it apart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just getting it ready.\u201d</p><p>Cord sighed again. \u201cNo offense, but I\u2019m not really in the mood tonight. In fact, I\u2019ll probably be lousy company so it might be best if you went on home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh-uh. The hottest man I know is stark naked right in front of me, no way am I going anywhere. Lay face down on the mattress, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis bossy side of you is new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah. Ky wouldn\u2019t agree. He once said I was as bossy as...well, you if I recall.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slightly again.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I hide my bossiness except when I\u2019m in professional mode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessional?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat part of \u2018massage therapist\u2019 is confusing to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna give me a massage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you already told me a blowjob was out for options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmy Jo Foster, that is beyond ornery.\u201d</p><p>She laughed because she\u2019d actually shocked him. \u201cI like it when you get all prissy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it when you get all raunchy,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She patted the bed. \u201cLose the towel. Lay on your stomach and spread your arms above your head in a Y and prepare to be wowed.\u201d</p><p>Cord did exactly as he was told.</p> <p>\u201cUsually I\u2019m standing, but tonight I have to improvise. Here.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the baggie full of ice wrapped in a towel. \u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour jaw. It\u2019ll keep the swelling down.\u201d</p><p>Something beyond gratitude shone in his eyes. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Try to relax. Remember this isn\u2019t sexual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to remember that,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou want music playing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is fine.\u201d</p><p>AJ poured oil on her palms and started at the base of his skull, working her fingers down his neck. Cord remained tense, not that she blamed him. A first time professional massage was different than the well-meaning back rub from a loved one. He finally loosened up with a deep, heartfelt groan of satisfaction when she moved down to work on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou are amazingly good at this, AJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Seriously, wonderfully, awesomely, astoundingly good. How much school do you have left before you graduate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne trimester, which is mostly clinical work. Then I can hang out my shingle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be overrun with customers. And marriage proposals from all sorts of men who\u2019ve experienced your magic hands.\u201d</p><p>Would that last group include you?</p><p>Don\u2019t go there, AJ. She kept her mouth shut and concentrated on his biceps and triceps.</p><p>But Cord wouldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cWhere you thinkin\u2019 of settin\u2019 up shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely and I talked about opening our own place either in Sundance or Moorcroft, but that was before things changed.\u201d</p><p>Cord tensed up again. \u201cWhat sort of things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings like Mama selling the ranch. Things like Jenn and the kids moving to Billings. Things like my potential partner/roommate/BFF Keely neglecting to tell me she\u2019d rather not be a massage therapist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What does she want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo continue her schooling and get a dual degree as a certified physical therapist and an occupational therapist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does that leave you?\u201d</p><p>Lost. \u201cIn Denver. It\u2019s a real crapshoot at this point where I\u2019ll end up come January.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>She allowed her brain to slide into professional mode as she finished his upper back.</p><p>On to the gluteus maximus\u2014or the best butt she\u2019d ever had her hands on. How could she stay neutral while rubbing and stroking perfectly squeezable man flesh? Without thinking of how she\u2019d clutched it tightly while Cord pumped in and out of her with such passion?</p><p>If she looked closely, she might even see scratches from her fingernails.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the deal, McKay. It\u2019s up to you whether I skip your very fine butt and move on to your very fine legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy up to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a situation where I\u2019m not intimately acquainted with the client, it\u2019s not a problem. We both know that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019ve had your tight tush in my hands. I don\u2019t know if I can massage it without remembering my death grip the last time you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you tryin\u2019 to give me a hard-on, AJ? \u2019Cause it\u2019s workin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She bit back a smile. \u201cNo. We actually have a class entitled, \u2018The Male Erection: Nothing Personal\u2019 which is my favorite class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s personal,\u201d he growled, \u201cvery personal. Intensely personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll focus on the backs of your legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>AJ tried not to look at the area between his thighs. But her gaze was continually drawn to the heavy sac covered in crinkly dark hair, a contrast against the stark white sheet.</p><p>\u201cStop starin\u2019 at my butt.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not. I\u2019m staring at your balls. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you usually talk to your clients while you\u2019re doin\u2019 this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. Mostly they\u2019re trying to relax so it\u2019s minimal conversation. Lots of people wear iPods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt bugs the hell outta me.\u201d</p><p>AJ pinched her thumbs down the center of his right calf. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like no one can stand the sound of silence. Always gotta have music playin\u2019 or TV blarin\u2019 or noises blastin\u2019 out of some handheld game. Even Colt can\u2019t work without some shit rattlin\u2019 his brain. Hell. Maybe that\u2019s his problem.\u201d</p><p>Here was her opening. \u201cSo what happens between you two now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t like I can fire him. Even though I wanted to today and yesterday when he didn\u2019t show up and I only got half the damn field hayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you were late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sorry. Lost track of time. Worked \u2019til damn near dark, then I hadta call Ky.</p><p>Shoulda called you too.\u201d He moaned when she hit a sore tendon by his ankle. \u201cI was a dickhead earlier at the bar. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>His sincere apology surprised her. She honestly thought he\u2019d be too stubborn to admit he was wrong. \u201cYou\u2019re forgiven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t gonna be that easy for Colt. Thing\u2019s been goin\u2019 to hell in a handbasket where he\u2019s concerned. Yeah, he\u2019s a thirty-one-year-old adult male and he oughta know better than to make such stupid decisions, but he don\u2019t. He never learns. Makes me question his decisions about the ranch, if you wanna know the truth. We all excuse his behavior and laugh it off as him sowin\u2019 his oats. Well, no more.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s goin\u2019 over there to talk to him first thing in the mornin\u2019. Guess Ma and Aunt Kimi are gonna fumigate the place tomorrow afternoon. Colt ain\u2019t gonna be workin\u2019 with me or anyone else for the time bein\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry too. And I sure as hell didn\u2019t need to end my long-ass day by getting into fisticuffs with my drunk brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. You\u2019re ending your day with a massage.\u201d</p><p>He smiled over his shoulder at her. \u201cMuch as I appreciate it, I\u2019m gonna ask you don\u2019t massage my feet. They\u2019re sore, they smell and they\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTicklish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. The tough cowboy does have a weak spot. I\u2019ll have to remember that.\u201d And exploit it at some point. She slapped his naked flank. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to turn over anyway. I need to get busy on your front.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Cord wouldn\u2019t survive those clever fingers.</p><p>He was in deep with this woman. Her feistiness in the bar turned him on. Her sweetness in the aftermath of the shit that\u2019d gone down with Colt had turned him on even more. But her hands? All over him? Soothing and tempting and taking away all sorts of aches and pains externally and internally? He\u2019d gone beyond turned on.</p><p>\u201cAJ, I don\u2019t think I can stand havin\u2019 you touch me without wantin\u2019 to touch you right back in the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind. I told you that.\u201d</p><p>Cord reached for her. He didn\u2019t speak. He just traced the back of his hand over the soft skin on her face. \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty. God, you\u2019re so pretty.\u201d</p><p>She blushed, making her even prettier, in his opinion. \u201cYou want me to finish the massage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn one condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to take off your shirt.\u201d</p><p>AJ frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always make me take mine off. Turnabout is fair play. Might be crass, but I wanna see your tits bouncin\u2019 while you\u2019re rubbin\u2019 me down. I thought about that a lot as you were workin\u2019 on my back. A whole lot. What those beautiful perky breasts looked like swayin\u2019 free. If the tips were hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. In case you haven\u2019t noticed I have a thing for them beauties.\u201d In case you haven\u2019t noticed I have a thing for you too, baby doll. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay. But I get to sit on your pelvis.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Cord actually felt his mouth water when AJ stripped off her bright pink tank top and unhooked the plain white cotton bra. He longed to touch those tempting points. To lick.</p><p>To suck. To bury his face in those pillowy mounds.</p><p>She leaned over to grab the oil and his tongue shot out to swipe across a ripe tip.</p><p>\u201cNo licking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I started I doubt you\u2019d make me stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re not gonna start, Cord McKay. Now hold still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy. You don\u2019t have to do the same on my account. The bouncier the better.\u201d</p><p>Although she straddled his pelvis, she didn\u2019t writhe on his groin as she concentrated on massaging his pecs and lats. She spent a long time rubbing the area around his nipples.</p><p>Conversation was at standstill. His breathing changed. Her breathing changed. They didn\u2019t look at each other; they just focused on body parts.</p><p>After AJ dug her fingertips into his hips, she nonverbally urged him to spread his legs wider. Without commenting on his raging hard-on, she continued to work his quads.</p><p>Her breasts swayed so provocatively he clenched his hands into fists to keep from reaching for them.</p><p>A soft whip of hair lashed across his distended cock. Cord\u2019s eyes flew open a second before the warm, wet heat of AJ\u2019s mouth enclosed him.</p><p>\u201cChrist. What the hell are you doin\u2019, AJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must be doing it wrong if you don\u2019t know.\u201d She sucked him deep. And dragged her bottom teeth up the vein before she released him from that velvet warmth.</p><p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t expectin\u2019\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I want to do it. Let me bring you. I want you to come in my mouth. I wanna know what you taste like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Okay.\u201d Right. Like he could say no to that.</p><p>AJ licked and lapped his cock, suckling his engorged cockhead, bringing him higher with every sweeping breath and delicate lick. Her single-minded intentions roused him to a whole different level of pleasure. When she brought her magic hands into play, rolling his balls and stroking the base of his shaft, holding back was a joke. He groaned as his cock emptied on her tongue in short, intense bursts and she swallowed every hot drop.</p><p>While he drifted down from her sweet, unselfish loving, she finished his massage and wiped the oil from his body.</p><p>Finally, he opened his eyes.</p> <p>AJ offered him a shy smile.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>She scooted up and placed her head on his chest.</p><p>He skimmed his fingertips up and down her naked spine. \u201cThat was the best massage I ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the first massage you\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But that wasn\u2019t the first blowjob I\u2019ve ever gotten and that one was the best too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie to you, baby doll. It was fuckin\u2019 amazin\u2019. Come up here and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>The tentative movement of her lips and tongue against his as she tried to hold back amused him. Cord knew she liked it when he controlled her mouth, when he urged them a little toward desperation. But the desperation he felt tonight owed nothing to sexual heat.</p><p>AJ sensed his mood and placed gentle kisses on every mark Colt left on his face. His stomach churned when he thought back to Colt\u2019s words and actions and the realization his brother was sick and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it. No way he could fix Colt like he\u2019d fix fence. He\u2019d try like hell, but Colt wouldn\u2019t beat this if he couldn\u2019t admit he had a problem. He sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou thinking about Colt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cIt\u2019s late. I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay. I can put it aside when you\u2019re here. Besides. I haven\u2019t kissed you proper. I need a taste of them sweet, sweet lips.\u201d</p><p>She smiled against his throat, nibbled his neck up to his mouth. \u201cShow me a proper kiss, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talkin\u2019 about your mouth, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>Her gray eyes widened.</p><p>Cord grinned. \u201cTake off them panties and crawl up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna get your butt slapped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen slide off those bikinis and pull up your skirt.\u201d</p><p>Rather than take off just her panties, AJ stripped off everything. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here for this, Cord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I\u2019m dyin\u2019 to put my mouth on you because, sweets, I love to watch you come. It\u2019s like you\u2019re getting an unexpected present every damn time.\u201d</p><p>AJ blushed.</p><p>Cord shifted down on the mattress. \u201cStraddle me. Up on your knees. Grab the headboard.\u201d When she hesitated he urged her closer so he could suck a nipple. \u201cDon\u2019t act all shy on me. I\u2019m gonna make you feel good. You know I can. You know you want it.\u201d</p><p>She moved into position. So did Cord. He slid his head between her knees.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m sitting on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd thank God for that. They used to call them mustache rides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord!\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAngle yourself a little farther back. Hold tight.\u201d</p><p>Before his tongue lapped the shiny wetness, before his hands spread her wide for the invasion of his fingers, he simply inhaled her. The sweet scent of AJ\u2019s arousal\u2014like sunshine and cotton. Like home.</p><p>He delved his tongue into her tight channel, long strokes as deep as it could reach, as his thumb flicked her clit in the same cadence.</p><p>AJ began to whimper immediately.</p><p>Cord sensed her orgasm gathering steam and her pussy muscles clenched around his tongue as she went over the edge. He figured the first one would be fast. Kissing a path down the inside of her thigh, he rotated his hands to clutch her ass.</p><p>\u201cCord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, baby doll. You can go again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He smacked her butt hard and she yelped. Leisurely, he licked every spot in her engorged pussy but her clit and blew a cool stream of air across the wetness. Petted the curve of her mound with his chin and cheek, intrigued by the contrast between her pale blondness and the darker tones of his hands on her skin.</p><p>When she could take direct contact, he fastened his mouth to her clit and sucked relentlessly, refusing to release that sensitive nub until he felt blood beat against his lips and she cried out his name.</p><p>Then she wailed, \u201cOh-man-oh-man-oh-man. Stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. One more. This one will take longer, but it\u2019ll be worth it, I promise. Come on, let me bring you off once more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Another spank. \u201cEvery time I hear a but, I\u2019m whackin\u2019 yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut. Crap. That one didn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it did.\u201d Whack. \u201cI think maybe you like a little ass play.\u201d Cord smoothed his hands over the curvy, hot cheeks. Then he traced the seam of her ass down to her tailbone. \u201cYou know I\u2019m gonna want in this ass, AJ.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at him. \u201cIn. Meaning\u2014what in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fingers. My tongue. But mostly I wanna grind my cock in there. I\u2019ve been the only man in your pussy, the only man in your mouth. The way I see it, that last bit of virginity belongs strictly to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Another crack across her tush. Both sides this time. \u201cI can see the interest in your eyes, so don\u2019t lie to me. You wanna know what that feels like, but you think you shouldn\u2019t wanna know stuff like that. Feels dirty, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cIf thinkin\u2019 about me doin\u2019 that to you turns you on? Nothin\u2019 wrong with that.</p><p>Nothin\u2019 that happens between us is wrong unless it ain\u2019t consensual. If you say no, I\u2019ll respect it. But sweet baby Jesus I\u2019d be lyin\u2019 if I didn\u2019t say I\u2019m hopin\u2019 for a big yes at some point. Soon.\u201d</p><p>He flattened his tongue and licked her from her bottom hole to the top of her sex.</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>Cord nuzzled the seam of her thighs. He dragged the wetness from her pussy down the crack of her ass to her tight hole, which was as pretty and pink as the rest of her.</p><p>She immediately tensed up.</p><p>\u201cNot doin\u2019 anything. Just givin\u2019 you an idea on how this\u2019ll feel.\u201d He circled the tip around those blood-rich nerve endings, suckling her clit in time to his finger until she began to bump her hips.</p><p>\u201cCord. Please. Make me come. No more teasing.\u201d</p><p>What AJ didn\u2019t know was he wasn\u2019t teasing her. After two fairly quick orgasms she\u2019d need time to recover, just like a man would.</p><p>Evidently Cosmo hadn\u2019t mentioned that factoid.</p><p>He built her again, circumventing her clit entirely. When he knew she was close, he twisted two fingers inside and stroked her G-spot. He held her clit between his teeth and flicked it with the very tip of his tongue, keeping his lips suctioned around it.</p><p>AJ went wild. Her legs shook. She alternately whimpered and begged. It was so unbelievably hot having her riding his face, that after her intense orgasm left her hoarse and gasping, Cord dropped his hand to his cock and jacked off like a randy teenager, letting come spray across his belly and losing his mind in AJ\u2019s willingness to try anything.</p><p>Finally, her sex quit pulsing and AJ flopped to the mattress. He retreated to the bathroom to clean up.</p><p>She murmured a protest at the sensation of the warm cloth, but ultimately let her legs fall open to him. He swiped the area between thighs sticky with her juices and his saliva, with a few red marks from his beard.</p><p>He looked at the clock. Two a.m. Then he glanced at her. AJ looked so comfortable, so cuddly, so perfect in his bed he didn\u2019t have the heart to make her get dressed.</p><p>Cord tossed a few pillows at the headboard and nestled her against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired. I know I have to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust rest, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I like this. Your body is so hard. And warm. Like snuggling up to a sun-warmed rock.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A much better description than Colt\u2019s accusation of him being a cold bastard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wake me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly in the morning so you can sneak in bed before anyone knows you were out all night.\u201d Selfish of him, but he didn\u2019t want her to leave.</p> <p>\u201cGood plan. Which means that\u2019s another virginity you can claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never slept in the same bed with a man. Ever. Not for an hour, especially not all night. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p> <p>AJ woke with a start. Where was she? And why was she...naked? A snore behind her made her jump. She turned slightly and saw Cord sprawled face down on the mattress beside her. Just as naked as she.</p><p>She was in Cord\u2019s bed? Her gaze flew to the clock. Five a.m.</p><p>Damn. She\u2019d been out all night.</p><p>So? You\u2019re an adult. You\u2019re entitled to cut loose once in awhile.</p><p>True. But neither her mom nor sister needed the extra worry in their lives.</p><p>AJ slid off the bed and kept an eagle eye on her lover as she dressed. Part of her wanted to wake him; part of her wanted to sneak out and deal with him later. She withheld a snort. How very Bridget Jones. She never thought this situation would happen to her. She and Cord hadn\u2019t had sex\u2014well, technically not penetration sex, but oral sex counted as real sex, right?</p> <p>Stop with the dissection and move your behind.</p><p>She retrieved her purse from the kitchen counter and checked her cell phone as she tiptoed out the front door. No missed calls, no new voice mail messages.</p><p>Whew. Dodged a bullet this time.</p><p>She climbed into her Jeep. The sun was a salmon-colored speck, lightening the sky to a myriad of pinks and orange. When she hit the gravel road running in front of Cord\u2019s place, she stopped.</p><p>Even after twenty-two years, the magnificence of this land flat out stunned her. This early in the morning the hills were still hidden in darkness, but the promise of dawn burned across the fields and valleys in a splash of pastel colors. The only part AJ had loved about getting up at the crack of nothing to do chores was the sense of accomplishment that she\u2019d managed to help them hold on to the ranch\u2014the place she\u2019d called home\u2014for another day.</p><p>Home. She\u2019d never bought into that old saying, \u201chome is where the heart is\u201d, mostly because it\u2019d never applied to her.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be easy for her mother to move. Florence Foster had spent more years living on the ranch than her daughter. And AJ felt childish wishing for childish things\u2014</p><p>for things not to change.</p> <p>Oddly enough, she accepted things wouldn\u2019t change with Cord. His serious nature and need for control never scared her, mostly because she\u2019d experienced the same weight of responsibilities that still hung on his shoulders. He\u2019d always been curtly polite with her, never teasing her mercilessly like Keely\u2019s other brothers, so discovering Cord\u2019s sense of humor was an unexpected bonus.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t do her any good to dwell on all the things she liked about him because that could eat up her entire day.</p><p>Since she was already up, she fed Lucy and the other horses and cleaned stalls.</p><p>Three hours later Jenn and the kids waved as they left for the day. She and Jenn had debated on keeping the kids at the ranch with Aunt Amy Jo instead of sending them to the summer day camp. But Jenn wanted one normal thing in her children\u2019s lives in light of the divorce and their impending move.</p><p>AJ dragged into the house. She started a pot of coffee and ran upstairs to shower. As she dressed, she looked longingly at her pristinely made bed, but there\u2019d be no rest for the wicked today.</p><p>Three cups of coffee lifted the mental cobwebs and she heard her mother stirring in the front room. \u201cMa? You ready for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust coffee this morning, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>AJ set the cup on the tray and perched on the chair by the bed. \u201cA couple of things I need to know before I get started. All the farm equipment is property included in the deed? We don\u2019t have to worry about holding an auction or cleaning out the machine shed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Carson said they\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything in the attic is boxed. Where should I start next? The cellar?\u201d</p><p>Florence shook her head. \u201cJenn tossed most of that old junk when the propane guy came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple months back when I was having problems with the heater again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas the temperature been better in this room? I know you said it was too cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt fluctuates, as usual. The heating problems are one thing I won\u2019t miss about this old house.\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou should start by throwing away a bunch of stuff like the magazines in the middle room upstairs. Your daddy loved \u2019em but there\u2019s no point in keeping \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Which leads me to my next question. We haven\u2019t talked about what to do with the horses. I want to keep Lucy. As far as the rest? I know Macie\u2019s dad, Cash Big Crow, is looking for stock. He\u2019d treat them well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what, you take care of that part of this ranch sale business and I\u2019ll let you keep the money from the sale.\u201d</p><p>That was an unexpected surprise. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d She drained her coffee and AJ brought the pot over for refills. \u201cThanks.</p><p>Sorry to be such a pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama. You\u2019re not a pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am sorry you\u2019re doing all the packing up. I won\u2019t be any help and Jenn has packing of her own to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat just means I get first dibs on the cool stuff for my apartment.\u201d AJ scrutinized her mother head to toe. \u201cWhat do you need me to do for you before I get to work? Are you ready for your massage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater. I\u2019ll probably watch some TV.\u201d She stared into her cup. \u201cMaybe you should rest since you were out all night.\u201d</p><p>AJ hated the guilty heat burning her cheeks. \u201cWere you worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I probably wouldn\u2019t have known if I hadn\u2019t gotten up to use the bathroom and saw your car pulling in at a quarter after five this morning.\u201d Florence sighed. \u201cNo lecture.</p><p>You\u2019re an adult. Can I ask if you were with a man last night?\u201d</p><p>She debating on lying, but she saw no reason to. \u201cYes, I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious.\u201d Her mom winked. \u201cI\u2019m gonna say be careful and let you escape before your face turns any redder, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be upstairs. If you need anything, just holler.\u201d</p><p>She hauled a bunch of full garbage bags downstairs. By the third trip she took a breather on the porch steps. It\u2019d be another hot one today\u2014the thermometer read ninety at ten o\u2019clock. She\u2019d finished her second glass of iced tea when her cell phone rang.</p><p>Caller ID said MM.</p><p>\u201cMacie McKay, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy breakfast,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cAnyway, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow the feeling. I remember how much work it was being a caretaker and I feel for ya.\u201d</p><p>AJ couldn\u2019t confess the real reason for her tiredness\u2014playing grab ass with Cord till the wee hours. Macie would blab to her husband, Carter, and then all the McKays would know about her and Cord. \u201cSo didja call me to lend your support?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I called because I\u2019m coming to Sundance tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Cool. What time, how long, and all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly, we\u2019ll be there overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe, meaning you and Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Me, Gemma and the twins.\u201d</p><p>AJ squealed. \u201cNot that it\u2019s not awesome you\u2019re coming, Mace, but I love love love those darling babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and everyone else. Channing hasn\u2019t been feeling well enough to travel, so she\u2019s dying to see Gemma and the babies again. Gemma\u2019s a little stir crazy stuck in the house breastfeeding twins every two hours, and I have a building I need to check out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA building? For what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you when I get there. In fact, is there any way you can get tomorrow afternoon and tomorrow night off from your caretaking duties? After the business deal, Channing wants a girls\u2019 night with the four of us. I guess she\u2019s kicking Colby out too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash isn\u2019t coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s haying season and he\u2019ll be working until dark. It\u2019ll drive Dad bonkers to be away from his twins for even a day, but between us, I think Gemma\u2019s looking for a break from him too.\u201d</p><p>AJ grinned. Cash Big Crow was all gooey-eyed and awestruck over the newest additions to his family. To hear Macie tell it, because Cash hadn\u2019t been around at all during Macie\u2019s early years, he was determined to do and learn everything this go around and be a very hands-on daddy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to my sister and see if I can work something out. If nothing else, maybe one of Mama\u2019s friends would like to come over, especially since we\u2019re moving and it might be a last chance.\u201d</p><p>Macie was quiet. \u201cYou okay with the McKays buying the Foster ranch, AJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really have a choice but to slap on a happy face. I won\u2019t lie; it\u2019s gonna be hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweets. We\u2019ll talk more tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Over margaritas, AJ hoped. \u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Channing would let Gemma stay anywhere besides with her?\u201d Macie laughed. \u201cI\u2019d planned on staying there too, but Carter wants me bunking at Carolyn and Carson\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be glad to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call from Channing\u2019s and let you know what time I\u2019ll swing by to get you. I\u2019d like to see how your mom is doing before we head out.\u201d</p><p>Might be ridiculous, but AJ was touched. Macie\u2019s thoughtfulness and feisty sweetness were just a couple of reasons why they\u2019d become close friends in the last year. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like that. Mama would too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then when we\u2019re alone we can gossip about Keely\u2019s latest cowboy on a string and you can tell me exactly how my sexy, gruff brother-in-law deflowered you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie! How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t until you just told me.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cYou\u2019re so easy to tease. Oops, Carter\u2019s bellering at me, gotta go.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the morning zipped by. AJ fixed lunch, and settled her mother down for her afternoon nap and a massage. She packed more boxes, pleased by how much she\u2019d accomplished. She\u2019d gone into the garage to find a crowbar, when she heard a vehicle pull up. After stepping outside, she blocked the bright sunlight with her hand and squinted at Cord\u2019s 350 diesel.</p><p>He climbed out and the truck door slammed.</p><p>\u201cCord? What\u2019re you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ. My dad asked me to stop by and give Flo some papers.\u201d</p> <p>Disappointment made her shoulders sag. He wasn\u2019t here just to see her. \u201cShe\u2019s sleeping. Since she hasn\u2019t been sleeping well, I don\u2019t want to wake her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to leave the papers with a note?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long before she wakes up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably an hour.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cHuh. Is Jenn around?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. She and the kids are in town. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re all alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why does that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cord crushed his mouth to hers and pushed her into the barn.</p><p>This was what she wanted. Darkness, heat, need. Cord devouring her. Kissing her like she was everything. His rough hands racing all over her body as if he couldn\u2019t decide which part he wanted to touch first.</p><p>He ate at her mouth and trailed his teeth down her throat. \u201cDrove me insane when you weren\u2019t there this mornin\u2019. Why didn\u2019t you wake me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I supposed to? I don\u2019t know anything about morning after stuff like that. I saw the clock and panicked. You said no overnights and no one knew where I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you. I woke up wantin\u2019 you. Seein\u2019 the imprint of your head on the pillow.</p> <p>The room smelled like you. Sunshine. Sex. The scent of your sweet juices was still in my beard. Made me instantly hard, rememberin\u2019 tastin\u2019 you. Feelin\u2019 your hands on me. That naughty mouth suckin\u2019 me dry. I\u2019ve spent all goddamn day hard as a posthole digger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, AJ. I wanna pin you against the wall and fuck you hard enough to rattle the stalls. Then I want to bend you over the railin\u2019 and take you from behind, sinkin\u2019 my teeth into that spot at the base of your neck that makes you scream my name.\u201d</p><p>AJ swallowed. \u201cUm. Let\u2019s start with just one and work our way down the wish list, okay?\u201d</p><p>Cord slanted his mouth over hers. Somehow he lifted her and wrapped her legs around his waist, all while kissing her, all while walking backward.</p><p>She opened her eyes. They stopped outside the tack room.</p><p>After setting her on her feet, he grabbed her wrists and held them above her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tyin\u2019 your hands. I can do whatever I want and you hafta hang there and take it like a good girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Crap.</p><p>His dark blue eyes narrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s one.\u201d He looped her wrists with baling twine and fastened it through a rope pulley above her head, which was used for loading bales.</p><p>Cord\u2019s show of domination made the inside of her thighs moist, her sex ached for the attention of his fingers or his mouth or his cock.</p><p>He ripped open her blouse and unhooked her bra. Stripped off her shorts and underwear. He leisurely traced the contours of her body from the valley of her breasts straight down to her slit. Although his mouth never touched her, his hot breath drifted against her damp skin. \u201cYou like this. My sweet angel has a devilish streak, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know. \u2019Cause you\u2019re dealin\u2019 with the devil himself right now, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>Cord unbuckled his belt. \u201cSuch a pretty picture you make.\u201d He released the zipper on his jeans a tine at a time.</p><p>The sound of his buckle jingling as he worked his jeans down his thighs drove her wild. No other noises existed. Nothing existed but this man and her burning need for him.</p><p>Her nipples were hard as cherry pits and her whole body quaked. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Double crap.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s two. And trust me, I am keepin\u2019 track.\u201d Cord fisted his hand around his cock and stroked himself with more force than she\u2019d dared try.</p><p>She rubbed her thighs together, searching for any kind of friction. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt when you pull hard like that?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNope. You are such a curious little kitty-cat. Have you thought about jackin\u2019 me off?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar. I jacked off last night while I was havin\u2019 you as my midnight snack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You weren\u2019t next to me this mornin\u2019 when I woke up with a dick hard enough to break concrete, so I had to whack off right there on the sheets that smelled like you.\u201d</p><p>Something shifted between them\u2014maybe the balance of power, maybe a sense of inevitability.</p><p>AJ locked her eyes to his. \u201cEnough teasing. Either get over here and fuck me or let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. This kitty-cat has claws?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis pussy has an itch and if you ain\u2019t up for scratching it right now, Cord McKay\u2014\u201d</p><p>He lifted her, pressed her knees wide against the partition, and slid into her in one fast stroke.</p><p>\u201cYes. Oh yes.\u201d</p><p>Cord buried his face in her neck, withdrew and plunged in again. And again. He changed the angle by bending his knees, and clamped his fingers on her butt, pistoning his hips fast as a jackhammer.</p><p>AJ twisted her body, trying to grind into his pelvis, wishing she had the use of her hands.</p><p>\u201cHold still,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cBut I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s three. What you need it to not get slivers in this sassy ass. We are doin\u2019 this the way I want, AJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He never moved his head, never missed a stroke when he said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She circled her legs around his waist and jerked him closer. Sweat trickled between her breasts. The hair on the back of her neck lifted. Every inch of her skin tingled. All that energy shot straight to her core and the orgasm blindsided her.</p><p>\u201cOh-man-oh-man-oh-man.\u201d</p><p>Colt whispered against her throat, \u201cHarder, baby doll, bear down on me harder.</p><p>That\u2019s good.\u201d His climax burst with enough force she felt her insides bathed with his heat.</p><p>Her womb kept contracting to keep all that seed inside. Each throb and pulse was longer than the last and she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cSsh.\u201d His mouth found hers. A gentle brush of his lips as he looked into her eyes.</p><p>While he kissed her, his hips kept bumping in tiny increments. Not fast or slow. Steady until the spasms ended. With the last movement he withdrew from her completely and set her on her feet.</p><p>Wetness gushed out. She wondered if the twine wasn\u2019t holding her up if she\u2019d even be able to stand.</p><p>Cord stepped back and yanked up his jeans. \u201cLike I said earlier. I was needin\u2019 you bad, AJ.\u201d</p><p>Not missing her, needing her. \u201cUntie me. I have to get cleaned up before I go in the house.\u201d</p><p>Zipped and buckled, he ignored her request and demanded, \u201cThere any baby wipes in here?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy would we have those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost places have them around for one reason or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Might be some in the tack room. Can\u2019t you let me loose before you go looking?\u201d</p><p>Cord\u2019s gaze traveled the length of the rope. \u201cYour arms hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can wait until I find somethin\u2019 to clean you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s four.\u201d</p><p>Feeling surly, she snapped, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get it up to an even ten? But but but but but but.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmarty. Lord. I am gonna enjoy the feel of my hand on those soft cheeks. In case you were curious, kitty-cat, that means ten each side, not ten total.\u201d</p><p>She averted her eyes to the hay-strewn ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Does that scare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever had a spanking. Not as a kid, definitely not as an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever was a bad girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I followed the rules and did what I was told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like me.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou were the bad boy of the county, or so I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you heard wrong. Anyway, we\u2019re just gettin\u2019 into all sortsa new things, ain\u2019t we?\u201d Cord grinned cheekily. \u201cSit tight. Or stand tight. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha, McKay. I\u2019d like to see how you\u2019d react if the tables were turned.\u201d</p><p>He poked his head back around. \u201cYou\u2019d like to tie me up? Or just whup my ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. Let me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you threatened me? No way.\u201d He cracked open the pop-top on a plastic cylinder and pulled out a couple of sheets. \u201cThese\u2019ll work.\u201d Cord gently wiped the inside of her thighs.</p><p>AJ gasped, \u201cThat\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost done.\u201d Cord shook the hay from her panties and shorts, helping her get redressed. Then he released the pulley, loosening the rope and freed her hands from the twine. Before he allowed her to rub her wrists, he checked them. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He gave each ligature mark one a quick kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll get the papers and you can pass \u2019em to Flo when she wakes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t gonna wait around?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A sheepish look crossed his face and she knew he\u2019d used the papers as an excuse to see her. She was absurdly pleased.</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He brushed the dust off his hat and put it back on before he headed outside.</p><p>She followed.</p> <p>After she had the manila envelope in her hand, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t be late tonight.</p><p>Seventeen penalties is plenty to get me started,\u201d before his rig took off in a cloud of dust.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>AJ arrived at Cord\u2019s house early evening to find a note taped to the door.</p><p>Strip. Lock the door. Sit by the fireplace, put on the blindfold and wait. No talking.</p> <p>Oh man. What did he have in store for her?</p><p>She\u2019d anticipated he\u2019d want her naked as soon as possible, so she\u2019d worn a summer sun dress\u2014easy on, easy off, no bra, no panties. After she was naked, she paraded into the living room. The coffee table had been shoved against the far wall, leaving the big area rug empty.</p><p>The sitting area directly in front of the fireplace grate was constructed of slabs of slate. Despite the hot day, that dark rock never heated, so she knew it\u2019d be like sitting on a block of ice on her bare ass. Still, she did it and slipped the neckerchief over her eyes.</p><p>While AJ waited in absolute silence, she listened to the sounds of the house. The chimes on the porch. The wind rattling the rafters. The whir of the ceiling fan. The hum of the refrigerator. In the distance she heard the horses neighing and the answering low moos of the cattle.</p><p>She inhaled slowly and deeply to counteract her racing heart. AJ smelled bacon and laundry soap and Windex and sage. And Cord.</p><p>Then she heard his bare feet shuffling across the wood floor. Muffled by the rug.</p> <p>Closer. Closer. She swallowed hard when the footsteps stopped.</p><p>\u201cYour penalties for tonight include no talkin\u2019 unless I say so. Which also means you don\u2019t get to argue with me. So let\u2019s get started right away. Hold out your right hand.\u201d</p><p>She did. A drop of something landed on her finger.</p><p>\u201cRub your fingertips together.\u201d</p><p>She smeared the slickness, like oil or K-Y around the pad of her thumb and index finger.</p><p>\u201cKick your heels out but make sure you\u2019re still balanced on the hearth. I wanna see your pussy.\u201d</p><p>A strange feeling unfurled as she did as instructed, even as her cheeks burned: one set with cold, one with heat.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself. Show me how you make yourself come.\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth opened to protest and she remembered the no talking rule.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re learnin\u2019. Move them fingers down to that juicy pink pussy.\u201d</p><p>AJ tentatively stroked from her clit down a few times, worried what would happen if she couldn\u2019t come on his command.</p><p>\u201cJust you and me here, baby doll. Don\u2019t be embarrassed. Tease me. Make me wish it was my fingers gettin\u2019 you off. Give me a show that\u2019ll make my dick harder.\u201d</p><p>With his encouragement, she lost some of her fear and pushed her middle finger into her pussy. She pumped that long digit in and out, getting it good and wet, using the bony section of her thumb to grind into her clit. When her finger was slick enough, she slid it up to her clit and rubbed. Lord that felt good, even when she did it to herself.</p><p>\u201cSo sexy. Keep goin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Knowing he watched her was a complete turn on. She rubbed directly on that little nub and thought of Cord stroking his cock at the same time. Not allowing himself to come until she did. AJ bit her lip. So close. She tweaked her nipple hard with her free hand while she rubbed short strokes on her clit and that did it. She came with a low moan.</p><p>Soon as the orgasm ended, she felt Cord in front of her. He plucked up her right hand to suck the juices from her fingers and her belly swooped.</p><p>\u201cJesus, that was hot as hell, my porn-star rodeo queen.\u201d He helped her to her feet and carefully led her to the rug, urging her to lay on her back. \u201cMy turn.\u201d Cold oil dripped between her breasts.</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>\u201cBeen wantin\u2019 to do this since the first time I got my hands on these.\u201d Cord straddled her waist and held the mounds together with his hands as he slid his warm cock in the deep valley of her cleavage. He hissed and began to thrust. \u201cBetween how goddamn good this feels and watchin\u2019 you touch yourself, I ain\u2019t gonna last long at all.\u201d</p><p>AJ wished she wasn\u2019t blindfolded so she could see his face. Yet she already knew the rhythm of his body. He was frantic, about to blow. When he gave four short thrusts, she felt his balls draw up off her belly.</p><p>Cord groaned and squeezed her breasts tightly as liquid warmth seeped out the end of his cock onto her chest.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d been holding her breath until he wasn\u2019t sitting on her ribcage. AJ expelled a quiet sigh.</p><p>He used a soft cloth to wipe her down. His rough-skinned hands sweetly caressed her arms and legs. Callused fingertips traced the line of her jaw and throat, then her collarbones.</p><p>Just his hands, not his mouth. Why hadn\u2019t he kissed her yet?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bettin\u2019 that wasn\u2019t your favorite position.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a couple of other ideas for tonight. You need to be on the fireplace for the next one.\u201d He helped her up and her butt met cold stone again. \u201cHang tight.\u201d</p><p>And she was tired of not talking. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>Immediately Cord\u2019s breath burned her ear. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to ask questions. And that one just earned you another penalty, baby doll. Stay put and stay quiet.\u201d</p><p>As his footsteps faded she debated on taking off the blindfold when a thought occurred to her. Maybe withholding kisses was her penalty. If that was the case, she\u2019d sit here like a lump all night because she absolutely craved the man\u2019s kisses.</p><p>Her heart thudded when she heard him return.</p><p>\u201cArrange yourself like you were before.\u201d</p><p>AJ put her hands behind her and spread her legs open.</p><p>\u201cGood. Stay like that. No touchin\u2019 me unless I say so.\u201d</p><p>Cord\u2019s lips brushed hers so softly she whimpered. He teased her for an eternity with his mouth and breath and little bites and flicks of his tongue until she was wet and lightheaded from the sensual onslaught.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Something long, cold, sweet and decidedly phallic brushed her top and bottom lip and tongue before Cord\u2019s mouth devoured hers in a kiss so hot her body went up in flames.</p><p>Which would explain why the Popsicle melted so quickly when he placed it on her nipples.</p><p>He swallowed her scream as he circled the icy tip around and around those rigid twin peaks. Then his mouth was licking the sticky sweetness from her left breast as he traced the frozen treat down the center of her body. Past her belly button, down her pubic bone, making a couple of tiny circles over her clit\u2014surely he wasn\u2019t planning on\u2014and he pushed the icy pop inside.</p><p>\u201cOmigod!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another one, AJ.\u201d Cord switched to her right nipple and suckled while twirling the ice pop inside her clenching sex.</p><p>Her pussy was on fire. It quickly became numb as Cord fucked her with the Popsicle.</p><p>She heard drips\u2014a combination of her flowing juices and the melting ice splatting on the floor beneath her, and she moaned at the eroticism bombarding her from every angle.</p><p>Darkness. His warm tongue bathing the very tips of her nipples. The sucking noise of the Popsicle and the sweet orange scent. The hard stone digging into her butt. The ache in her arms from keeping herself upright. The sound of Cord\u2019s broken breaths and the feel of his goatee gliding across her tingling skin.</p><p>The Popsicle disappeared and was replaced with Cord\u2019s mouth. His hot tongue burrowed into her cold pussy and she screamed.</p><p>He slurped and sucked, eating at her with finesse, then gluttony. His mouth covered her mound completely as his teeth and tongue and lips demanded her total surrender.</p><p>She gave it.</p><p>AJ wailed as the orgasm thundered through her, every pulse point in her body was synchronized to the flicking of his tongue. Before she could catch her breath, Cord lifted her and reversed their positions. He sat on the hearth and stretched her over his lap.</p><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019ve been rewarded, you will take your punishment like a good girl.\u201d</p><p>Smack smack\u2014he landed a firm blow on each cheek.</p><p>She yelped at the sting of pain, which felt unbearably hot against the coldness of her butt cheeks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one. Not a sound, AJ. Each sound earns another penalty.\u201d</p><p>Whack whack.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Two more spanks, harder than the first ones. \u201cThat\u2019s another. I ain\u2019t kiddin\u2019. Hold still.\u201d</p><p>Whack whack.</p><p>AJ bit her lip and braced herself. She hung upside down, naked, across a man\u2019s lap as he peppered her ass with swats. Why wasn\u2019t she humiliated? Why wasn\u2019t she running away?</p><p>Because she knew it turned Cord on to epic levels. He was strung tight with exhilaration and heady with sexual power. He never hit her hard enough to hurt, just enough so there was no doubt who was in charge.</p><p>God. Was Cord McKay ever in charge.</p><p>Whack whack.</p><p>At some point around spank nineteen, AJ wasn\u2019t dreading that connection of his big hand to her ass; she anticipated it. She craved it. So much to the point she moaned.</p><p>Loudly. Twice.</p><p>\u201cThat earned you two more, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>Whack whack.</p><p>\u201cThis ass is beautiful, all pink and white.\u201d Whack whack. \u201cWarmed up from bein\u2019 on that cold hearth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarm. It feels hot and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whack whack whack whack. He hissed, \u201cI can keep goin\u2019 all night. I\u2019m findin\u2019 I like this way more than I ever imagined. Way more.\u201d</p><p>Whack whack. His hands smoothed over the heated mounds, down between her legs.</p><p>He wormed two fingers inside her pussy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re soppin\u2019 wet. This little spankin\u2019 stopped bein\u2019 a punishment, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Whack whack. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I thought about talking the whole time just so you\u2019d keep doing it\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Cord snarled and rolled her so she was in his arms. Holding her like a baby, he walked them to the rug. He set her on her feet, keeping her back to his chest. His heavy, harsh breathing stirred her hair. \u201cOn your hands and knees. Now.\u201d</p><p>AJ dropped to the rug, once again that slight edge of fear\u2014that feeling of the unknown heightened her excitement.</p><p>Cord said, \u201cMove your knees out wider.\u201d</p> <p>She felt the rug scraping her kneecaps as she followed his command and he knelt behind her.</p><p>Then his tongue bathed the burning marks on each cheek. She whimpered when that wicked tongue traced the crack of her ass down to her tailbone and back up.</p><p>The blunt head of his cock connected with her pussy briefly before Cord impaled it in one hard stroke.</p><p>\u201cCord\u2014\u201d</p><p>He smacked her ass twice. He didn\u2019t speak. He just gripped her hips and methodically fucked her. Each stroke equal. No variation. Slow and shallow.</p> <p>Sweat poured from her. From him. Her body shook. His body shook. She couldn\u2019t stand it because it felt so damn good, he was purposely holding them both off from orgasm as long as possible. AJ knew if he deepened or lengthened the thrusts it\u2019d send them both soaring.</p><p>Finally he said gruffly, \u201cI\u2019m too far gone to be gentle, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>Cord increased his pace to that of a runaway jackhammer, she splintered into a thousand shards. So did he.</p><p>When he removed the blindfold would she see the crown of her head lying on the rug? The man had positively blown her top.</p><p>Cord grunted. He stretched his chest to her sweaty back, caging her in his arms. He sank his teeth into her nape, sending goose bumps in a wave across her skin.</p><p>She sighed in complete contentment.</p> <p>\u201cEnough? Or do you wanna go for a couple more and see if you end up in the penalty box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the penalty box?\u201d</p><p>He whispered, \u201cThe hot tub.\u201d</p><p>Ooh.

Better than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Macie. It was sweet of you to make her lunch. Fancier than she gets from me, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Macie waved her off. \u201cAll ingredients you had on hand, no biggie. How long\u2019s it take to get to town again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty minutes. So, what\u2019s the big secret? What are you looking at in Sundance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDewey\u2019s Delish Dish in the Sandstone building.\u201d</p><p>AJ turned slightly to look at Macie. \u201cYou quitting the Last Chance Diner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no. I swear Velma would hunt me down and kill me. We\u2019re expanding.</p><p>Velma\u2019s interested in taking over Dewey\u2019s place. He\u2019s getting ready to retire, he\u2019s got no one to pass it down to, but he doesn\u2019t want to leave Sundance without a family style restaurant. I\u2019m here to check it out and see how much remodeling we\u2019d have to do before we make a commitment or whether we\u2019d be better off looking for a different location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose other storefronts are empty, which is sad because it is a cool building right in the middle of everything in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I hope we can salvage Dewey\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>AJ focused her attention on the landscape outside her window. How many more times would she make the trek from her house into town? Twenty? Thirty?</p><p>\u201cAJ? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m trying to be mature about the ranch sale, because I understand I can\u2019t run the place from Denver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>That single word made her think of Cord and the wicked penalties she\u2019d earned last night. A shiver worked down her spine despite the unrelenting heat. \u201cPart of me wants to throw a weeping tantrum about losing my home.\u201d AJ sighed. \u201cDo I sound like I\u2019m about four?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I never had a home up until the last year, so I have nothing to judge it by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a home because of Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that \u2018home is where the heart is\u2019 saying is true, but Gemma and Dad\u2019s ranch feels like my physical home now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Carter feel the same? Isn\u2019t he missing the McKay place?\u201d</p><p>Macie was quiet for a little too long.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I tell you something, you have to swear not to tell anyone, AJ.\u201d Macie shot her a glance. \u201cEspecially not Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>AJ\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cGet out. You guys haven\u2019t even been married a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t planned, but it wasn\u2019t unplanned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cryptic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Dad and Gemma had the babies, Carter and I realized we wanted to have our kids while we were young. Plus, we want them to be raised around family\u2014his and mine.</p><p>Ky\u2019s already four. Channing is pregnant, so our baby will have instant cousins and playmates. I didn\u2019t have family growing up. Carter did. He says the best part of his life is that connection. Dad and I are figuring that out.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWe are really excited about having a baby, but I promised Carter to let him tell his family the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I squeal now?\u201d</p><p>Macie nodded.</p><p>After AJ did a happy dance in her seat, she demanded, \u201cHow far along are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely. Like three weeks. Carter insisted on one of those early pregnancy tests, so we\u2019ve known since I was five days pregnant. One of the other reasons we wanted to wait to tell anyone was because Channing just announced her pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but she\u2019s almost four months along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiming is everything in the McKay family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you be adding more work to your schedule with a baby coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would oversee the one in Sundance, not run it. Remember my roommate Kat?</p><p>She\u2019d run it fulltime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not quitting the diner that means you\u2019ll be traveling. Won\u2019t Carter demand to be with you all the time now that you\u2019re preggers?\u201d AJ whirled in her seat. \u201cThat\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? Are you guys moving back here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...and no. We\u2019ll be living here half the time and half the time at the Bar 9.</p><p>Carter misses the McKay ranch and his brothers. And with all that\u2019s going on with Colt, I know Colby and Cord would appreciate his help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would you live? Someplace on the ranch?\u201d</p><p>Macie squirmed.</p><p>Then AJ knew. \u201cYou\u2019ll be living in my house, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Are you upset?\u201d</p><p>During the moments she\u2019d allowed herself to think about it, she\u2019d wondered what\u2019d happen to their home. Colby and Channing owned a gorgeous place a couple of miles from Carson and Carolyn\u2019s homeplace. Cord didn\u2019t need a house. Cam was in Iraq, Keely in Denver, Colt shared the old Andrews place with his McKay cousins. Her biggest fear had been the house she\u2019d loved and grown up in would be turned into a den of iniquity like the infamous Boars Nest.</p><p>\u201cAJ? Say something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. When was this decided?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby and Carter had been kicking around an idea of putting a trailer up the road from your place, when Carson told us about them buying the Foster ranch. Cord suggested it\u2019d be perfect for us with the extra large barn Carter can use as a permanent studio. And it\u2019s close enough to Cord\u2019s place that he could check on it when we were at the Bar 9.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, when Cord called us to tell us about Colt, he asked me to talk to you about it first, since we\u2019re friends.\u201d Macie\u2019s hazel eyes were filled with concern. \u201cWe\u2019ll still be friends, right, AJ? I can\u2019t stand the thought that this would hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurting me is inevitable, you heard my mixed feelings about moving.\u201d</p><p>AJ stared out the window and Macie let her.</p><p>\u201cNothing would make Mama happier than knowing the house was filled with a happy family. Why didn\u2019t Cord tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Her cynical side thought Cord worried the news would lessen his chances of getting laid. But Cord probably believed hearing the news from Macie would be easier. She might\u2019ve been resentful to the whole McKay family if it\u2019d come from any of them\u2014even Keely. Cord\u2019s intuitive side surprised her. Lots of things about him surprised her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me the truth, Macie McKay, were you mentally redecorating my house while we were eating lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Macie reached over and whapped her on the knee. \u201cBeing around my sis-in-law has made you a real smartypants, Amy Jo Foster.\u201d</p><p>AJ laughed and it didn\u2019t feel as forced as she\u2019d imagined.</p><p>The lunch rush at Dewey\u2019s was over. AJ trailed behind Macie as Dewey gave her the nickel tour. As many times as she\u2019d been in, she hadn\u2019t noticed the details that made the interior unique until Dewey pointed them out to Macie.</p><p>When they started discussing ventilation systems in the kitchen, AJ excused herself and loitered outside the empty storefront next to the diner.</p><p>A woman riding a motorcycle parked next to Macie\u2019s Escape. A tattooed and pierced woman with short, jet black hair, the ends of which were dyed bright pink. She bounded up the steps, the jangling of the keys in her hand rivaled the jangling of the rings in her nose, ears, lip and eyebrow. She stopped when she caught sight of AJ lurking by the door and looked up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Double whoa. The woman was absolutely stunning. Her face was sharp angles\u2014</p><p>razor blade cheekbones, a square jawline. Her features were softened by pouty lips the envy of Angelina Jolie.</p><p>The woman didn\u2019t smile. \u201cCan I get you to move please? That door opens out, which is the first thing I\u2019m going to change.\u201d</p> <p>AJ\u2019s ears perked up and she shuffled aside. \u201cChange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister and I are opening up a shop here once we can get the changes approved from the landlord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandlord? Doesn\u2019t Dewey own this building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be easier if he did. He sold it last year. Any changes have to get approval from this mysterious owner.\u201d The woman\u2019s vivid blue gaze narrowed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Dewey neglected to tell my friend that. She\u2019s talking to him about taking over his restaurant.\u201d</p> <p>Blue eyes finally smiled. \u201cDewey is a miscreant. Let\u2019s crash their meeting and see how old Dewey reacts.\u201d</p><p>AJ led the way. Dewey blinked rapidly when he saw the woman behind her.</p><p>\u201cNow, Dewey, please tell me you aren\u2019t misleading this lady? She does know you don\u2019t actually own this building anymore?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Macie said, \u201cDewey, Velma is gonna be majorly pissed if that\u2019s true. And you know what she\u2019s like when she gets a burr under her saddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-b-but it\u2019s not what you think. The owner gave me full authority to turn over the restaurant to you, Mrs. McKay. You still have to submit your remodeling plans, but he already gave the go-ahead to proceed, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho the hell owns this building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that I can\u2019t say, but the truth is I doan know. All our communication is done through email. I send my rent checks to a P.O. Box in Denver.\u201d Dewey swallowed nervously. \u201cNever talked to a live person, it\u2019s some sort of architectural firm specializin\u2019 in historic Western preservation.\u201d</p><p>The blue-eyed woman demanded, \u201cI still haven\u2019t received approval on my proposed changes and I signed the goddamn lease a month ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because you\u2019re puttin\u2019 in a tattoo parlor, Ms. Ellison? Not the same as upgradin\u2019 a restaurant.\u201d</p><p>AJ whirled around. \u201cA tattoo parlor? In Sundance? That is so cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Macie chimed in, \u201cI\u2019d like to hear what you\u2019ve planned for the space, since it appears we\u2019ll be neighbors.\u201d Macie thrust out her hand. \u201cMacie McKay. This is AJ</p><p>Foster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia Ellison. Come on over and take a walk on the wild side.\u201d India winked. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to be the new resident bad girl who leads this sleepy Wyoming town into the temptations of body art.\u201d</p> <p>Macie filled India in her tentative plans for the restaurant while AJ explored the space, which\u2019d been a hair salon in a former life. A couple other eclectic businesses had tried to make a go of it, but none succeeded.</p><p>\u201cOnly half is for tattoos and piercing. We\u2019ll use the front half as a salesroom for the products my sister manufactures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatural skin and hair care products made in Weston County. Ever heard of Sky Blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d AJ said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t find it here. You have to drive to DeWitt\u2019s Pharmacy in Moorcroft to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why Sky wants to expand to Sundance. We both fell in love with this building, plus the third floor spans the entire length. I\u2019m waiting for approval on changes to make it an apartment for when I move here permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you live now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenver.\u201d India sighed. \u201cSo, help me out, guys. I\u2019m looking for a reputable construction company to do all the remodel work if I ever get approval. You\u2019re local.</p><p>You won\u2019t bullshit me.\u201d</p><p>Macie said, \u201cWest Construction. My husband\u2019s cousins Remy and Chet own it. Not to be biased, but they do outstanding work. We\u2019d planned on using them for the diner remodel and ah...a house remodel.\u201d</p><p>AJ ignored the house remodel portion of the comment and added, \u201cThey built a couple of beautiful homes for the McKays. I\u2019m not related to them, so I can honestly say they\u2019re the best around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Do you have their number?\u201d</p><p>While Macie and India chatted, AJ wandered over to another door. \u201cHey, India, mind if I look in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill this be part of India\u2019s Ink and Sky Blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s a connecting hallway to the other store and the access to the upstairs.\u201d</p><p>AJ brushed aside cobwebs and stopped in front of another door. She pushed it open and ventured inside. Dusty, dirty and the windows were covered with soapy grime that filtered out most light. The space was identical in size to India\u2019s place, a long narrow single room with high ceilings, accented with crown molding at the top and parquet floor beneath her feet. With a little elbow grease and a couple of well-placed walls, this would make a perfect massage studio. And it was close to home.</p><p>Her excitement lasted about ten seconds. She realized when she finished school she wouldn\u2019t have a home around here. Not an insurmountable problem if Keely had planned to come back. They could rent a trailer, split the rent and the workload.</p><p>But AJ was realistic. Massages would be a hard sell in Crook County. It\u2019d take a few months to build up a clientele and a couple years to make enough money to earn a living.</p><p>Whereas in a bigger city she\u2019d start making money immediately. After one last regretful look, she returned to Macie and India.</p><p>\u201cThis is karma or something,\u201d Macie said. \u201cDid you know my middle name is Blue?</p><p>And my mother considered naming me India?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>Macie nodded. \u201cIndia the Indian. My mom was slightly nuts.\u201d</p><p>India whirled on AJ. \u201cIf you tell me you have a monarch butterfly tattooed above your butt crack, I\u2019ll freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Sorry. No tattoos.\u201d</p><p>India smiled slyly. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about changing that tattoo virgin status sometime soon.\u201d</p><p>Macie\u2019s grin rivaled India\u2019s. \u201cLosing one\u2019s virginity is always a good thing. Nice meeting you, India. Keep in touch. If all goes according to plan, we\u2019ll start the remodel in about four weeks.\u201d</p><p>On the way back, AJ managed to keep Macie talking about Carter\u2019s upcoming art show, the horses Cash expressed an interest in, and not the situation between her and Cord McKay.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if we stop at Carolyn and Carson\u2019s house first before I take you home? I\u2019m feeling a little woozy all of a sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d It drove home the point how intertwined her life was with the McKays\u2019 when she noticed Cord\u2019s truck parked out front at his folks\u2019 house.</p><p>Her stomach pitched. Be hard to act normal around him after last night.</p><p>Carolyn McKay was in her usual spot in the kitchen. She beamed at Macie. \u201cHey, sweetie, how\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. But I actually feel nauseous from the excitement. Do you mind if I lay down before supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, go ahead. Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>Macie shook her head and made a mad dash for the bathroom.</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s worry lines faded when she saw AJ. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Any problems with the lawyer today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Once the money is squared away and Florence pens her signature to the deed, you and your mother are officially squatters on McKay land.\u201d</p><p>AJ\u2019s face fell.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey. I was kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice goin\u2019, Ma,\u201d Cord said dryly. \u201cGot salt in your hand, wanna throw that in her eye too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get going.\u201d AJ purposely avoided the word \u201chome\u201d. She frowned. \u201cShoot.</p><p>I don\u2019t have a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you. I\u2019m headed that way.\u201d Cord pecked his mother\u2019s forehead. \u201cBehave.</p><p>No pesterin\u2019 Macie about you-know-what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I have a choice. Carter made me promise.\u201d Carolyn winked at her. \u201cHave fun at your girls\u2019 night. Call if you need a designated driver, but I believe you\u2019ll be the only one drinkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She and Cord didn\u2019t speak at all until they were in the truck and a mile down the road. \u201cMacie told me she and Carter will be living in my old house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay with that?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cI guess. Thanks for suggesting Macie tell me.\u201d She looked out the window. \u201cSo are the McKays officially land barons? Buying up everything in Crook and Weston County?\u201d</p><p>Cord didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s just hard.\u201d</p><p>He slowed down at the next pullout and parked. \u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>AJ buried her face against his chest. He didn\u2019t say a word; he just held her.</p><p>After a while, he said, \u201cI wanna be with you like this, dust devils swirlin\u2019 around us in the late afternoon heat. Just us, sneakin\u2019 some alone time. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Cord slipped out and climbed back in the passenger\u2019s side, pulling her on his lap.</p><p>\u201cLet me love you up. You look a little lost.\u201d</p><p>I am. Oh, she\u2019d like it if he loved her, but she accepted the only type of love Cord could offer her was physical.</p><p>He kissed her softly, sweetly, running his rough hands up her spine beneath her damp shirt. The languorous kiss seemed endless. Cord seemed equally content just to touch her. He eased away from her mouth and whispered, \u201cLord, I\u2019m gettin\u2019 addicted to your kisses, AJ. I feel plain, damn drugged when you\u2019re kissin\u2019 me. I feel plain, damn lost myself when you ain\u2019t around.\u201d Then he dove in for another thorough taste of her mouth.</p><p>When his erection twitched, she fumbled for his belt. \u201cPants off, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d He lowered the bench seat back. \u201cScoot to the middle for a sec.\u201d He shimmied his jeans down his legs. \u201cNow you. Take them britches completely off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>AJ kicked her sandals to the floorboard.</p><p>\u201cAnd the shirt and bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf my shirt comes off, then so does yours.\u201d</p> <p>He grabbed the hem and yanked. \u201cNow come here, cowgirl up and show me how good you can ride.\u201d</p><p>Bracing her hands on the sculpted muscle and hardness of his chest, she straddled his pelvis and began to lower down.</p><p>His hand curled around her hips. \u201cSlow. I wanna see your body takin\u2019 me in. Oh yeah, that\u2019s so goddamn sexy. Bring those pretty tasty nipples to my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Immediately Cord expelled a groan and began to lick and suck, not in his usual, forceful way, but with as much languor as he\u2019d kissed her mouth.</p><p>Witnessing the sheer joy on his face as he suckled, feeling him gliding deep\u2014</p> <p>touched something inside her. Every rapid inhalation of the air in the cab filled her lungs with the scent of him. Of them. Of dust, hot sage, wool seat covers, sunshine and home.</p><p>A bead of moisture zigzagged down her chest and Cord lapped at it, following the wet line back to the source behind her ear.</p><p>He whispered, \u201cNeed it faster, baby doll. Let\u2019s move from a canter to a trot.\u201d</p><p>She rocked her hips more briskly, gripping the headrest above Cord\u2019s head. Each downstroke ground her clit against his pelvic bone and she moaned in complete abandon.</p><p>\u201cSuch sexy noises. Arch back. I wanna watch your face as I make you come.\u201d</p><p>Cord cupped her breasts and squeezed, latching on to the right tip as his thumb scraped across the left.</p> <p>The swirling sensation in her groin gathered momentum and the next wave catapulted AJ over the edge. She closed her eyes, losing her sanity as the pulses in her nipples synchronized to the deep pulses inside her.</p><p>He rolled his pelvis, his hands clamped her ass and he thrust hard three times. Cord hid his face in her hair, his groan a husky rasp of pleasure.</p><p>They stayed plastered together until their breathing evened out. \u201cYou fit me so damn good. Maybe we could just nap like this for awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time we napped together, I woke up at five a.m. I don\u2019t particularly want old Sheriff Comas finding us naked. Old guy might have a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. And I do have chores to finish.\u201d His mouth grazed the inside of her arm. \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you tonight.\u201d</p><p>She peeled her body from his. \u201cIs that what this was about? Needed a little nookie to get through the lonely night, Cord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That nookie wasn\u2019t because I needed TLC, AJ, it was because you needed it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes swam with tears.</p> <p>\u201cHey now. None of that.\u201d Cord soothed her, raining soft kisses on her face and gentle caresses on her body.</p><p>Finally he lifted her off his softened cock. He yanked his jeans back up, zipped and buckled.</p><p>While he left the cab to climb back into the driver\u2019s seat, AJ grabbed her capris, bra and shirt and dressed.</p><p>How had Cord known her mood? Known exactly that she\u2019d needed tenderness and understanding?</p><p>\u201cBaby doll, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Have you heard from Colt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad has him workin\u2019 someplace else. Don\u2019t know where. I do know what Ma and Aunt Kimi found at the Boars Nest made \u2019em madder than wet hens: excessive empty condom wrappers and liquor bottles. They said it would\u2019ve been easier to set fire to the house than to clean it.\u201d</p><p>Cord turned into the driveway leading to her home. \u201cFirst Ma sent Dag back to Uncle Harland\u2019s. Then she left an angry message on Colt\u2019s cell. Colt blew a gasket, railin\u2019 about invasion of privacy and so forth. It was another ugly scene and now Dad\u2019s pissed \u2019cause Colt made Ma cry. Probably a good thing Carter didn\u2019t come with Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, because you think Carter\u2019s a Mama\u2019s boy and her crying would piss him off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Carter would try to reason with Colt first. Then he\u2019d use his fists. When Colby catches wind that Colt beat on another brother, hurt Ma and pissed Dad off, well, I ain\u2019t sure Colby wouldn\u2019t kill Colt outright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s a bad situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feelin\u2019 it\u2019ll get worse before it gets better.\u201d</p><p>AJ did too. She opened the cab door. \u201cThanks for the ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No goodbye kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in public, remember?\u201d</p><p>Cord scowled. \u201cYeah. Be careful tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what? The thing I\u2019m most in danger from is being barfed on either by the babies or the mothers-to-be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you?\u201d</p><p>She blinked innocently. \u201cWho told me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie. She told you she\u2019s pregnant?\u201d</p><p>AJ gaped at him. \u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter can\u2019t keep his mouth shut to save his life. Macie should\u2019ve made him the last person to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to do when he\u2019s the father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine that boy is struttin\u2019 around like a damn peacock.\u201d He smiled wistfully. \u201cI remember I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m excited for them. I can\u2019t wait until I get the all clear to tell Mama. She\u2019ll be happy to hear this house will be filled with kids again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, AJ about that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good night.\u201d</p><p>AJ bounded up the steps without looking back.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you had a baby before I did,\u201d Channing said.</p><p>\u201cTwo babies.\u201d Gemma pointed at Channing\u2019s belly. \u201cAnd unless you\u2019re growing a pair, you\u2019ll have to go through the whole pregnancy thing again to catch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c I can\u2019t wait. Look at this sweet little face. What wondrous things babies are.\u201d</p><p>Channing cuddled Ryder close and smiled at him. \u201cHe is beautiful. Perfect everything. So much hair. Such a mellow disposition. Definitely takes after Cash, not you, Gem.\u201d</p><p>Just then Ella wailed.</p><p>Macie grinned and handed Ella to Gemma. \u201cThat\u2019s Mama\u2019s rowdy girl. Feeding time for my loud sis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChan, bring Ryder after I get Ella settled, willya? He\u2019ll smell food the second my milk lets down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to? He looks so comfy. I think he\u2019s fine,\u201d she cooed, kissing his forehead,</p><p>\u201caren\u2019t you darlin\u2019 boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>AJ watched the scene unfold with complete fascination. Her sister had opted not to breastfeed, so this whole \u201cletting it all hang out\u201d philosophy with bare breasts, well\u2014</p><p>bared and literally hanging out\u2014had thrown her for a loop.</p><p>Gemma clutched Ella like a football on her left side, propping Ella on a pillow and lifting her shirt. Ella\u2019s dark head swiveled the direction of the scent of milk. Gemma brought Ella closer so that rosebud mouth could latch onto the nipple. Gemma stroked Ella\u2019s hair and murmured, \u201cYou\u2019d think you hadn\u2019t eaten in hours, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>Ryder began to fuss. Channing sighed. \u201cI tried to give you a break. But this little guy knows what he wants.\u201d Channing nestled Ryder on Gemma\u2019s right side and he started sucking with happy baby grunts.</p><p>\u201cI need a drink,\u201d AJ muttered.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, I\u2019ll get you a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit, Channing. I\u2019ll grab one.\u201d</p><p>AJ sipped and studied the front of Colby and Channing\u2019s refrigerator, covered in family pictures and Ky\u2019s artwork. Ky had drawn a picture of the entire McKay clan on a long sheet of white paper. Grandma and Grandpa were prominent on the right side. Colby and Channing were at the top with their arms around each other. Colt was lying down in the lower right corner. A tiny image of Cameron holding a rifle was crayoned below Colt, meant to show that Uncle Cam was far away in Iraq. Keely cracking a bullwhip, wearing a sparkly belt and a big grin. The smaller mirror images of Kane and Kade were below her. Carter and Macie holding hands at the bottom of the page on the left. And dead center was Cord McKay, his visage bigger than all the others.</p><p>On Cord\u2019s right side, a smaller identical likeness of him, aka Ky, beaming up at his dad. She squinted. Yep. A crude red cape fluttered behind the dynamic duo. The boy had a serious case of hero worship.</p><p>She knew the feeling.</p><p>AJ drank half the beer before returning to the living room.</p><p>Ten minutes of baby chatter continued.</p><p>Macie said, \u201cMuch as I love talking about my new brother and sister, and the impending new McKay boy baby, let\u2019s talk about something else. I\u2019m pretty sure AJ is bored to tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about sex.\u201d Channing addressed the comment to Gemma. \u201cWhen will we get back to our normal sex life? Because it\u2019s been so hit and miss for us for the last two months.\u201d</p><p>AJ shot a quick glance at Macie, who suddenly had a panicked look on her face.</p><p>\u201cIn another couple of weeks, things should be back to normal. At least until the last month. I didn\u2019t want Cash to touch me at all. I was big as a house, I wasn\u2019t sleeping and I had to pee every five minutes. I felt about as sexy as an old cow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the six week ban on sex after the birth? How on earth did you make it through that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to the doctor two weeks ago and she gave us the go ahead. I adore my husband. I especially adore sex with my husband. I can\u2019t wait to make it up to him when we have more than five minutes before one of the babies needs something. But right now if I had the choice between sex and sleep? Sleep wins.\u201d</p><p>Channing gasped, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Macie looked positively ill.</p><p>AJ changed the subject. \u201cGuess who I saw dirty dancing together at the Golden Boot two weeks ago? Your husbands\u2019 cousin Chassie West and Trevor Glanzer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Channing and Gemma exchanged a look, which was lost on Macie and AJ.</p><p>\u201cYep. Rumor is they\u2019ve been seeing a lot of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cA few months. I\u2019ve heard from a couple of sources that they\u2019re serious.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWow. Surprised that hasn\u2019t made it into the McKay gossip channel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the situation with Colt did?\u201d</p><p>All eyes zoomed to AJ.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there. What really happened?\u201d</p><p>AJ retold the story with as much detail as she\u2019d remembered.</p><p>Channing took Ella to burp her. \u201cDo you know what Colt said to Cord that\u2019d make Cord act like that? Because Cord never acts impulsive.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d acted pretty damn impulsive earlier when he\u2019d had her naked in his truck. \u201cNo one knows.\u201d</p> <p>Macie, Gemma and Channing gossiped about other members of the McKay family.</p><p>AJ already knew most of it, since she\u2019d lived in the county her whole life. Since she\u2019d known the McKays her whole life.</p><p>So why did she still feel like the outsider?</p><p>The conversation swam back into focus.</p><p>\u201cDag and Chassie are brother and sister?\u201d Macie asked Gemma, \u201cDidn\u2019t Dad team rope with Dag on the circuit a couple of times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Dag roped with Trevor after Edgard went back to Brazil.\u201d</p> <p>Channing said, \u201cI overheard Carolyn and her sister discussing Dag. Since he quit the circuit he\u2019s been drinking. A lot. Even more than Colt.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Harland West hired Trevor, to keep an eye on Dag. So it makes sense that\u2019s how Trev and Chassie hooked up. I can\u2019t believe Colby didn\u2019t tell me that part.\u201d</p><p>Channing kissed the top of Ella\u2019s head. \u201cShe\u2019s asleep. Want me to put her down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Ryder\u2019s out too. I\u2019ll come with and tuck him in.\u201d</p><p>They left the room and AJ looked at Macie. \u201cI think I\u2019ll head home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because I feel awkward and out of place. \u201cI\u2019m tired. I have a bunch of packing to do tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Macie stood. \u201cWould you give me a ride back to Carter\u2019s folks\u2019 house? My car is packed with baby stuff and I might as well leave it here rather than unpack it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d AJ and Macie said a quick good-bye.</p><p>Once they were in AJ\u2019s Jeep, Macie sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sure they were glad to see me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Gemma and I get along great. She\u2019s more than just a stepmother; she\u2019s a good friend. But she still is sort of like my mother. Whereas she and Channing are great pals and they talk about everything. Gemma won\u2019t discuss her relationship with my father when I\u2019m in the room, which is completely understandable.</p><p>And Channing and I are still feeling our way around our relationship to each other and our places in the McKay family. Sometimes I wonder what it\u2019d be like to already know all the ins and outs of this family.\u201d Macie grinned at AJ. \u201cSomeone like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t make me a part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Cord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Great sex, not that I have anything else to judge it by, but the man definitely knows what he\u2019s doing between the sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in the barn, and in the pasture, and on a horse if he\u2019s anything like Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t tried it on a horse.\u201d AJ grinned and turned onto the paved highway. \u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know how you feel about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll bask in his sexual attention and expertise for as long as I can. But we both know it has a finite end\u2014when Ky comes home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worry about you, AJ, because I think you\u2019ll take whatever little Cord McKay offers you just to be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might\u2019ve been true if I hadn\u2019t moved away last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though this is my first sexual relationship, it\u2019s opened my eyes about a lot of other things. I believed the sex was good because I love him. But Cord doesn\u2019t love me and the sex is still good for him. Which shows me that I might have a skewed idea of what love is, now that I know sex and love aren\u2019t intertwined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit cynical, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Or maybe I stopped being na\u00efve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if he asked you to marry him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t. His family comes first. His ranch second.\u201d She wasn\u2019t his family and he now owned her ranch.</p><p>A quiet pause hung in the tepid evening air.</p><p>Macie stared out the window across the moonlit fields. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful here. I can see why Carter wants to divide our time and have the best of both worlds.\u201d</p><p>At the McKay homestead, AJ said, \u201cDrive safe tomorrow. Let me know when I can tell my mom your good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. I\u2019ll call you soon.\u201d</p><p>AJ watched Macie disappear into the house. Cord\u2019s truck was parked next to Colby\u2019s. When she remembered what\u2019d happened in that truck a few short hours ago...her toes curled in her flip-flops. She left before she found a reason to track Cord down for a repeat performance.</p><p>Jenn was still awake and sipping a glass of Jim Beam. Straight up.</p><p>\u201cIs Mama asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. The kids wore her out. Everything wears her out these days.\u201d Jenn shoved the bottle across the table. \u201cJoin me in a drink. I could use the company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d AJ grabbed a juice glass, ice, and a Coke to mix with the whiskey. \u201cWhat\u2019s got you drinking alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlan and I met this morning. I wanted to talk about visitation rights, summer vacation and school breaks over the holidays, you know, normal stuff that most fathers should care about.\u201d She sipped her drink and didn\u2019t look up. \u201cNot him. As I sat across from him, the man I\u2019d been married to for the last twelve years, I realized I didn\u2019t know him at all.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about me or the kids. It\u2019s embarrassing to admit I\u2019ve been living a lie, trying to make something work that should\u2019ve ended years ago. So as I sat there, sensing his impatience and his desire to \u2018be done with the whole goddamn thing\u2019 I knew how wrong I was to push for marriage with him in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t love me, Amy Jo. He liked me. The sex was really good. I believed I could work with that. I could make him love me. Or I could love him enough for both of us.\u201d Bitter tears spilled down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cJenn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can deal with him discarding me. But how am I supposed to tell our children, his children, that their father is discarding them too? That they might not ever see him again and that is his choice? How do I look them in the eyes and break their hearts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t. It\u2019s not your fault Alan is a selfish dickhead who\u2019s leaving you no option but to pick up the pieces. The only thing you can do is what you\u2019ve been doing.</p><p>Show Krista and Mason and Ariel you love them. We love them. We are a family no matter what. No matter where we live.\u201d</p><p>Jenn made a sound between a gasp and a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou are a great mother...and a great father too.\u201d AJ went to her broken sister. Jenn wrapped her arms around AJ\u2019s waist and sobbed in silent misery. AJ cried right along with her and felt like she\u2019d aged ten years in the last ten hours.</p><p>After Jenn quieted down, AJ handed her a tissue.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get so grown up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been grown up. I didn\u2019t exactly have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did more things around the ranch after Daddy\u2019s heart attack than you ever let on, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had to be done. I didn\u2019t know any different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I would\u2019ve known. Makes me feel just as selfish as Alan.\u201d Jenn blew her nose. She gathered up the glasses and put the whiskey bottle back in the liquor cabinet.</p><p>\u201cAnything else you need tonight before I go to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but since you\u2019re dispensing advice, I\u2019m gonna return the favor.\u201d</p><p>AJ looked up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re seeing someone. I won\u2019t ask who. I\u2019d like to think if it was a serious relationship you would\u2019ve brought him around to meet your family. You have a lot of years ahead of you in the dating scene. Remember this, when you find that special someone, whatever you do, don\u2019t settle for less than a man who loves you completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d</p><p>Rather than heading upstairs, AJ snuck outside. She stood on the front porch staring at the stars, contemplating family dynamics and her place in the universe for a long time before she finally crawled into bed.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t come over tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenn stayed with Mom yesterday afternoon when I was helping Macie. She has things to do tonight when she gets off work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, AJ, that\u2019s two nights in a row. You\u2019re supposed to be here every night. That was the deal.\u201d</p><p>The phone went silent.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Cord, I think it might be time to renegotiate the deal. If you\u2019re gonna get pissy about me taking care of my mother because you aren\u2019t getting a piece of ass, then maybe I\u2019m done dealing with you. Maybe you can continue to be a jackass on your own time.\u201d She hung up.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit!\u201d Cord was half-tempted to whip the cell phone at the wall. He snapped it shut and threw it on the coffee table. Great. He oughta go over there and set her straight. Right. How was he supposed to come to terms with the idea that he...missed her?</p><p>What the hell was he supposed to do with himself tonight?</p><p>Cord stared at the fan spinning lazily on the cathedral ceiling. Maybe he should take up a hobby. Bowling. League darts. Whittling.</p><p>He headed for the barn. The farrier was coming in the morning to shoe all the horses.</p><p>He might as well clean up the tack room.</p><p>Ky had made a mess of the place. Put him in a time warp to think he hadn\u2019t been in here since Ky had left. Even more humbling was the knowledge he hadn\u2019t ridden his horses for a couple of weeks. He\u2019d have to rectify that tomorrow after they wore new horseshoes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cord dragged in the garbage can and cleaned up. Finished with that chore, he rearranged the ropes according to type and length. He restacked the saddle blankets.</p><p>Gathered the horse\u2019s grooming supplies for a thorough washing. Set all the saddles on the ground and checked for wear and tear he might\u2019ve otherwise missed.</p><p>Took him ten minutes to find a clean rag. He kicked over a plastic pail and sat on it while he cleaned Ky\u2019s saddle. The kid needed to climb on a ladder to get on his pony, Plug. But he\u2019d been determined to get on \u201cthe cowboy way\u201d so he\u2019d swung his short leg over like an experienced buckaroo the second time he attempted to mount. Cord had been absurdly proud.</p> <p>After he\u2019d finished wiping the grime off and coated the leather with leather conditioner, he picked up the next saddle. He\u2019d bought this saddle for Marla right after they\u2019d gotten married and she assured him she\u2019d love being a rancher\u2019s wife.</p><p>What\u2019d he been thinking, marrying her in the first place? So she\u2019d been pretty. So she\u2019d fawned over him like he was John Wayne reincarnated. She\u2019d lacked a sense of humor, although that wasn\u2019t fair because most folks would say the same about him. She hadn\u2019t been adventurous in bed, nor had she understood his occasional appetite for domination and a bit of kink. Somehow she\u2019d equated those scenarios as a threat to her female independence.</p><p>Marla hadn\u2019t been driven to success; she more or less floated along, flitting from one thing to the next. From the get-go she exhibited an aversion to working outdoors, and to working hard, so he didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d ever believed she\u2019d\u2019ve been happy living in Wyoming.</p><p>Why had he fallen for her? Hell, why had he imagined himself madly in love with her? Why had it crushed him that she\u2019d left? Because he hadn\u2019t the balls to admit he\u2019d made a mistake and she\u2019d made the first move to rectify it? Had his pride concocted a lie after the fact about his deep, abiding love for her just to keep him infallible in the eyes of his son? The responsible Cord McKay had loved once and would never make the same mistake twice?</p><p>That bit of truth sliced him to the bone.</p> <p>Cord racked his brain to counter that thought. Seemed to be a blank spot where Marla existed in his memory. A bitter, dark hole. If he couldn\u2019t remember the good or the bad times, just a whole lot of nothing, why was he so bitter? Why had he sworn off all women? He\u2019d always chalked up his reasoning to the old adage that one bad apple spoiled the whole barrel, but now he had to admit his line of thinking was seriously fucked up.</p><p>The outer door to the barn crashed open. \u201cCord? You in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the tack room. Come on back.\u201d</p><p>Kade paused in the doorway holding a six-pack. \u201cWanna beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Colt took one, twisted off the top and the metal cap pinged against the garbage can. He sucked down a mouthful. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Kade flipped over another bucket and sat. \u201cWhatcha doin\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCleanin\u2019 up. Haven\u2019t been in here since Ky\u2019s been gone. The boy left his mark.\u201d</p><p>They drank beer and talked about Ky\u2019s adventures in the big city. Kade adored Ky and his son considered Kade another one of his uncles. The three of them hung out at least once a week, watching \u201cguy\u201d movies, taking in a rodeo, riding horses or target shooting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that saddle before. Whose is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Marla\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Kade picked it up and scrutinized it. \u201cNo bullet holes in it so I know you ain\u2019t been usin\u2019 it for target practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHar har. Forgot I even had the damn thing. Big waste of money. I think I coaxed her onto a horse maybe four times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna be a nosy dick, but you still got it bad for her?\u201d</p><p>Cord\u2019s gaze zoomed to Kade\u2019s. \u201cNo. Why\u2019d you ask that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDunno. You ain\u2019t been lookin\u2019 for another woman since the divorce, at least not in this county.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m concentratin\u2019 my efforts on the next county over.\u201d</p><p>Kade\u2019s whole posture went rigid.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t lookin\u2019 to get hitched again any time soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s odd, what with your brothers finally takin\u2019 the plunge. Least now any woman you brung home as a bride would have other female family around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried about me becomin\u2019 a grouchy ol\u2019 bachelor, cuz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried about a lot of my kinfolk, but you\u2019d be damn near the bottom of the list.\u201d</p><p>Cord swigged his beer. \u201cWho\u2019s on the top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt. Followed by Dag. Then Cam since he\u2019s gettin\u2019 shot at in Iraq. Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Kane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been influenced by Colt. Neither of our mamas would be happy to learn how they\u2019ve been treatin\u2019 women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat why you moved out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartially. Mostly because I found myself skatin\u2019 toward that callous attitude. It ain\u2019t right. I don\u2019t wanna go through life with that sense of entitlement. Any woman oughta open her legs for me just \u2019cause I smiled at her or my last name is McKay. Leads to a bad outlook on all women.\u201d</p><p>Cord wondered if that last comment was a shot at him. \u201cWhen you find a woman you wanna date, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll appreciate you not bein\u2019 a bitter dickhead only lookin\u2019 for a piece of tail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am datin\u2019 someone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Cord didn\u2019t hide his surprise. \u201cHow come I haven\u2019t heard about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeepin\u2019 a low profile. Don\u2019t wanna mess it up and introduce her to our crazy family before I have to. And I definitely didn\u2019t want her knowin\u2019 what was goin\u2019 on at the Boars Nest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know her?\u201d</p><p>Kade shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s from out of state. She and her sister inherited a small family place and she relocated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna tell me her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But I will tell you I ain\u2019t never met anyone like her. Makes me sound totally fuckin\u2019 moon-eyed, but she\u2019s funny and smart, sexy as shit, and she don\u2019t take no shit, neither. There\u2019s somethin\u2019 there worth stickin\u2019 around for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re bangin\u2019 her anyway despite your respectin\u2019 women spiel?\u201d</p><p>A hangdog look crossed Kade\u2019s face. \u201cNo. Ironic, huh? The guy who weeks ago couldn\u2019t talk about nothin\u2019 but gettin\u2019 laid is...not gettin\u2019 any at all. And I\u2019m good with that. What about you?\u201d</p><p>Cord thought of hedging, but as long as Kade hadn\u2019t named names, he wouldn\u2019t either. \u201cActually, I am seein\u2019 someone.\u201d</p><p>Kade\u2019s eyes widened like Cord smacked him upside the head with a 2x4. \u201cGet the fuck out. Seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it ain\u2019t serious. It\u2019s casual,\u201d he lied, mostly to himself. \u201cProbably last until Ky gets back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re bangin\u2019 her?\u201d</p><p>Cord grinned. \u201cEvery chance I can get.\u201d</p><p>Kade chinked his bottle to Cord\u2019s. \u201c\u2019Bout time.\u201d</p><p>Another beer loosened Cord\u2019s tongue. \u201cI wanna run somethin\u2019 by you that Dad and I\u2019d been talkin\u2019 about before all this shit happened with Colt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seen Colt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Dad\u2019s keepin\u2019 him away from me. You seen him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Kane and I are doin\u2019 the shit hayin\u2019 along the ditches in the public thoroughfare on either side of the county line so I ain\u2019t seen much of my brother either.</p><p>What\u2019ve you and Uncle C been talkin\u2019 about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeepin\u2019 the part of the herd that\u2019s up on the western edge on summer grazin\u2019 over the winter and through calvin\u2019 season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of feed and water. We need to rest the grazin\u2019 where we\u2019d keep \u2019em here anyway. I\u2019m sick of drivin\u2019 cattle a hunnerd miles, and back and forth twice a year.</p><p>If we don\u2019t lose too many head, we might expand up there with a fulltime operation. If we do have losses, chalk it up to a failed experiment and we know for sure it can only be used as summer grazin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s damn isolated country out there, Cord. No town for sixty miles.\u201d Kade\u2019s eyes registered recognition. \u201cYou\u2019re thinkin\u2019 of sendin\u2019 Colt out into the boondocks? As a way to get him to dry out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re considerin\u2019 it. Don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll go for it. We can\u2019t force him. Even out in the middle of nowhere he could invite some of his boozin\u2019 friends. Then our experiment wouldn\u2019t matter\u2014either for him or the cattle, \u2019cause I\u2019ve no doubt the cows wouldn\u2019t do well under his half-assed drunken care.\u201d Cord sighed. \u201cLike I said, nothin\u2019s decided, somethin\u2019 we\u2019re kickin\u2019 around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep me in the loop.\u201d Kade eased to his feet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say nothin\u2019 to nobody.\u201d</p><p>Kade snorted. \u201cI\u2019m a little short on roommates these days. Do most my talkin\u2019 to the tractor or the cattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear ya there.\u201d Cord followed Kade out to his pickup.</p><p>\u201cThis sucks sometimes, don\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBein\u2019 the oldest next generation McKay son. You. Me. Quinn. Knowin\u2019 that keepin\u2019 the McKay ranch goin\u2019 is on our shoulders. Feelin\u2019 responsible for every damn thing that happens on our place. Bein\u2019 stewards to the land and the cattle and feedin\u2019 the mouths of our family. Makin\u2019 sure everyone and everything is properly tended. Can be a heavy weight, cuz. Can be damn lonely.\u201d</p><p>Cord didn\u2019t respond. Kade wasn\u2019t much for philosophizing, but when he did, he was always dead on. Cord was smart enough to keep his mouth shut and listen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLeast you got an heir. I thought I\u2019d be married by now. Have a couple of kids. It ain\u2019t really bothered me until recently. I figured there was time. Now that I\u2019ve been livin\u2019 with my folks, might sound sappy as shit, but I want what they have. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m gonna wake up in ten years and be a grumpy forty-year-old man and be in the same damn place I am now.\u201d</p><p>Was Cord an example to his cousin of the kind of man Kade did not want to become? Why\u2019d that sting so bad? He wasn\u2019t so set in his ways he couldn\u2019t change, could he?</p><p>\u201cMaybe things are gonna change.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhenever you say that, it\u2019s usually for the worse,\u201d Kade said wryly.</p><p>\u201cLemme know when you\u2019re ready to introduce your lady friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell. She\u2019ll dump me and go for you\u2014the broodin\u2019 cowboy with the wounded soul and the cute-as-a-button motherless son. Plus, you\u2019ve got a bigger\u201d\u2014he grinned\u2014</p><p>\u201csection of the ranch than me. She\u2019ll drop me like a cow pie.\u201d Kade added slyly, \u201cThat is, if you ain\u2019t already spoken for by your lady friend by the time I get up the gumption to bring her around.\u201d</p><p>Right. His lady friend would be living in Colorado in a few short weeks.</p> <p>Kade drove off and Cord trudged up the steps and into his house.</p><p>He wandered from room to room. Watched TV. Felt loneliness beating on him from all sides before he finally went to bed.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>Later the next following morning, AJ\u2019s mother said, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna wear yourself out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But I\u2019m used to working hard around here and it has to be done. I\u2019m about finished with the bedrooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in those boxes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe clothes going to the mission on the reservation.\u201d AJ dropped the box and dust shot up, making her cough. \u201cThree more and I\u2019ll take a break.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later she carried two glasses of iced tea into the front room. \u201cI might curl up beside you and take a nap this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d welcome it. I used to love that you were such a cuddler when you were a little girl. Jenn never was. You would crawl right up on my lap.\u201d Her mom fussed with the straw in the glass. \u201cThat was about the only time you were allowed to be a kid. I\u2019m sorry we relied on you so much later on. Neither your daddy nor I wanted to admit his health was failing. For him to go from being so robust, to so frail.\u201d</p><p>Mostly for him to spend years pretending not to be either.</p><p>AJ loved her dad, but like most tough Wyoming men, his pride overrode his common sense. From her thirteenth birthday until her father died when she was eighteen, she\u2014in essence\u2014had been their hired man. She\u2019d done the chores in all seasons, except for haying, which they\u2019d always hired out. She, her mom, and dad managed to muddle through that first calving season of her dad\u2019s weakened state. At least he\u2019d realized she couldn\u2019t handle the livestock, so they\u2019d quietly sold off all their cattle a few cow/calf pairs at a time and began renting sections to the McKays for grazing.</p><p>Yes, Floyd Foster\u2019s reputation as a keen rancher had remained intact until the day he\u2019d died.</p><p>Amy Jo Foster\u2019s reputation in those years was nonexistent. She stopped participating in school activities, as she went home directly after classes ended to do chores. She\u2019d morphed from an outgoing girl to a withdrawn young woman with more responsibilities than what clothes to wear to the next rodeo dance. Her classmates\u2014including Keely McKay\u2014believed she\u2019d become a goody-goody, when in truth, AJ\u2019d been too tired to be anything. She worked like a dog and she\u2019d had few friends besides her horses.</p><p>She didn\u2019t complain. It was tough on her mother taking care of her ailing father and the household, plus keeping a false face to the community. Jenn was too busy raising three kids by herself to help.</p> <p>But Jenn had no problem demanding you drop out of school and come back here to help her.</p><p>AJ knew Jenn felt guilty about asking AJ to temporarily withdrawal from school, but the bottom line was AJ was here right away after her mother\u2019s injury. Once again she was a daughter who did the right thing out of love. For her family. As she\u2019d continue to do.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful quiet. Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking, which always gets me into trouble. Can I get you more tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Florence kept fiddling with the straw. \u201cSince you were home last night, will you be out whoopin\u2019 it up tonight during happy hour at the Golden Boot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. We\u2019ll see. I\u2019m supposed to be helping Liza with her bachelorette party so I might head to her place to see what\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re going to Cord\u2019s to see what pops up on him.</p><p>He\u2019d be a little anxious after not seeing her for a couple of nights.</p><p>On second thought...\u201cA nap might not be a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>A few hours later, after she\u2019d packed the ranch truck with boxes for donations, her cell phone rang. Caller ID said Cord.</p><p>\u201cHey, AJ. How are ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonely and lookin\u2019 forward to tonight.\u201d Pause. \u201cYou are comin\u2019 over later, right?\u201d</p><p>Cord sounded...anxious. She smiled. \u201cFar as I know. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to make sure you wear boots and long pants. No, baby doll, you don\u2019t get to ask why.\u201d</p><p>She paused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure hopin\u2019 I hear a \u2018but\u2019 in your response someplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I learned my lesson last time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell hope not.\u201d</p><p>Her belly fluttered. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Except to apologize for bein\u2019 a jackass last night when you called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology accepted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough. See you at six. Got somethin\u2019 special planned.\u201d</p><p>Lord. She hoped it wasn\u2019t another one of his penalties.</p><p>Yes, you do.</p><p>Soon as AJ pulled into the yard, Cord didn\u2019t cool his bootheels in the house like usual; he bounded out like an eager pup. He bent down and kissed her soundly, a mixture of sweetness, heat and gratitude.</p><p>He tugged her to the corral. \u201cCome on. We\u2019re goin\u2019 ridin\u2019. Mick put new shoes on the horses today. I haven\u2019t been as vigilant about exercising them as I usually am.\u201d His hot gaze flicked from her red ropers to her pink face. \u201cHad more important things on my mind lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t put Lucy through her paces since that day\u2014\u201d She looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d He scooted closer and stared at her lustful mouth. \u201cThe day I...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTied me up in the barn and screwed me silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplainin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no. The way you make me feel, Cord, hot and needed\u2014\u201d She hastily added,</p><p>\u201cSexually speaking, of course.\u201d</p><p>Cord wondered why she felt the need to qualify that?</p><p>Because this is a sexual relationship, dumbass. You shouldn\u2019t be taking her riding.</p><p>You should be riding her.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get saddled up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pick a horse for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. You had a chance to ride them all when you watched Ky, so you know which one you like better than I would.\u201d</p><p>AJ picked Nickel, a quarter horse retired from barrel racing. Which just proved he\u2019d been right in letting her choose her mount because he would\u2019ve saddled up Borneo, a much older and gentler horse than Nickel.</p><p>\u201cWhose saddle is this?\u201d She walked behind Nickel to his right side and reached under his belly to fasten the cinch.</p><p>\u201cI bought it for Marla right after we moved back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it still looks new?\u201d</p><p>Cord grinned. \u201cUh-huh. Might be a little stiff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like stiff. I can work with stiff.\u201d</p><p>Surely she hadn\u2019t meant...he glanced over at her to see a big ol\u2019 smile on her not-so-innocent face. \u201cAnd I used to think you were so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed to think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I know under that sweetness is a wickedly naughty streak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplainin\u2019?\u201d she mimicked.</p><p>\u201cGod no.\u201d</p><p>She returned to Nickel\u2019s left side, unhooked the halter and let it dangle while she slipped on the bridle. Damndest thing. Nickel, who didn\u2019t allow just anyone to slip a bit in his mouth, opened right up. She talked to him, slipped the bridle over his ears, undid the quick release knot on the leadrope and draped both over the hook on the fence.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna get the gate?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been so engrossed with her horsewomanship that he hadn\u2019t readied his own mount. Cord followed AJ into the pasture. She\u2019d climbed on while he\u2019d closed the gate.</p><p>Damn. He\u2019d wanted to see that very fine ass of hers in the air as she threw her long leg over the saddle.</p><p>Cord mounted up. \u201cI thought we\u2019d ride to the butte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Fast or slow?\u201d</p><p>Soon as fast made it out of his mouth, AJ took off. She handled Nickel like a pro, giving him his head but staying in total control.</p><p>He caught her, but he suspected she\u2019d let him catch her.</p><p>AJ faced him and her smile rivaled the radiance of the sun. \u201cThese horseshoes seem to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmarty.\u201d</p><p>They ambled along through the sagebrush and rocks. Letting the horses lead them around scrub cedar and stunted pines.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI love how every time I ride through the fields some new wildflower has popped up.\u201d She pointed. \u201cSee? That one wasn\u2019t out two weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>She reined her horse to a stop.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord McKay. How can you be out here all the time and not notice the flowers?</p><p>Can\u2019t you see the daisies? The wild roses? The tiny purple starflowers? The yarrow? The lavender heads on the milkweed?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI see weeds.

You\u2019re beautiful, AJ. Wild and free on the back of that horse. The wind in your hair, the sun glowin\u2019 on your face, miles of blue sky behind you. Wish I had a camera.\u201d To show her how stunning she looked because he didn\u2019t need tangible proof. The image of her would be burned into his brain forever.</p><p>Those sharp gray eyes narrowed. \u201cDid you hit your head in the last couple days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do ya mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst an apology? Then a horseback ride? Now you\u2019re tossing me compliments like poetry? You gonna whip out a guitar and serenade me with cowboy love songs next?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Next, I\u2019m gonna...\u201d He spurred Jester in the sides and yelled over his shoulder,</p><p>\u201cRace you to the butte.\u201d</p><p>He heard her laughing and knew his playful side surprised her, hell it surprised him too, but he didn\u2019t let the reckless feeling deter him from winning for a change.</p><p>\u201cI deserved that.\u201d She urged Nickel to the left to skirt the base of the butte as she shaded her eyes and looked up. \u201cYou ever climbed to the top of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong time ago. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far can you see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPretty far. Not like on that plateau by Devil\u2019s Tower where everything is spread out for two hundred miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a butte on our place\u2014well, your place now\u2014that I used to climb. Never imagined when I climbed it two years ago it\u2019d be the last time.\u201d</p><p>They rode in silence until Cord realized it was an unnatural silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really gonna miss all this like crazy.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m really gonna miss you like crazy.</p><p>Cord checked his watch. \u201cWe should be gettin\u2019 back. I\u2019ve gotta call Ky pretty soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ready to come home yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a sneakin\u2019 suspicion he ain\u2019t completely unpacked.\u201d</p> <p>AJ smiled. \u201cLast year when I watched him he showed me his ring bearer outfit for Macie and Carter\u2019s wedding, complete with \u2018packin\u2019 leather shoes. At first I didn\u2019t know what he was saying. When I figured out patent leather, I\u2019ll admit I asked him to repeat it a couple of times because it was so damn funny. I didn\u2019t laugh at him, but that kid cracks me up.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanning said she wasn\u2019t picking out girl\u2019s names because she knows she\u2019ll have a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wonder how many brothers I\u2019d have after Carter if Ma hadn\u2019t broken the hunnerd year drought and birthed a girl McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of girls in my mother\u2019s family. When I loaded up boxes today I found a whole bunch of pictures and letters. Was weird to think of them as relatives. Even weirder to think there\u2019s a whole bunch of family history I wasn\u2019t aware of. It\u2019s gonna be fun going through that stuff later, but packing has been a lot harder than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysically?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Emotionally.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d reached the backside of the fence. Cord dismounted and led Jester to the side closest to the barn. He didn\u2019t offer to help AJ; she knew her way around.</p><p>After she\u2019d hung up her borrowed tack in the barn, she carried out two buckets of oats as he brushed the horses down. Once Nickel finished his portion, she gave Jester his bucket. She rested her butt on the fence and gazed across the horizon.</p><p>Cord wrapped his arms around her from behind and set his chin on her shoulder.</p><p>AJ snuggled into him. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatcha lookin\u2019 at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGonna be a pretty one tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty every night. I love the sky as it starts to fade from light blue to indigo to purple to black. You\u2019d think I\u2019d get tired of it, but I never do.\u201d</p><p>How many times had he sat out here, content to watch the sunset? He never tired of it either.</p><p>Tonight he\u2019d forego Mother Nature\u2019s display because he wanted, needed to be with her.</p><p>\u201cAJ. Come inside. I\u2019m dyin\u2019 to put my hands on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to call Ky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It can wait a bit.\u201d Cord buried his lips in the slope of her shoulder. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...since you asked so nice.\u201d</p><p>He hopped over the fence. They kissed all the way into the house. All the way up the stairs. All the way down the hall to his bedroom. Sneaking kisses as they undressed each other. Cord laid her on the comforter and lowered his body over hers.</p><p>\u201cBaby doll, what\u2019s wrong? You\u2019re trembling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always make me tremble.\u201d AJ\u2019s eyes were bright with something resembling...lust. Had to be lust because he couldn\u2019t fathom what that look on her face really meant.</p><p>Rather than dwell on it, he focused on mutual slaking of need. He groaned softly when the head of his cock brushed the wetness coating her sex. Sometimes he forgot she wasn\u2019t as experienced as her body indicated. Cord eased into her on a slow glide. Once he was fully seated he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cGo slow like that again.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never shown her the sweeter, slower side of making love after the first time?</p><p>Not really.</p><p>What a selfish prick. He\u2019d make it up to her starting now.</p><p>\u201cAs slow as you want.\u201d He kissed her mouth. That sassy mole. The curve of her cheek. Her temple and her eyelids. Her mouth again. All while leisurely rocking in and out of her body.</p><p>Her strong hands drifted up and down his back to his ass in a teasing caress.</p><p>Cord nibbled the line of her jaw. Her delicate earlobes. The muscles straining along the side of her neck. His tongue flicked across the pulse point at the base of her throat before dipping into the hollow. It took effort, but he managed to hold off on his climax when her first one ripped through her like wildfire.</p><p>Still, he didn\u2019t speed up. He dragged his goatee across the tops of her breasts, offering the tip of each hardened nipple a swirling lick, then he returned to her mouth to toy with her well-kissed lips. Through half-closed lids he studied her face, lost in the pleasure he was bringing her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold off forever\u2014everything was too perfect, the tender way she touched him, the glove tight feeling of her pussy sucking him to the root.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. I\u2019m so close again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right with you, baby doll,\u201d he panted against her throat, lost in the scent of her, the everything of her.</p><p>AJ canted her pelvis, curling her thighs around his hips to bring him deeper. \u201cCord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove me like this, slow and easy and for a long time. Make it last forever.\u201d AJ\u2019s fingers dug for purchase on his sweat-covered butt as her spine bowed off the bed.</p><p>\u201cBeen about as long as I can take.\u201d Cord sealed his mouth to hers as his balls drew up. The climax rolled over him, not a singular explosion, but in drawn out bursts, intensified by the rhythmic squeezing of her interior muscles around his cock.</p><p>He broke the kiss to press his lips to her temple, tasting sweat and sunshine and AJ.</p><p>When they\u2019d recovered some, she nuzzled the side of his head. \u201cMmm. Slow is good.\u201d</p><p>Cord smiled. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>She yawned. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you crawl under the covers and rest while I call Ky?\u201d</p><p>Once he\u2019d gotten her settled she sighed. \u201cComfy as I am, don\u2019t let me fall asleep here for the whole night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s assuming I can move. God. You\u2019re an exhausting lover, Cord McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 that as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should. I\u2019m so glad I waited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaited for what?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cAJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaited for you to be ready for me.\u201d</p><p>Confused by her cryptic statement, Cord pecked her on the forehead, tucked the quilt under her chin and tried not to think about how natural it was to have her in his bed.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>\u201cHow many inches long you think his dick is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiza!\u201d AJ nearly choked on her punch.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Don\u2019t pretend you haven\u2019t been looking at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I wasn\u2019t measuring him for condom sizes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtra, extra large. Super magnum. That bad boy\u2019s gotta be at least ten inches.\u201d</p><p>AJ eyed the stripper, whose junk was peeping out of the top of a metallic snakeskin G-string. The man looked little more than a boy. With his hands fluffing his shaggy rock star hair and the seductive way his slender hips gyrated, she knew no mere boy could move like that.</p><p>Four women from Liza\u2019s church whooped, elbowing each other to line up first to shove money in the string circling the guy\u2019s tattooed pelvis. In the corner by the food, seventy-something Bebe was winning the deep-throat-a-bratwurst contest. Marijane Jackson Goodhue, the president of their graduating class and extremely pregnant, showed how well she could roll meatballs in her mouth.</p><p>Liza\u2019s wish had come true. This was one wild-assed party. Packed to the rafters with women from all over the county\u2014including Cord\u2019s mother, Carolyn, and his Aunt Kimi.</p><p>There were four six-foot tall inflatable penises making the rounds. Any woman who played the bratwurst game won a headband decorated with bobbing light-up penises. AJ</p><p>turned her head to the left and the spring on her headband caught in her hair again.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the bride-to-be?\u201d someone shouted from the stage.</p><p>AJ lifted Liza\u2019s arm above her head and waved it madly. A horde of women descended on Liza, dragging her to a chair up front, which left AJ free to sneak to the punchbowl.</p><p>As she refilled her cup, Carolyn McKay sidled up. \u201cFancy meeting you here, Amy Jo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d AJ tried not to stare at the headpiece Cord\u2019s mom wore and wondered if Carolyn was trying not to stare at hers.</p><p>\u201cKeely is gonna be so mad she missed this party. I think we oughta rub it in real good, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>AJ grinned and clinked her mug against Carolyn\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ll drink to that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Flo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. She\u2019s anxious to get on with her life. We\u2019re going to Billings in a couple days to find a place for her to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Billings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe company Jenn works for had an opening. She can start in the next couple weeks, which will give the kids time to adjust before school starts.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn placed her hand on AJ\u2019s arm. \u201cHow are you adjusting, sweetheart?\u201d</p> <p>AJ shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I haven\u2019t officially left here yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve probably heard it from Keely, but you are welcome at our home anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that. And I know that Macie and Carter are looking forward to being around here more often. Exciting news about the baby, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. Can you believe I\u2019m gonna be a grandma again? Times three? I love my little Ky, but I\u2019m beside myself about Channing and now Macie. Lord. Doesn\u2019t seem that long ago I was sittin\u2019 in a chair like that one, about to pledge my life to a wild McKay.\u201d A wistful look crossed her face.</p><p>\u201cLots of people told me not to bother trying to love a man like Carson McKay. I knew he was gruff from the get-go. He holds a grudge. He\u2019s set in his ways. Carson is a cowboy rancher to his very core. Not big on public displays of affection. But I never listened to what any of them said. In my heart I knew what kind of man he was and still is. It isn\u2019t the public displays that matter. The important affection in a relationship is given in private anyway.\u201d</p><p>Was that a hint that Carolyn knew the type of affection her son Cord was giving her in private?</p> <p>\u201cGood Lord that\u2019s not very private, is it?\u201d</p><p>AJ\u2019s head swiveled to see what Carolyn was gawking at. Oh man. The stripper spread his legs wide and was doing the bump and grind\u2014in Liza\u2019s face. His butt was completely exposed and seemed to be covered in a sheen of oil. To discourage women from grabbing onto him?</p><p>\u201cHang in there, sweetie, it\u2019s worth it in the long run,\u201d Carolyn said, the penises on her head bobbed merrily as she returned to her seat up near the action.</p><p>Was that a warning her son was a chip off the old block? Or an encouragement AJ</p><p>should follow her instincts as far as Cord was concerned?</p><p>Problem was, AJ didn\u2019t trust her instincts anymore. She\u2019d started the quest to win Cord\u2019s love weeks ago. Now she wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d do with it if she ever got it.</p><p>Not that Cord gave off any signals he was falling in love with her. In lust?</p><p>Definitely. They\u2019d curl up to watch a movie or eat a meal together and rush to get naked together. Not that she was complaining\u2014hello, world\u2019s hottest cowboy rancher had it bad for her\u2014where was the downside in as much nasty, raunchy sex as she could take?</p> <p>Near, as she could figure, no downside. Except she still loved him. Not with the hero worship of a five-year-old girl, but with the eyes of a woman who knew a good man.</p><p>With the eyes of a woman who knew she\u2019d need years to capture the heart of Cord McKay...and she had two weeks.</p><p>Tonight was the third night in a row she hadn\u2019t been with him. Not to be churlish or to punish him. She spent her day fulfilling the needs of one person, only to race over to Cord\u2019s place to fulfill his needs. What about her needs? The ones that didn\u2019t have a blasted thing to do with family love or sexual gratification?</p><p>To cement the idea her personal needs and goals mattered, she\u2019d driven by the Sandstone building in Sundance a couple of times. It was the perfect size for a start-up massage studio. Too bad she didn\u2019t have the capital to remodel\u2014not even after the sale of seven horses. With her young age and no land ties to the community, she\u2019d have a devil of a time convincing the local banker to give her a loan.</p><p>Now that she thought about it, she and Keely hadn\u2019t gone beyond the \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be great to run a massage parlor in Sundance\u201d pipe dream. No planning. Which allowed her to figure out a plan to make her dream happen on her own.</p><p>She needed a patron. Maybe the economic development department for the state of Wyoming had business incentives to keep natives in the area. It\u2019d be worth looking into.</p><p>The time had come for her to be assertive in all areas of her life.</p><p>As if on cue, her cell phone rang. Keely.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. I can\u2019t hear you. Who? No. Haven\u2019t seen him. But your mom is here.</p><p>Look, K, I\u2019ll call you later with all the juicy details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the bridesmaids?\u201d Liza\u2019s sister Glenda barked in the microphone. Glenda scanned the room from the makeshift stage, grinning when she made eye contact with AJ.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one! Amy Jo Foster, come on down!\u201d</p><p>Yippee. AJ wanted that skanky guy to rub his crotch in her face like she wanted to get gored by a bull.</p><p>She hopped up on the stage next to Liza, who didn\u2019t look the least bit humiliated.</p><p>She was absolutely in her glory. AJ wouldn\u2019t do a damn thing to dim the gigantic grin on her friend\u2019s face\u2014she\u2019d play along and pretend she was having the best time in the world.</p><p>The only other bridesmaid besides Glenda was Darby Van Zandt and she was shier than AJ and Liza combined.</p><p>\u201cNow, ladies. We\u2019re gonna have a little contest. Yes, there is a prize.\u201d Glenda waved a clear plastic purple phallus with pearl looking things inside. \u201cThis vibrator, as seen on Sex and the City, is called the rabbit. It spins.\u201d She hit a switch and the vibrator started to make a buzzing noise as the tip circled.</p><p>The women in the crowd went nuts.</p><p>\u201cIt has three speeds, even reverse. It\u2019s waterproof. And this little do-hickey on the front? It vibrates in all the right places. I guarantee it won\u2019t move on you at the moment of truth. It stays exactly where you want it. For as long as you want it. This here is a girl\u2019s best friend because it can go all night without complaint...or until the batteries run out.</p><p>And you don\u2019t need a man with this bad boy around.\u201d</p><p>Half the women cheered; half booed.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, this fabulous prize will be awarded to one of these lucky ladies upon completion of a simple task.\u201d She paused for effect. \u201cThe most creative placement of a rolled up twenty dollar tip someplace in Mr. Angel\u2019s G-string with only her mouth. No hands allowed.\u201d</p><p>The room erupted in fits of laughter, clapping, wolf whistles and boot stomping.</p><p>\u201cWho wants to go first? Our lovely bride?\u201d</p><p>Amidst the cries of Liza, Liza, Liza, AJ heard the sound of glass breaking. Dear Lord, were these normally prim and proper ladies throwing...beer bottles? Or was that outside in the main part of the bar?</p><p>Glenda placed a rolled up bill in Liza\u2019s mouth. Mr. Angel\u2014what a stupid name\u2014</p><p>sashayed over and turned Liza\u2019s chair sideways so no one would miss out on the action.</p><p>Liza hammed it up. When she attempted to shove the money dead center in the pouch, it dropped to the floor. The stripper quickly picked it up.</p><p>A chorus of disappointed aw\u2019s arose...followed by the sound of shattering glass and heavy thumps that no one but AJ seemed to notice.</p><p>Darby scarcely raised her head when Glenda placed a fresh twenty between her tight lips. Mr. Angel did his bump and grind routine, taking extra time working the crowd since it didn\u2019t appear Darby was much of a sport.</p><p>Lord. Was this almost over?</p><p>Darby\u2019s half-hearted attempt to insert the money in his belly button fell short and the bill hit the ground. Mr. Angel scooped it up.</p><p>Where was he putting that cash? Wasn\u2019t like he had pockets.</p><p>A rowdier chorus of boos and whoops boomed. At the back table by the punchbowl, drinks were raised in a toast\u2014then the members of the Ladies Guild of First Methodist Church...had a chugging contest.</p><p>Whoa. Getting out of hand in here.</p><p>AJ\u2019s focus returned to Glenda calling for order after a fistfight broke out. Carolyn McKay stepped in to stop it. No doubt she had plenty of experience breaking up fights with her brawling bunch.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re down to our final contestant.\u201d Glenda slipped a rolled bill between AJ\u2019s teeth. \u201cAmy Jo, shown \u2019em how it\u2019s done, girl.\u201d</p><p>Drunken bellows of encouragement floated from the church ladies\u2019 table.</p><p>Mr. Angel spun sideways and performed his cheesy lounge singer dance. When he gyrated in front of her, she said, \u201cTurn around. We need to distract them before they riot.\u201d It finally clicked what she meant and he straddled her lap with his butt in her face instead of his bulge. She waited while he dry-humped the air in front of her.</p><p>Good God. This was horrid. Women liked this?</p><p>And what the heck was that noise? Like splintering wood?</p><p>\u201cSettle down, ladies, we\u2019re getting to the good part. Go, Amy Jo.\u201d</p><p>Amidst shouts of Amy Jo, Amy Jo, Amy Jo, AJ inhaled a deep breath when the stripper turned around. She slid the twenty beneath the G-string above his right hipbone.</p><p>She\u2019d almost made the corner of the fabric to tuck the money into the pouch, when the outer door to the bar burst open.</p><p>Curious men poured in, including Cord McKay.</p><p>Their eyes locked. And her mouth was dangerously close to a stripper\u2019s...pole.</p><p>Rage flared in his dark blue eyes.</p><p>For the first time in her life AJ felt the urge to be contrary. Cord was already pissed, how much madder could he get? So amidst the confusion, keeping her gaze firmly on Cord\u2019s, she dropped the cash in the man\u2019s banana hammock and used her teeth to snap the stripper\u2019s G-string like a rubber band.</p><p>Cord was infuriated.</p><p>The stripper yelled, \u201cOuch!\u201d When he caught sight of the deputy\u2019s arrival, the stripper snatched his duffel bag and slunk out the back door half-naked.</p><p>Glenda shouted, \u201cAmy Jo wins!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>AJ hopped up and snagged her prize off the podium and hefted it in the air like she\u2019d won the gold buckle at the rodeo.</p><p>A few women noticed and clapped.</p><p>Carolyn McKay floated her a thumbs up before she and her sister snuck out.</p> <p>The deputy and male bar patrons stared in horror at the decorations and the leftover food. And Bebe and Toots were having a sword fight with two monstrously long and anatomically correct penis-shaped swords.</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t nearly as much of an eyeful as the three women bouncing on a six-foot inflatable penis like it was a buckin\u2019 bull. And two other women slow dancing with their life-size phallic partners.</p><p>Oh yeah. Keely would be absolutely pea green with envy.</p><p>Liza kept a silly grin on her face as Noah climbed up on the stage and helped her to her feet. \u201cMy Prince Charming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy drunken bride.\u201d</p> <p>She giggled. \u201cIt was a grr-reat partay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that. Ready to return to the castle, princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Liza grinned at AJ as Noah scooped her into his arms and carried her out.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be talkin\u2019 about this one for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat they will.\u201d When she turned back around she saw Cord, standing in the same place, staring at her coolly. Like he didn\u2019t know every inch of her body. Like it hadn\u2019t bothered him a bit to see her on stage with a male stripper.</p><p>Like he didn\u2019t care about her at all.</p> <p>Say something. Come up here and chew me out. Drag me out. Don\u2019t stand there and pretend you don\u2019t know me.</p><p>Of course, Cord didn\u2019t do anything.</p><p>Disappointed, AJ spun around to regain control of her emotions. Stupid rum punch and bridal games always made her weepy. She stacked the chairs on the stage and carried them to the wall.</p><p>When she looked back Cord was gone.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t gone far.</p><p>Cord fumed in the shadows of the parking lot as he leaned against his truck outside the bar.</p><p>AJ had had her lips on another man.</p> <p>His woman had her mouth near some half-naked punk\u2019s groin.</p><p>In public.</p><p>And she\u2019d been enjoying it.</p><p>Had she been drunk?</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Women stumbled out of the bar for the next half hour under the watchful eye of the Crook County deputy. Husbands, boyfriends, in a couple of cases fathers, picked up the bachelorette party attendees. A couple of women walked arm in arm down the sidewalk singing, \u201cSave A Horse (Ride A Cowboy)\u201d but they\u2019d changed the words to, \u201cSave A Horse, Ride An Inflatable Penis\u201d which wasn\u2019t particularly funny, yet it sent them into gales of laughter.</p><p>Finally AJ came out. Alone. She nodded to Deputy Shortbull and headed for her Jeep.</p><p>Cord sauntered out of the shadows.</p><p>She jumped back. Then tried to start his goatee on fire with her glare. \u201cDid you give your mom and aunt a ride home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually I don\u2019t, Mr. McKay.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the Mr. McKay shit?\u201d</p><p>AJ shot a look over her shoulder. \u201cAre you sure you should be talking to me? Since we\u2019re not supposed to know each and all? Someone might see. Spread rumors that you\u2019re secretly diddling me and God knows we couldn\u2019t have that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Are you drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter if I am? Are you taking a poll?\u201d</p><p>This was not going well.</p><p>\u201cWrong answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I get another prize for giving you the right response?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, AJ.\u201d He glanced at the box in her hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prize I won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to snap off something smart, but changed her mind and smiled cagily. \u201cA vibrator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fuckin\u2019 way. What the hell do you need one of those\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014for? Comparison? That might be interesting.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her steadily, wondering if the steam blowing out of his nostrils was the same color as the steam blowing out of his ears.</p><p>\u201cFun as this conversation has been, Mr. McKay, I need to be getting home. Might need to stop and pick up some double A batteries first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell. You ain\u2019t goin\u2019 no place until you tell me why you haven\u2019t been around for the last three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy havin\u2019 your mouth next to another guy\u2019s dick?\u201d</p><p>She looked at her watch. \u201cWow. It\u2019s half-past I don\u2019t give a shit what you think, Cord McKay.\u201d</p><p>He growled.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have the right to talk to me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because you\u2019re mine.</p><p>Where the hell had that come from?</p><p>\u201cBecause...Christ. It\u2019s hard to have a serious conversation with you when you\u2019re wearin\u2019 lighted cocks on your head.\u201d</p><p>AJ defiantly thrust out her chin and the penises bobbled. \u201cWe aren\u2019t having a conversation. You\u2019re giving me tough-guy attitude. If you won\u2019t acknowledge me in public, you don\u2019t have the right to chastise me for anything I do in public or in private.</p><p>And now you lost the right to do anything to me in private either, bucko.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit bein\u2019 so goddamn childish.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed to silver slits. \u201cQuit bein\u2019 such a goddamn dickhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one with dicks on your head, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? I can take mine off any old time I please, but you wear your dickhead status like a second skin. Or should I say as a second foreskin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tryin\u2019 to piss me off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m trying to go home. So step aside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough shit. You ain\u2019t in no condition to drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays Deputy Shortbull. He forced me and everyone else to take a Breathalyzer. I passed. So hah!\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t let her go like this. Stall.</p><p>\u201cIf you walk away from me, AJ, I swear to God your penalty will double. Triple maybe. You already owed me for the last two nights. Don\u2019t make it worse on yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it, cowboy. In fact, you\u2019d better bring a rope and hogtie me because that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll ever get me back in your bed. But we both know you won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done with the hot horny divorced cowboy and the virginal babysitter fantasy.</p><p>And no, I won\u2019t cause a hysterical crying scene that\u2019ll embarrass poor proper rancher Cord McKay. This will end like it began\u2014as our dirty little secret. But it sure has been fun.\u201d</p><p>AJ pivoted on her stiletto, her hips swinging, the penises on top of her head swaying with every step of her long, sexy legs as she promenaded away from him.</p><p>Oh yeah. Little Miss Baby Doll just earned herself one helluva punishment.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>The next morning Cord woke up an hour earlier than usual. He finished his chores, cleaned up and was at AJ\u2019s house by eight a.m.</p><p>He called her cell phone. \u201cI\u2019m comin\u2019 up the driveway to get you. Easy or hard, your choice. But you will be leavin\u2019 with me, AJ. I suggest you be dressed and ready. Don\u2019t make me hogtie you because contrary to your smart little remark, you know I will do it.</p><p>In public. In front of your family. With complete and utter joy.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>He parked. Waited a minute. Hopped out and passed her Jeep. On the passenger\u2019s seat was the flashing penis headband, a button proclaiming, \u201cI sucked balls at Liza\u2019s bachelorette party\u201d and...the vibrator she\u2019d won. Still in the box.</p><p>Heh. A little comparison might be interesting, huh? He\u2019d see about that. He snagged it and put it in his truck under the seat. To be ornery, he draped a rope over his shoulder, just so Little Miss Smartypants knew he wasn\u2019t kidding.</p><p>Cord knocked on the front door.</p><p>Jenn answered. \u201cCord McKay? What on earth are you doing here on a Saturday morning? Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m lookin\u2019 for Amy Jo. Last week she offered her help and I\u2019m here to take her up on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDealin\u2019 with my horses. Since we\u2019ve been cross breedin\u2019 for a couple of years with your stock, I\u2019d sure like her opinion on which ones I oughta sell when she sells yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on in and have a cuppa coffee. She\u2019s a regular Dale Evans when it comes to horses. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love to help.\u201d</p><p>First thing Cord noticed were the boxes stacked everywhere. Second thing he noticed was AJ glaring at him.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019, Amy Jo. I was just tellin\u2019 Jenn about you helpin\u2019 me out today with my horses. Doin\u2019 a little ridin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t possibly help today. As you can see\u201d\u2014she gestured to the stack of flattened cartons\u2014\u201cmy hands are full.\u201d</p><p>Was she really challenging him? He mouthed, \u201cThat\u2019s one.\u201d</p><p>Her back snapped straight.</p><p>\u201cOh pooh, you don\u2019t need to stick around here, Amy Jo. Take a break. Spend time outside. You deserve it. The kids and I have gotten really good at packing in the last week.\u201d Her eyes zeroed in on his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s the rope for?\u201d</p><p>Cord kept his gaze on AJ\u2019s. \u201cI figured I might have to drag her out. She can be stubborn.\u201d</p><p>A bit of unease flashed in AJ\u2019s stormy gray eyes.</p><p>Jenn laughed. \u201cNow that I\u2019d like to see.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, knew it looked predatory and didn\u2019t care. \u201cComin\u2019 along peacefully, Amy Jo? Or do I have to prove to you and your sister just how good I am with ropes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d She stood and snatched her purse off the counter. \u201cI\u2019ll follow you in my car.\u201d</p><p>Like hell. \u201cI can bring you back, no problem.\u201d He bestowed his best aw-shucks-I\u2019m-a-good-ol\u2019-boy grin on Jenn. \u201cShe\u2019ll be gone all day. And to show that I ain\u2019t a total ingrate, I\u2019ll probably take her out for supper.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A kid screamed, another one yelled, \u201cMom!\u201d Jenn sighed and disappeared upstairs.</p><p>Cord gave AJ\u2019s jeans and T-shirt a once over. \u201cGet your boots on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the entryway.\u201d</p><p>He held the door open for her. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>AJ reached for the red ropers lined against the wall with the others.

Not by half.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and climbed in.</p><p>Cord purposely didn\u2019t speak to her at all during the ride to his place. He didn\u2019t crank the radio either. His silence would keep her on edge, right where he wanted her.</p><p>He parked in front of his house and stared straight ahead as he spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ve pushed me to the limits of my control, AJ. Today ain\u2019t so much about discipline, but playin\u2019 catch up for the nights you\u2019ve missed. Today I\u2019m gonna give you a taste of me not holdin\u2019 back. I\u2019m warnin\u2019 you; I will be relentless in takin\u2019 what I want. You won\u2019t deny me anything.\u201d</p><p>AJ didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cGo on in the house. You have five minutes to strip to nothin\u2019 and do whatever you need to prepare yourself for me before I\u2019ll expect you in the living room. Five minutes.</p><p>Not a second more.\u201d</p><p>He watched her hustle in the front door. After two minutes passed, he reached for the box under the seat and headed in after her. A quick trip upstairs to drop off his goodies and her time was up.</p><p>She positioned herself in front of the windows, naked, with her arms folded over her chest.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d</p> <p>Her footsteps were silent on the wood floor. When she was close enough, he curled his hands around her face and rested his forehead to hers. She melted against him, returning his affection without hesitation. Then Cord kissed her for a good long time, mostly to please himself as he walked her backward past the couch. He nudged her onto the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cSit. Lean back on your elbows and spread your legs.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>He scooted her forward until her butt hung off the edge. \u201cJust like that. Don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Cord licked her from her throat straight down to her pussy.</p><p>AJ moaned.</p><p>Lord. She did like a little kink\u2014was already wet and he\u2019d barely touched her. He dropped to his knees and stared at the feminine bounty before him. Soft. Pink. Glistening with want. He burrowed his tongue into her channel, inhaling her sweetness as he began to work her over with his mouth. Long sweeps of his tongue from her clit to her tiny puckered hole. He suckled her pussy lips, used his teeth on her clit while circling his wet thumb across that tight rosette.</p><p>When she began to bounce her hips and that kittenish whimper echoed in his ears, he latched on to her sweet spot and sucked. As she started to come, he plunged two fingers into her ass and his thumb pressed just inside the entrance to her juicy pussy.</p><p>\u201cOh-man-oh-man-oh-man. Cord!\u201d</p><p>He scissored the fingers in her ass, his thumb stroking the sensitive spot of her wet sex, his mouth suctioned to the swollen bud, every action in tune with the blood pulsating in her body.</p><p>She screamed.</p><p>Cord didn\u2019t back off until AJ exploded again. His attention to her pleasure triggered a sweet, thick female ejaculate and she literally came all over his face.</p><p>It was unbelievably fucking hot.</p><p>As she was floating down from the last orgasm, he kissed her, checking to see if she\u2019d be uncomfortable with the taste of herself on his tongue. But she lapped at him like a hungry kitten, digging her fingernails into the back of his neck.</p><p>His dick was so hard it threatened to drive a hole through his jeans to get out.</p><p>Cord helped her up. \u201cOn your knees on the rug, baby doll. Hands behind your back.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the rope.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakin\u2019 sure you can\u2019t use your hands.\u201d He bound her crossed wrists. \u201cToo tight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He watched her watching him as he unbuckled his belt and unzipped his jeans. Lowered them to his shins. He shoved the boxers down and his cock bounced like it was spring loaded. \u201cCome closer.\u201d</p><p>AJ wet her lips and walked three steps on her knees.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Get your mouth nice and wet for me. First I want you to suck my balls.\u201d</p><p>He widened his stance and placed his hands on the top of her head. \u201cMight have to crane your neck.\u201d</p><p>She nuzzled his groin and kissed down the length of his shaft until her hot breath reached where his sac hung. AJ licked around his left nut before bringing it into her warm mouth.</p><p>\u201cAh. Both of them now. Like that.\u201d When Cord glanced down and saw her face buried in his crotch, her eyes closed in enjoyment, his dick jerked against his belly. \u201cSuck nice and slow. Get \u2019em really wet. Roll \u2019em over your tongue...oh hell yeah.\u201d After his balls had drawn up, he stroked her cheek and said, \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>AJ released them. \u201cI love the way you smell. All musky, manly, salty goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna love the way I taste too.\u201d He tipped her head up and he circled the weeping tip of his cock over her lips. \u201cOpen wide, \u2019cause I\u2019m goin\u2019 deep.\u201d</p><p>He fed his cock into her mouth an inch at a time. Jesus. He loved that supremely wet heat and how the soft tissues of her mouth molded to his hardness.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna work past your gag reflex until you feel me in the back of your throat.\u201d Cord placed his hands on her head to guide her. \u201cYou\u2019re doin\u2019 fine. That feels so goddamn good. You can take it all.\u201d The cockhead crested her soft palate and her lips were pressed against his abdomen at the root. \u201cBreathe through your nose.\u201d</p><p>AJ tried to speak and the vibration of her voice box traveled up his shaft and electrified his balls.</p><p>\u201cDo that again.\u201d</p><p>A humming noise this time.</p><p>\u201cChrist. Now I know why it\u2019s called a hummer. Suck me hard as I\u2019m pullin\u2019 out.\u201d</p><p>Her lips stayed tight around him until the head popped free. \u201cDo I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo questions, baby doll. My show.\u201d Cord pushed the length back into her mouth, building a rhythm that brought her bottom teeth into contact with the sweet spot underneath his cockhead on every withdrawal. His legs started to shake with anticipation.</p><p>Everything primitive and male inside him roared satisfaction at seeing his dick coated with her saliva and her chin shiny wet.</p><p>The silky glide and the way AJ alternately sucked and licked jerked his balls up tight. His thrusts became faster, shorter. He gently held her head between his palms and her baby soft hair spilled through his fingers.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, flick that wicked tongue, right there. Work just the tip. Make it drippin\u2019 wet. Like that. Open wider.\u201d He pumped four more times. The last one kept his cock deep. Cord arched as the spasms sent his seed jetting down the back of her throat.</p><p>She swallowed with gusto.</p><p>White noise detonated in his brain. When not a single twitch of his cock remained, he eased out of her mouth.</p><p>AJ\u2019s big gray eyes were on his as he yanked up his boxers and jeans and refastened his belt.</p><p>Cord dropped to his haunches and wiped her chin. \u201cYou get any better at that and you\u2019ll send me into a coma.\u201d He kissed her in a long, slow, seductive tangling of tongues, which left them both breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cGo upstairs and wait on the bed for me.\u201d He stood and helped her to her feet, watching shamelessly as her breasts bounced, her ass shook and her shiny blonde hair swayed across the middle of her back when she climbed the stairs buck-assed nekkid.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>It was difficult to stretch out on the bed with her wrists tied behind her back, but AJ</p><p>managed.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t she seeing red at his high-handed behavior?</p><p>Because maybe high-handed means he cares about you.</p><p>Right. It meant he cared that she was a sexual plaything willing to flesh out his darkest fantasies.</p><p>She could work with that.</p><p>AJ closed her eyes and ran her tongue around the inside of her smooth lips. He hadn\u2019t been kidding about showing her his dominant side. Not that she minded. Having him lose control, mindless for the release only she could give him, hearing tough guy Cord McKay whimper. That was powerful, knowing how thoroughly she\u2019d pleased him.</p><p>The creak of the door startled her, but she wasn\u2019t in any position to panic.</p><p>Cord perched on the edge of the bed close to her. Completely dressed. He smiled.</p><p>She smiled back. \u201cAre you still mad at me for last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly because you were right.\u201d He skimmed his fingertips over her face. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful and vibrant and young and sweet. Everything I\u2019m not. You don\u2019t embarrass me, AJ. Me not wantin\u2019 anyone to know about what we were doin\u2019 wasn\u2019t to protect me; it was to protect you. Some folks think it\u2019s funny, the reputation the McKays have. It\u2019s not.</p><p>You saw how Colt\u2019s been behavin\u2019. I\u2019d never let you get caught up in it. You deserve better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut off her protest with a kiss. Seemed he always did that. Seemed she always let him. But there were worse ways to elicit a subject change, in her opinion.</p><p>\u201cTwo questions, baby doll. You ever seen the movie 91\u20442 Weeks?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou scared of water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you throwing me in the stock tank with my hands tied like this? Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean like takin\u2019 a shower.\u201d</p><p>Cord had showed up so unexpectedly she hadn\u2019t had time to shower. Did she smell bad? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know that look.

After blowing him while he\u2019d floated on the surface of the water, he\u2019d fucked her tits again.</p><p>Slower, longer, taking more time to arouse her by playing with her nipples and letting her suckle just the tip of his cock. Then he\u2019d bent her over the edge, perfectly aligning her clit with a water jet and mounted her from behind like a stallion and fucked her until she screamed her release.</p> <p>\u201cAJ,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I say no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say tough shit, we\u2019re doin\u2019 it anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorta thought you might say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoll over. I need to untie your hands.\u201d</p> <p>He made quick work of the rope. Before she sat up, he trailed his lips down the curve of her right butt cheek, and back up the left. She tried to get up but he pushed his hand in the middle of her back and held her down.</p><p>\u201cAh-ah-ah. Not so fast. For this next lesson, you\u2019re gonna be blindfolded too.\u201d</p><p>Something cool slipped over her eyes. \u201cWait a minute...you said too.\u201d</p><p>Cord slithered the rope across her spine and chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tying me up again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to get worried about your penchant for bondage, McKay.\u201d</p><p>His breath was hot in her ear. \u201cOnly with you. Only for you. Come on.\u201d He tugged her upright and led her into the bathroom. \u201cSmall step up. Hands above your head. Back up. Perfect. Hold still.\u201d</p><p>He tied her arms to the metal showerhead. \u201cWhat in the world\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo talkin\u2019. Don\u2019t make me gag you, because I will.\u201d</p><p>She stuck out her tongue.</p><p>He caught it between his teeth and gently bit down, then sucked it like he\u2019d sucked her clit. \u201cLast warnin\u2019. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>Her heart beat harder. She listened to bottles chinking against the tile and the sink being turned on and off. She heard him unbuckle and unzip his Wranglers, the whooshing thud as they hit the floor. Strange how tuned in she was to the sound of him stripping.</p><p>Cord stepped inside and said, \u201cCold?\u201d</p> <p>She sensed him drooling over her hard nipples. \u201cIs it obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Let me see if I can\u2019t warm you up.\u201d</p><p>AJ expected him to turn on the shower, not fasten his mouth to her nipple. By the time he finished worshipping her breasts, he\u2019d heated her up past warm to the boiling point.</p><p>Cord pressed his hot, naked body against hers. He nuzzled her throat. \u201cGot something I want you to taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I just do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Funny. Open up.\u201d</p><p>She shrank back. \u201cIt\u2019s not soap, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Open up and stick out your tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She did. A heavy, sticky dollop landed dead center. She closed her mouth and swallowed.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood answer.\u201d Droplets of that same sticky substance landed on her breasts. Her belly. The tops of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakin\u2019 you my personal lollipop. I\u2019m gonna lick it all off. Every. Single. Drop.\u201d</p><p>Everything inside her went red-hot with want.</p><p>\u201cOpen up and stick out your tongue.\u201d</p><p>She did. Something warm ran off the sides and down her chin. She licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cChocolate syrup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d Cord drizzled warm syrup down her neck. He squirted so much on her breasts she felt it dripping from her nipples. He coated the inside of her thighs. Then he licked her chin and her lips before he blew her mind with another soul kiss. \u201cTasty. Open your mouth and stick out your tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many flavors am I gonna be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnxious to feel my tongue on you? Licking off every bit of sweetness?\u201d</p><p>Her sex clenched hard. \u201cCord. You\u2019re making me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby doll, that\u2019s the point.\u201d He used his teeth to tug her earlobe, sending goosebumps through her from her scalp to her curled toes. \u201cNow be a good girl and stick out your tongue or I\u2019ll turn on the shower and let it clean you off instead of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2014I\u2019ll be good. I promise.\u201d AJ stuck out her tongue. A solid blob this time. She closed her mouth and chewed. \u201cPeach jam. Specifically your mom\u2019s peach jam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have half a dozen jars at our apartment. It\u2019s the one food thing Keely refuses to be without. She\u2019s making me bring a couple more pints home to Denver when I go back.\u201d</p><p>A beat of silence, then, \u201cI\u2019m not smearin\u2019 jam on you. So, open your mouth for the next one.\u201d</p><p>AJ wondered what\u2019d thrown him. A reference to the fact she\u2019d be returning to that apartment? Or the idea Denver would be her only home?</p><p>\u201cAJ,\u201d he warned.</p><p>She opened her mouth. More sticky liquid dribbled down her chin. \u201cChokecherry syrup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have highly developed taste buds, let\u2019s see how mine feel against your skin.\u201d</p><p>Cord began his onslaught at her neck and licked his way down. Sometimes fast.</p><p>Sometimes slow. Sometimes scraping his teeth on her flesh. Sometimes using suckling kisses.</p><p>But every sweep of his tongue, every hot breath, every groan and sigh only pushed her further to the edge. Her heart, her arms, her belly, her legs\u2014all trembled. Her pussy in particular quivered for the feel of that brilliant tongue.</p><p>Finally he said, \u201cSpread your legs.\u201d</p><p>Her blood seemed to pound right out of her veins as she slid her bare feet across the cool tile.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the prize you won last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>A buzzing noise sounded beside her right ear.</p><p>\u201cNo. Is that the...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Picked up off the front seat of your car. Didn\u2019t want your sister or your nieces and nephew to find it first. Plus I thought we might need it today. You know, for a little comparison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no need to thank me, baby doll. Watchin\u2019 this plastic cock disappear into your pussy will be thanks enough.\u201d The buzzing stopped. \u201cI lubed it with K-Y, but hold still while I put it in.\u201d</p><p>The vibrator slid in easily. Whoa. Talk about bizarre, having a plastic cock inside her; no warmth, no life, no heat, no pliancy. What was the appeal?</p><p>Then Cord turned it on and she knew.</p><p>\u201cOh-man-oh-man-oh-man.\u201d The part inside her pussy vibrated differently than the one on her clit. The interior wand seemed to be spinning. Slow. Fast. Slow. Fast.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It feels...weird. But in a good way. In a really good way all of sudden.\u201d She felt him smile against her breast.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna turn it to warp speed. While it\u2019s doin\u2019 it\u2019s thing, I\u2019m gonna do mine.</p><p>God, I love your tits. Especially without the condiments.\u201d</p><p>She arched when Cord sucked her nipple, which pressed the outside apparatus more firmly against her clit. Her whole body shook. The darkness, the sweet scents in the enclosed damp space, the hunger of Cord\u2019s mouth, the feel of his hard body, and the loss of the use of her hands\u2014all overpowering sensations. The unrelenting vibrations inside her pussy and on her clit were setting her on a path to the fastest orgasm of her life.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d She gasped as the climax struck fierce as chain lightning, in intense bursts, flash after flash of light behind her eyelids and then it was gone.</p><p>The buzzing stopped. Cord removed the vibrator and his mouth was on hers. He untied her hands.</p><p>She sagged against him. He turned the shower on, letting the cold water hit his back until it heated. Droplets of water sprayed her face and scented steam filled her nostrils.</p><p>Cord washed her off as he kissed her; his rough hands seemed bigger when they were wet. He said, \u201cI want you like this. Turn around.\u201d</p><p>He braced her hands on the wall, bending her forward until she was nearly at a right angle. He kicked her feet apart, tilted her hips and slid into her to the hilt. And stopped.</p><p>\u201cCord?\u201d</p><p>His chest pressed into her spine. \u201cI want to fuck you like an animal\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it. Take what you want. You have the reins.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and sank his teeth into the back of her neck, sending a fresh batch of tremors through her body before he stood up and slammed home.</p><p>Over and over. Harder than he\u2019d ever done before.</p><p>Cord didn\u2019t speak beyond grunts. He just systematically fucked her into oblivion.</p><p>Good thing she\u2019d braced herself. It was almost like he was trying to fuck her through the wall. When he came, snarling, pounding his flesh into hers, she swore even his semen burned hotter.</p><p>She sensed a shift in him. His breathing leveled, resembling a wave of shame as he retreated from her body with exquisite care. AJ walked her hands up the wall. She spun around blindly, reaching for him.</p><p>God, she loved this man. She loved his gruff, sweet, thoughtful sides. And his edgy side. She wasn\u2019t in love with the perfect Cord McKay she\u2019d been fantasizing over forever, but the real flesh and blood man. The real man. Flaws and all.</p><p>And she knew without a doubt he\u2019d break her heart. His stubborn pride would stand in the way of them being together. She had too much pride to do all the work of making him see how good they could be together for the long haul if he\u2019d just be patient. She\u2019d been doing all the work in all aspects of her life and she deserved a man who would meet her halfway. She deserved a man she didn\u2019t have to beg to love her.</p><p>AJ coiled her arms around his waist and kissed his chest, above his heart, making a wish. Please love me. Please see what we could have together. Please figure it out on your own.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired. Your water games wore me out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHang tight.\u201d He removed the blindfold, returned with a fluffy towel, dried her off thoroughly and guided her back into the bedroom to tuck her between his sheets. \u201cRest, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we still have all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And all night if you want it.\u201d</p><p>AJ smiled and sank into the pillows. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll just take a little catnap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that.\u201d He kissed her forehead.</p><p>She expected him to leave. But Cord swept her hair from her face and dragged his rough-skinned knuckles up and down her cheek.</p><p>As AJ drifted away, she heard him murmur, \u201cWhat the hell am I supposed to do now?\u201d</p><p>She tried to fight her way back to consciousness to give him a couple of realistic options, but a veil of darkness covered her and she was out.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>Rather than pace while AJ napped, Cord made lunch. Rather than dwell on the fact that in two short weeks he wouldn\u2019t be able to drive to her place and kidnap her for a full day of wicked sex games, he thought about how they\u2019d spend the rest of the afternoon.</p><p>Naked, obviously. But what else?</p><p>What else do you need? Wasn\u2019t this deal supposed to be a way to prove that sex was separate from love and companionship?</p><p>Not love. Logically his need for companionship made the most sense on why he was so insanely crazy about her. He was missing his son and spending time with AJ was a substitute. The minute Ky arrived, things would be back to the way they\u2019d been.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t they? Wouldn\u2019t he be happy then?</p><p>Cord knew he shouldn\u2019t be such a damn ostrich about this stuff, but he wondered if the \u201cout of sight; out of mind\u201d adage would hold true once AJ was gone.</p><p>He piled food on a tray and carried it upstairs. AJ was lying on her side, breathing evenly. \u201cAJ? I made lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She scrambled upright. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fell asleep in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Wow. How long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle more than an hour. You hungry?\u201d</p> <p>AJ stretched. \u201cAlways. What\u2019s on the menu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold cuts. Cheese. Fruit. Nothin\u2019 fancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. Do you have a robe I can borrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA robe? What the devil do you need a robe for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sit in the kitchen naked.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWho said anything about eatin\u2019 in the kitchen? I brought you lunch in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you worried about crumbs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ll do a number on the sheets anyway.\u201d Cord scooted closer and plucked up a grape from the tray. \u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed thoughtfully on the piece of fruit. \u201cAre you gonna smear condiments all over me again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that be so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just wish I could\u2019ve taken a turn.\u201d She scrutinized the tray. \u201cWhere are the cookies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat cookies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Lunch isn\u2019t lunch without cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound just like Ky,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cKy is a boy after my own heart.\u201d</p><p>A tiny stupid flare of jealousy appeared: Cord wanted to be the man after her heart.</p><p>You could be. Just take the chance. Admit this is long past a simple roll in the hay.</p><p>\u201cYour son and I even have the same favorite cookie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeanut butter kisses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Cord leaned closer. \u201cI don\u2019t have any peanut butter kisses. How about a real one instead?\u201d He granted her a quick peck and dangled a fat green grape above her lips.</p><p>\u201cOpen up.\u201d</p><p>AJ sucked the grape from his fingers with deliberate sensuality, which made his dick stir. \u201cThis makes me feel like a lady of leisure. Laying in this soft bed. Having a hot guy hand feed me. You have palm fronds hidden somewhere too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot guy. Right. You mean old guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have a few years on me. Hasn\u2019t kept you from keeping up with me.\u201d She purposely looked at his groin.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never mattered to me.\u201d Her serious gray eyes searched his. \u201cDo you remember the time I fell off my horse? When I was five? And you picked me up, wiped my tears and calmed me down?\u201d</p><p>Cord frowned. Didn\u2019t ring a bell. \u201cYou gonna be upset if I say no?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if you did remember. But I\u2019ve never forgotten it. Never. You were a Western knight in a white cowboy hat. You\u2019ve been my fantasy man since that day all those years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ, that\u2019s not me. Then or now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Don\u2019t spoil the memory for me by denying it. Don\u2019t spoil this moment either.</p><p>Be Cord my sexy fantasy man, not Cord the responsible rancher who thinks too much.\u201d</p><p>A section of her hair was stuck to her cheek from where she\u2019d slept on it. Cord peeled it away and rubbed the damp, white-blonde strand between his fingers. So soft.</p><p>Such a contrast against his rough, callused hand. \u201cYou are sweet.\u201d</p><p>AJ blushed. She picked up a chunk of salami and held it to his mouth. \u201cI want to feed you too.\u201d</p><p>By the time the food was gone, they\u2019d teased each other to the point Cord was crazed to have her again. He sat in the middle of the bed and wrapped her legs around his lower back as she shifted down slowly, encasing his cock in her tight, wet heat.</p><p>\u201cI like it this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too, baby doll. Me too.\u201d Cord clutched her ass cheeks in his hands as they maintained a slow, sensual pace. Her soft skin brushed his everywhere. He consumed her mouth, her neck, her nipples, never completely leaving the heaven of her pliant pussy.</p><p>She climaxed and brought him along with her, in a deliciously sweet throbbing that seemed to last an eternity.</p><p>With their bodies and mouths still connected in the aftermath of lazy, but passionate loving, he realized he\u2019d never clicked with anyone on this level\u2014heart, body and soul.</p><p>He also realized he didn\u2019t know what the hell to do about it.</p><p>AJ licked his Adam\u2019s apple. \u201cMmm. Sweaty, yummy sexy man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get some more food if you\u2019re still hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just nibble on you, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine by me.\u201d He arched his neck when her teeth scraped up to his ear and released a shudder. \u201cGod. I love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll keep doing it.\u201d</p><p>His hands were on her butt and his thumbs idly stroked the crack of her ass to the puckered rosette. On the next slow stroke up, his thumb lingered on that tiny opening.</p><p>Immediately she tensed up.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I do, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for umm...more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go slow.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing\u2014which alarmed him because she always spoke her mind.</p><p>\u201cAJ? Look at me.\u201d She lifted her head. Cord didn\u2019t like the fear in her eyes. He especially didn\u2019t like the fact he\u2019d put it there. She\u2019d given her body over to him without hesitation, with eagerness, with utter trust, with joy. He\u2019d be a fool\u2014and a bully\u2014if he let his sexual desires overrule her panic. \u201cI\u2019d never make you do anything you didn\u2019t want to, baby doll. If you\u2019re not ready, no big deal, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget what I said. I\u2019m a controllin\u2019 dickhead sometimes. I\u2019m used to bein\u2019 obeyed.</p><p>Period.\u201d He kissed her with reassurance. \u201cNo hurry. I can wait until you\u2019re ready. In the mean time\u201d\u2014he flipped her on her back\u2014\u201cI want you again.\u201d</p><p>AJ murmured, \u201cI\u2019m so glad Cosmo was wrong about the male recovery time thingy.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled against her throat and wondered how he\u2019d ever let her go.</p><p>After spending nearly all day in bed, AJ needed a break. She unfolded from Cord\u2019s embrace and reached for her clothes that he\u2019d brought up from downstairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowhere. Don\u2019t you have to check cattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come along?\u201d</p><p>Cord raised both eyebrows. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Can we take the horses instead of the truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakes longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I like being outside.\u201d</p><p>He rolled over and mumbled something as he reached for his clothes.</p><p>\u201cWhat? If you don\u2019t want me to come along, just say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. Just shocks the hell out of me that you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t. As much as I bitched about it when I had no choice but to tend to everything, I\u2019m a ranch girl through and through. I think you forget that sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tryin\u2019 to.\u201d</p><p>Not touching that comment, cowboy. I can\u2019t wrestle your demons anymore than I can make you change your mind or see the truth.</p><p>Downstairs, as AJ slipped on her ropers, Cord waggled the silver boots at her. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t worn these. Now you\u2019ll have me thinkin\u2019 of all sorts of scenarios in which you\u2019re wearin\u2019 nothin\u2019 but these fuck me boots when we get back.\u201d</p><p>She snatched them and threw them in the coat closet. \u201cWrong. Out of sight; out of mind.\u201d</p><p>Cord froze.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019ll really work? Pretendin\u2019 somethin\u2019s not there when it obviously is right in front of you?\u201d</p><p>AJ had the strangest feeling they weren\u2019t talking about a pair of boots. \u201cNo. Come on. Let\u2019s saddle up.\u201d</p><p>Within ten minutes they were riding the fenceline. The late afternoon sun was hot, not unbearably so, but warm enough that AJ wished she\u2019d grabbed a hat. Cord wore his, a finely woven cream-colored straw, not the frat party variety, but the type ranchers needed in the summertime to reflect heat. She couldn\u2019t help but think the white hat just reinforced the white knight image she\u2019d held of him her entire life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After they\u2019d checked the herd, they continued clopping along. The serenity of the scenery negated the need for idle chatter. Cord led; she followed.</p><p>\u201cSee that stock tank? Race\u2014\u201d</p><p>The second she heard the word race she was gone. He didn\u2019t come close to catching her. \u201cMaybe you should ride this horse next time, McKay. I\u2019ve beaten you both times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to go best three out of five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You have a daredevil streak, Ms. Foster. How come I never knew about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause being a wild child was Keely\u2019s reputation, not mine. I was too busy working in my dad\u2019s stead to be wild.\u201d After she realized what she\u2019d confessed, she kicked her heels into Nickel\u2019s sides and they were off.</p><p>Cord reined up beside her. \u201cYou gonna explain that, or are you gonna make me guess?\u201d</p> <p>She said, \u201cGuess,\u201d deciding he wouldn\u2019t figure out what no one else had during those years.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. I moved back here seven years ago after bein\u2019 in Seattle for two years, so you would\u2019ve been fifteen. I don\u2019t remember you chummin\u2019 around with Keely until you were at least eighteen, after Ky was born and Marla took off. So durin\u2019 those missin\u2019 years you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Look. A red-tailed hawk.\u201d AJ pointed to the bird circling in the vibrant blue sky off to the west.</p><p>\u201cBaby doll, I could be sarcastic and list a buncha things you might\u2019ve been doin\u2019, but I\u2019m askin\u2019 you to be honest and tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it anyway.\u201d</p> <p>AJ met his hard gaze. \u201cI was working the ranch. Daddy had a debilitating heart attack when I was thirteen. Mama and Daddy didn\u2019t want anyone to know about his health problems, so all the doctor\u2019s visits were done in Cheyenne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re sayin\u2019? What? You did everything? Ran the ranch by...yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do the haying. But I knew what else needed to be done, so I did it. End of story.\u201d</p><p>Colt looked like she\u2019d punched him in the gut. \u201cYou ran the ranch? From the time you were thirteen? Why didn\u2019t anyone in the community notice? For Christsake, why didn\u2019t anyone in my family notice?\u201d He demanded, \u201cDid Keely know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until a few years ago. She always teased me about being such a goody-goody.</p><p>But the truth was, I was too damn tired to care about being the belle of the county.\u201d After she\u2019d told Keely the truth, Keely had been suitably appalled by her own clueless behavior. She\u2019d also been embarrassed by the McKay family\u2019s tendency to take care of their own to the exclusion of all others. AJ had sworn Keely to secrecy and they\u2019d become friends on a much deeper level than she\u2019d ever imagined possible.</p><p>\u201cYou took care of the cattle? And the horses? And fixin\u2019 fence and mowin\u2019 ditches?</p><p>And breedin\u2019 and brandin\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter the first calving season Daddy started selling off cow/calf pairs. By the time I was fifteen all the cattle were gone. Dad told everyone he wanted early retirement and we leased most the grazing land. Then I just had to deal with the other ranch stuff you\u2019re always talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask my dad, my brothers, my cousins, or any of the McKays? You have to know that someone in my family would\u2019ve helped you out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich family, Cord? Colby was rodeoin\u2019. Cam joined the service. Carter was at college. You were living in Seattle, which left Colt. Your McKay cousins, Kane, Kade, Quinn and Bennett had to do all the rest of the work\u2014except for Chase who was still in high school\u2014and they had to hire out, remember? The McKay ranch is fifty times the size of ours. So your family couldn\u2019t have helped us even if my dad hadn\u2019t had too much pride to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m warning you, Cord, drop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d</p><p>AJ reined Nickel the opposite direction, snapped the reins and raced back to the barn like the hounds of hell nipped at her heels.</p><p>Cord was right on her horse\u2019s tail. But all thoughts of continuing the discussion were lost when she noticed Colby\u2019s pickup screaming up the driveway as she reached the fence beside the barn. She jerked Nickel to a stop, causing Cord to do the same with Jester.</p><p>He snapped, \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to hide in the barn until Colby leaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that. I\u2019m sick of this hidin\u2019 shit. I think it\u2019s time we told everyone the truth about us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord!\u201d</p><p>They turned to see Colby running toward them.</p><p>A sick feeling churned in AJ\u2019s stomach. Colby. Running.</p><p>\u201cYou gotta come. Dag had an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDag? What the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ain\u2019t sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe okay?\u201d</p><p>Colby shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Shock hung in the air.</p><p>AJ said, \u201cGo on, Cord. Be with your family. I\u2019ll take care of the horses.\u201d</p><p>Neither he nor Colby said another word as they climbed into Colby\u2019s truck and roared off.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>Four days later...</p><p>Cord sat next to his brother Carter in the church basement after Dag\u2019s funeral service. Everyone was somber, still in a state of shock over Dag\u2019s death.</p><p>Sometimes a tragedy will pull a family apart. But it had the opposite effect with the Wests and McKays, by putting an end to the rift between them. Carson and Cal and Charlie McKay and all of Dag\u2019s male McKay cousins\u2014less Cam who was in Iraq\u2014were pallbearers right alongside the eight West cousins.</p><p>The church had been packed with family, members of the community and lots of young rodeo cowboys. They\u2019d all been holding up fairly well until Dag\u2019s buddy Trevor Glanzer brought the traditional riderless horse to the funeral procession of cars headed to the graveyard.</p><p>In the last four days, Dag\u2019s father, Harland, aged twenty years. He refused to let his daughter, Chassie, out of his sight. Cord\u2019s mother shooed Chassie away to give her a much needed break from her father\u2019s overwhelming grief, and Carolyn stayed beside her grieving brother. The only other time Cord had seen his mother so distraught was two years ago when Colby nearly died from a rodeo injury.</p><p>Cord\u2019s gaze swept the table. Carter and Macie. Colby and Channing. Keely. Kane and Kade. Chase McKay and his older brothers Quinn and Bennett. Cash Big Crow.</p><p>Trevor. But Trevor went to comfort Chassie and they disappeared outside. Cord imagined it wouldn\u2019t be much longer before he\u2019d be hearing another set of wedding bells. Better that than the somber tones of a funeral dirge.</p><p>Colt was conspicuously absent. He\u2019d been at the service and the burial, but no one knew where he\u2019d gone afterward. No one said it, but everyone knew his brother was drinking someplace. And of all the stupid fucking things to do...drinking was what\u2019d gotten Dag killed.</p><p>Dag had still been half-drunk from a hard night of partying when he\u2019d started chores Saturday morning. The assumption was Dag passed out on the tractor, drifted into the ditch where the tractor flipped on top of him and crushed him. Luckily Trevor discovered Dag that afternoon, not Harland. God knows that would\u2019ve killed his uncle and they\u2019d be having a double funeral.</p><p>Ranching was a dangerous life. Fatal accidents happened all the time. Not in their family in recent years. And not because of a bad decision that could\u2019ve easily been avoided.</p><p>A fucking senseless waste of a life.</p><p>Jesus. He couldn\u2019t believe Dag was dead. None of them could.</p><p>Voices murmured. Cord loosened his tie and Keely caught him looking at his watch.</p><p>\u201cWhat time do you have to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn about an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to go alone? I could drive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, sis, but I\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s gonna be a quick trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to him today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He don\u2019t understand and I\u2019ve done a poor job explainin\u2019 it to him.\u201d By the time Cord decided to tell Ky what\u2019d happened to Dag, his son had plain gone into hysterics and demanded to come home. Oddly enough, Marla agreed Ky should be with him. They\u2019d changed the plane reservations and Cord was scheduled to leave on the last flight out of Cheyenne to Denver, en route to Seattle. As happy as he\u2019d be to see his boy for the first time in a month, a layer of sadness dimmed his enthusiasm. Death changed everything.</p><p>Carter shoved his empty cup across the table. \u201cSorry I\u2019m gonna miss seein\u2019 the little squirt, but we can\u2019t stick around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fault,\u201d Cash said. \u201cI doan wanna leave Gem alone with the twins overnight. She says she can handle them but she shouldn\u2019t have to. We brought two horse trailers and we still need to load up the horses I bought from AJ before we take off.\u201d</p><p>Cord\u2019s stomach clenched at the mention of AJ\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cThat means you guys are leavin\u2019 me to deal with Colt once I track him down?\u201d</p><p>Colby asked.</p><p>Shit. Cord hadn\u2019t thought of that. \u201cCan it wait until I get back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I, Colby, chopped liver? I didn\u2019t get to knock some sense into Carter the last time we had a McKay fall out of line, so I\u2019m entitled to let loose on another one of my stupidly clueless brothers.\u201d Keely gave Cord a pointed look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what.\u201d</p><p>Kane said, \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. Kade and I\u2019ll be around.\u201d</p><p>Quinn scratched his head beneath his hat. \u201cCount me and Bennett in, if you give us enough warning so we can make the drive. Chase has gotta get back on the road too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you competin\u2019 next?\u201d Cash asked.</p><p>\u201cWichita. Big purse. Lotsa points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long way. You drivin\u2019 straight through?\u201d</p><p>Chase nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood luck and be careful.\u201d When Cash stood to leave, everyone at the table followed suit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After Cord was on the road, he heard his cell phone beeping and he saw he\u2019d missed a call from AJ. Damn. They\u2019d been playing phone tag for a couple of days. The day after Dag died she\u2019d gone to Billings with Jenn to get her mother moved into the assisted living facility. She wouldn\u2019t be back until after he and Ky returned.</p><p>Yeah, he knew it was over. He knew he shouldn\u2019t call her back. He should just let it go. He should just let her go. But the idea of not seeing her again? Not talking to her?</p><p>Not laughing with her? Not touching her? That was just another reason why his reunion with Ky would be so bittersweet.</p> <p>He hit redial anyway and left her another message. Cell service through Wyoming was spotty at best so he knew chances were slim they\u2019d actually connect. Why did everything in life have to be so goddamn hard?</p><p>Why don\u2019t you just buck up and tell her how you feel?</p><p>Right. So she could walk away from him?</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d stay.</p><p>Nah. The die was cast. The ball was in play. There was no way to go back and he really couldn\u2019t see how he and AJ could go forward when they\u2019d literally be miles apart from Sundance to Denver.</p> <p>It was a damn long, lonely, depressing drive to Cheyenne.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Two days later...</p><p>While Kade and Skylar waited for the check after a crappy meal at Ziggy\u2019s sports bar, which neither of them tasted, he saw Colt.</p><p>Happy as Kade was to know his cousin wasn\u2019t dead, because no one had seen him since Dag\u2019s funeral, he was less than happy when Colt stumbled to their booth drunk as a skunk, high as a kite with a vulgar look in his bleary eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, cuz. Who\u2019s the purty lady?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSkylar. Skylar this is my very drunk cousin, Colt McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how come you haven\u2019t brought her by the Boars Nest? \u2019Cause she ain\u2019t the adventurous type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because I don\u2019t live there anymore.\u201d Kade had a moment of panic. What if Colt was here with Kane? Why in the hell after half a dozen dates hadn\u2019t he come clean about his real identity? Because it\u2019d gone too far and he was a total fucking dumbass.</p><p>\u201cExcuse us, we were just leavin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, hold on. I\u2019ll let ya go get lucky,\u201d he winked lewdly at Skylar, \u201csoon as you tell me what the hell Kane did with my extra set of truck keys. Can\u2019t find \u2019em anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my brother here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, your brother ain\u2019t here. That\u2019s what I\u2019m sayin\u2019. The bartender took my keys. I keep an extra set in my glove box and they\u2019re missin\u2019. Kane didn\u2019t give \u2019em back last time he borrowed my truck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be drivin\u2019 anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you turn into such a fuckin\u2019 pussy, Kade? Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Colt, and go someplace else. For Christsake go sleep it off in your truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you got the right to tell me what to do like everyone else in my goddamn life? Fuck that. I\u2019ll knock you into next week, you smarmy cocksucker.\u201d</p><p>Skylar said, \u201cTake it easy, Colt. You\u2019re confused. Maybe Kane and I should take you home.\u201d</p><p>Colt frowned and looked around wildly. \u201cKane? He\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right there.\u201d Skylar pointed at Kade.</p><p>No no no. Kade knew everything was about to go horribly wrong.</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, I may be drunk as shit, but you\u2019re the one who\u2019s confused. That ain\u2019t Kane.</p><p>That\u2019s Kade.\u201d</p><p>Skylar stared at Kade as if she expected him to dispute it. While she waited, two more shadows fell across the table and they both looked up to see Colby and...Kane.</p><p>Fucking great.</p><p>Skylar gasped. Her gaze zipped back and forth between the twins. \u201cThere are two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkylar? What the hell are you doin\u2019 here with my brother?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were black with rage when they connected with his again. \u201cKade, I presume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. I can explain. When I found out what a dick Kane was to you on your date that night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took it upon yourself to pretend to be him that lunch date in Moorcroft? And then all the times after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I mean, no. Shit. I wanted to show you I\u2019m not him. Just because we\u2019re identical twins doesn\u2019t mean we have identical behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you want them to, purty lady. These guys fulfilled quite a few women\u2019s fantasies of bein\u2019\u2014what\u2019d Jazz call you that night she fucked both of you at the same time?\u2014a twin beefcake manwich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt, shut your fuckin\u2019 mouth,\u201d Colby snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re having a big goddamn laugh about this, Kade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t laughin\u2019, Sky, \u2019cause it ain\u2019t a joke. I planned to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight after you screwed me in the parking lot of a honky tonk not an hour ago?\u201d she hissed. \u201cWas it all a lie? A trick? See if I\u2019d notice the difference between you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, sweet darlin\u2019, there\u2019s plenty of us McKay men around if you wanna give me a shot. I\u2019m up for anything.\u201d Colt ran his fingers down Skylar\u2019s arm.</p><p>Kade jumped up and clocked Colt in the jaw. Colt stumbled but remained upright.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever fuckin\u2019 touch her. Don\u2019t you even look at her, you drunken piece of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I don\u2019t have to pretend to be someone I\u2019m not in order to get some pussy.\u201d</p><p>Kade lunged for him again and Colby held him back as Colt hit the ground.</p><p>He noticed everything and everyone in the bar came to a dead stop.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Colby and Kane each had one of Colt\u2019s arms as they dragged him outside.</p><p>Somehow, Kade found the balls to face Skylar\u2019s justifiable fury. He boxed her in so she couldn\u2019t escape until he\u2019d said his piece. \u201cNo matter what you think, I was me when we were together. Me. Kade McKay. Everything I did, everything I said, every damn time. None of it was a lie. The way I feel about you ain\u2019t a lie either.\u201d</p><p>She whispered, \u201cJust go away and leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t humiliate me any more than you already have. Go.\u201d</p><p>Miserable, he walked out.</p><p>Colt had passed out in the parking lot. The three of them threw him in the back of Kane\u2019s truck with more force than necessary.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you track him down?\u201d Kade asked.</p><p>\u201cThe bartender called me. We\u2019ve put the word out to all of Colt\u2019s regular waterin\u2019 holes that we\u2019re lookin\u2019 for him.\u201d</p><p>Colby was pissed and as close to losing it as Kade had ever seen him. \u201cWhat the fuck am I supposed to do with him? I can\u2019t take him home. Ma is already a mess over Dag\u2019s death and she\u2019s worried sick the same thing is gonna happen to Colt.</p><p>\u201cIf I leave him by himself to sleep it off, he\u2019ll disappear again, or I\u2019ll find him dead from chokin\u2019 on his own vomit. You guys can\u2019t stay up all night and babysit him because we\u2019ve all gotta work tomorrow. We\u2019re short-handed since Cord\u2019s been gone and Colt ain\u2019t been around to pick up the slack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt ain\u2019t done shit for months, Colby. None of us are happy about that.\u201d</p><p>Colby paced. \u201cMy pregnant wife is fuckin\u2019 hysterical because she\u2019s afraid my stupid brother will do somethin\u2019 to get me killed. Now she refuses to let me work anywhere around him. How am I supposed to tell my folks that? When Colt and Cord can\u2019t work together anymore either.\u201d</p><p>Softly, Kane said, \u201cShe\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what the hell am I supposed to do? We\u2019ve got a goddamn ranch to run! None of us can spend our time worryin\u2019 about soap opera family shit like this.\u201d</p><p>They remained quiet, lost in their own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay up with him at the Boars Nest tonight,\u201d Kade said. \u201cI\u2019m too wound up to sleep anyway and Ma will know somethin\u2019 is wrong with me if I go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess that gets you outta mornin\u2019 chores,\u201d Kane said.</p><p>\u201cTalk to Uncle C about this. I\u2019ll talk to my dad. We\u2019ll come up with somethin\u2019 because far as I\u2019m concerned, tonight was the last straw for Colt\u2019s employment anyplace on the ranch.\u201d</p><p>Kane retrieved the keys from the bartender and drove Colt\u2019s truck home, then helped Kade get Colt into the house.</p><p>After they\u2019d dropped Colt fully clothed in his bed, Kane said, \u201cAbout what happened with Skylar\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot talkin\u2019 about it with you now, or ever, Kane. Let it alone.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and Kade heard the door to his brother\u2019s room close.</p><p>It was a long night.</p><p>Colt stirred around eight o\u2019clock when Kade dumped a bucket of cold water on him.</p><p>\u201cGet up, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Colt rubbed his jaw and wiped water from his face. \u201cWhat happened last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a drunk and an asshole and an embarrassment to this family.\u201d</p><p>Colt leaned over and threw up in the bucket on the other side of the bed. When he got to the dry heave stage and finally sat back up, Kade tossed him a bottle of water.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be the only one. It\u2019s sure to be all over Crook and Weston Counties today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cAm I really that far gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so.\u201d Kade paused. \u201cYou remember Dag is dead?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWhat else has happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanning doesn\u2019t want Colby to work with you because she\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll get him killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. My sweet sister-in-law fuckin\u2019 hates me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot hate, she\u2019s scared, Colt.

I\u2019m so fuckin\u2019 sorry.\u201d</p><p>His deep baritone was scarcely above a whisper. \u201cWhat the hell has happened to me? I don\u2019t remember nothin\u2019,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Kade didn\u2019t answer. He just let Colt soak it all in.</p><p>After a while Colt stood and shuffled to the bathroom.</p><p>Half an hour later Colt propped himself against the doorway to the kitchen. He cleared his throat. \u201cI need help.\u201d</p> <p>Kade didn\u2019t offer anything.</p><p>\u201cI need help in a bad way. No more drinkin\u2019. No more druggin\u2019. No more whorin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>When Colt met his gaze, Kade wasn\u2019t the least bit surprised to see Colt\u2019s tears.</p><p>\u201cI know I don\u2019t got no right to ask you, but will you help me? Will you take me some place to dry out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to call your brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They have enough shit to deal with. Call Keely. Have her find a place in Denver. Someplace away from here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But I\u2019ll hafta tell the family why I ain\u2019t gonna be able to help out the next coupla days. The truth about you goin\u2019 in for treatment oughta come from you, cuz, not me.\u201d</p><p>Colt nodded and took Kade\u2019s cell phone and disappeared into the kitchen.</p><p>Kade McKay to the rescue again. While he waited for Colt, he took stock of his own situation.</p><p>His life was a screwed up mess. Living with his parents. He\u2019d try like hell to get Skylar to forgive him and give him another chance, but he figured with his luck, he\u2019d already lost her. Not that he blamed her. He\u2019d done a stupid thing by not telling her the truth and now he was paying for it. Just like Colt was.</p><p>Losing a woman like that seemed a damn steep price to pay. He hoped Cord was smart enough to not make the same mistakes he had. One of them deserved a shot at happiness that didn\u2019t have a goddamn thing to do with the fucking ranch.</p><p>Ten minutes later Colt shouldered an overnight bag and trudged past Kade to his truck without another word.</p> <p>They\u2019d have plenty of time to talk on the road, if Colt wanted to. But Kade wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the trip to Denver toward sobriety was completely silent.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>Three days later...</p><p>\u201cDaddy, how come Gran-gran is so sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Uncle Colt made some bad decisions and he had to go away. Gran-gran misses him like I missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he go away like Dag went away?\u201d</p><p>Cord looked up from buttering toast. \u201cNot the same, Ky. Dag ain\u2019t comin\u2019 back. Colt will be back next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Is that how come you\u2019re sad too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d But Cord couldn\u2019t help feeling relieved that his brother finally acknowledged a problem and had taken control of his life. They\u2019d deal with the changes when Colt returned.</p><p>\u201cI know what\u2019d make ya happy.\u201d</p><p>AJ. Seeing AJ would make him very happy. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlayin\u2019 Go Fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, that\u2019d probably do it. We\u2019ll play a game first thing when I get home later this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come I gotta go to Gran-gran\u2019s? Why can\u2019t I help you?\u201d</p><p>Cord counted to ten. \u201cAs I\u2019ve already explained three times, I can\u2019t be worryin\u2019 about you today while I\u2019m changin\u2019 out the pump. And Gran-gran missed you bad. Don\u2019t you wanna cheer her up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The spoon in the cereal bowl clattered. \u201cI wanna stay with you. Why are you sendin\u2019 me away? I wanna stay in my own house and play with my own tools and be with my own daddy\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ky launched himself off the barstool, coiled himself around Cord\u2019s legs and blubbered. He\u2019d been clingy too\u2014another thing Cord hadn\u2019t dealt with before. He hoisted his son up and tried to calm him.</p><p>When Ky quit sobbing, Cord finally understood what Ky had been saying over and over\u2014 I don\u2019t wancha to die too.</p><p>No way could he leave the kid today. No way.</p><p>He called his folks\u2019 house. \u201cMa. No, we\u2019re not runnin\u2019 late. He\u2019s not comin\u2019 over today. Because he needs another day with me, and I could use another one with him.</p><p>Yeah, I know we\u2019re short-handed. So? The pump will keep another day. I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>Ky finally stopped shuddering and peeked out from where he\u2019d hidden his teary face in Cord\u2019s neck. \u201cIs she mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Disappointed, but not mad.\u201d</p><p>Cord gazed down into Ky\u2019s somber blue eyes. The kid looked so much like him it was like looking back in time.</p><p>\u201cYou mad at me now, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor being a kid? Not on your life.\u201d He kissed the top of his head. \u201cBut I will be ticked if you beat me at cards, boy.\u201d</p><p>Ky giggled and wiggled to be let down.</p><p>Cord felt like one piece of his life clicked back in place. Oddly enough, he still felt like another piece was missing.</p><p>AJ\u2019s cell phone rang at nine o\u2019clock and she knew it was Cord before she saw the caller ID. \u201cHey. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKy\u2019s in bed. And I haven\u2019t seen you in over a week.\u201d</p><p>No small talk. Not a surprise. \u201cYou wanted this \u2018deal\u2019 to end when your son returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cSo? Why\u2019d you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see if you\u2019d come over.\u201d</p><p>Why? Because you missed me? Or missed the sex?</p><p>Did it really matter? She was leaving in a couple of days. Hadn\u2019t she wished for a chance to be with him again?</p><p>\u201cAJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Give me half an hour.\u201d</p><p>A sense of displacement and sadness rolled over her as she looked at the empty walls. Nothing remained of the years the Foster family spent here besides memories and the boxes stacked in the kitchen. Where would Macie and Carter start making changes?</p><p>Plenty of repairs and updates dogged this old ranch house\u2014repairs the Fosters hadn\u2019t the skill or the money to implement. She doubted Macie would see the charm in leaky faucets, drafty windows, doors that stuck, a cellar with an uneven floor and an unreliable heating system.</p><p>Speaking of...she wiped her sweaty brow. Why was it so damn hot in here? She\u2019d shut off the window air conditioner because it kept shorting out, and she\u2019d closed the windows because of the bugs. But it shouldn\u2019t feel like the damn furnace was running.</p><p>Stupid coal heater in the cellar was acting up again.</p><p>Nothing she could do about it now and it wouldn\u2019t be her problem much longer anyway. Day after tomorrow the movers would load up everything and take it to the storage facility in Billings. Then she\u2019d make a final walk through with the McKays and the banker and be on her way to Denver to finish school.</p><p>It was weird to think she wouldn\u2019t see her mother until Christmas. Not as weird as imagining Christmas wouldn\u2019t be here, at home, in this house, ever again.</p><p>Pull up your bootstraps, girl. Life goes on.</p><p>That it did. AJ had cried at Liza and Noah\u2019s wedding ceremony as they\u2019d begun their life together. As she\u2019d cried for Dag West, his life cut short too soon. It\u2019d served as a reminder that things could be much worse in her life than moving away from home and unrequited love.</p><p>She grabbed her purse and drove to Cord\u2019s. He waited for her on the front porch swing. After a prolonged kiss, without saying a word, he took her hand, led her upstairs straight to his bedroom and locked the door. He stripped her bare. The need on his face ripped straight into her soul.</p><p>His clever hands and hungry mouth were everywhere and attempted to set her skin on fire. He perched her on the edge of the bed and fell to his knees, nudged her thighs wide and bent to taste her. A few teasing swirls and he latched on to her clit and sucked.</p><p>The intense concentration on that bit of flesh and nowhere else launched her into orgasm like a rocket booster.</p><p>While she attempted to return to sanity, Cord kissed his way up the center of her torso, tickling her nipples with his lips. \u201cRoll over onto your stomach.\u201d</p><p>Cord\u2019s rough fingers caressed her arms, the sensitive backs of her thighs and calves as he placed her exactly how he wanted her\u2014butt in the air, arms stretched above her head. He lapped her spine from tailbone to the nape of her neck, sending another wave of shivers across her body.</p><p>He maneuvered his cock inside her on a slow smooth glide. \u201cEvery bit as good as I remembered. So goddamn good.\u201d When he layered his muscled chest over her back to drag kisses over her shoulder, she arched, craving the contact of his warm male skin on hers. While he drove into her, he straightened up and curled his hands around her hips.</p><p>AJ looked over her shoulder at him and her heart nearly stopped. Her fantasies paled in reality to this man, so ruggedly beautiful lost in passion. Eyes squeezed shut, jaw clenched. Lips full and soft from kissing her. Sweat gleamed on his torso. The veins in his arms bulged.</p><p>Cord sensed her staring at him and opened his eyes.</p><p>AJ didn\u2019t say a thing. His restraint snapped. He slammed into her over and over. She half expected to feel the bite of his teeth on her throat like stallions did during mating.</p><p>A guttural groan burst forth from Cord as she felt the end of his cock twitching, and her interior muscles contracted around the rigid shaft and sent her flying into an orgasm that stole her wits.</p><p>AJ collapsed face first on the bed. Firm lips feathered up her calves. He used his tongue on the back of her knees. More lingering kisses up her thigh. Then the other leg.</p><p>On her butt. Cord spent a lot of time kissing, licking and nuzzling her lower back. Equal treatment to her arms and shoulders and by the time he flipped her over, she was shaking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cord kissed her until she was dizzy. Until she was sopping wet with need.</p><p>He whispered, \u201cAgain,\u201d and picked her up, carrying her to the rocking chair in the corner. He straddled her legs across the arms of the chair and sank inside her. \u201cAlways so ready for me, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how to touch me to make me that way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damn sexy I never know where I wanna touch you first.\u201d He lifted her breasts to his mouth level. \u201cHow about I suck these while you\u2019re ridin\u2019 me, cowgirl? I wanna feel your nipples throbbin\u2019 on my tongue when you come.\u201d</p><p>This go round was slower, a solid, steady rocking of the chair and a longer climb to pleasure. In the aftermath, Cord kissed her like he couldn\u2019t bear to have their lips be apart.</p><p>They didn\u2019t talk. They returned to bed and touched and kissed and made love until they were exhausted.</p><p>Sleepy, AJ shivered beneath the covers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always cold.\u201d Cord rummaged in the dresser alongside the bed. \u201cHere\u2019s a T-shirt.\u201d</p> <p>She slipped it on. Pathetic, but she had every intention of stealing it so she\u2019d have something to remember him by.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta check on Ky. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>When he returned, AJ noticed he\u2019d left the door cracked open. Cord spooned against her and breathed in her hair. \u201cStay. Just a little while. I\u2019ll wake you up before dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Okay.\u201d She knew he\u2019d keep his word because he wouldn\u2019t want Ky to find them in bed together. She allowed herself to drift away.</p><p>Two sharp pokes on her arm startled her awake. Her gaze flew to the alarm clock.</p><p>Five thirty.</p> <p>Dammit. It had happened again.</p><p>Two more insistent pokes and AJ moved her head to see mini-Cord, aka Ky\u2014</p><p>wearing Superman pajamas, peering at her suspiciously. \u201cAmy Jo? Hey, how come you\u2019re havin\u2019 a sleepover in my daddy\u2019s bed?\u201d</p><p>Crap. She elbowed Cord in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cYou coulda had a sleepover in my room.\u201d</p><p>By Ky\u2019s petulant expression he was upset because he considered her his friend, not his father\u2019s friend. Her fingers automatically reached out to smooth Ky\u2019s dark sleep-tousled hair. \u201cNo way, Jose. You snore.\u201d</p><p>Ky smiled. \u201cDaddy snores louder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo did you move back for good? I shore missed you.\u201d Ky hopped up on the bed, right next to her. \u201cAre you gonna babysit me today? We could bake some of them cookies. And ride horses. Hey, wanna see the pitchers of the ocean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on, sport,\u201d Cord said in a husky morning voice. \u201cLet\u2019s have breakfast before you go makin\u2019 any plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you stayin\u2019 for breakfast, Amy Jo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Two enthusiastic bounces. \u201cPleeeeaaase?\u201d</p><p>She was such a sucker for this kid. \u201cOkie-dokie, artichokie, but you\u2019d better have a coffee cup out for me by the time I get down there.\u201d</p><p>His face bloomed with a devilish grin that was pure bad-boy McKay. \u201cI knew you would. You can even sit by me.\u201d The look Ky sent his dad dared him to argue about seating arrangements.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get dressed and we\u2019ll meetcha downstairs?\u201d Cord said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ky stood on the mattress and bounced twice before he hurled himself off the bed like a long jumper.</p><p>AJ gasped.</p><p>Cord sighed.</p><p>\u201cBetter\u2019n last time, huh, Dad?\u201d Ky\u2019s little chest puffed up. \u201cPretty soon I\u2019ll be able to make it all the way to the door.\u201d He scampered out.</p><p>Before AJ could comment, Cord\u2019s mouth was on hers for a deep kiss. He broke away and smiled. \u201cGood mornin\u2019. And before you worry about my son catchin\u2019 us in bed, let me say it ain\u2019t the end of the world.\u201d He nuzzled her neck. \u201cMakes me think maybe we oughta go public with this. Maybe we oughta get...married.\u201d</p><p>A whack upside the head couldn\u2019t have stunned her more than a marriage proposal.</p><p>From Cord McKay. First thing in the morning.</p><p>\u201cWhat say we get hitched? We\u2019re compatible\u2014in bed and out. You know what it takes to be a rancher\u2019s wife. You like my kid and he adores you. You\u2019d be a great mother to him and any other kids we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I have all my teeth and I can cook, too,\u201d AJ snapped and jumped out of bed to scramble for her clothes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a goddamn broodmare, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Maybe the reasons don\u2019t sound romantic, but why ain\u2019t it a good idea? You love it here. This could be your new home. You already know the land and my family.</p><p>You could stay right here and you wouldn\u2019t have to go back to Denver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave to go? I want to go to Denver. I want to finish school because it is the single thing in my life I\u2019m doing for myself and no one else.\u201d She yanked on her jeans. In the last few weeks Cord hadn\u2019t listened to a damn thing she\u2019d said. He wanted her simply because...she suited him.</p><p>At one time that might\u2019ve been enough for her, but not now. Marriage should start with a declaration of I-love-you-and-can\u2019t-live-without-you. Period. It didn\u2019t make her childish to expect love, not compatibility, as a reason to spend her life with him; it just made his reasons emotionless and selfish.</p><p>\u201cAJ, listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>She whirled around. \u201cDo you love me, Cord? Is that why you\u2019re hinting you\u2019d like my boots under your bed every night?\u201d</p><p>Cord averted his eyes. \u201cThere are more important things in a relationship than love.\u201d</p><p>Not for me there isn\u2019t.</p><p>The front door slammed and voices echoed in the foyer. Before either of them knew what the ruckus was about, footsteps pounded up the stairs. The bedroom door was flung open and Carolyn McKay raced in, Carson and Ky on her heels.</p><p>Carolyn threw her arms around AJ. \u201cThank God. Oh, thank God you\u2019re okay, Amy Jo. We thought...\u201d</p><p>AJ couldn\u2019t breathe, Carolyn was squeezing her so tight.</p><p>Ky announced, \u201cAmy Jo had an overnight with Daddy, Gran-gran.\u201d</p><p>Cord groaned. Carson cleared his throat. AJ felt her cheeks flame.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Real good that she was here and not there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere? What is going on?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn eased back and tucked a strand of hair behind AJ\u2019s ear. \u201cSweetheart, I don\u2019t know how to tell you this.\u201d</p><p>All the blood drained from her face. \u201cDid something happen to my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but your house caught fire and burned to the ground.\u201d</p><p>AJ stared, in utter shock. \u201cWhat? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout two hours ago, near as they can figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows. It went so fast the volunteer firefighters didn\u2019t get there in time to save anything. And we thought you were inside...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I realized your Jeep wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWe called Keely when we couldn\u2019t get you on your cell and she told us to check here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house burned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, honey, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t appear to be. Didn\u2019t spread to the barn or any of the outbuildings so they\u2019re assumin\u2019 it was just somethin\u2019 in the house that somehow ignited.\u201d</p><p>AJ nodded numbly. \u201cI know Ma told you we\u2019d been having problems with both the propane and the old coal furnace. Some of the wiring was kinda iffy too. I can\u2019t believe it. If I would\u2019ve been there, maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it, don\u2019t even think it, AJ,\u201d Cord snapped.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault. Sweetheart, we\u2019re just so glad you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut everything else was. All our family pictures and furniture and the movers were supposed to come and get it all tomorrow...\u201d Tears broke free like a dam breach.</p><p>Carolyn wrapped an arm around her shoulder and led her from the room. She offered to make coffee; all AJ wanted was to see the wreckage that used to be her home. Alone.</p><p>But Carolyn insisted on coming along.</p><p>Pumper-trucks and pickups filled the yard. When AJ caught the glimpse of the smoking pile of rubble, she covered her face and sobbed. The only thing that remained was the foundation and the cement walkway.</p><p>Poof. Everything gone. Carolyn held her while she cried. She stayed close when AJ</p><p>called her mother and her sister, and the insurance agent. Luckily they\u2019d kept the house insured until the final step of the deed transfer, which wouldn\u2019t be for another couple days.</p><p>Hours passed before the firefighters declared the last embers out. It was late afternoon and she was alone with her scattered thoughts, lost in the smell of smoke, guilt and tears. Carolyn had saddled up Lucy and rode her to the McKay homestead, promising to take care of her horse until AJ was settled. Wherever and whenever that might be.</p><p>AJ wondered if she\u2019d ever feel settled again. Not only had she lost her home, she\u2019d lost decades worth of family history. She literally had nothing but the clothes on her back.</p><p>She knew things could be replaced. She knew she was lucky to be alive. She knew it, yet, she mourned. And dammit, she figured she had a right to it.</p><p>Cord\u2019s big truck rumbled up the driveway. With all that\u2019d happened she\u2019d completely forgotten their early morning conversation. AJ hoped Ky was with him because he wouldn\u2019t speak so freely about future plans with his son around.</p><p>But Cord was alone and he didn\u2019t get out of his truck for the longest time, he just stared at the debris pile. When he climbed out, he ambled straight to her and enclosed her in his big strong arms.</p><p>Why did he feel like home?</p><p>Wishful thinking.</p><p>She allowed his comfort and managed not to cry. Finally she untangled herself from him. \u201cIt\u2019s probably better it burned now, rather than after Carter and Macie moved in with their sweet little baby, none of them suspecting what horrors were awaiting them in this old crappy house. I couldn\u2019t live with myself if it would\u2019ve happened to them.\u201d AJ </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>walked away to try a sense of balance.</p><p>Cord chased her down. \u201cYou\u2019re damn lucky it didn\u2019t happen to you and you weren\u2019t here last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if I had been I could\u2019ve saved something. Picture albums. Letters. My great grandmother\u2019s tatting. Anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGoddammit, AJ. Look at me.\u201d He grabbed her arm. \u201cNone of that shit is more important than your life.\u201d</p><p>She jerked back. \u201cEasy for you to say. You have everything in your life that I just lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten what I said this morning? I offered you everything I have.\u201d</p><p>Everything except love.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2014\u201d he gestured to the rubble behind them, \u201c\u2014is gone. It sucks. I\u2019m sorry. But now you can move on.\u201d His jaw tightened. \u201cNow you can move in with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMove on? Just like that? Forget about everything in my life going up in flames and move in with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to take care of you, baby doll. What don\u2019t you understand about that?\u201d</p><p>AJ looked him dead in the eye. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to take care of me, Cord McKay, because I\u2019ve been taking care of myself my whole life. All I ever wanted was for you to love me. Just love me. What don\u2019t you understand about that?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond\u2014he actually looked a little sick to his stomach. At the prospect of loving her?</p><p>Enough. She\u2019d had enough heartache to last a lifetime. \u201cGoodbye Cord.\u201d</p><p>She climbed in her car and didn\u2019t look back. There was nothing here for her anymore.</p> <p>Chapter Thirty-two</p><p>Don\u2019t let her go. Jump in your truck and chase her down.</p><p>AJ left him. Just like Marla had.</p><p>She would\u2019ve stayed if you\u2019d had the balls to tell her the truth.</p><p>What truth? That he nearly went out of his freakin\u2019 mind because she could\u2019ve died last night? When he wanted to hold her up she preferred his mother\u2019s comfort and company to his? That she handled everything by herself again, when he\u2019d offered to fix it for her, and added insult to injury by tossing his offer back in his face?</p><p>What did you offer her?</p><p>What she needs.</p><p>No. You offered her what you need. You don\u2019t even know what she needs.</p> <p>Me. She needs me. Why won\u2019t she admit it?</p><p>Dammit. He hadn\u2019t planned to handle it this way. He\u2019d imagined approaching her about them getting hitched over a nice romantic dinner. Between Ky\u2019s questions, ranch business\u2014including Kade volunteering to head the cattle experiment up in the northeast section over the next few months\u2014and his mother\u2019s constant cell phone updates about Colt, he hadn\u2019t had a chance to consider an approach about how he\u2019d convince AJ to accept his proposal for her own good.</p><p>Now it didn\u2019t matter because she was gone for good.</p><p>Two weeks later...</p><p>Cord was on edge, snappy with Ky, his dad, his mom, Colby and his cousins.</p><p>Seemed everyone was avoiding him and leaving him to his own devices.</p><p>Alone in his own damn house again. He paced to the kitchen for a beer to ease his frustration when he noticed the sinkful of dirty dishes. Dammit. Why did crusted eggs remind him of AJ? Why did everything remind him of her? Fuck it. He headed to the porch and his dad\u2019s truck parked in the driveway.</p><p>Ky hopped out of the cab, followed by Cord\u2019s mother and Keely.</p><p>What was Keely doing here?</p><p>His son bounded up the steps and Cord caught him in a one-handed hug. \u201cHey, where you goin\u2019, slick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought if I ran by you really fast you wouldn\u2019t have no time to yell at me.\u201d</p><p>Cord froze. \u201cWhat? Why would I yell at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou been kinda grouchy lately. Aunt Keely says it\u2019s \u2019cause you got your head up your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyler! You weren\u2019t supposed to repeat that.\u201d</p><p>Ky grinned and ran in the house.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were gonna be around to corrupt my son, Aunt Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on break and have a couple of things to take care of before I go back.\u201d</p><p>He wondered if AJ was on break too. He sipped his beer.</p><p>Keely sighed. \u201cSee, Ma? I told you. He\u2019s the most stubborn of all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Just like his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d I do? Why you gangin\u2019 up on me?\u201d</p><p>His little sister teetered on the tips of her boots and stuck her nose right in his business. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask the damn question I see in your eyes, Cord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Why ain\u2019t she returnin\u2019 my calls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a clueless asshole who doesn\u2019t deserve her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely West McKay,\u201d Carolyn said sharply, \u201cthat isn\u2019t helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. She\u2019s mooned around you for years\u2014years! Why? She\u2019s shouldered more responsibilities than anyone should, which is probably why she was so drawn to you in the first place, Mr. Large and In Charge\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, back up. Whatya mean mooned around me for years? She\u2019s twenty-two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has some crazy notion she\u2019s been in love with you since she was five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he breathed, but the truth pummeled him from every direction as the things AJ</p><p>said came rushing back.</p><p>Because I\u2019m definitely smitten with you.</p><p>I\u2019ve had a crush on you for so long.</p><p>You\u2019ve been my fantasy man since that day all those years ago.</p><p>Keely\u2019s eyes burned with anger and tears. \u201cYou think it\u2019s a coincidence she was untouched? No. AJ saved her virginity for you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so glad I waited. Waited for you to be ready for me.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was stupid, I still do. I tried to talk her out of waiting because I didn\u2019t think you could love her like she\u2019s dreamed of her whole life.\u201d</p><p>Just like this. Love me like this, slow and easy and for a long time. Make it last forever.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the closest thing I have to a sister and I hate that my brother is just like every other man\u2014taking what\u2019s offered and giving nothing in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord West McKay. Is that true?\u201d his mother demanded.</p><p>Cord\u2019s cheeks grew hot. Partially because his mother was listening to the conversation; partially because he felt the need to defend himself. Keely was dead wrong.</p><p>\u201cShe came to me. So don\u2019t you go blamin\u2019 me for nothin\u2019. I offered to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you were doing her a favor,\u201d Keely snapped. \u201cLike she was just one of the fringe benefits of taking over the Foster ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I care about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare? Jesus, Cord. You care about horses, and cattle, and the ranch. If you care about a person, you tell them you love them. Hell, you shout it from the rooftops.\u201d</p><p>All I wanted was for you to love me. Just love me.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you done that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Keely said. \u201cAJ deserves better than you. Why should she have to be the one to convince you she\u2019s worthy of you? You oughta be on your knees proving that you\u2019re worthy of her. Instead, you\u2019re here glaring at me, acting as pigheaded as every other man in this testosterone-laden family.\u201d Keely opened her cell phone and whirled away.</p><p>He snagged Keely\u2019s elbow. \u201cWhat do you want me to say? I nearly lost my fuckin\u2019 mind when I realized no one in my entire family knew what she\u2019d been through all those years to keep that goddamn ranch when she was merely a girl? That I nearly wept with fear when I considered I could\u2019ve lost her forever if she hadn\u2019t been in my bed the night her house caught fire?</p><p>\u201cShould I tell her that I can\u2019t sleep, I can\u2019t eat and I miss talkin\u2019 to her? Or just sittin\u2019 with her? That I miss the secret way she smiles at me? That I constantly think about the way she smells, the taste of her mouth, the feel of her skin, and the sound of her laughter?</p><p>\u201cThat she\u2019s the only woman I\u2019ve ever met who gets everything about me? My moods, my needs, my ties to the land? She sees the beauty in a patch of weeds out in the middle of nowhere Wyoming? That I love she can saddle and ride a horse faster than me?</p><p>That she ain\u2019t as shy as she pretends? That she doesn\u2019t mind muckin\u2019 out stalls? And checkin\u2019 cattle?</p><p>\u201cShe loves sunsets and bakin\u2019 cookies and holdin\u2019 babies and two-steppin\u2019 and all that corny country shit? She loves my son, and how was I supposed to tell her how much I love her, when I was scared to death she\u2019d leave me\u2014and then that\u2019s exactly what she did anyway?\u201d</p><p>He was breathing hard and damn near tears. \u201cYou tell me how I\u2019m supposed to deal with that, Keely, \u2019cause I sure as hell don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>The sudden silence was like more salt in his wound.</p><p>\u201cYou stupid jerk. You really do love her.\u201d Keely all-but tackled him in a bear hug.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she ain\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she will be if you give her a reason to come back.\u201d She tipped her head back and stared into his eyes. \u201cYou do realize how important it is for AJ to finish school? For herself? There\u2019s so little she\u2019s done for herself, like you, everything she\u2019s done has been for her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I didn\u2019t understand. Guess maybe I thought school was a whim\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014like marrying a Wyoming rancher and hightailing it back to the big city when it didn\u2019t work out? AJ is not Marla. But you will lose her if you don\u2019t take the first step this time. She gave you her trust, it\u2019s time for you to give her yours and toss in your heart to up the ante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to do that?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn snorted.</p><p>Cord\u2019s and Keely\u2019s eyes swiveled her direction.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask your father? He\u2019s had to grovel a time or two hundred. He\u2019s got lots of pointers.\u201d Her smile faded. \u201cBut if you really want to show Amy Jo she matters to you? Prove you listened to her thoughts and opinions, hopes and dreams over pillow talk or during dinner or while you were cleaning the barn. She gave you the map to her heart, son, you just gotta learn to read it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A gust of wind rattled the chimes on the porch, breaking the lingering silence.</p><p>Cord smiled and let the sage-scented breeze soothe his troubled mind. He could do this. He had to do this. \u201cA map, huh? I can work with that.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-three</p> <p>Four weeks later...</p><p>AJ was dragging butt after a long day of classes. She waited for the elevator, clenching and unclenching her fists. Her hands hurt. Had she given everyone in the free world a massage this week?</p><p>The apartment she shared with Keely was dead quiet. AJ let out a sigh of relief. As much as she loved her roommate, she needed some down time. Keely was a whirlwind of activity. When she wasn\u2019t studying or working she had to be out doing things and she demanded AJ come along for the ride.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t taken long for AJ to get back into the swing of school. Between the three extra classes and finishing an extra work-study course in four days, she was still on track to graduate right before Christmas.</p><p>Not that she had a clue what she\u2019d do once she received the diploma. As much as she loved her mom and sister, she\u2019d rather live in Denver than Billings. She\u2019d filled out the paperwork for the Wyoming economic development\u2019s no-interest loan, an initiative for opening her own studio in Sundance, but she wouldn\u2019t have the final word on whether she\u2019d received it until after the first of the year.</p> <p>Every week different businesses would come to the college to recruit students. AJ</p><p>could probably pick and choose where she wanted to work\u2014but none of the health care companies were in Wyoming. Where her heart was.</p><p>Her weary head fell into the couch cushions. For the first two weeks after her house burned down and she\u2019d returned to Denver, Cord called her every day. Sometimes twice a day. She never picked up. The messages weren\u2019t sweet and loving, but terse. Typical.</p><p>Then he\u2019d stopped calling altogether.</p><p>AJ knew things were crazy at the McKay ranch. Colt had returned home after a month-long stint in rehab. Channing\u2019s pregnancy wasn\u2019t going smoothly and the doc put her on partial bed rest, which worried Colby. Carter postponed his art show to help out on the ranch since Kade was gone for the whole winter. Quinn and Bennett pitched in.</p><p>Macie ran into major remodeling snags with the diner, which required her constant on-site supervision.</p> <p>And Cord...well, evidently Cord was the glue that held it all together.</p><p>So who held him together?</p><p>No one. She had no doubt Cord worked all day, came home and cared for his son, and fell into bed exhausted and alone every night.</p><p>Which made her heart hurt. AJ hadn\u2019t stopped loving him, she was pretty sure if Cord could love any woman, it would be her. She wondered fifteen times every day if she\u2019d done the right thing in walking away from him, when he\u2019d offered her exactly what she\u2019d wanted from him.</p><p>Wrong. You wanted his love. You didn\u2019t get that.</p><p>Two loud raps on the metal door startled her. She stood and looked out the peephole.</p><p>A deliveryman. With flowers.</p><p>The safety chain clicked. \u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFlower delivery.\u201d</p><p>Great. More flowers for Keely from one of her many admirers. Still she knew to ask before she opened the door. \u201cWho\u2019re the flowers for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ Foster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she squealed and flung open the door. She\u2019d never gotten flowers before.</p><p>Ever. She took the bouquet to the table to rip open the card: AJ\u2014Close as I could get to Wyoming wildflowers. Hope it reminds you of home. I miss you. Cord Her mouth hung open. Cord had sent her flowers? She peered at the small purple daisies and the big yellow mums and the thick greenish-yellow stem which sort of resembled goldenrod. And the tiny white baby\u2019s breath, which reminded her of cow parsnip. She sniffed. Yep. He\u2019d even had the florist use sage as the greenery. She grinned. Probably cost him an arm and a leg for that extra touch. Still, his sweetness touched her.</p><p>The next week Cord sent her two tickets to the Big and Rich concert at the Pepsi center. Shocked her he\u2019d remembered they were her favorite band. She dragged Keely along and bought a \u201cSave A Horse (Ride A Cowboy)\u201d concert T-shirt and wore it to bed instead of his T-shirt she\u2019d ended up with after the fire.</p><p>The following week a plain brown box arrived with FRAGILE stamped all over the outside. AJ opened it to find dozens of peanut butter kisses cookies. The note read: Ky helped make these. Not as good as your sweet kisses, baby doll. Think of me while you\u2019re eating these and studying...Love\u2014CWM.</p><p>Oh man. The man was trying. Really trying.</p><p>Less than a week later, she received a box with the silver boots she\u2019d forgotten in his front closet\u2014along with a new ballcap that that read: You Gonna Cowgirl Up and Ride? Or Lay There and Bleed?</p><p>No note. She wondered if the hat was a challenge.</p><p>Only two days passed before his next gift arrived via her cell phone. A streaming video of her horse running alongside Nickel and Jester and Ky\u2019s pony, Plug, in the frost-covered field behind Cord\u2019s barn. Then a close up of Lucy from the star on her nose to the tip of her long chestnut tail, the gorgeous autumn sunset as the backdrop, with Cord\u2019s husky voice in the background. \u201cShe looks happy here, huh? Ky and I are takin\u2019 good care of her until you come back. I think Jester\u2019s got a thing for that stubborn mare. I know the feelin\u2019. Quit bein\u2019 stubborn and call me, baby doll. I miss you somethin\u2019 fierce.\u201d The screen went blank.</p><p>AJ could scarcely see it through her tears. She hit redial and held her breath when Cord answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cAJ? Is that really you?\u201d</p><p>She sniffled and nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I am now. \u201cAh. Yeah. Thanks for the video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the tickets. The concert was awesome even if Keely got a little out of hand.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t need the details on that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the flowers, too. They were so...\u201d She started to cry.</p><p>\u201cHey, now. No tears. I\u2019ve been waitin\u2019 to hear from you for two and a half damn months and it\u2019ll bust my heart even more if you\u2019re sobbin\u2019 on the line the whole time. I can\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Pause. He sighed. \u201cPlease, tell me everything you\u2019ve been doin\u2019. Don\u2019t leave nothin\u2019 out.\u201d</p><p>So AJ talked, half-afraid the conversation would be hopelessly one-sided, but Cord seemed eager to chat. An hour passed. Reluctantly, AJ said, \u201cI have homework to finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I call you again? Same time tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI have somethin\u2019 to say. I wish I could say it to your sweet face, but I ain\u2019t about to let the opportunity pass me by again. When you asked me if I loved you, I should\u2019ve manned up. I didn\u2019t. I was a chickenshit, plain and simple. The truth is, I do love you, AJ. More\u2019n you can possibly imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish while I still got the guts to do so. The last time I told a woman I loved her? She left me. So in my screwed up way of thinkin\u2019, I thought if I didn\u2019t tell you, you wouldn\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>AJ was glad she was sitting down because she was light-headed and weak-kneed.</p><p>\u201cYou left anyway. I understand now that even if I woulda told you how I felt, you still woulda left\u2014and your leavin\u2019 had nothin\u2019 to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Our partin\u2019 coulda been a lot sweeter, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you telling me how you feel is pretty sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you ain\u2019t seen sweet, baby doll. Not by half.\u201d</p><p>She smiled even when her belly did a little flip.</p><p>\u201cTalk atcha tomorrow. Think of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Cord hung up.</p><p>AJ snapped the phone shut after she watched the video again.</p><p>They\u2019d take this one day at a time. Might not be the fairy-tale ending she\u2019d envisioned, but it was a start.</p><p>For the next two months Cord wooed AJ over the phone.</p><p>Once a week he sent her a package. Sometimes the items were funny, like a miniature windup dancing horse he\u2019d picked up at the farm supply store. Or sweet, like a silvery camisole that he claimed matched her eyes. Or thoughtful, like a pair of flannel pajamas because he knew she was always cold. Or raunchy, like the fur-lined adult novelty handcuffs.</p><p>No matter what he sent, he included a hand-written note with the words I LOVE</p><p>YOU written in all caps and underlined. Heavily underlined. Ky frequently contributed a drawing to the weekly mailing, in addition to demanding to talk to her at every opportunity.</p><p>If she thought she\u2019d loved Cord before, it was nothing compared to the way she felt about him now.</p><p>AJ looked at the clock and smoothed the wrinkles from her denim skirt. Cord would be here any minute. Lord. They hadn\u2019t seen each other in over four months. Longest four months of her life. And yet, getting to know Cord on a non-physical level gave her a whole bunch more to appreciate about him.</p><p>She\u2019d taken her last test and was officially a certified massage therapist. Seemed weird not to have a graduation ceremony. Seemed even weirder not to have a plan firmly in place about her future. She just hoped Cord was in it.</p><p>Three knocks sent her scurrying to the door. She flung herself into Cord\u2019s arms the second he stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cOh God. You\u2019re here. You\u2019re really here.\u201d</p><p>Cord kicked the door shut and just held her. He tipped her face back to look into her eyes. \u201cBefore I kiss you, before I touch you, let me say this: I love you. Sweet baby Jesus. I love you so damn much.\u201d He kissed her with a mix of tenderness and passion that had tears springing to her eyes.</p><p>When she broke away, she whispered, \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen marry me, AJ. Not because we\u2019re compatible, or because you are a born ranch woman, or because you\u2019d make a good mother. Marry me for me. Marry me because I\u2019m a selfish bastard and I want you to be mine forever. Marry me because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll survive the rest of my life without havin\u2019 you by my side every damn day. Please say yes, baby doll. Make your home with me. With us. Make me the luckiest man in the world.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Cord kissed her again.</p><p>All the need and hunger that\u2019d been dormant inside her ignited like a brush fire. She tugged him toward her bedroom.</p> <p>He gently dug his bootheels into the carpet. \u201cNuh-uh. No hanky-panky until you\u2019re wearin\u2019 my ring and you\u2019re my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have the swat now? I\u2019ll even take my skirt off. Shirt too.\u201d Her hands went to the buttons on her blouse.</p><p>\u201cAmy Jo. You ornery cuss. Keep them clothes on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI missed you. I want you. I don\u2019t wanna wait.\u201d She nipped his chin and scraped her teeth down his throat. \u201cBet I can getcha to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But we ain\u2019t got much time, so there\u2019s two things we hafta talk about first.\u201d He reached inside his suit coat pocket and removed an envelope. \u201cYour mama gave me this to give to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>AJ opened the letter and her heart caught at the familiar formal handwriting: Sweetheart-I\u2019m glad Cord finally knows the truth about what you did to keep our ranch going.</p><p>I\u2019m thrilled he\u2019s asked for permission to marry you and I know you\u2019ll be happy to be home in Sundance where you belong and with a man who loves you like crazy.</p> <p>You\u2019ve no idea the guilt your father and I felt about how you worked so hard and got nothing in return but more work. In hindsight, we knew what we did was wrong. There\u2019s no way to make up for the lost time now, except to offer you this check as \u201cback wages\u201d</p><p>and hope it eases the way for you to start your own business. You earned it. I\u2019m so proud of you for finishing school. I miss you. Bring your new hubby and son up for a visit after you get settled. Congratulations!</p><p>Love you, baby girl,</p><p>Mama</p><p>She glanced down, in utter disbelief, at the check for thirty-five thousand dollars. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Where did she get the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur buyout was very generous, AJ. But I had nothin\u2019 to do with this.\u201d He pointed to the check. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna argue that you earned it. You shouldn\u2019t argue either.\u201d</p><p>AJ\u2019s mind was already whirling. She could rent that storefront space in Sundance she\u2019d been eyeing. Heck, she had money to renovate even if the loan from the state didn\u2019t come through. She looked up at Cord. \u201cDo you know if that space in the Sandstone Building next to Macie\u2019s restaurant is still up for grabs?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAfraid not. It\u2019s spoken for.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>Cord put a finger under her chin. \u201cBy you. I leased it in your name, AJ, last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Did you know Mama was gonna give me this money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I know you. I have faith in you. I know how good you are at givin\u2019 massages and so will everyone else in the county. Even if you wouldn\u2019t have gotten this unexpected windfall, I figure the state of Wyoming ain\u2019t dumb enough not to fund your business. I didn\u2019t want you to miss out on the space you\u2019d set your heart on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You did it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t do for you.\u201d Just as he bent down to kiss her, the door opened and Keely and Colt burst in.</p><p>\u201cDid she say yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she said yes. The woman\u2019s been in love with me since she was five.\u201d He whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of catchin\u2019 up to do.\u201d</p><p>Keely squealed and AJ smacked Cord in the arm before Keely squeezed her tight.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re really gonna be sisters now. This is so cool! So, you guys ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>Cord cursed.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told her?\u201d Colt grinned. \u201cTypical.\u201d</p><p>He sauntered over and hugged AJ. \u201cWelcome to the family. I\u2019m gonna enjoy teasin\u2019 my bro about bein\u2019 a cradle robber for a long time to come.\u201d</p><p>AJ looked at Colt. He looked fit and healthy, even when a sense of wariness surrounded him that hadn\u2019t been there before. She whirled back around and faced her intended. \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we\u2019re goin\u2019 to Vegas. Tonight. To get married. Thought I\u2019d surprise you. Colt and Keely are standin\u2019 up for us.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, stunned.</p><p>Which caused him to babble. \u201cCome on, baby doll. I love you. You love me. I don\u2019t wanna wait. You told me when we talked about gettin\u2019 married on the phone the past coupla weeks that you didn\u2019t want a big weddin\u2019 ceremony. Colt and I got three days before we\u2019re needed at home. Keely said she\u2019d kill me if she didn\u2019t get to see us tie the knot. Ky\u2019s stayin\u2019 with my folks, though it\u2019s makin\u2019 him mighty antsy waitin\u2019 for us to come home. I thought we could get hitched, and spend the night in the honeymoon suite of a swanky hotel. Then we\u2019d come back here, pack your stuff and you could come home with me for good.\u201d</p><p>She continued to stare at him.</p><p>\u201cAh, hell. Are you mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just trying to wrap my head around the word home and you in the same sentence.\u201d</p><p>Cord\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cSame thing, in my opinion.\u201d</p><p>She melted. The feeling of rightness, of inevitability, flowed over as sweetly as it had when she\u2019d been a young girl.
