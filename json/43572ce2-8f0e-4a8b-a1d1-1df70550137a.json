He had controlled his sexuality, his desires,his automatic attraction to the beauty of the female form. He had withstood their drugs that were designed to make his cock hard and make the sexual training go smoother for the females and the scientists. He had achieved no erections to satisfy any of them. He had no desire, either physically or mentally, sober or drugged, until he saw her. Until the day they introduced the new Lab Tech. She was young. As small and delicate as anything he had ever seen. Her long, dark blonde hair was like a fall of silk down her back, her large brown eyes watching the cells warily, as thoughafraid ravening beasts would attempt to escape at any moment.</p> <p>Her reaction had amused him at first.As the year went by it grated on his conscience, on his emotions. And he couldn\u2019t stop watching her, couldn\u2019t stop wishing. But he knew the path of revealing such emotions. And as time went by, his rage grew. His anger toward the scientists, the guards, the lives they were forced to live, festered inside him.</p><p>The animal in him howled out in fury. The need to survive, to fight for another day, was like a demon ripping at his defiance of the drugs and the tests. But something more primal, some knowledge so basic and ingrained he could not fathom its source, warned him of the dangers to come.Warned him of the threat one woman represented.</p><p>He watched her secretly as the new drug coursed through his system that day.Their new aphrodisiac. It was a powerful one this time, taking all his concentration to fight to keep his erection down. Inside he howled in fury. The confinement was bad enough, the constant training to kill; the drugs and experiments were weighing on them all, but even worse was the fury beginning to fill him. It was even harder to control than the drugs, or his desire for this one woman.</p><p>That anger was becoming such a part of his soul that there were times Aiden feared it himself. That anger could become a threat to the entire Pack. If he dared to strike out at a guard or one of the inhuman scientists, then the punishment would fall not just on his head, but on the entirePack . And that thought he found more frightening than any other.</p><p>As the anger had grown inside him, he noticed that Charity watched him more often. After more than a year in the Labs she had grown more comfortable with the Breeds. She talked to his sister, Faith. Laughing over whatever girlish things she could fill Faith\u2019s head with. As though his sister needed to find hope in this dismal life they led. Unless they found a way to escape, they would all eventually die. If not on one of the perverse missions they were sent on, then by the simple means of their guards\u2019 bullets. It had happened before, he was certain it would happen again.</p> <p>\u201cAiden?\u201dShe approached his cell warily now, her dark eyes worried, her expression somber. \u201cDr. Bainesmith wants you to service the woman soon.\u201d</p><p>Compassion and something more glittered in her eyes. Hegrowled, a low sound of warning that had her flinching as she bit her lip nervously. He couldn\u2019t contain his rage this time. He wanted this woman, wanted her above all things, and he could not betray that basic, inherent desire to touch none but her. And he feared for her if he did touch her. How would he maintain his control? Death was preferable to this endless maze of wakening emotion and hopeless weakness.</p><p>\u201cAiden, she will have you killed,\u201d she whispered imperatively. \u201cFaith will be alone then.\u201d</p><p>The soft sound of her voice was destructive. Like summer\u2019s heat it stroked over his senses. His cock rippled with the need to lengthen. He bared his teeth, raising his head enough that she could see the savagery of his expression past the long fall of his hair.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t watching his face. Her gaze was trained on his cock. His fickle flesh twitched, but remained limber. He bared his teeth in a silent snarl of warning. Her gaze rose to him slowly, and he saw the knowledge in her eyes. She knew it was he controlling his erection, not the impotence the others believed afflicted him. But there was none of the fear she should have felt.</p><p>\u201cAiden, you can\u2019t die,\u201d she whispered, glancing over her shoulder to be certain they were alone.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t continue to defy them this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may play lap dog all you wish,\u201d he bit out coldly. \u201cI will not breed for these bastards.\u201d</p><p>Something flashed in her eyes then. Her lips thinned, as though there were something she needed to say, something to reassure him. She held it back with a quick shake of her head.</p><p>\u201cThis is not a good day to die,\u201d she hissed quietly. \u201cSave it for something important.\u201d</p><p>The flash of stubbornness in her gaze, in her expression, intrigued him. He had never seen the silent steel that flashed there before.As though some inner core of strength sustained her. He envied her that stubbornness.</p><p>\u201cOne less Breed for them to torture,\u201d he sneered back at her, hating her concern, her compassion. Hating his need for her and what he must now do to protect not just his Pack, but her as well. \u201cWhy do you come to me this way, girl? I could rip you apart with my bare hands. Come, enter my lair, and I\u2019ll prove this to you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darkened, first with fear and then with a strange glimmer of defiance. And his cock twitched again. He wanted her.Needed her as he needed nothing else in his life, and there laid his destruction. To take her would be to give them what he knew they wanted. If he released his control to take another, then he knew he would never find it again. He would know no peace, no ease until he had Charity beneath him, his cock buried so deep inside her he would share her soul. And in doing so he would destroy them both. It was better to choosehis own death rather than the destruction of his soul.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you die,\u201d she bit out. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re doing here, Aiden.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFucking their little brood mare won\u2019t keep me alive. I was born to die, Charity. We all were.Some just sooner than others.\u201d He wished she would leave him. Turn and walk away, and allow him to face his fate with the strength his pride demanded.</p><p>Frustration flashed in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCharity, is he ready?\u201d Bainesmith drew their gazes to the other side of the lab where a gurney was being wheeled in.</p><p>Aiden\u2019s body tightened as the scent of arousal, strong and drug-induced, reached his nostrils. He grimaced at the scent. It overpowered the faint, fresh scent of Charity\u2019s earthy response to him, sickening him with its smell.</p><p>The woman was strapped to the bed, her legs raised and spread, held into the metal stirrups that had</p><p>been unfolded. It was a disgusting display, sickening his soul. The soldiers that accompanied the perverse doctor moved to his cell door as Charity backed away. Aiden didn\u2019t give them the satisfaction of fighting them. He rose to his feet and waited patiently. Every muscle in his body demandedaction, demanded that he fight. He controlled it as easily as he did his arousal.</p><p>He watched broodingly as Bainesmith, her under-scientists, guards and technicians approached his cell slowly. All eyes focused on his thighs and the limp cock that hung there.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard still hasn\u2019t achieved an erection.\u201d Bainesmith was coldly furious as she turned to the scientist that accompanied her. \u201cYou assured me it would work this time.\u201d</p><p>The aging doctor shook his head, perplexed. Dr. Agullera was as perverted and depraved as any human Aiden had heard tell of. The man deserved a painful, bloody death.Right after Bainesmith\u2019s, of course.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps impotence is his problem, and not merely defiance, Dr. Bainesmith. I warned you this could be the case.\u201d His lofty superior tone set Aiden\u2019s teeth on edge. The cell door opened slowly as the guards awaited him, weapons held ready as they watched him warily. He contained his triumphant smile. He would die, but he would die knowing they feared him. Aiden stepped from the cell, aware of the fate awaiting him. Bainesmith had made the promise to him when the drug was injected. The experiments into breeding were imperative for some reason. If he couldn\u2019t fuck, then he wouldn\u2019t live. He watched the doctor\u2019s eyes narrow, and cursed her with an inborn fury he prayed would live after his death.</p><p>\u201cYou were a perfect specimen,\u201d Bainesmith sighed in regret. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad, Aiden. I won\u2019t enjoy killing you, I would have much preferred fucking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden, don\u2019t let them do this.\u201d Wolfe\u2019s voice echoed from the adjoining cell as he heard Faith cry out in fear. \u201cDammit, I order you not to allow this.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t glance at either of them. Today, despite Charity\u2019s belief, was as good a day as any to die.</p><p>\u201cTake him to the other room,\u201d Bainesmith sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with him there.\u201d</p><p>He heard the resignation in her voice. He didn\u2019t fight the guards; he allowed them to push him forward and walked voluntarily to the room of death. They all knew what the room was for. You entered there, you didn\u2019t come out.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Charity turned to the doctor. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill him, Delia.\u201d</p><p>Her familiarity with the doctor surprised him. She spoke to her with the ease of a long association. A tone to her voice that demanded, expected to be heard without censure. Silence filled the Lab as all eyes turned to her. Aiden watched her broodingly, daring her to go further.</p><p>\u201cCharity, the animal is of no use to us,\u201d Bainesmith bit out, her expression creasing into a frown. \u201cEven the drugs don\u2019t work on him. He is not a dependable specimen.\u201d</p><p>Fear flashed in Charity\u2019s eyes. She was pale now, her gaze going between him and Bainesmith.</p><p>\u201cBut he is.\u201d She sounded frantic now. \u201cThe stimulation is wrong. He\u2019s disgusted by those women...he can\u2019t help that. He\u2019s not being properly stimulated.\u201d</p><p>Aiden\u2019s stomach dropped as fear flashed hard and heavy in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>\u201cI would love to fuck her, Charity,\u201d he snarled at her, vowing vengeance if she hindered his final escape.</p><p>\u201cThe equipment just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lying.\u201d She turned back to him, and he gritted his teeth at what he saw in her eyes. At that moment he began to pray. Pray that she had not realized his desire for her, his knowledge that he was but a step away from mating her and giving the bastards what they wanted. A child, a creature they believed would mold more easily than the original Breeds did. It was a knowledge he couldn\u2019t hide from himself, but he was determined to hide it from the bastards who had created him. If he revealed his ability to fuck, then it would only be a matter of time before they attempted to match him with a woman he could not deny.Just as they were attempting to match Wolfe, based on his uncontrolled response to Bainesmith\u2019s young daughter.The same with his sister, Faith, and his Packmate, Jacob. Tomorrow Faith was scheduled to be drugged and taken to the other man. The thought of that, as well, was unbearable.</p><p>There was no privacy in the Labs. The sexual experiments were carried out before the eyes of all those held within the cells. He would be forced to listen to Faith\u2019s cries. Here the mating sounds and know it was destroying her.Just as Faith had been forced to listen to her Pack Leader and Jacob as they had taken the women brought to them. He couldn\u2019t imagine her or Charity seeing such a loss of control from him. The blow to his pride, to his soul, would be more than he could bear.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too soft for this job, Bainesmith.\u201d He smiled with a tight promise of retribution to the girl. \u201cYou should have gotten someone a bit harder. I bet she throws up when she sees blood.\u201d</p><p>He silently cursed as Bainesmith watched the girl with calculated interest.</p><p>\u201cCan you produce a response, Charity?\u201d she asked her coldly. God no.A shiver of dread worked over his spine. He looked at Charity, knowing in that moment she would destroy him.</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d Her voice was faint, fear trembling through the sound of it. Bainesmith\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cChain him to the crossbars. We\u2019ll see what she can do.\u201d</p><p>He fought them then. A roar of fury broke past his lips as the guards began to force him to the metal X </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>built on the other side of the room. He would be restrained, unable to move, unable to fight. If she touched him, if he smelled her arousal, it would all be over with. The weakness the aphrodisiac produced left him little strength to fight. Muscles were lethargic, lacking power; only his cock would have true strength. If she touched his cock, it would damned well explode in seconds.</p><p>Within minutes he was strapped to the crossbar. Arms and legs were buckled down, his waist held tight</p><p>to the center of the X, helpless. He howled in fury, the sound primal, enraged. There would be payment for this, he swore as he fought the straps. And it would begin with Charity.</p> <p>\u201cThere he is, Charity.\u201d Bainesmith waved a hand at his nude, bound body. \u201cGet him hard and he can live another day.\u201d</p><p>Charity approached him warily as he watched her with raw, unbridled fury. He snarled, the animalistic sound vibrating in his chest and throat as he bared the wicked canines at the side of mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t attempt it,\u201d he growled at her, ignoring her frightened expression, the wary set of her body.</p><p>\u201cTouch me, Charity, and I promise you will pay.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, her brown eyes somber, moist with emotion. That look speared into his soul and tightened his chest with emotions too unfamiliar to delve into.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you die.\u201d Her hand touched his hard abdomen. \u201cI can\u2019t, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>Her touch had his muscles clenching in pleasure. He growled at her again, his teeth snapping together in warning as her hand trailed lower.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you myself.\u201d She was going to go down on him. He saw the clear intent in her eyes and knew he was doomed.</p><p>If her soft mouth touched his cock he would not have the strength to fight her. Already his weakened flesh was stirring, overpowering his control, desperate to tempt her into touching it.</p><p>\u201cBut at least you\u2019ll live one more day,\u201d she whispered sadly. Her lips touched his abdomen. He felt the fire lick over his body, the desire that simmered in his blood flaming at the moist touch. His cock tingled, pleading to be free of his control. He gritted his teeth, fighting the lust surging through his loins.</p><p>\u201cJust one day,\u201d she whispered again against his skin. \u201cThat\u2019s all you need, Aiden, just one more day.\u201d</p> <p>She went to her knees, the wet heat of her mouth covering his cock as he roared out his fury. Her hand cupped his scrotum, messaging it as her tongue stroked over his flexing cock. He couldn\u2019t fight it. Oh God, her mouth was so good.Hot and tight. Her tongue was timid but felt like a whip of fire on his flesh. He felt his erection blooming. His body tightened as he fought it, but he couldn\u2019t fight the drug, and her sweet mouth. As though the moist depths were made for him alone, his cock hardened, lengthened, until she was forced to wrap her hands around the base, covering more than half of the shaft to keep him from strangling her as his hips suddenly bucked, burying the heated length into her mouth. His mind rioted, his body betraying him as deeply as Charity was. He felt his erection surging as the pleasure began to lick over his body. It was extreme, too intense to resist, too heated to fight any longer. He forgot the depraved scientists watching the act, forgot the soldiers and their perverse amusement. Without conscious control he began to fuck her suckling mouth. The restraints did little to hinder the movement of his hips, did nothing to stop his desperate thrusts into the heated warmth between her lips. He wanted to touch her. He wanted to stroke andcaress her. Years of pent up arousal, of hard won control shattered in that instance. He felt his cock convulse, her mouth tighten. His groan was a cry of</p><p>tortured pleasure as he felt his seed erupt from the tip.</p><p>He blasted into her mouth, his head thrown back, his strangled cry echoing around him as she suckled his seed from him. And still his cock tightened further, a swelling hidden by her hands that increased the ecstasy tearing through his body.</p><p>Her hands tightened around the sudden, almost fist sized knot that bloomed within the shaft. She stroked it, her tongue laving the pulsing head of his erection, drawing each violent burst of his semen into the heated depths of her mouth until he felt as though he would go insane from the need to fuck her tight cunt. It was over too soon, yet Aiden knew it had lasted too long. Her hands eased the hard knot but now nothing could ease the drug-induced arousal that filled his body. His cock was still engorged, so hard it hurt, and the need to fuck overcame any other need his mind held. He shuddered as she drew back then. Her lips moist, her gaze silently pleading for forgiveness as the cool air of the Lab replaced the wet heat of her mouth.</p><p>Aiden hung limply in the straps, his head lowered as he stared at her kneeling before him. Hatred welled within him, fury igniting every nerve ending in his body as he watched her lick the last remaining evidence of his seed from her mouth.</p><p>The betrayal was nearly more than he could bear. It pumped hard and fast through his body, searing nerve endings, tightening muscles. Yet, once stimulated, his cock now refused to return to its limber state, though the desperate swelling beneath her hand subsided. She had betrayed him. The reasons why did not matter.</p><p>\u201cYou will pay,\u201d he growled. \u201cSomehow, some way, you will pay.\u201d</p><p>Her sad little smile was only reinforced by the tears in her eyes. \u201cI already have, Aiden, in ways you will never know.\u201d</p> <p>And he promised himself, one day, she would pay by his hand.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Six years later</p><p>Breed Labs, South America</p><p>Escape. It was a litany within her head. The Labs were exploding around her, the mechanical countdown to the final explosion echoing around her with hollow gloom. The backup generators had finally failed;</p><p>releasing the lock to the cell she had spent the past months confined in. Charity paid little attention to her nakedness or the burning pain in the soles of her feet as she rushed across the metal floors. The mountain would collapse when the countdown finished, that she knew. She was on the wrong end of the underground compound to even pray for help. She had been kept isolated after she aided the Winged Breeds in their escape attempt.Placed as far away from them as possible in the hopes that should the others be rescued by their brothers, then she, at least, would remain. Chemicals exploded around her, broken electrical lines danced in a mad marionette as she rushed through the cavernous rooms. The adrenaline pumping through her system would only move the latest batch of drugs through her body that much quicker. She knew time was running out for her. When the full force of the artificial hormone hit her, she would be too weak, too helpless to protect or save herself. The air around her heated as the flames became more intense. She could feel her feet burning, blistering from the scalding metal beneath them, and pushed herself to run faster, harder. If she could just reach the escape tunnel in time, then she knew safety would only be moments away. The dim lighting from the battery-powered lamps guided her, the eerie red glow shedding at least partial illumination on the long corridors that led through the Breeding Labs. Yet the faster she ran, the closer the flames and the heat seemed to get.</p><p>She fought for breath, feeling the weakness invading her body, knowing that time was something she didn\u2019t have and sure as hell couldn\u2019t steal this time. A ragged scream born of fury escaped her throat. Surely her sacrifices wouldn\u2019t end in her own death, as she had always feared. She was so close, so close to freedom that she could taste it. Feel it.</p><p>Shegasped, hope blooming within her as she staggered through the marked exit. The floor was so hot she could feel the knifing pain searing through her ankles as it baked her flesh, but she could feel the cooling breeze on her face.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Aiden,\u201d she cried out the curse. She always cursed him when the fear overwhelmed her. It gave her strength, gave her purpose.</p><p>He had left her in those damned Labs six years before. Left her aching, needing as he escaped,hoping he would return for her. For years she had nursed that hope inside her. She had deceived the Council at every turn. Passed information, passed messages, fought for the tortured souls the bastardscreated, and prayed each day that some miracle would occur to halt the genetic experiments. But they never had. And each day she had prayed he would come for her. Until the prayers slowly stopped, the hope strangled away, and she gave up. She gave up, but her body remembered.</p><p>The remembrance he had left inside her had been her downfall.Her punishment. He had sworn she would pay, and she had paid in exacting measures over the years. In the last months, the payment had increased until she feared for her very sanity.</p><p>Tears streamed down her face, blurring her vision as she struggled through the last tunnel. The countdown was drawing closer to the final number, the final escape. It would be far easier, she thought distantly, to wait it out, to become another casualty to the desperate battle between science and its creations. But some part of her, some last shred of her survival instinct refused to let her surrender. She had to escape. She had to live. Though for what, she was no longer certain.</p><p>Finally, blessedly, the deserted opening to the mountain loomed ahead. The drugs were pumping harder through her body now, weakening her legs, sending pain radiating through her abdomen. She clutched her stomach, fighting to ignore the torturous reaction of her body to the chemicals as she burst through the opening and into the clear night air beyond.</p><p>Explosions blasted around her as she screamed out in shock, her hands covering her head as debris rained upon her. A blast of heated air threw her to the ground, but she couldn\u2019t stop. She half crawled, half ran to the protection she knew only the jungle could provide. And she kept running. The shelter of the trees cut even the fragile rays of the moon to the dimmest light, making it nearly impossible to see now. Despite the flames behind her, the inferno bursting through the night sky, here darkness reigned. Cool, soothing, the night air whispered around her, safe and sheltering as she pushed herself through the jungle, forcing her body to put as much distance as possible between her and the exploding Labs.</p><p>The soft dirt beneath her feet was like daggers through her flesh as she kept moving.Always moving. Escape.Safety. She had fought for years to escape and had been too terrified of what would happen to those she fought to save. She would die, she swore, before she allowed them to take her back this time. She was doomed now. They knew her secrets, knew the changes slowly occurring in her body. She was of little use to herself, and of no use to the Breeds she had tried to save for so long. She stumbled into the jungle, her vision faint now as the drugs filled her body. Pain was a brutal reminder that at least she still lived, though why she fought to do so had become the question of the year. She should have given up months ago, she thought sadly. The brutal testing should have killed her, not to mention the stress of blood loss, and the forced transfusions of blood her body no longer wanted to accept.</p><p>She fell to her knees. The pain from the abrupt landing merely blended in with the rest of the agony flaring through. She gasped for breath, whimpering as she struggled to keep moving, crying out as she fought the overriding paranoia that the drugs induced. The sounds of the jungle were too loud; the screech of a bird, the shuffle of the wildlife in the brush. Animals could smell blood. It brought out the scavengers and predators of the night looking for a handy meal. A sobbing laugh escaped her. She would be little more than a diseased snack to any creature unlucky enough to take a bite of her. But she also knew her scent, the smell of her tainted blood, would hold them back. Animals were often much smarter than their human enemies. She couldn\u2019t force herself back to her feet. The weakness of her body was too draining, and it took more strength than she now possessed, so she crawled instead. It eased the pain in her feet, though the fire raging in her womb only grew worse. The incision made in her abdomen that morning was bleeding again. They could never truly halt the bleeding once the drugs were injected inside her. She couldn\u2019t stop the pain, or the need. And in that need she whispered Aiden\u2019s name. When the drugs inside her reached their peak, she knew she screamed it out. Screamed and begged for ease, though none ever came. And the bastards who built on whatever Aiden had done to her so many years ago would only strap her to the metal bed, attach the probes to her body and make their little notes. She hoped they died. She hoped every one of them were in that fucking mountain when it collapsed. Buried in the waste oftheir own evil. A bark of hysterical laughter escaped her at that thought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSons of bitches,\u201d she gasped, fighting to pull herself through the dense undergrowth of the jungle. \u201cI hope they\u2019re screaming in pain.\u201d</p><p>Shestopped, her body tightening as she gritted her teeth against the weakness that dropped her further to the ground. She could feel her juices dripping from her body, thick and hot from her greedy cunt. The arousal was more than she could bear now. Her body was hungry, starved for fulfillment, demanding a release that just didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cAiden...\u201d she cried out his name, desperation born of fury, pain and fear echoing in the air around her. Ithurt, this need. The pounding fury of sexual hunger was unlike anything she could have imagined. Damn, it was worse than before. She tightened her thighs, fighting the pain of the arousal. It throbbed through every cell of her body, tightening her muscles to a screaming peak as her womb clenched in need. She could feel the blood running along her abdomen, the rippling pulse in her womb. Just her luck, she thought, she was going to bleed to death before she could ever effectively escape. Stupid scientists.She had been under their noses for years as they fought to find or to capture a Breed mate. They had kept the semen collected over the years, preserved for use, constantly watching for a candidate for their evil. They had no idea she existed. No idea she had become bound to Aiden the day she had so foolishly swallowed his semen. But, boy, had they tried to make up for lost time after they found out.</p> <p>She had messed up, allowed them to catch her aiding the Winged Breeds. They had needed a woman at the time to place with the leader, Keegan, and for a while, debated her use. Until they checked her blood, and found what she had found years before. A hormone known only to the Wolf Breeds and a high level of the aphrodisiac reported to run only through the blood of mated females. From that moment on her life had become hell.</p><p>\u201cBastards.\u201dHer teeth gritted as her womb convulsed again.</p><p>She clamped her hand to the incision in her stomach, praying the bleeding wouldn\u2019t become severe again. Sometimes it did. Sometimes, she was certain she would die. The sounds of gunfire, explosions and the screams of war could still be easily heard. Charity breathed out wearily, knowing she had to move, she had to drag herself farther away from the fighting, the possibility of capture. She wanted tolay down and rest, to forget the horrors of the bastards she had hopefully left behind. But time wasn\u2019t on her side, and sleep was only a prayer. She dragged herself to her hands and knees and forced her body to move. Just a little farther, she promised herself. She shuddered as a leaf raked her nipple. Oh hell, it felt too good.Too damned good. Her nipples were hard points of exquisite sensation with no hope of relief. She knew well that no amount of touching them, of stroking her straining clit would bring anything more than an increase in arousal.</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere, Charity?\u201d She froze. Still on hands and knees, her eyes widened as a pair of boots and long muscular legs came into view.</p><p>Her gaze lifted. Up, over the shadowed expanse of tight thighs, a hard abdomen, a wide chest. His face was dark, his silver-gray eyes hidden, but she knew that voice.Knew his voice, and God help her, his scent.Rich and wild, with a hint of summer heat.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me. Girls night out,\u201d she gasped as her womb shuddered again, peaking with pain, as though his</p><p>scent called to her arousal.</p><p>She fought to change course, knowing she was caught, knowing there was no hope. He moved to counter her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in heat,\u201d he growled. She heard the fury throbbing in his voice and remembered his last vow to her. She shivered in dread.</p><p>She leaned against the thick trunk of a tree, sitting down wearily. She knew she was going into shock. She held her hand to her abdomen, feeling the blood that eased past the incision. She didn\u2019t bother to answer his accusation. There was no denying her arousal, or her depleted strength.</p><p>\u201cSo sue me.\u201d She leaned her head against the tree, watching as he hunched down in front of her, his body so tempting that if she had the strength she would have attacked him then and there. \u201cGoaway, I don\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p> <p>She needed his cock. There was a difference.Hard, thick and long. She whimpered as she felt her cunt pulse more of her thick juices to her thighs. Glorybe , she needed to be fucked. She hated the thought of dying, so aroused,unsatisfied .</p><p>\u201cWas I offering to help you?\u201d he asked her, his voice a bit too casual and light. Then he paused. She watched his head tilt, heard him inhale roughly. \u201cCharity, you\u2019re bleeding.\u201d His voice had changed, edged with reluctant concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying, Aiden,\u201d she whispered then, sadly. She would never know his touch, never know satisfaction.</p><p>She heard his indrawn breath, and wondered how he could smell the blood over the scent of raging lust.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, you\u2019re not,\u201d he bit out, moving so quickly she could only cry out as he swung her into his arms, against the hard warmth of his chest. \u201cYou won\u2019t escape me that easily, Charity.\u201d</p><p>God, his body was hard, hot. One arm looped around his neck, the other pressed to her abdomen as she fought to stem the blood welling from the wound there.</p><p>She inhaled his scent, so wild and clean, as her breast brushed against the fabric of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d she whimpered against his neck, the painful lust overcoming common sense or any shred of modesty.</p> <p>She was naked in his arms, and he was hot and aroused. She could smell his arousal as well.A stormy, primal scent that wrapped around her, edging her own lusts higher.</p><p>\u201cAnd you will have me,\u201d he grunted.\u201cSooner than you know. But not while you are bleeding to your death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me,\u201d she cried out bleakly. \u201cYou do, Aiden. You owe me. Please make it stop hurting.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened around her, his pace increasing as she moved against his chest. She was in need. The lightning flashes of aroused pain were torturous, worse than they had ever been before.</p><p>\u201cSoon, Charity.\u201dHis answer was a breath of sound.A promise or a warning? She wondered. \u201cSooner than either one of us needs.\u201d</p><p>He was striding through the jungle, moving at a rapid pace, holding her snugly to him, sharing his heat, his strength. Beneath her hand the blood flowed from her body. She could feel the chilling weakness washing over her and knew that this time she would not survive the loss of blood. She had lost too much, and the transfusions took too long for her body to accept. She would escape in death. What he had sought so many years before had now come to her.</p><p>\u201cCan I sleep now, Aiden? I\u2019m very tired,\u201d she asked him faintly as she felt the weakness closing over her.</p><p>She heard him curse. The sound was dark, deadly. The scientists had once again stolen what he believed was his.First his control, and now his vengeance.</p><p>She allowed her head to fall to his chest, a smile to shape her lips. And on a silent breath she whispered goodbye as darkness stole over her.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s yourmate, she can only accept your blood.\u201d The doctor hastily prepared for the transfusion as her assistant stitched the incision on Charity\u2019s abdomen.</p><p>The pale skin was smeared with blood, too much blood. It had run in slow rivulets down her abdomen, smearing her thighs, and the smooth bare flesh between them. He had felt her weakening seconds before he reached camp, felt the fight that had always been so much a part of her slowly drain from her fragile body and knew he was losing her. She was dying in his arms. His jaw bunched as he fought the anger surging through him. He turned his face from her, staring at the side of the tent that held the field hospital. If he watched her, looked at her lying there so pale and helpless, he didn\u2019t know if he would be able to contain his rage. He had been warned of what was to come, though he had given little credence to the Breeds\u2019</p><p>declaration of psychic abilities to the point they claimed to possess them. He had scoffed at their knowledge of the bonds he knew would exist between them.Had mocked their predictions of the events to come. He had assured himself that night in the Labs had been due to the drugs, nothing more.Even though some internal sense had warned him otherwise.</p><p>He had been prepared to treat her as coldly, as cruelly as he would any Council lapdog. But the moment he had caught her scent, had seen her face, so pale, so distressed, he had been unable to maintain his determination. Her scent called out to him, her delicacy terrified him. She was so tiny now; so fragile he wondered how she had managed to escape on her own. She appeared too weak to even stand under her own strength, let alone to have escaped into the jungle.</p><p>He was within seconds of destroying every Council soldier and scientist they had taken, rather than holding them for questioning later by the Breed lawyers and government officials heading for the area. Remembering the smell of blood, of her impending death was nearly more than he could stand. They had done this to her. They had stripped her of all dignity and used her for their insane experiments. They had nearly killed her in their drive to play God.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop to question his conflicting feelings regarding Charity. His fury over her betrayal of him, his hatred that she had stayed with the Council rather than fighting to be free.His desire for her, his fury at her. It all converged inside him until the morass of emotions became overpowering.</p><p>\u201cStop growling at me, Aiden,\u201d the doctor bit out nervously, her dark face watching him intently. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt. It\u2019s just a needle.\u201d</p><p>She inserted said needle into the vein, opening the valve to allow his blood to ease gently through the tube that connected him to Charity. He didn\u2019t care about the damned needle. Over the course of his lifetime he had seen more needles than he could count.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my mate,\u201d he snarled, unable to hold the words back any longer. He knew the lie for what it was, though. \u201cI have not accepted this.\u201d</p><p>The doctor snorted. She was young for her remarkable skill in Breed medicine. A bit on the short side, with full breasts and hips most men would ache to clasp close. Her skin was as pretty as milk chocolate, and she had long, sleek black hair that fell down her back in a multitude of braids.</p><p>\u201cHer body says otherwise.\u201d She crossed her arms beneath her breasts as she stared down at him, glancing often at the speed of the transfusion. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny the mating, Aiden. You know that.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her broodingly. She watched him as she would a recalcitrant child. The forced patience and mocking amusement had him baring his teeth in warning.</p><p>\u201cI can deny whatever I wish,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI did not mark her. How can she be my mate?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at the question. Her studies into the mating phenomena that began with Hope were well known. She was determined to learn why the Feline Breeds had bred so easily, whereas the Wolf Breeds had been unable to. The scientists had theorized for years that the inability to breed could reverse. It had been proven with the Feline Pride. The Wolf Packs had not yet accomplished that last battle with nature, though.</p><p>\u201cIf what I suspect is true when she swallowed your semen in that Lab six years ago, that was all it took. I suspected the mating could occur without the mark, and this proves it. The blood tests don\u2019tlie , Aiden. Her body is bound to yours. The hormone and unique DNA that marks it matches yours perfectly. The enzyme in her blood that rejects any other transfusion further proves it. Deny it all you like, but she\u2019s a part of you.\u201d</p><p>Aiden refused to answer the charge. His blood boiled at the thought of being tied to this woman.Any woman. The life of a Breed was too dangerous. The life of a Breed mate was even more so. The low, vicious growl that rumbled in his throat couldn\u2019t be silenced. The silent disapproval of his conscience was just as loud.</p><p>Had it not been for Keegan warning them that her body would accept no other blood but Aiden\u2019s, they</p><p>would have lost her.Not that Dr. Armani hadn\u2019t run the first vital testing for blood match. She had run the tests as her assistant prepped Charity for the transfusion. Each second had seemed a lifetime as she bled uncontrollably. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow much longer will this take?\u201d He flicked a contemptuous glance at the blood-filled tube that led from his arm. \u201cI havework to do.\u201d</p><p>The scent of her need, even unconscious, was destroying him. Sweet and tempting, the subtle fragrance stirred him, keeping his cock engorged,his body ready to take her. He hated the uncontrolled response. The need, as hard and brutal as it had been while the drugs pumped through his system years before.</p><p>\u201cShe is more important,\u201d she informed him, her voice turning cold. Aiden lifted his lip contemptuously. To the doctor, she might be more important. To the Wolf Breeds she might be more important. To him, she was the enemy, he assured himself. He would not let his unruly body sway him where she was concerned. She had worked with the Council for years now, been a part of their inner workings, knew their secrets and their evil. Even when she could have escaped them, she stayed. Working with them rather than fighting to be free.</p> <p>No sane person could have spent so many years in the bosom of such monsters and not be like them. The denial that clawed in his heart for so many years refused to accept this, but Aiden knew it was no more than the truth. He would not be led by his emotions in this. Charity was a Council doctor, one of their most valued Lab Technicians and budding scientists, and yet none of them saw the potential of betrayal here.</p><p>\u201cAll done.\u201dDr. Nicole Armani\u2019s voice was soft, yet tinged with disapproval as she removed the transfusion catheter. \u201cYou can return to whatever you deem important now, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>He rose slowly to his feet.</p><p>\u201cHow long will she be unconscious?\u201d He prided himself on his control then. He stood before the doctor, careless, unconcerned.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Aiden.\u201d She shook her head, watching as the assistant worked over Charity. \u201cShe\u2019s lost a lot of blood, her body was in shock from whatever drugs they had pumped into her, and she was already weakened. It could be hours, it could be days.\u201d</p> <p>He flexed his fist carefully. \u201cI\u2019ll have one of my men stationed as guard. If she awakens, call for me. If not, she will be leaving on the air transport coming in this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden, she\u2019s too weak.\u201d Dr. Armani turned on him in angry surprise. \u201cShe may not survive the trip. She needs to be stabilized further.\u201d</p><p>His mouth opened to snap at her, to reinforce the order, but his gaze was caught by the silent, too pale woman on the bed. He wanted to howl at himself in rage as an unfamiliar weakness rose inside him. She was too pale.Too weak. He wanted her away from here, yet he couldn\u2019t endanger her further. Some instinct he couldn\u2019t deny or fight refused to allow him to test her fragile strength.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201dHis voice was a harsh, contained growl of fury.</p><p>\u201cNot before she stabilizes,\u201d Armani said again, her voice stubborn.\u201cA day, a week, whatever. I\u2019ll let you know when she can be moved.\u201d</p><p>Frustration bit at him with sharp, hungry teeth. Charity would soon be in more danger by staying here than she would be if she were moved too early. The implication of her health and the war raging through the jungle with the escaped Council soldiers and Coyotes was a difficult problem. One he needed to resolve quickly.</p> <p>\u201cWe have limited time here.\u201d He gnashed his teeth together, frustration mounting inside him.</p><p>\u201cAiden, do you want her to die?\u201d She turned on him then, facing him with a frown, her black eyes glittering angrily. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to keep her alive.Period. Do you think I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing? I will let you know the minute I think she can be moved. If all goes well, possibly\u2014and I stress possibly</p><p>\u2014tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He raked his fingers through his hair in a burst of anger. \u201cWe may not have this time you need, Doctor,\u201d</p><p>he bit out. \u201cWe must be cleared out of here as quickly as possible. You are aware of this, I assume?\u201d He sneered the question at her.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t afford an organized assault by soldiers possibly on their way to free those taken captive. The war between the Council and the Breeds was heating up in ways that left him struggling for the answer to their survival.</p><p>Dr. Armani drew herself stiffly erect. Her brows lowered dangerously, a tight smile shaping her lips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push me, Aiden. I am not one of your Enforcers and I won\u2019t be ordered about. You take care of your responsibilities and I will care of mine. We\u2019ll both live that way.\u201d She was beginning to appear decidedly violent.</p> <p>\u201cAre you threatening me, Armani?\u201d he questioned her then, dangerously. No one had dared threaten him since the day they escaped the Labs.</p><p>\u201cSounds like she is, Aiden.\u201dFaith stepped into the tent, dirt-smudged, and frowning in concern. \u201cWe need you outside. Jacob and Wolfe just pulled in the head scientist. It\u2019s Robertson, and he\u2019s ready to talk.\u201d</p><p>Robertson. Dr. Andrew Robertson, second only to Bainesmith, before her death. He would now be considered the Council\u2019s top expert in Breed experimentation. Aiden smiled coldly. He glanced back at Charity, promising himself that she would awaken soon, and when she did, she would not escape him or his vengeance.</p><p>\u201cWere they able to retrieve any of the records?\u201d he asked her quickly, forcing his mind away from Charity and her fragile health. \u201cWe need those records, Faith.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head as they rushed from the tent.\u201cNothing, Aiden. Keegan was able to get into the records room before the explosion. Let\u2019s pray they were destroyed. From what I\u2019ve seen, we don\u2019t want to know what happened here.\u201d</p><p>He heard her compassion, her pain. And in many ways he agreed with her. The Lab had been hell, the smell of death and depravity nearly strangling them as they entered it. They had enough nightmares. God knew they didn\u2019t need anymore.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go see if we can choke some facts out of him then,\u201d he smiled mercilessly. \u201cI\u2019m in the mood to be persuasive.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>He was in the mood to be sick. Aiden stood inside the jungle, just out of sight of camp and fought to breathe. It wasn\u2019t the sickness in his gut that caused the problemsthough, it was the emotional turmoil pitching through his soul. He wiped at his damp face and assured himself it was the heat of the night, not tears that dampened his face.</p><p>Propping his arm against the tree beside him he buried his face against it, his muscles taut from the tension riding his body. God help him, he wanted to kill them all. There were twenty-five soldiers and nearly a dozen scientists restrained within the tent he had just left and he wanted to rip their throats out. He wanted to hear their screams of pain, see them on their knees begging him a second before he tasted their blood.</p><p>His fists clenched in driving fury as he stood there, fighting to control his breathing, his rage. We tied her down. The hormone had to be inserted directly into the womb with the ability to view the resulting changes. We decided rather than going in through the cervix, that it would be easier to make the incision into the womb itself and insert the camera probe directly inside. Easier for them.The growl that rumbled in his throat was a primal protest to the claim. It was no easier. It was more painful. It was a shock to the body when none was needed, and she had nearly bled to death more than once in the process.</p><p>Included in the experiments was a hormonal aphrodisiac made from the hormone in his semen. The arousal it produced was found to have stimulated the ovaries in some way. They were merely awaiting a new ovulation period before attempting to force conception with the few remaining samples they had of his sperm. They had been certain the changes within her womb would allow conception to occur. Her records had revealed the ingestion of his semen. They had found the perfect specimen for yet more of their monstrous tests. For six months. Six agonizing months where she had wasted away to nothing, driven closer and closer to the brink of death.</p><p>And had she died, they would have tossed her body away as yet another broken specimen. She wouldn\u2019t have mattered, only the results of the tests did.Tests that stripped the mind and horrified the soul. He was still reeling from the reports the guards and lower level scientists were more than eager to give in exchange for their lives.</p><p>\u201cShe lives. This should be all that matters.\u201d He raised his head, staring at the Winged Breed they had been forced to drag from the flames of the Lab as he fought to return and save the woman he knew was still held there.</p><p>Keegan was nearly six and a half feet tall though lacking the heavy muscle that most Breeds developed. Not that he appeared weak. He stood tall, his arms crossed over his chest, aristocratic and graceful. His long brown hair fell past hisshoulders, his amber eyes were intent and focused. Aiden shook his head. He still couldn\u2019t believe they had managed to do it. They had given man wings. Full, strong, graceful wings that folded upon his back. They extended from his boot-shod feet to the top of his head with nearly an eighteen foot wing span to hold his human body within the sky. The bone work of the Winged Breeds was less dense and more flexible than those of full-humans and other Breeds. He was a miracle of genetic perfection, and psychic to boot. Son of a bitch, if he wouldn\u2019t be a pain in the ass.</p><p>\u201cI should kill every damned scientist sitting in that tent,\u201d Aiden growled. \u201cEventually they\u2019ll be released, just as the other bastards were six years before. It will never stop, Keegan.\u201d</p><p>The knowledge that there was little he could to stop the madness ate at him, just as it always had. The experiments still continued and the Council cruelties seemed to only magnify each time another Lab was found. There was no mercy, no humanity in the men and women who ran those Labs. Only the experiment mattered.</p><p>The wings at Keegan\u2019sback shifted as though in agitation. He breathed in deeply, his gaze rising to the sheltering branches overhead before his eyes returned to Aiden\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIt seems very hopeless I know,\u201d he sighed. \u201cBut I do not believe it will always be so, Aiden. I believe the new future, desperate though it may be at times, will make a way for us all. We must prepare our children for that day. Keep them strong enough to lead.Strong enough to survive.\u201d</p><p>As though the Breeds needed children to worry about as well.Innocent lives thrown smack in the middle of a scientific war on humanity versus the lack of.And as Keegan hinted, victory would be a long way down the futuristic road.</p><p>Aiden grunted. \u201cYeah, I figured I could forget ever seeing it myself.\u201d</p><p>He wiped a hand over his face before spearing his fingers restlessly through his hair. Regaining his control was a battle this time. This Lab, the tests that had been described to him,were too horrific for him to accept.</p><p>\u201cA day will come when it will end. But it is yet far off,\u201d Keegan finally shrugged. \u201cNature has smiled on us, though. She has found us worthy of life, and of continuing. Your mate will prove this to the world. Your son will help lead in a future race to triumph. We can do nothing but pave the way for him and the others that shall follow.\u201d</p><p>Mate. His teeth snapped together at the word.His mate and his child. He ignored the flare of heat in his cock, fought back the instinctive possessive instincts and snarled violently.</p><p>\u201cI do not accept this woman as my mate,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>A chuckle echoed in the darkness.Keegan\u2019s laughter. His superior attitude was beginning to grate on Aiden\u2019s nerves.</p><p>\u201cNature has done this for you,\u201d Keegan informed him with no small amount of amusement. \u201cPerhaps she</p><p>knew you were not worthy to choose. Often pride and our human frailties will hide the truth from our eyes until our mistakes are too excessive, have caused too much damage to ever set right. So she has instead given such choices to the animal that resides in us, to recognize our other half. The one created exclusively for us.\u201d</p><p>Aiden snorted. \u201cThere are, at last count, five women for every male out in the world...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is at present less than a dozen female Breeds from all those created. There are over six hundred known Breed males, and perhaps more unknown.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shock widened Aiden\u2019s eyes. \u201cThree hundred,\u201d he bit out. \u201cLast count is three hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Keegan nodded.\u201cOver six hundred known to me then. My count is of course more accurate I can assure you. But that is neither here nor there. Humans are naturally predisposed to female children. It will not be so for Breeds, who will be predisposed to males. What would you make of this, Aiden?\u201d</p><p>Shit. He bit back a stream of curses at the information. Not that he wholly trusted theWinged male\u2019s knowledge. Unfortunately, he suspected the man knew exactly what he was talking about.Which only complicated things further.</p> <p>\u201cMore trouble than we need,\u201d he sighed roughly. \u201cOur males will mate with full-human females. The Purists that will arise will go crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Keegan nodded slowly. \u201cBut not more than the Breeds can manage.\u201d</p><p>He would have said more, Aiden thought, if one of the Enforcers hadn\u2019t chosen that moment to call his out his name as he approached them.</p><p>\u201cAiden, Armani needs you back at the tent. The girl is bleeding again and she\u2019s frightened she may need another transfusion.\u201d</p><p>He flinched, turning back to Keegan with a flash of worry.</p> <p>\u201cHer life is in your hands, Aiden,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt is your choice now if she lives or dies. Now is the time to make it.\u201d</p><p>Aiden narrowed his eyes in frustrated fury. \u201cYou know, Keegan, I could grow to hate you,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cQuite easily.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give the Winged Breed a chance to respond. He turned and rushed back to the camp, heading for the medical tent and the woman, Nature, in all her supposed wisdom, decided was his mate.</p><p>\u201cAnd I could grow to hate you as well, Aiden, quite easily,\u201d Keegan murmured as he watched the other Breed rush from the darkness toward the well camp.</p><p>\u201cIs this not the way of all alphas?\u201da soft voice asked him with gentle amusement, touching his mind with a light, feminine touch.</p> <p>He snorted. \u201cThere are alphas and then there are fools. Which, I wonder, will he ultimately be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have not seen this yet?\u201dthe voice asked softly. \u201cIt must be because you have refused to look.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged defiantly, as though the voice could see such a movement. \u201cI would prefer not to regret what I can not change.\u201d</p><p>He had a fondness for Charity. Not alove, or a jealousy of what Aiden possessed, but a fondness. Her soul was gentle, her heart filled with warmth. She was the only human he had met who possessed such qualities.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you do not look, how do you know it cannot be changed?\u201dthe voice asked. He sighed wearily. \u201cAre there not duties for you to attend to? Surely wherever you are, there are things you must do other than harass me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, my duty is to harass you more often.\u201dHer laughter filled his mind. \u201cI have been accused of being quite lazy where you are concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would dare?\u201dhe mocked her patiently then.</p><p>She laughed again.A whispery little chuckle that tempted him to smile.</p> <p>\u201cWill you be leaving there soon?\u201dshe asked.</p><p>\u201cWithin the hour.We are preparing to fly now. They will be upset at our absence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are things you must do, Keegan. They will survive without your knowledge. Remember, what comes easy is not near as important as those things you must fight for.\u201d</p><p>And there was much, he thought, left to fight for. Shaking his head at the cruelties of man and the fickleness of fate, he moved farther into the jungle for the clearing he had landed in earlier. Unfurling his wings he lifted them to the breeze coming behind him and took a running leap into flight. Charity would suffer for the desertion, but he had seen enough to know that her trials were those she must face alone. He had his own destiny to conquer, his own trials to endure. And it must all begin now.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Breed Compound</p><p>Colorado Mountains</p><p>Charity came awake with a moan of pain. How she had managed to sleep, to escape the blinding pain of the drugs, she wasn\u2019t certain. How she came awake in the unfamiliar room was even more confusing. She blinked weakly up at the rough beamed ceiling wondering where she was, what had happened. A spasm of convulsive reaction shook her womb, taking her breath, as she moaned harshly. She could feel the dampness between her thighs, the ever-present arousal that spiked through her body. The sexual need she could tolerate, she had learned to accept it over the years. It was the blinding pain of the attempts at forced fertility that weakened her mind.</p><p>When the contractive shudder eased away she looked around the room. The bedroom was large and almost homey. On the other side of the room an open fireplace burned cheerily, the flames warming the rooms with heated comfort. The bed was canopied, the thick flannel curtains tied back along the rough wood posts. Several comfortable chairs sat on the other side of the room, beside a large chest and dresser.</p><p>To her side a door was open to another room, obviously a bathroom. Thank God, she needed one. She checked carefully, she wasn\u2019t restrained in any way. Her wrists weren\u2019t sore, though her feet felt like hell. She pushed the quilts from her body, finally realizing she was dressed in a large T-shirt, but nothing else. She wasn\u2019t going to bitch; she hadn\u2019t been allowed to wear clothes in six months. She moved weakly to the side of the bed, biting her lip at the pain in her legs and ankles as she swung them from the bed. She dreaded putting any weight on her feet. She could feel their tenderness, the pain awaiting her.</p><p>She bit off her cry of agony as she gingerly stood up. Tears filled her eyes and within moments dampened her cheeks as she shuffled to the small room. Once there, she used the toilet, washed her hands and face and glanced longingly at the tub before shaking her head. If she got in, she would never pull herself out.</p><p>As she washed her face, she found a clean toothbrush still within its box and worked it free quickly. She felt almost freshened after brushing her teeth and forced herself back to the bed. Her breaths were panting whimpers by the time she sat down on the mattress and managed to pull her legs onto the bed. She collapsed across it, breathing heavily, trying to relax through the contractions in her abdomen. She felt along the incision, surprised that no blood was leaking free. It was bandaged, obviously stitched closed. She blinked in confusion toward the fireplace, trying to remember, to understand the abrupt changes around her.</p><p>No cells, no scientists, no restraints. She breathed in deeply, knowing there was something she had forgotten, something she needed to remember. Shadowed images flickered through her mind.Flames and fear, a blinding heat as she fought to escape. She shook her head, trying to make sense of it.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out of bed. If you had called I would have helped you.\u201d</p><p>Fear shocked her system. The breath lodged in her throat as she stared unblinkingly at the fire, trying to deny the voice that had spoken. It wasn\u2019t possible, she assured herself. Not now. Not after all these</p><p>years.</p><p>His voice was colder than it had been in the Mexican Labs.More savage and controlled than she remembered. She licked her lips nervously, wondering if she would survive the savagery she glimpsed in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ignore me forever, Charity.\u201d Smooth, mocking amusement raked across her nerves as leanly muscled thighs came into her line of vision. Between the jean-clad columns, a thick, hard erection bulged against the snug, low-slung cloth.</p><p>Charity swallowed in tight reaction as her nipples peaked, hardening with increased arousal. She fought to breathe through the welcoming shudders in her womb. As though her body had instinctively recognized its sexual master, it began to hum in joy. A joy her mind rejected, the intellectual part of her aware that she may have well escaped the physical pain, but the emotional agony to come could well be worse. Muscles flexed, his abdomen tightened as he bent his knees, lowering himself until he could stare at her from the bottom of the bed. Her breath hitched in her throat. He was older, his features honed, harder. His eyes were a silver-gray, merciless,as cold as ice.</p><p>Black hair fell shaggy and thick around his face as he propped his forearms on the mattress, watching her silently. Satisfaction lined his expression, tormenting, knowing.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she cleared her throat weakly.\u201cOut of the frying pan and into the fire.\u201d She commented on her apparent rescue from the Labs, only to find herself now held by the one man she had fought to escape for years.</p><p>A thick black brow arched questioningly.\u201cAn interesting analogy. Would you like me to contact the Council and return you?\u201d</p><p>She flinched. He would, she thought, and likely do so gladly. But which was really worse?</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me? Did you find the Winged Breeds as well?\u201d she finally bit out when she couldn\u2019t answer her own question. The pain in her womb only fed her anger, fed her sense of desperation. His expression darkened. \u201cWe found them. Do you remember the attack at all?Your escape from the Labs?\u201d</p><p>Escape? There had been no rescue? She forced herself to shake her head negatively. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Not that she cared at this point. She was free of them, and she would die before going back.</p><p>\u201cYou somehow managed to escape just before the explosion brought the mountain down. We had already rescued Keegan and the others, but had been unable to get to you. I found you afterwards, nearly unconscious in the jungle.\u201d He watched her closely. The look was so intent she dropped her own gaze.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d Shards of memory flashed through her mind, making more sense as the seconds passed.</p><p>\u201cKeegan led me to you.\u201d His voice was calm, holding little, if any, emotion. The very fact that he appeared so emotionless was more frightening than his anger could have been.</p><p>\u201cHe should have left me to die,\u201d she grunted sarcastically. \u201cIt would have been far kinder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention less complicated.\u201d Aiden surged to his feet, causing her to flinch in dizzied reaction.</p><p>\u201cOur doctor has examined you and found no lasting injuries. You\u2019ve been washed, disinfected and stitched. You should be well soon.\u201d</p><p>Disinfected.Morbid amusement filled her.As though she had somehow been contagious. She closed her eyes, fighting the overwhelming futility of fighting further. Unfortunately, something inside her refused to allow her to give in.A spark of rage, of anger. Not just at the Council, but at Aiden as well. Had it not been for him and his determination to die too soon, she wouldn\u2019t be in this mess right now.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the update,\u201d she gritted out as she closed her eyes, fighting to breathe through the surging contractions in her abdomen. If he would just go the hell away then she could be miserable in peace. She heard him sigh roughly. \u201cI can smell the scent of your arousal. You\u2019re horny, Charity.\u201d His voice was edged with frustration.</p><p>\u201cPoor me,\u201d she sniped as she gritted her teeth against the pain.</p><p>\u201cThe scent offends me.\u201d He sounded angry, as though she expected him to relieve the pain.</p><p>\u201cPoor you.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t about to ask him for anything, even if it was his damned fault. \u201cIf it offends you so damned bad then get the hell away from me!\u201d She shot him a look that she hoped showed her rising fury.Like she needed a damned update concerning the state of her own body. She tensed then as a particularly agonizing bolt of pain tore through her womb. It was getting worse. She fought to control the scream building in her throat, but couldn\u2019t stop the whimper that escaped her lips. Before she could do more than gasp, Aiden flipped her to her back, holding her down, increasing the pain that radiated like a cascade of fireworks through her body.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she wheezed, desperate to curl back into the fetal position she had assumed when the pain first started.</p><p>She could feel the cold sweat breaking out on her face, the screams building in her throat. She hated being this weak in front of him, in such pain she was helpless against whatever cruelty he would inflict. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you think you can go on hurting like this?\u201d His question was a hard, rough growl. \u201cThe pain is killing you, Charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaves you the trouble,\u201d she cried out furiously, fighting her need to arch to him, to rub against him. God, he was heavy and hard against her, and she needed him so desperately. Alternately, fury whipped at the edges of her mind. He was being less than considerate of a condition that was basically his fault. His next words exploded through her, though, searing past the arousal to an anger bordering on rage.</p><p>\u201cBeg me and I\u2019ll ease you.\u201d She glimpsed the cold smile on his face, the flash of his canines. Finally, mercifully, the pain eased again until she could breathe normally and felt less like vomiting in his face. Bastard, he would have deserved it.</p> <p>\u201cFuck you, Aiden,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>She brought her knee up fast, not overly hard as the pain left her weak and dazed, but hard enough. His eyes widened as he paled before falling to his side with a groan of pain, his hands going instinctively to his offended cock.</p><p>Knowing retaliation would be quick, she tried to roll from the bed, to crawl from him. She couldn\u2019t believe she had struck out. Couldn\u2019t believe she had actually done it. Amusement flashed through her for a second as she remembered the look of horror on his face before a growl of animal fury sounded behind her.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Pain was pain, she thought, as he gripped her shoulders and jerked her back to the bed. The constant flashes of fire through her body were worse than anything he could inflict on her, short of broken bones. He came over her, his knees a vice about her legs as he stared down at her with dark, icy calm. She knew she was supposed to be frightened of his anger; she could see it in his eyes, feel it in the waves of fury emanating from him. His assurance that she would cower beneath his rage was there in his self-satisfied expression.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t beg you, and I won\u2019t cower before you,\u201d she bit out, her teeth gritting as her muscles tightened again in defense of the pain that struck her womb.</p><p>She was shaking, perspiration coating her skin as she fought her tears. And Aiden was only making it worse. The touch of his body, his weight holding her down, his hands warm and calloused as he held her wrists above her head, combined to increase her arousal and in return the fiery waves of hunger that swept over her. The pain was brutal, like a fist punch to the gut as her womb spasmed in need.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so desperate to be fucked that your whole body screams out for it,\u201d he sneered. \u201cYou\u2019ll beg soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to you,\u201d she snarled back. \u201cI\u2019d rather fuck a mongrel Coyote than ask you for anything, Aiden. Bastard that you are,you\u2019d leave me hurting anyway.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes as the corner of his upper lip lifted, showing the sharp canine in deadly relief.As though the sight of it frightened her. She would have snorted if she could find the breath to push that much air through her body at one time.</p><p>\u201cYou will go to no other,\u201d he bit out. \u201cWhen you decide to ask me nicely for relief, Charity, perhaps I will be nice and extend it.\u201d</p> <p>He jumped from her then, staring down at her, breathing hard and rough as he watched her. Her eyes went down his body, until her gaze locked on the thick bulge beneath his jeans.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re horny too, Aiden,\u201d she said softly. \u201cMaybe you need to beg me. Ask me politely for relief and perhaps I will extend it.\u201d</p><p>She gasped then as a particularly hard contraction tightened her abdomen. She curled quickly on her side, fighting the waves of pain as she felt more of her juices leak from between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d she cursed him breathlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s your fault. You did this to me, and you hate me for saving your miserable life.Bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you believe, Charity?\u201d He leaned close to her, his teeth bared in his own anger. \u201cThat I hate you? I do not hate you, darling, for saving me. I hate you for tying me to you.For taking my choice and my will from me. But more than anything else, I will never forgive you for betraying me as you did, and leaving me helpless in that bitch\u2019s hands.That I won\u2019t forgive you for.\u201d</p><p>Aiden stalked from the bedroom, unable to look at her, to smell the sweet scent of her need. She was his mate. He hadn\u2019t truly believed it, had paid little heed to Cian\u2019s claims in the weeks before they attacked the Labs. He hadn\u2019t truly believed. He believed now.Had believed before bringing her to his home. But that didn\u2019t mean he had to like it. It didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t fight it. He pushed his fingers restlessly through his hair as he heard her moan again. Every muscle in his body tightened in agony. The blood burned in his veins, seared his cock. He ached for her, like nothing he had ever known in his life. And he knew he wouldn\u2019t deny her much longer. He moved to the stove where a pot of stew bubbled merrily. She had to eat. She was too thin, too weakened to carry a child if she did conceive as Cian had said she would. Right now, he doubted if she could even withstand his lust or the sexual intensity that would come from their mating. What terrified him the most, though, was wondering if she would survive how his body would lock with hers, ensuring his seed every chance to find root within her body.</p><p>He heard her moan again.A bleak, pain-ridden sound that tore at his soul. Damn her. He flipped the stove off, setting the pot to a back burner as he flipped the cooking spoon into the sunlit sink. His cock was heavy, fully erect, confined behind the material of his jeans and begging for release. Arousal had never fired his blood with such a firestorm of hunger.</p><p>He remembered the day she had coaxed his erection to bursting relief. After taking his first release into her mouth, she had followed Bainesmith\u2019s orders and left the Labs. It was then his hell had truly begun. Hard, aching for her, his cock had stayed erect, desperate for relief. With mouth and hands, Bainesmith had drained him more than once into her fucking vials for testing. For hours, until he hung limply on that fucking metal cross, sweat dripping from his body as they put his unwilling arousal to hard use. And he had fucked.Just as they wanted. When they wheeled the unknown woman\u2019s gurney to him, adjusted her to allow the penetration into the hot depths of her pussy, he had fucked her.And fucked her. And still he had not eased. Bainesmith had been more than pleased. Thankfully though, after the first time Charity had sucked the seed from his body, the further swelling in his thick shaft had not occurred. The fist-sized knot had stayed silent, though he could feel its need just</p> <p>beneath his desperate flesh.</p><p>When he was finally returned to his cell, his body thick with sweat, his cock coated with the woman\u2019s sap and his own seed, he could do nothing but collapse onto his cot and swear his vengeance.On Bainesmith and on Charity.</p><p>But how do you reap vengeance when it\u2019s your mate?</p><p>She cried out again, the sound low, tortured. She was in need.Her body hot and pulsing, pleading silently with him to fill it. The drugs injected into her pushed her natural arousal higher; those injected into her womb increased her fertility. She would carry his child.</p><p>His hands trembled as his cock throbbed to the point that he was forced to grip it in defense. He bared his teeth in helplessness. She was his.His mate. And by God, now was as good a time as any to prove it.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cDo you know what will happen when I take you?\u201d Charity opened her eyes in surprise as Aiden moved to the end of the bed.</p><p>Her eyes widened as his shirt drifted to the floor and his hands went to the worn leather belt threaded through the loops of his jeans. Her mouth watered. She could almost sense the hot male taste of his thick, hard flesh. She remembered it clearly, relived it often in her dreams.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t asked me politely yet,\u201d she reminded him, trying to snarl then wincing at the thick arousal in her voice.As though he had to ask. She knew when he touched her she would go off like skyrockets. Her breasts ached now, her nipples feeling more swollen, if that were possible, than ever before. He released the metal buttons on his jeans, one by one, as her breathing increased.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what will happen, Charity?\u201d he asked her again. The heavy warning in his voice had her swallowing tightly with nerves and shades of fear.</p><p>\u201cI know the basics,\u201d she bit out. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid. And I\u2019m not ready to fuck you yet, either. Beg me, Aiden.\u201d Her womb clenched in protest.</p><p>His hands paused. The jeans were undone, yet still covering him.</p><p>\u201cYou know the basics of Wolf Breed sex?\u2019 he asked her carefully. \u201cYou know how I\u2019ll lock inside you?\u201d</p><p>She remembered then, the hard knot she had barely kept hidden from the scientists as Aiden shot his</p><p>seed into her mouth. She trembled, her eyes widening as she stared up at him. Like an animal, he would lock inside her, ensuring his seed had time to reach her fertile womb. She moaned bleakly. Her eyes closed as she fought the knowledge of what was to come. Now she understood the reasons behind the careful blood tests the scientists had conducted, trying to match her blood to one of the Coyote Breeds stationed there.Looking for a match.A breeding pair.An animal that would lock inside her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d She jerked away from him as she felt his touch at her shoulder. \u201cGet the hell away from me, damn you.\u201d</p><p>She scrambled to the headboard of the bed, refusing to look at him. She fought to ignore the pleading ache in her body, the arousal that only seemed to grow. How the hell was she supposed to bear this if he touched her?</p><p>\u201cThe pain is killing you, Charity,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Her gaze flickered to him, then away, as he shed his jeans. She shuddered. She knew how thick and hard his cock was, and knew how desperately her body needed it.Her body, her heart, but not her mind. She wasn\u2019t a breeding vessel.</p><p>\u201cAiden, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d She shook her head desperately. \u201cPlease, please leave me alone. The pain will go away...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember a time when I begged you similarly,\u201d he reminded her coolly. \u201cDo you remember that time, Charity? Yet, you sucked me to my release regardless, and then left me to suffer the agony of needing only your body, and being forced to accept the alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you were fucking instead of bleeding to death,\u201d she snapped, staring at him, enraged. \u201cIf death is so preferable to you, no one is stopping you now. Want me to help you load the gun?\u201d</p><p>He moved up on the bed, crawling to her, his eyes a cold, hard gray as he watched her.</p><p>\u201cI fucked for them, Charity,\u201d he growled viciously as though she hadn\u2019t spoken at all.\u201cFor hours. I could not get enough, could not come enough. I screwed every hole I was given access to that night, and still my cock would not soften. Now, you will relieve that ache, Charity.The ache that has lingered ever since that cursed day.\u201d</p><p>He was furious because she had saved his miserable life? She gritted her teeth in fury. Why was she surprised? For some reason she had thought over the years that he would have seen the good sense behind such a move.But oh no, not Aiden. She should have known it was too much to hope for.</p><p>\u201cThey would have killed you.\u201d She slapped at his hand as he touched the hem of the shirt she wore. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let you die then, but by God you can go to hell now.\u201d She glared at him, trembling with anger and need.</p><p>\u201cAnd now, I will not let you die.\u201d The material shredded beneath his hands.From hem to neck, then down the back as he tore the cloth as easily as paper.</p><p>She cried out, struggling against him as she fought to get away from him, to resist the scent of him, the touch that beckoned and made her body plead for more.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Charity.\u201dHe caught her close as she fought to jerk away from him. He was warm. She shivered with the need to burrow closer. Oh God, his body was so warm it seemed to sink into that hidden, frozen core of her soul that never seemed to melt.</p><p>\u201cLet me hold you for a moment.\u201d His arms tightened around her as she fought to breathe. Her back was plastered to his chest, his arms holding hers clamped to her side, his hands flattening on the painfully clenched muscles of her abdomen. His fingers stroked the skin there, delicately massaging and easing the shuddering muscles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI only wanted to save you,\u201d she whispered as his heat seeped into her body. \u201cI knew rescue was coming, Aiden. I contacted that reporter and told him where the Lab was. I knew help would be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forced me to betray my body, my own instincts, Charity,\u201d he whispered in her ear, the sound dark and feral. \u201cYou were my mate, and you forced me to betray you. I gave your pleasure, and my seed to another. And you calmly walked away.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head desperately. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d She wanted to stay angry, needed to, but her body was weak, worn and so aroused that the clenching of her cunt was more a spasmodic reaction to her overwhelming sexual hunger than a reflection of her mind\u2019s willingness to engage in the act. His cock jerked at her back, hot and hard, a velvet stroke of power that further inflamed her body.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take you. I will take you as I see fit, as many times as I wish.Beginning now, Charity. Fighting me, fighting the need, will only make it worse. I know this from experience, mate.\u201d</p><p>He was still angry. His fury stroked her as casually as his hands massaged her abdomen, moving lower, closer every second to the wet heat of her cunt. She was on her knees, held close to him, helpless in his grip and her own needs.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to bury myself inside you.\u201d The growl in his voice shocked her with the sound of primal heat. \u201cI feel as though my blood is boiling, Charity, demanding you, demanding your tight pussy wrapped around my cock.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled sharply. His voice was deep, pitched low, as he whispered at her ear, his breath stroking over the delicate shell with erotic heat. She wanted him, needed him so desperately that fighting against it seemed a useless task.Until she thought of the consequences.</p><p>\u201cAiden, wait.\u201d She shuddered as his lips feathered over her neck, then his teeth scraped the sensitive skin with a nip of barely restrained hunger.</p> <p>\u201cFor what?\u201dHis hands stroked upward, his palms molding themselves to the full mounds of her breasts, his thumbs and forefingers capturing her peaked nipples.</p><p>Charity lost her breath, and her mind, in that instant. Her eyes closed as her head fell back against his broad shoulder and she pressed more firmly into the grip.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that, Charity?\u201d He pressed closer to her, his canines scraping across her shoulder with sensual promise.</p><p>His fingers worked her nipples slowly, with just enough pressure to further inflame the lusts building in her body. His palms cupped her with heated warmth, but his wicked fingers only stroked her internal fires higher, hotter. And all the while his lips, his tongue, the sharp points of his canines rasped at the skin of her neck and shoulder. She could feel her flesh tingling, pleading for a deeper caress.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re torturing me. Deliberately,\u201d she panted, her voice rough, trembling almost as badly as her body was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of this day for years,\u201d he growled at her ear. \u201cEach time I took another woman and felt her pussy parting for me, taking me, I\u2019ve thought of you, Charity. Thought of you, and wondered just how long it would take me to fuck you out of my system.\u201d</p> <p>Shock tore through her body a second before she jerked out of his arms. Before he could stop her, she moved across the bed, biting off a cry of painful regret as she lost the heat of his body. She came to her knees, facing him, ignoring the jarring spasms in her womb. He faced her. He didn\u2019t move to pull her back into his arms, or to touch her in any way. The smirk that lingered on his lips tempted her to violence, though. The heavy, bulging thickness of his cock tempted her in ways she didn\u2019t want to consider.</p><p>\u201cI am not your mate,\u201d she rasped out. \u201cThe pain will go away. The need will become no more than an echo, and when I can walk, I\u2019ll show you just how fast I can remove myself from your pitiful life, Aiden. I want no part of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that too bad,\u201d he snarled, his eyes darkening, muscles tensing with anger. \u201cYou won\u2019t leave, Charity. Not now, not ever. Mating is forever, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d She lifted a brow, knowing the sarcastic impression it would convey. \u201cDrugs do not make a mate, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all the denials in the world won\u2019t change the nature of the beast, Charity,\u201d he bit out. \u201cAccept it or not. Your body will accept no blood but mine, your body longs for mine. The hormone driving you crazy ismine ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a drug,\u201d she cried out, spearing her fingers through her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s the damned drugs, Aiden. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He snorted mockingly as he moved from the bed.</p><p>\u201cDrugs be damned, woman.\u201d He shot her a hot, angry glance. \u201cCan you tell me you had no desire for me? That your body didn\u2019t melt daily in need? That your pussy didn\u2019t stay hot and wet for me after swallowing my sperm? Tell me it didn\u2019t. I dare you.\u201d</p> <p>His superior expression, the sneering knowledge in his eyes, inflamed her. She lifted her chin, staring him in the eye as she watched him with a mocking twist of her lips.</p><p>\u201cOf course I did, Aiden.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t make me horny. I was as much a prisoner as you were. Of course I would have fucked you. You turned me on. That doesn\u2019t make me your mate. It doesn\u2019t make me any part of you. The drugs did that, not nature.\u201d</p><p>She watched his lipsthin, his eyes narrow on her intently.As though he could see past her building fury, past her protestations. She wasn\u2019t about to tell him just how hot she did get in those years before she was caught betraying the Council. No more than she was about to tell him the results of the tests she had run on herself.</p><p>She watched as he breathed in hard and deep, his nostrils flaring as he fought for control. His expression was a study in sensuality. His lips looked just slightly fuller than normal, his bronzed skin flushed along the cheekbones.His chest, bare of hair, wide and muscular, tense with his effort to control his own raging lusts.</p><p>Finally, his lips quirked.Not mockingly, but with genuine amusement.</p><p>\u201cWhen I can touch you, Charity, and your body doesn\u2019t heat with longing, your cunt doesn\u2019t cream with need,then we\u2019ll discuss whether it\u2019s the drugs or nature. Until then, you are my mate, whether it\u2019s what you wish or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bastard, Aiden.\u201d She clenched her teeth as she fought the building fury, the rush of blood that only stroked her arousal higher.</p><p>\u201cMost likely,\u201d he agreed softly. \u201cBut for the moment, mate, I\u2019m your bastard. Deal with that however you will.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cTime to eat.\u201dCharity watched as Aiden moved slowly to the bed several hours later, his expression set in determined lines as he picked up a pair of long sweat pants from the chair by the bed and approached her. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll help you get dressed and carry you into the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at the sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d She shook her head. Right now she was more concerned with keeping herself from jumping his broad body and stuffing his cock up her pussy. She felt like a rabid animal, intent on mating.</p><p>\u201cYou look hungry.\u201d He frowned down at her.</p><p>Oh, he had no idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she gritted out.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look fine,\u201d he pointed out a little too patiently to suit her. She opened her eyes, staring up at him with a lack of amusement or patience.</p><p>\u201cI look like a scrawny bitch in heat, which is pretty much what I am,\u201d she said with blistering emphasis.</p><p>\u201cSo go away and let me die in peace.\u201d</p><p>Aiden sighed patiently, the sound further grating on her nerves. He held out the pants. \u201cDress willingly or I can force them on you.Your choice, Charity.\u201d</p><p>She knew she needed to eat. Knew she needed to regain her strength but the blistering arousal tormenting her was unlike anything she had known previously. The pain wasn\u2019t nearly as blinding as the need to be touched. But if he touched her, if he took her, she knew the consequences could be catastrophic.</p><p>Gathering her strength and her courage, she sat up slowly, watching him warily as she held out her hand for the pants. He ignored her. He knelt at her feet with a warning look. Likely daring her not to kick his teeth in, she thought with a hidden smile. Oh, how satisfying that would be.</p><p>Aiden hid his grin as he watched her. Her expression didn\u2019t change, but the forced curve of her mouth, the stillness about her cheekbones warned him. He remembered in a flash of insight seeing that look on her face a second before she nearly ripped the balls off one of the Labguards years before.Patient, calm. Exacting.</p><p>He eased the material over her legs, watching them carefully for any tensing. He would need only a second\u2019s warning, but damned if that warning wouldn\u2019t come in handy. When he reached her thighs he swallowed tightly as the fought the instinctive need to caress her. He could still smell her heat. It was soft and sweet, yearning. Son of a bitch, she was making his head spin, it was so intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cEase up,\u201d he murmured as she lifted her hips.</p><p>He jerked the material over the soft curves of her ass, his fingers itching to stroke them. The palms of his hands were nearly sweating with the hunger to caress her.</p><p>\u201cAll done.\u201dHe tightened the drawstringmarginally, making certain it wasn\u2019t snug against her sore midriff. He knelt on the floor again and rolled the cuffs carefully over her bandaged feet. He wanted to resent her.Wanted to resent the necessity of taking care of her. Yet he couldn\u2019t. He had caught himself in the kitchen thinking of ways to ease her, to make things easier on her. Then he would remember he was supposed to be angry. Only to remember the horror stories he had heard in relationship to the experiments conducted on her. She was going to drive him crazy. He was driving himself crazy trying to decide what he was supposed to feel, how he was supposed to act. This mating business was a pain in the ass, and now he knew well why he had wanted nothing to do with it. He had other things to do, other concerns that he felt was far more important than attempting to analyze these unfamiliar emotions.</p><p>\u201cThere you go.All done.\u201d He rose to his feet before bending down to lift her into his arms. She was too light, almost fragile in his arms. She was also tense as hell and too damned weak to do more than just tighten against him as he carried her into the kitchen.</p><p>Once there, he set a bowl of stew before her and a tall glass of crisp, cold milk. She needed energy, food. Something that would stick with her and give her strength for the coming battles ahead.</p><p>\u201cI have to go out for a while,\u201d he told her as he watched the delicate manner in which she ate. She nodded sharply.</p><p>His lips twitched. She wasn\u2019t gobbling her food, but he\u2019d be damned if he couldn\u2019t tell she wanted to. She kept careful control of herself, though, eating with a steady determination that hinted at the hunger she suffered from.</p><p>\u201cGet as much rest as you can, Charity,\u201d he told her long minutes later as she sat back in her chair, replete, and glanced at him. \u201cI\u2019ll be back to check on you sometime today. If you need me, there\u2019s a landline in the bedroom. It connects to the communications building. Just tell whoever answers that you need to speak to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll do fine without you.\u201d He didn\u2019t like the forced unconcern that suddenly surrounded her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you will.\u201d At least he was certain she would try to make sure she needed him for nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou need to rest for a few days, Charity. Get your strength back. I\u2019ll stay away as much as I can, but you know as well as I do that it\u2019s only to delay the inevitable.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him from the corner of her eye.</p><p>\u201cI need a bath.\u201d She didn\u2019t answer his comment. \u201cCould you get someone to help me with that?\u201d</p><p>His body tightened. He could see her, stretched out in the big tub in the bathroom, dressed in nothing but steam and heated water. His cock jerked in reflex. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hell. Of course she needed a bath, he thought in weary disgust. The question was, could he maintain control long enough to help her with that?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d He tried to shrug as though he could do it with no problem, but already his body was heating further at the thought of it.</p><p>She watched him broodingly. He could see the battle going on in her head. She wanted the bath, desperately. She didn\u2019t want him helping her with it though. Finally she sighed in resignation.\u201cFine. As long as I can get clean. The most I should need is help getting out of the tub. I can handle the rest of it on my own.\u201d</p> <p>She should have been a Feline, he thought.Damned independent, stubborn female.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I anyway?\u201d She suddenly grimaced as she stared around the kitchen. \u201cAre we still in South America?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColorado.\u201d He rose to his feet and cleared the table quickly. \u201cThe government allocated us several hundred acres here as a home base. The compound is heavily fortified with several dozen army personnel as well as Air Force support from the base across the mountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe compound.\u201dShe nodded then. \u201cI\u2019d heard of it. When I get better, I\u2019d like to see it.\u201d She didn\u2019t look at him, and for all her appearance of unconcern he could tell it mattered to her to see what they had accomplished. Aiden didn\u2019t care much for the fact that it pleased him.</p><p>\u201cWhen you can walk comfortably, I\u2019ll take you on a tour,\u201d he promised her softly as he moved to her drooping body. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get you back to bed. You need to nap a bit more before you\u2019re ready to do anything.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed bleakly as he lifted her into his arms once more. \u201cI don\u2019t sleep well, Aiden.\u201d She tried not to lean against his body. He could feel her tensing, holding herself away from him as she fought to maintain her control. He would allow it, for now, he thought.</p><p>\u201cI have something that will help you sleep, baby.\u201d He laid her back on the bed before moving back to the kitchen.</p><p>When he returned, he carried a glass of water and a sedative Armani had approved for Hope and Faith last year.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a sedative,\u201d he told her when she stared at the small pill in his hand. \u201cOur doctor had to create one especially for Hope and Faith. Sometimes, they don\u2019t sleep well either.\u201d</p><p>There was a single week of the month that the two women were more like rabid animals in their temperaments than grown women.</p><p>\u201cDid she check...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe checked everything, Charity. Trustme, the damned woman doesn\u2019t miss a thing. Now take your medicine like a good girl so you can rest. You will need your strength soon.\u201d He gave her a wolfish smile. All teeth and male amusement.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed on him but she took the pill, swallowing it with a long drink of water before lying back against the pillows.</p><p>\u201cNow sleep.\u201d He tucked the blankets around her. \u201cI\u2019ll check on you later and help you get a bath.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were closing even as he spoke. Aiden resisted the need to brush the hair back from her face, to caress the delicate line of her jaw. His fist clenched as he turned on his heel and stalked from the cabin before his need overcame his good sense. She was going to make him crazy, he thought. Then he grunted mockingly. Or perhaps she already had.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>The next morning, Charity was able to move more comfortably from the bed and to hobble through the house. Dressed in one of Aiden\u2019s T-shirts and another pair of drawstring sweat pants with the ankles rolled up quite a bit, she made her way through the small cabin in search of food. She hadn\u2019t expected to awake alone. She had been prepared for yet another confrontation with Aiden, but the respite was more than appreciated. She was still weak, still tired. The months of experiments within the Labs had damned near killed her and she was smart enough to know that. It still could. But at least she had slept for a change. She didn\u2019t know what was in the little pill Aiden had forced down her throat twice more the day before. But whatever it was it had thrown her into a sleep deep enough to allow her mind to ignore the pulsing arousal that tormented her. Unfortunately, it returned with a vengeance when she woke up.</p><p>Her body was sensitized, achy, the flesh tingling wherever she touched. Her cunt was moist, throbbing in longing. The sexual need that burned in her body seemed worse now, as though his touch had somehow stoked the fires already burning within her.</p><p>An hour later, the light meal finished, the dishes stacked in the sink, she looked around and admitted the silence of the cabin was starting to get to her. As much as she had prayed for peace over the past years, such silence was so foreign it was almost frightening to her. From outside the cabin she could hear the sudden sounds of vehicles and voices raised as orders were shouted. It wasn\u2019t imperative, nor seemed alarming. Moving to the couch, she peaked outside the large window behind it to see what was going on.</p> <p>The view was breathtaking. She ignored the movement going on in what appeared to be a central area of command in favor of the beauty of the mountains surrounding them. She needed to see more, ached to smell the breeze off the mountains. Standing up, she moved carefully to the front door. The wounds on her feet hadn\u2019t been severe, thankfully, and she hoped within a few days they would be healed enough to allow her to more thoroughly investigate the Breed compound she had heard so much about in the past years.</p><p>The scientists she had worked with had been outraged, furious, when the United States had declared the Breeds were fully human. The explosion of outrage over the experiments and the uses the Council had envisioned for the Breeds had swept the world.</p><p>When the United States had apportioned the land in Colorado out to the Breeds and aided them in building the large protective compound, the fury within the Council had overflowed to the Labs. Recapturing or killing the Breeds was out of the question now. The focus of the world was frowning so heavily on those suspected and known of being within the Council, that any movement toward recouping their loses had been put on hold.Except for the Coyote Breeds. The Council had finally found the perfect soldier there. They followed orders precisely, their mercilessness nearly equal to their creators. She stepped out on the porch, breathing in the clean, crisp air of the early fall morning and stared around with a sense of surprise.</p><p>A tall stone wall enclosed the acres-large compound. From where Aiden\u2019s cabin sat, slightly higher atop a rise, Charity could see the crystalline lake outside the enclosure, as well as the rolling hills that led to thickly forested mountains around them.</p><p>Inside the compound, friendly chaos seemed to reign. The cabins were set some distance apart, providing privacy and a sense of freedom, she thought. There were quite a few trees growing within the compound, a large blue pond, and several long, low buildings and storehouses. It was beginning to resemble a small town.</p><p>The central portion of the area was, at the moment, filled with dozens of men and women unloading boxes of equipment from several trucks that had pulled into the compound. Guards watched from a safe distance, automatic rifles held in readiness as hard eyes watched the commotion. There had to be over a hundred Breeds milling about, as she could see.Which meant there were likely many others sleeping, working, doing whatever it took to keep the place running. The entrance to the compound was heavily fortified and guarded as well. It would be damned near impossible to get in or out without being seen. And despite the beauty of the compound, it was still that...a heavily protected area.</p><p>Charity bit her lip as she eased herself onto the rough wood porch swing to the side of the porch, and continued to watch the work below. They were still imprisoned, just in a different way. The freedom she had always envisioned for the Breeds hadn\u2019t come about as she had thought it would. As she watched the commotion going on, she realized her appearance on the porch hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed. She was being watched and carefully guarded. One of the men stood within a small stand of trees, the other in a fortified stand atop the compound wall. Both watched her with hard, determined gazes.</p><p>The enjoyment she had taken in feeling the breeze wash over her, smelling the clean, natural scent of the lake beyond and watching the men below at work suddenly dimmed. She rose to her feet and made her way carefully back into the house.</p><p>They didn\u2019t know, she thought. They couldn\u2019t know how she had helped them in the Labs, how she had helped plan their rescue. Few people did know. She had been a shadowy figure on the edge of the group working to destroy the Council and its mad schemes.</p><p>Not that they had succeeded. She pushed her fingers wearily through her hair as she stretched out on the couch and gazed moodily up at the ceiling. They were still creating, still experimenting, playing God and destroying lives.</p><p>The sudden opening of the door had her jerking upright, turning to watch as Aiden came into the cabin. He closed the door as he turned to look at her.</p><p>\u201cDoing okay?\u201d he asked her carefully.</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d she drawled.\u201cUntil a second ago.\u201d</p><p>Mocking amusement lit his eyes.\u201cToo bad. I have to sleep sometime.\u201d</p><p>He bent over, unlacing his boots before toeing them off with a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep last night?\u201d she asked him curiously, wondering what he had done.</p><p>\u201cI was working last night.\u201d He moved to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWorking at what?\u201d She frowned, realizing she had no idea what he did.</p><p>\u201cSecurity.\u201dHe shrugged. \u201cI coordinate all the little details that keep the compound secure. We had someone sniffing around the perimeters of the wall last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoyotes?\u201d she asked trying to still her fears. The Council would not let her go without trying to recapture her. The tests they had conducted on her were too important. He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not certain. We could never tell for sure.\u201d</p><p>Charity watched silently as he pulled a bottle of water from the refrigerator and took a long drink. His head tilted back, revealing the stubborn curve of his chin, the strong line of his neck. His dark flesh glistened with perspiration, the open collar of the cotton shirt revealed dark, tempting flesh. Her cunt clenched, her breasts aching as her gaze went to the hand wrapped around the bottle. Large, strong hands, surprisingly graceful looking for a man.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d He lowered the bottle, placing it back in the refrigerator as he glanced at her.</p><p>\u201cI ate.\u201d One hunger was satisfied, the other was killing her.</p><p>\u201cI have to run into town in a bit,\u201d he told her. \u201cDo a drive-through and see what I can see. Want to go with me?\u201d</p><p>The invitation caught her off guard. She looked at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, see what you can see?\u201d she asked him. \u201cI thought you were going to go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNap.\u201dHe shrugged, watching her more closely now. \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse, Charity. Are you ready to stop fighting it yet?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d Confusion shot through her. She had no idea what his question meant.</p><p>\u201cThe arousal.\u201dHe walked to her slowly, stopping at the edge of the couch, his eyes darkening. \u201cWe\u2019d both sleep better if you stopped fighting it.\u201d</p><p>The amusement and knowledge in his voice and expression had her eyes narrowing in anger.</p><p>\u201cAh. I see.\u201d She folded her arms across her breasts. \u201cSo, everything would work out if I would just go ahead and let you fuck me.Right?\u201d</p><p>He stilled then. Finally, after a long moment, he just shook his head as his expression flashed with regret. He sighed wearily. \u201cForget it. I don\u2019t want to fight with you, Charity. This situation isn\u2019t sitting any easier with me. But facts are facts. You\u2019re in pain and I\u2019m your best bet, baby, to escape it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d rather die horny.The self-satisfied, egotistical bastard. What made itworse, was the knowledge that he was right.</p><p>\u201cIt gets easier.\u201d She shrugged. At least, it always had before. \u201cHow long was I unconscious anyway?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She frowned, wondering how much longer she had to wait.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the grin that tilted his lips.</p><p>\u201cTwo days.\u201d</p> <p>She thought quickly. \u201cIt should be over in a few more. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.\u201cPossibly. But what you\u2019re unaware of, sweetthing, was that I had to supply the blood transfusion you needed.That little anomaly in your blood system jumped by more than a hundred percent, according to the doctor. You\u2019re screwed, honey.\u201d Triumph glittered in his eyes, echoed in his voice. Charity felt her heart jump in her breast. Her eyes widened in shock and fear. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, the implications of the information slapping her in the face. \u201cNo. You\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201dHe frowned down at her. \u201cI haven\u2019t lied to you about any part of it, Charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blood.\u201dShe swallowed tightly. \u201cTell me, Aiden, you didn\u2019t give me blood.\u201d</p><p>His white teeth flashed as he smiled slowly. \u201cYeah, I did. Doc said it was the most amazing thing she ever saw. Your blood cells and those little Breed things I have in my blood were friggin\u2019 like crazy under that microscope. I think mine topped yours, honey. Doc is getting all kinds of ideas on how to help Faith and Hope now.\u201d</p> <p>Weakness flooded her system. She pressed one hand to her abdomen, above the wound the scientists had made into her womb. She had no doubt in her mind the added component in his blood had dominated her blood cells. It made sense. The small amount contained in his semen had started the process; the addition of his unique blood was more than likely her downfall now. She shook her head, fighting the tears threatening to flood her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>Aiden snorted. \u201cYou need to be fucked, sleep, then more sleep and food first. No wayI\u2019m letting you around that damned quack until you\u2019re stronger. The two of you are too damned much alike. You\u2019ll be strapped in an exam table first thing and the rest will be history. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to see what you\u2019ve done,\u201d she bit out, moving carefully to her feet, facing him, furious at him and the unknown doctor who had dared to transfuse her without tests first. \u201cAnd why the hell did they give me your blood? Surely you had a supply of regular blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did.\u201d He nodded, crossing his arms over his broad chest.\u201cPlenty of it.But none of it compatible to yours. We even had the right type, but tests showed a rejection of it from the anomaly in your blood. Only I matched, baby.Lucky you, huh?\u201d</p><p>Sarcasm was thick, heavy in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have any idea what you\u2019ve done?\u201d She shook her head, almost dazed by the knowledge. \u201cMy body would have accepted my blood type. It may have protested mildly, but it would have accepted.</p><p>You don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I do,\u201d he informed her softly. \u201cThe transfusion merely cemented what we both know is true...\u201d</p><p>She shook her head violently, limping away from him as her fingers clenched, fury washing over her.</p><p>\u201cThe drugs started this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201dHis voice was mild, if you discounted the dark savage throb beneath it. \u201cWhen you went to your knees and swallowed my seed is what started it, Charity. You know it, and I know it. You were my weakness because nature decided that was the way it was. Not the drugs, not the blood.\u201d</p><p>She was trembling. Almost absently Charity was amazed at the tremors washing over her body. She stumbled against the fireplace, her breath hitching when he caught her, jerking her against his harder, hotter body.</p><p>\u201cFeel it, Charity,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cIt was there when I felt your mouth on my cock. It was there when I shot my come down your throat. It was there when you needed blood and I provided. You refused to let me escape, baby, now you can share the life I\u2019ve built instead. Now doesn\u2019t that sound like fun?\u201d</p> <p>He was furious. Charity heard his anger, dark, deep, pulsing in his voice. He swung her up in his arms, ignoring her protesting cry as he stalked to the bedroom. His muscles were tight, tense and she could feel the need for violence that wrapped around him like an invisible flame. But he was gentle as he laid her on the bed then sat beside her, staring down at her.</p><p>\u201cI needed to save you,\u201d she whispered bleakly. \u201cI had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause nature commanded,\u201d he bit out.\u201cWhether you like it or not, Charity. Whether I wanted to accept it or not, you are my mate. Your blood proves it, but even more, this does...\u201d</p><p>Before she could stop him his hand pushed beneath the loose pants and curved around her sensitive pussy, then his two long fingers plunged inside her soaked cunt as his palm pressed against the swollen clit.</p><p>\u201cAiden,\u201d she screamed out his name as her vagina convulsed, spilling more of her silky juices around his hard fingers.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re hot,\u201d he growled, his expression instantly filling with a hard, savage lust. Her thighs clamped on his hand, her hands wrapping around his broad forearm, though she had little strength, little desire to pull him free. In fact, her body was so helpless, so desperately aroused she could do nothing but arch into the hand, silently begging for a deeper penetration. He gave it to her. Slowly, his fingers stretched her, his gaze locking with hers as the rest of her vision seemed to darken.</p><p>\u201cAiden,\u201d she panted, terrified of her response to him, fightingherself and the needs washing over her.</p><p>\u201cI bet you taste as good as you feel,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd you feel damned good, baby.Too damned</p><p>good. And you\u2019re too fucking weak for what I need right now.\u201d</p><p>He slid back slowly, ignoring her whimper, the arch of her hips.</p><p>\u201cAiden.\u201dShe licked her lips, fighting the plea her body was screaming out to her. He was breathing hard. Almost as hard as she was as he watched her closely, his eyes darkening with whatever thoughts were running through his mind.</p><p>\u201cRest,\u201d he growled.\u201cFucking rest, Charity, before I take you and hurt you worse than you already are.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Aiden slammed out of the cabin, the need for sleep so overwhelmed by the need to fuck that he had to get away from her. He snorted, if only the need to fuck was what drove him, he thought as he plopped down on the steps and laced his boots on his feet.</p><p>He pushed his fingers restlessly through his hair as he tried to make sense of the impulses flowing through his brain. Damn, she was going to make him crazy.Just as crazy as he had been in the Labs after her arrival. Her scent had nearly taken him to his knees the first time she had walked into the room. The subtle, irresistible draw of her body had been almost more than he could bear. He stared at the ground, sighing roughly. After the night spent roaming the mountains around the compound trying to track whoever or whatever had been outside the wall, he was exhausted. And it wasn\u2019t helping that his temper seemed so blasted iffy either. He was completely unsettled and he didn\u2019t care much for the feeling.</p><p>The woman was bewitching him. What the hell was wrong with him? She looked at him with those big hurt eyes, so filled with arousal anda deceptive warmth, and something inside him wanted to melt. It was inconvenient was what it was.</p><p>He lifted his head and stared off into the distance, wondering at the changes that were occurring too quickly around him.The changes within himself. He couldn\u2019t seem to make sense of it, and he\u2019d be damned if he would go to Jacob and ask him anything about it. The other man watched him with such amusement now that it made his hackles rise instantly. But overriding it all was his need for Charity.The complete, compelling, unquenched need to fuck her as hard and as fast as he could drive his cock into her.</p><p>He gritted his teeth, standing almost painfully to his feet. That fickle flesh throbbed beneath the fly of his jeans with a demand that was damned near impossible to deny. As he started to stalk from the porch steps, the door to the cabin was flung open.</p><p>He turned, facing Charity warily as she stood there dressed in nothing but one of his T-shirts. And her</p><p>nipples were hard. And he could smell her heat. And by God, she was his mate. He had waited six fucking years to touch her, to slake the need that never seemed to leave his body, and he was tired of waiting.</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, then her eyes widened slowly as his narrowed. He stepped back to the rough plank porch, advancing on her as she watched him carefully. Her lips opened as she drew in a rough breath. Her breasts rose and fell quickly against the material of her borrowed shirt and the smell of her heat wrapped around him, tightening his cock, tensing his body with the unadulterated need to fuck.</p><p>\u201cGo inside,\u201d he growled. \u201cLeave the door closed. Don\u2019t step outside. Don\u2019t push me, don\u2019t berate me, Charity. I am one inch from pushing you against the damned wall and fucking you until we both collapse in exhaustion. I don\u2019t think you want that right now.\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed, her eyes darkening with arousal and fear. More arousal, though, than fear. Damn, she was killing him. A second ticked by, then another as her eyes slowly narrowed on him and anger replaced the fear.</p><p>\u201cAiden,\u201d she drawled mockingly as she leaned against the doorframe. \u201cIs it a burden being such a prick or does it just come easy for you?\u201d</p><p>He breathed in carefully, forcibly restraining himself to keep from touching her. From jerkingher into his arms and pushing himself inside her tight, hot pussy he knew was waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d he snarled. \u201cIt comes real fucking easy.\u201d</p><p>She sighed regretfully as she shook her head slowly. \u201cI was afraid of that. Oh well...\u201d</p><p>He moved in on her before she could finish, backing her into the house, then against the wall of the foyer. She stared up at him in surprise, fighting the arousal that sang through her blood as his dominance reflected in the savage features of his face. The Native American cast to his features had always enthralled her, now more so than ever.</p><p>\u201cCharity,\u201d his voice was a hard, rumbling growl. \u201cYou can only push me so far. You can only deny me so long. Combine the two, and your time will shorten immeasurably. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him through her lashes, her lips quirking teasingly, mockingly. \u201cBeg me, baby, and we\u2019ll see.\u201d She threw his words back at him.</p><p>His fists clenched. If he touched her, he knew he would never release her. It wouldn\u2019t matter if she cried. It wouldn\u2019t matter if he hurt her. Some instinctive, primal need howled out its demand, making his body tremble as he fought to deny it.Just a while longer.Just until she was healed. Just until he knew he wouldn\u2019t physically hurt her.</p><p>\u201cYou are playing a very dangerous game,\u201d he breathed in roughly as he jerked back from her. \u201cBe careful, Charity, that it doesn\u2019t backfire on you.\u201d</p><p>He stomped to the door once again.</p><p>\u201cWill you be back for dinner, darlin\u2019?\u201d she asked him mockingly, stopping him in his tracks. His chest seemed clenched, something inside him screaming out for a tender voice, gentle words. He was a fool and he knew it.</p><p>He looked back at her, smiling slowly, confidently, his eyes going first to her hard-tipped breasts then to her seductive gaze. He watched her smile dim as her gaze dropped to the near lethal canines.</p><p>\u201cI guess, mate,\u201d he growled. \u201cIt\u2019s all according to what you can come up with for dessert.\u201d</p><p>He gave her no time to respond but stalked as far and as fast from her as he could. He could feel the perspiration breaking out on his body as he fought for control.Fought the wild need to fuck, to mate, to have her beneath him screaming in climax as he thrust repeatedly inside her. It was a fight he was rapidly losing.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>The next afternoon, Charity hobbled through the connecting living room to the kitchen in search of food. She had slept away most of the day before, and long into the night, only awakening as Aiden checked on her after he returned. The arousal pulsing through her body was ever present, tormenting her dreams as deeply as it did her waking hours. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was his mate. She knew that herself from the tests she had taken months after the episode in the Labs. Her body had begun changing then.The uncomfortable, ever present arousal.The surges of heat and irritation that seemed to linger just under her skin. Later, blood and saliva tests showed the presence of an unknown hormone that varied in strength according to the state of arousal she was in. She had hoped it would go away. Had hoped it would slowly diminish. She hadn\u2019t counted on the scientists learning her secret, or finding a way to advance the changes her body was trying to make. She hadn\u2019t anticipated a damned blood transfusion, something even the scientists hadn\u2019t been able to use. The hormonal virus running through his blood was too potent for her body to fight.</p><p>But her heart and her mind disagreed. Nature was precise; it didn\u2019t make mistakes, not with something so basic as a mating instinct. Nature didn\u2019t deal with the heart, or anything as fickle as emotions. It dealt with biology, chemical reactions. A chemical reaction wasn\u2019t enough for her. Her heart, her soul, demanded more.</p><p>Charity eased her way to the stove and the pot sitting on the back burner as she made her way to the kitchen. Lifting the lid, she inhaled the scent of vegetables and beef, and a rich broth that made her mouth water.</p> <p>Within minutes she was sitting down to the warm soup, and a cold glass of milk. As far as meals went, she figured it was as close to ambrosia as she was going to get. She couldn\u2019tremembering anything tasting as good in years. The milk was bitingly cold and eased the terrible dryness in her throat, while the food eased at least part of the cramps in her stomach.</p><p>She had just finished the small meal and placed her dishes in the sink to wash when a light knock sounded on the door and it opened slowly.</p><p>\u201cCharity?\u201dA female voice called out, and Charity watched in surprised as two women walked into the front room.</p><p>\u201cHope.Faith.\u201d Amazement filled her. They were older, filled out and more mature, but smiling in welcome as they rushed into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cCharity.Oh God, I thought you were dead or something.\u201d Faith reached her first. Laughing, almost crying, Charity allowed the other woman to embrace her tightly, ignoring the sharp, burning protest from her flesh. Faith was a bittaller, her once long, auburn hair was cut shorter now, but there was no mistaking the pretty features or her laughter filled voice. Even in the Labs, after Faith got past her initial wariness, she had been filled with humor and a love of life. As Faith moved back, Charity watched Hope quietly. Hope had hated all the scientists and Lab personnel after Wolfe\u2019s escape. The few times Charity had tried to contact her she had been rudely rebuffed.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Hope said quietly.\u201cFor Wolfe\u2019s life and his escape.\u201d</p><p>Surprise shot through her. \u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d</p><p>Hope\u2019s lips quirked into a grin.Her features were vaguely Asian, compliments of her Chinese mother. She had taken her slender height and blue eyes from her American father, though.</p><p>\u201cI made it a point to find out, after Wolfe found me.\u201d She stepped closer, hugging Charity briefly, though warmly. \u201cCome on now, get off those sore feet and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>She hobbled back to the open living room, collapsing gratefully on the wide, well-cushioned couch as Hope disappeared into another room that Charity hadn\u2019t noticed earlier.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s check your feet.\u201d She came back moments later carrying a first aid kit. \u201cDr. Armani will be around later this evening, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re starting to get uncomfortable again.\u201d</p> <p>Armani.Charity controlled her expression, her knowledge of the doctor. Armani had been her contact while she was with the Council, until more than a year ago. Surely to God Armani had known better than to transfuse her with Aiden\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re actually not too bad.\u201d Charity shrugged, uncomfortable with having the other woman kneeling at her feet. \u201cI could use some clothes, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some stuff you can wear. I\u2019ll run over to the cabin and get them while Hope takes care of this.\u201d</p><p>No sooner than she spoke the other woman turned and rushed back out the front door.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still in heat,\u201d Hope sighed, shaking her head.\u201cCan\u2019t sit still for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs are you.\u201dCharity caught the slight, though distinct scent of a storm around the other woman as well.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you and Wolfe been back together?\u201d</p><p>Hope glanced up at her, her dark blue eyes somber.\u201cAlmost a year. And yes, I am. It eases somewhat, sometimes. But it\u2019s still pretty strong. It\u2019s eased for me, for the time being.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave your hormonal levels been tested while it\u2019s strongest?\u201d Charity asked her, wincing as Hope checked the tender pads of her feet. \u201cMy own tests showed increased hormone levels during ovulation. The scientists later found a slight genetic alteration in the cell structure of the ovaries. Their tests began there. With each successive hormonal treatment I was given, the cell structure has changed further, coming closer to a match with the Wolf Breed sperm. Have you been tested for any of these changes?\u201d</p><p>The unique DNA coding of the male Breed ruled out breeding with either Breed, or non-Breed females. Yet the scientists were finding a way to break through this barrier.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hope shook her head slowly. \u201cWolfe banned any such testing, and honestly, we didn\u2019t see the need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope, that can\u2019t continue.\u201d Charity frowned fiercely. \u201cListen to me, your body is changing.Slowly. Evolving to match Wolfe\u2019s enough to breed. This has to be watched carefully. It affects any woman that would mate with a Breed male. The answer to this is in the blood. The anomaly in the Breed blood cells is like a virus to the right woman, if the chemistry is compatible. It then infects the ovaries and the egg, making conception possible with the compatible sperm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would the scientists try to advance this? Or nature?\u201d Shock filled Hope\u2019s expression as she stared up at her in concern. \u201cThe original object was to prevent breeding.\u201d</p><p>Charity took a deep breath, trying to tamp back her own fears. \u201cThey want the children, Hope, to experiment on.Animals whose organs will come closer to matching human requirements.Disposable creations for experimentation. They haven\u2019t stopped. They will never stop. And no one, not Breed, nor mate nor child will ever be safe from them. Their super Army didn\u2019t come to fruition, so they\u2019ve changed direction now.A direction that could become more dangerous than their original plans. As for nature...\u201d</p><p>She took a deep, trembling breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I know the evolution began in me, afterI the night I swallowed Aiden\u2019s semen. It\u2019s similar to a virus at the cellular level. It\u2019s so complicated even the Council scientists have been unable to figure it out completely. But it begins a slow evolution that I believe will result in conception. As though nature itself has decided that the species will survive.\u201d</p><p>She watched as Hope\u2019s face paled. \u201cDid you tell Aiden this?\u201d she whispered desperately. \u201cDoes he know?\u201d</p><p>Charity shook her head. \u201cKeegan knew. I assumed he had found time to talk to Wolfe.\u201d</p><p>Hope shook her head imperatively. \u201cKeegan hasn\u2019t said anything, Charity.Nothing. The Winged Breeds disappeared within hours of their rescue. No one has seen them.\u201d</p><p>No one?Keegan held the answers, the key to all this. He had told her, right before the attack on the mountain, that he had figured it out. That he knew what the scientists were doing, and how nature would eventually fight back. He had kept her sane those last days as he connected with her, explaining what her body was doing, and why. He wouldn\u2019t just leave.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Charity blinked at her in surprise. \u201cKeegan wouldn\u2019t do that. He knows the experiments. He knows what they were doing, step by step, even when I didn\u2019t. Hope, Keegan is incredibly psychic, with a photographic memory. He was connected to me during those experiments. He knows everything, every last detail, he wouldn\u2019t just leave.\u201d</p><p>Hope stood to her feet, the first aid kit and Charity\u2019s raw feet forgotten as she panted for breath. \u201cI have to find Wolfe. This is worse than any of us believed.\u201d</p><p>She rushed from the house, the door slamming behind her as Charity covered her face with her hands before pushing her fingers through her hair with weary frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you, Keegan?\u201d she bit out furiously, rubbing her temples, fighting for the connection he had often kept with her. Unable to believe he would just disappear, just leave. \u201cDamn you, why the hell did you run?\u201d</p><p>The mental connection she had once shared with him was absent, though. She felt only silence, only a bleak desertion by the man she had thought was a friend.</p><p>It made no sense. Keegan wasn\u2019t the type to just drop a responsibility he had taken on. He knew he would be needed. Knew Charity would need the information he had gathered as he shared those experiments with her telepathically. It was the reason she had allowed him to set up the link in the first place.</p><p>Frowning, she fought to re-establish the connection then sighed in bleak resignation. Keegan had always come to her. She had never had to call out to him, to try to find him; he had just been there. A presence she had been able to feel whenever she needed to maintain control, or when the pain became too blinding to focus forherself .</p><p>And now he was just gone. Her eyes narrowed. What was he up to? She knew he was calculating, secretive. He wouldn\u2019t have left in such a way unless there had been a reason for it.Unless the danger was increased somehow by his presence. She bit her lip thoughtfully. He was up to something. She could feel it. She knew him well enough to know how he plotted, planned. Now, she just had to figure out what he was up to, and why.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Aiden stood quietly behind the chair Wolfe sat in, while Jacob stood more to his side. His pistol was strapped to his thigh, along the wall behind him a rack of automatic weapons were held, ready for use. As the leader of the controversial Wolf Breed Packs, protecting his life could sometimes become a job in itself. At the moment, the room held not just Wolfe and his mate, but Jacob and his as well. Other than Charity, these two women were the only known mated females. That they were also the mates to the head of the Packs made them even more important.</p><p>The news that Hope had brought to Wolfe earlier was already beginning to cause a stir in the small Breed compound. Gathered in the room were the Leaders of the four packs who had pledged their loyalty to Wolfe and to the newly formed Breed Alliance. They all listened with bated breath as Hope explained Charity\u2019s information. Information she had not given him, but had given to another instead.</p><p>Information he would have much preferred that she keep to herself for a bit longer.</p><p>\u201cTo verify this, I\u2019d have to run my own tests.\u201d Dr. Armani was thoughtful as she watched Wolfe.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I will consider accepting this information on hear-say alone.\u201d She glanced at Hope apologetically. \u201cCharity\u2019s blood tests alone tell me it\u2019s possible, but I refuse to go in blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharity is already pumped full of the drugs, she would be perfect...\u201d Hope began.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Aiden\u2019s head rose in shock and anger as Hope voiced the thought. He speared her with a dark glance, his jaw clenching tightly as he fought to control the instinctive anger. More experiments? The pain he had watched ravage Charity\u2019s body, even while unconscious, had nearly destroyed him. He wouldn\u2019t consider such an action.</p><p>\u201cAiden, hear her out,\u201d Wolfe said quietly.</p><p>Aiden growled, for the first time that he could remember, so opposed to his leader that he feared his own reactions.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to allow it,\u201d he bit out, pacing around the couch, aware of the other members of the Council watching him carefully. \u201cShe is not part of this Pack, Wolfe, and therefore not under your command. She is mine...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you are under my command.\u201d Wolfe glanced at him, his gaze reflective. Aiden narrowed his eyes, watching the other man intently. He had never known Wolfe to issue an order he didn\u2019t agree with. Never known the other man to ask of others what he would not do himself. But this, Aiden would not consider.</p><p>\u201cShe is my mate,\u201d he snarled, his body hardening, tightening at the thought of her unclaimed status. \u201cIt is not for you to order me there, Wolfe.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe sighed. \u201cUnfortunately you are right, Aiden. But it is not for you to choose for her. Charity will be given the choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden.Our very survival depends on our ability to breed. Hope and Faith are in constant arousal now, their bodies no longer their own, their sexuality no longer theirs to control. If there is a way to stop this, then it is not something we can overlook,\u201d Wolfe snapped in frustration. Aiden well understood his leader\u2019s anger and concern. He glanced at his sister in frustration, seeing her compassion, her understanding as she watched him. But he also saw well the signs of her growing arousal once again. Both women were unable to be away from their mates for very long. The situation was breeding nothing but anger and more frustration.</p><p>\u201cThe blood work I\u2019ve run up to this point supports Charity\u2019s claims,\u201d Dr. Armani said softly in the silence of the room. \u201cThe tests I would require would be done gently, Aiden, with all care given to your mate\u2019s body and her mind. I don\u2019t wish to harm her. But we must see the results of the drugs they used on her. It could help me, perhaps, to determine how to recreate the process in a gentler manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me it would be smarter to find those damnedWinged bastards,\u201d Aiden snarled. \u201cThey have the answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.Charity\u2019s body holds the key. We could do nothing without examining her to see the results of whatever information Keegan holds,\u201d the doctor snapped out. \u201cStop being so damned possessive, Aiden. I\u2019m not going to hurt her.\u201d</p> <p>His head swung around as he fought a furious growl. The doctor was watching him as she would a recalcitrant child. The look didn\u2019t set well with him.</p><p>\u201cYou are right. You will not hurt her, because there will be no tests,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the same man who claimed this woman was not his mate? Nothing to him?\u201d the doctor asked as she crossed her arms under her breasts, watching him mockingly. \u201cWhat do you care what is done with her body? She is not a Breed, Aiden, and nothing to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not play word games with me, Armani,\u201d he snapped, infuriated that she would throw his own angry words back at him. \u201cShe has yet to heal from whatever hell they put her through. This has nothing to do with a mating and everything to do with a healing. I will not allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA healing will not occur, Aiden, until possibly, conception,\u201d the doctor snapped back, her black eyes glittering with her own ire. \u201cDo not presume to believe that, whatever those experiments were, the effects will merely wash away now that she is safe. You know better than this.\u201d</p><p>Aiden felt his stomach tighten with a sensation akin to fear.Conception? He clenched his fists as he fought to hold back the blistering curses raging through his mind. Dammit, Charity wasn\u2019t strong enough to hold herself up right now, let alone to survive the unknown trials of a Breed birth. Only God knew what would result.</p> <p>\u201cAiden.\u201dWolfe came to his feet, his expression stoic,his gaze compassionate. \u201cThis is not any easier on our women, Hope and Faith, as well as those who will suffer through this when they mate. If Charity holds the answers, then we must find out what they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I think you\u2019re talking to the wrong person about this,\u201d Hope spoke up then, her gaze leveled on Aiden. \u201cCharity has conducted her own experiments, and she knows this won\u2019t merely go away. I say we ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say she\u2019s too weak,\u201d Aiden shook his head roughly. \u201cNot now. Not until she has strengthened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden, I just saw your woman not more than an hour ago,\u201d Hope argued. \u201cShe is in such need her body trembles from it. I\u2019ve never seen Faith, nor known myself, to suffer so excessively from the heat. It\u2019s her pain, therefore it\u2019s her choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be a child as well, Hope, should she conceive,\u201d he growled. \u201cHave you forgotten so easily how familiar she was with your mother? How easily she betrayed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean how easily she saved your worthless hide.\u201d Faith stepped into the fray then. \u201cI remember how nobly you were willing to give up your life on a whim, brother, and how she saved it. I do not see that as a betrayal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden.\u201dWolfe forestalled anything he would have said to his sister in the heat of anger. \u201cRemember,</p><p>Charity is not the only one who will feel the effects of this arousal. Return to your mate, discuss this if you will, or take care of the needs tormenting you both first, whichever you deem more important. But unless Keegan is found in the next few days, then this discussion will be resolved.To all our satisfaction.\u201d</p> <p>Aiden drew in a hard, controlling breath. Wolfe watched him without a hint of leniency in his expression. He would not change his mind if no other answer were found.</p><p>\u201cWould you so willingly give over your woman, Wolfe?\u201d he snarled viciously. Wolfe sighed wearily as he glanced at the woman in question. \u201cTo ease her torment, Aiden, I would do whatever is necessary,\u201d he finally sighed softly. \u201cIf it meant my own life, I would give it to ease Hope\u2019s way.\u201d He turned back to him slowly. \u201cBut that is my love for her.My understanding of her pain. From where,Aiden, does your reluctance stem?\u201d</p><p>Aiden raised his head slowly, proudly.\u201cFrom ownership, Wolfe. The bitch is mine. Not yours, not the Pack\u2019s. Mine. Remember that before you come to my cabin claiming her in the name of your love for your mate.\u201d</p><p>He turned and stalked from the lead cabin, his boots thumping loudly, the door slamming with a satisfying thump behind him.The cool night air wrapped around him, embracing him with a sense of freedom, of wonder. And yet his soul felt as helplessly bound as it had been for six long, torturous years.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Wolfe turned to Jacob, who had stayed silent, watchful as the confrontation arose with Aiden.</p><p>Wolfe felt torn, placed between his friend and the needs of Hope and Faith, as well as Charity. The scent of her need was nearly overpowering the last time he had been in Aiden\u2019s cabin. Even unconscious her body had sought relief, in whatever form it could find. He watched Jacob frown consideringly before his lips twisted in a wry grin. \u201cHe\u2019s a goner.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cGive him long enough to sate himself the first time with her, and he\u2019ll think more clearly then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s strong enough to handle it.\u201dWolfe shook his head wearily then turned to the doctor for her opinion. The more unusual aspects of Breed mating had the potential to terrify, more than to arouse, unsuspecting females.</p><p>Dr. Armani arched a brow in mocking question. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me? Sorry, Wolfe, I have yet to understand the regular mating process you go through. The anal aspects are even more confusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt eases the arousal, for a time,\u201d Hope reminded her. \u201cSo it must have significance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.I\u2019m certain it does.\u201d She tucked her hands into the pockets of her light jacket. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I know what it is yet. And if Aiden has his way, it appears I never will.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe growled. \u201cFind that fucking Winged Breed.\u201d He turned on Jacob again. \u201cSend out one of our best groups. They have to be in that damned jungle somewhere. If you have to, put out a call to Sam\u2019s group. I want them found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo Packs are already there, Wolfe.\u201d Jacob shook his head, grimacing. \u201cIf they can find them then they will. I\u2019ll call in Sam, but I don\u2019t like the idea of it. Either way, I have a feeling Keegan or his people won\u2019t show themselves until they have no other choice. Unfortunately, I have no idea what would push them to it.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe drew in a deep breath, tamping down his own anger, his own frustration.His own arousal. Aiden\u2019s woman wasn\u2019t the only one in heat, and Aiden\u2019s patience wasn\u2019t the only one being pushed to its limits. If they didn\u2019t find an answer to this soon, then there would be no hope for any of them, let alone their futures.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>She was breathing through the contractions ripping her womb apart. Aiden watched from the doorway, his mind consumed with such contradictory impulses that he wasn\u2019t certain if he should leave, or if he should go to her. His body demanded he go to her. Every bone and muscle in his body, not to mention his traitorous cock, demanded that he take her now.</p><p>His control, so fiercely won after she had taken it from him, demanded that he run. Run hard and fast, as far away from this woman as he could get. The emotional threat she represented tore at him. The mating to come terrified him. Already he could feel the aggression, the dominance roaring within his body. Wolfe and Aiden had warned him of what was to come, but had anyone warned her? No one had, he knew. Hope and Faith hadn\u2019t been with her long enough, and he knew her earlier fear of their mating would only magnify if he explained the full details of it to her. Anal sex would frighten any virgin in such circumstances. To be taken in such a manner by a Breed male would be terrifying at first. He pushed his fingers through his hair, fighting himself, fighting the urges running through him. How was he supposed to steel his heart against her? She had known rescue was coming, had fought to save him when he would have willingly died to escape the hell he knew was coming. Had it really been her fault...his loss of control?</p><p>She moaned weakly, curling tighter into the fetal position she had assumed, holding a pillow tight to her stomach. Cian had told them that her pain had only grown worse over the months. Each injection had pushed her closer to insanity as she fought the changes ripping through her body.Changes that were slowly preparing her for him.</p><p>His hands went to his shirt, releasing the buttons slowly as he fought to maintain control of his breathing. Her scent was rich and evocative, filled with the power of a mountain storm, the heady fragrance of honeysuckle. His cock was like a staff of burning iron, throbbing beneath the restriction of his jeans, pleading for the tight confines of her honey-rich cunt. She would be wet, slick and hot. Her channel would clasp him like a wet velvet fist, dragging over his sensitive flesh as he thrust in and out. He</p><p>swallowed tightly at the thought.</p><p>It only took moments for him to undress. He left his clothes where they fell then padded slowly to the bed. She was his mate. God help them both, but he couldn\u2019t leave her in pain, nor could he bear his own any longer.</p><p>\u201cCharity,\u201d he whispered as he moved onto the bed behind her, reaching out to draw her hair back from her perspiring face.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Aiden.\u201d Her voice was strangled, thick. \u201cI can\u2019t think while you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He frowned down at her. \u201cYou aren\u2019t thinking, Charity, you are in too much pain to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe contractions are worse,\u201d she gritted out. \u201cThe heat is worse, when it should be leveling off. There\u2019s a difference to it now. It has to be because of the transfusion. I need a fucking lab.\u201d She was almost crying now. \u201cHow am I supposed to figure this out without tests?Without equipment? Goddammit, get away from me.\u201d She was panting for air now.</p><p>Aiden shook his head in confusion. She seemed more concerned with testing her damned reactions than she was with alleviating the pain. He lay down beside her, his arm hooking over her waist and pulling her back against his body.</p><p>She gasped, her body stiffening before a moan escaped her throat.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so warm,\u201d she whispered, burying her head in the pillow beneath her. \u201cHow am I supposed to fight this when you\u2019re so damned warm, Aiden?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He closed his eyes. He couldn\u2019t halt the need to kiss the soft shell of her ear. Her breath caught as a shiver trembled over her body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared, Aiden,\u201d she whispered, her voice sounding lost, lonely. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to fight this when you\u2019re so close to me. And I don\u2019t think I can bear your hatred when it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>He breathed out roughly. \u201cIf only I could hate you, Charity.\u201d His hand moved beneath the pillow she had gripped to her stomach.</p><p>The contractions were harder than they had been before. He moved his hand beneath her shirt, beginning a gentle massaging motion with his fingers as her breathing began to deepen, roughen.</p><p>\u201cFeel good?\u201d he asked, noticing her reaction as his breath whispered over her ear.</p><p>\u201cToo good,\u201d she moaned. \u201cI can\u2019t think, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not think at all, Charity.\u201d He closed his eyes, drawing in her scent, becoming nearly intoxicated on the sweetness of it.</p><p>His body was clamoring now. He clenched his teeth as his lips smoothed over her neck. Her blood beat hard and fast beneath the tender skin as her body tightened further. She swallowed tightly. \u201cWhat you said earlier...\u201d He could hear the fear in her voice.</p><p>\u201cNeither Hope nor Faith have known any pain from the dominance of their mates, or the matings themselves, Charity. Your body is ready for me, and what is not yet prepared, will be prepared in due time.\u201d</p><p>His cock was pressed against the crease of her buttocks. Below, the small tight hole of her anus awaited him. He hadn\u2019t believed Wolfe and Aiden when they warned him of that overwhelming desire to possess that dark, forbidden spot. But he believed them now. His throttled growl shocked them both as he fought to deny himself. She was already frightened, he knew. To take her there, to forcehimself into the narrow depths of her anus, could very well terrify her. Yet, the need was like a fever flowing hard and fast through his veins.</p><p>Prepare her. He had to prepare her. If her arousal were high enough, her needs overwhelming even her fears, then she would be ready for him.</p><p>\u201cCome here to me, Charity.\u201d He pulled the pillow from her grasp then rolled her over to her back. She stared up at him, her brown eyes dark, dazed with her arousal as he stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cSee how your body eases for me,\u201d he said gently, his hand pressed to her stomach, easing the knots from the muscles of her abdomen. \u201cIt knows I can relieve the pain, the arousal. Only my body can do this for you, Charity.Only my touch.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the T-shirt up her body, remembering heatedly how he had torn the other one from her. He undressed her quickly, tossing the fabric from the bed as he stared down at the beauty displayed before him.</p><p>Her breasts rose and fell in a hard, fast rhythm. Perspiration glistened on the silken skin, emphasizing the swollen curves and dark, elongated nipples. He tore his gaze from the ripe mounds, meeting hers as he fought for control.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll conceive,\u201d she reminded him again, tears glistening in her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want a child, Aiden. I don\u2019t want to bring another into such a hopeless situation.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked at her accurate description of the Breeds\u2019 lives to this point.It was often a hopeless battle they fought.</p><p>\u201cNature will do what it must.\u201d He pulled her slowly into his arms then. \u201cOur concern, Charity, is to aid it as best we can. No matter the cost. We survive, because we must.\u201d</p><p>He gave her no chance to answer or to argue. His head lowered. The temptation of her lips, swollen from the sensuality of her arousal, was too much to resist. Like the sweetest fruit, demanding that he taste of its erotic perfection.</p><p>She whimpered when his lips touched hers, opening to him, her hands moving timidly to his shoulders as his fingers continued to stroke her tightened abdomen.</p><p>She was as intoxicating, as he knew she would be. Aiden allowed his tongue to stroke over her trembling lips, ignoring her soft entreaty as they opened for the silken feel of the plump curves beneath his tongue. She was moving against him slowly, her nipples raking over his chest like little brands of need. Control was a tenuous thing at best, but he found pride in the fact that he was holding onto his. Until she</p><p>arched against him, a hungry moan breaking from her throat as her tongue reached out to lick back at him.</p> <p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>The teasing, licking strokes at her lips were driving her crazy. Charity had hungered for Aiden\u2019s kiss, his touch, for too long. As the pain in her abdomen slowly began to ease, another torturous ache took its place. The fires in her cunt began to flame through her body, clouding her mind with an arousal too fierce to fight any longer.</p><p>As she stroked across his tongue, a growl, deep and rough, sounded in his chest a second before it plunged hard and hot inside the depths of her mouth. His arm pushed beneath her shoulders as the other went around her waist, jerking her closer, tighter to his chest as she tasted the wildness of his kiss. Spicy and addicting, the moist stroke of his tongue inflamed her further. As hers tangled with it, she felt the small swollen glands at the side, though paid little attention to them. Yet another strange occurrence for this unusual Breed. He moved further over her, stroking the interior of her mouth, her lips, her tongue, the edge of her teeth until she clamped her lips on the teasing invader and suckled at it desperately.</p><p>The taste that filled her mouth sent her senses spinning. She wouldn\u2019t have believed lust could have its own unique flavor, but Aiden\u2019s did. It tasted of a summer thunderstorm, quenching her thirst for his passion but only driving her hunger for his touch higher. The taste filled her, intoxicated her,made her desperate for more. It made her as wild as his taste.</p><p>She twisted in his arms, pressing harder against him. She needed, ached for more. What the \u201cmore\u201d</p><p>was, she wasn\u2019t certain at that point. But her entire body felt inflamed, her arousal building higher, to heights she never dreamed of knowing.</p><p>Each time she drew on his tongue the taste of his lust filled her. Within seconds her body was burning brighter.As though the very essence of his kiss was an aphrodisiac all its own. It was worse than any of the drugs forced into her body.More blinding, more intense than anything else she had known in her life. He growled into her mouth then, pulling back, his teeth nipping at her lips as she fought to draw him back to her. He controlled her struggles easily as his lips moved down her neck, his canines raking her skin as she shuddered at the pleasure of it.</p><p>\u201cAiden, don\u2019t torment me this way.\u201d Her cunt was on fire. She could feel the flames licking through the tissue there, traveling to her womb, stroking it with the lava-hot agony of her arousal.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201dHis voice was a rough, untamed growl. \u201cFirst. First I will do as I have dreamed of for years.\u201d</p><p>He held her wrists to the bed as he paused over her heaving breasts. Charity watched him, barely able</p><p>to keep her eyes opened, fighting for breath as she marveled at the sensuality shaping his face.</p><p>\u201cAiden...\u201d She trembled beneath his brooding, hot gaze as it focused on her swollen curves.</p><p>\u201cHow pretty they are,\u201d he breathed out roughly.\u201cHow many years I\u2019ve dreamed of tasting your sweet breasts, Charity.Feeling your nipples in my mouth, against my tongue.Hard and aching for my touch.\u201d</p><p>He licked his lips and Charity moaned against the punch of lust that contracted her womb. No pain this time, just a brutal contraction of agonized desire that halted her breath. Then his tongue distended and she whimpered. When it stroked against one overly sensitized nipple she arched violently to him, a cry of pleasure erupting from her throat.</p><p>When the heat of his mouth covered the hard tip, pleasure whipped through her body with such force that she jerked with it, an almost orgasmic sensation ripping through her.</p><p>\u201cAiden please.\u201dShe pressed against him, gasping for breath as his lips suckled at her breast, his tongue stroking her nipple with diabolical intent as his hands held hers shackled, refusing to allow her to touch him in turn.</p><p>He moaned against her sensitive flesh, his canines rasping against her as he nipped at her nipple then.A small flash of fire, of never-ending intensity, seared across the heated peak. Each touch made her body weaker, made her arousal flare higher.As though his touch alone was more potent than the drugs injected into her body. She stared down at him, fighting to breathe as his head began to lower, his lips stroking down the tightened muscles of her stomach. Each caress was like a living flame on her skin. Each stroke of his tongue only fanned it higher, hotter, brighter .</p><p>\u201cCharity,\u201d he whispered her name as he reached the clenching muscles of her abdomen. \u201cThe scent of your need is making me crazy.\u201d</p><p>Making him crazy? She was on the verge of melting into a puddle of lust, and he said she was making him crazy?</p><p>He released her hands as he moved lower, but there was no danger of her protesting now. She was panting, weakened by the surging pleasures, the blistering heat in her vagina. His lips stroked over her, dipping into the small valley of her belly button, moving steadily closer to the swollen, moist curves of her bare cunt. Charity could only watch, could only tremble in anticipation as the room seemed to heat with the building sensuality stretching between them. When his tongue stroked over her swollen clit, circling it with a smooth, sensuous lick she couldn\u2019t halt the moaning cry forrelief, or the spasmodic jerk of her hips as she desperately sought a deeper touch.</p><p>\u201cAiden, this will kill me...\u201d She broke up, a strangled scream erupting from her throat as his lips covered her, drawing her sensitive clit into his suckling mouth.</p><p>There was heat and fire, and then there was mindless ecstasy. It overtook her, wrapping her in the cataclysmic folds of an impending orgasm that she knew would destroy her forever.</p><p>His tongue licked and stroked, rasping over the sensitized knot of nerves as his hands held her thighs open, controlling her involuntary undulations against his mouth. Her vagina spilled its silky moisture,then rippled in agonized anticipation as his fingers parted the swollen flesh protecting its entrance.</p><p>\u201cCharity,\u201d he growled against the throbbing knot of nerves as his fingers slid through the thick essence. \u201cI cannot wait much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait,\u201d she gasped, her hips arching to the whisper of his ragged breaths as her clit screamed out at the desertion. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Aiden, please. Please make me come.\u201d</p><p>One long finger thrust hard and deep inside the tight channel as his mouth returned to her clit with hungry demand. His mouth covered her again, greedy, hungry in his greed. Charity\u2019s eyes widened, her gaze darkening as sensation began to erupt inside her.</p><p>Her clitoris fragmented into a fireworks explosion of ecstasy as her vagina tightened on the invading finger, pulsed then erupted in rapture. The whipping sensations tore through her, tightening her muscles as heat flamed throughout her body. She screamed his name, only barely aware of him moving as the lightning strokes of pleasure tore her apart.</p><p>In the midst of the incredible array of fiery explosions, Aiden moved over her and positioned himself quickly. He hesitated for only a moment, but long enough for Charity to feel the sudden, heated warmth that exploded from the head of his cock. She stared up at him in surprise, watching his eyes widen. He nudged inside her further. The heated expulsion repeated, and incredibly she felt her vagina warming, relaxing, yet firing a deeper need inside the hungry depths.</p><p>\u201cWhat...\u201d She shook as the hunger became a compulsion, a hard demand that left her gasping.</p><p>\u201cCharity, forgive me.\u201d He grimaced,then with one hard stroke filled the swollen, hungry depths of her cunt with his thick erection.</p><p>She climaxed once more on the first stroke. She couldn\u2019t breathe. She gasped for breath, her head whipping against the mattress as her hands flailed helplessly to hold onto the bulging breadth of his arm as he braced himself on his elbows.</p><p>His features looked distorted as she fought to focus on his face. She couldn\u2019t fight the sensations. Couldn\u2019t fight the building surge of renewed hunger. His cock filled her as it surged through swollen tissue, but the bite of pain did little to cool the violent arousal that pushed her past any previous perceptions of need. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAiden.Aiden, help me.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop the tortured whisper as she felt his lips caress her shoulder, his teeth raking her. \u201cPlease...Aiden, please. Do something.\u201d</p><p>Despite the echoes of release that still rippled over her body, she needed more. Aiden groaned at her shoulder, his arms holding her close as he began to move. The hot shaft of engorged flesh dragged past the gripping muscles of her cunt, only to return in a hard stroke of such brutal pleasure that she swore it would kill her. Pain bit at the outer edges of sensation, but even that only drove her higher.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he growled then. \u201cDo you hear me, Charity? Mine.\u201d</p> <p>His cock thrust into her greedy, clenching cunt with almost mindless fervor. The smooth hard strokes kept her body clamoring for more as the sensations intensified, built; growing into such a conflagration she could only gasp at the power. And with each stroke, felt the hard, tortured knot of need tightening in her womb.</p><p>Her thighs tensed, the muscles of her cunt involuntarily tightening on the surging shaft, feeling the thick veins, the throb of blood, the hard pulse that beat beneath the engorged flesh, and she knew his control was slipping.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d he gasped, his hands lowering, gripping her thighs and forcing her legs toraise . He lay over her, his mouth at her shoulder, his teeth an erotic pressure on her skin as he began to fuck her hard, deep. She could feel his cock battering at the entrance to her womb, stroking her higher, filling her, driving her farther into the brutal maelstrom of sensation. When her orgasm came, Charity knew she had died. Her breath gurgled in her throat, her eyes blinded as her womb tightened further, then further. She tried to scream when she felt the implosion, but there was no breath for sound. She didn\u2019t explode outward, but inward. A violent internal destruction that occurred with such pleasure she knew she would never survive the ordeal. She felt her own release splatter past his surging cock,then amazingly, her muscles clamped tighter on him, tighter...</p><p>\u201cAiden...\u201d Reality ceased to exist as she simultaneously felt his teeth lock onto her shoulder as his cock began to swell.</p><p>She fought it.Fought him. The agonizing swell of pleasure, the feeling of a fist-sized knot growing halfway down the shaft was too much. Her body pulsed in frenzied orgasm as she tightened further, trying to force him away. She couldn\u2019t move. With his teeth locked into her shoulder, his animalistic growls sounding in her ear as his cock swelled, she couldn\u2019t force him away. Another smaller orgasm ripped through her body then as she felt the first splash of his hot seed inside her quaking pussy. His cock was pulsing hard, the beat of blood vibrating through her over-stretched muscles as his cock jerked inside her, spilling the thick, rich semen that seemed to soak into every cell it touched.</p> <p>His hips jerked, his cock straining to thrust inside her farther as they both cried out at the pleasure/pain of it.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes,\u201d he groaned, as his mouth lifted from her shoulder. \u201cAll of it, Charity. Take all of it.\u201d</p><p>The knot pulsed, engorged, pushing her into another series of rapid explosions as yet more of his release surged inside the sealed channel. There would be no loss of seed. She could nearly feel her womb sucking each drop of it inside its hungry depths.</p><p>The head of his cock was buried against her cervix, each time her own hipsjerked, she could feel the bulging head moving against it. Each eruption from the thick crown shot straight inside the opening, drenching her womb.</p><p>Minutes, hours later, the painful sensitivity through the rest of her body eased, though Aiden stayed</p><p>locked tight inside her. His weight was now held on his elbows, though his head dropped against her shoulder. His damp hair caressed her cheek as his heaving chest rasped against her tender nipples. For the first time in six years, Charity felt her body ease. For the first time in six months, she felt the horrible pain disintegrate. She sighed, her arms falling to the bed as exhaustion began to overtake her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, sighing deeply. \u201cI need to sleep now, Aiden. I haven\u2019t slept in so long...\u201d</p><p>She had been unconscious, but even then tormented with her body\u2019s needs. With the inner fires of desperation quenched, the need for true rest overtook her.</p><p>Aiden would protect her, just as he had eased her. That thought comforted her as she finally gave into the weariness. Her eyes closed as she breathed out deeply, then darkness overwhelmed her. Sleep, she thought. Finally, sleep.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Aiden groaned roughly as he slid his sensitized flesh from the wet clasp of Charity\u2019s tight vagina. The slick, moist sound as he slid from her had his cock twitching with the need to bury inside her once again, though he knew that such an option was, for now, impossible. He stared down at her, unable to make himself move entirely from her. Her short, dark blonde hair was damp, several strands clinging to the moist features of her face. Perspiration coated her body and ran in shallow rivulets to the sheets below her.</p><p>He touched her flushed cheek with the fingers of one hand, his thumb moving to caress the swollen contours of her lips. Asleep, she looked fragile, innocent, exhausted. Lines of weariness creased her face. The complete submission of her body to the sleep that had overtaken her went deeper than the unconsciousness that had held her after her escape. This was bone-deep, and soul-weary. How long, he wondered,had she been without restful sleep?</p><p>He walked into the bathroom and collected a small wash pan, cloth, soap and towel and returned to the bed. He couldn\u2019t let her sleep with the sweat and semen drying on her sensitive skin. She wouldn\u2019t rest well, and suddenly, knowing that she slept well was of primary importance to him. He sponged her off carefully, ignoring the hard throb of his cock while enjoying the satiny softness of her skin. From head to toe he cleaned her, ignoring her grumbling moans, his lips quirking in a smile as she finally rolled to her stomach to avoid him.</p><p>And there temptation reigned. He sponged her shoulders, the graceful line of her back, her slender legs and tempting thighs. He paused before carefully washing the soft contours of her buttocks then drying them slowly. His fingers trembled as he ran the dry towel down the shadowed cleft of her rear. His cock</p> <p>throbbed in hard demand.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t satisfied by a long shot. He needed her again, harder, deeper, until his cock could swell and explode inside her once more.Right there. His fingers glanced over the tight little entrance to her anus. He needed her there.</p><p>His disgusted curse was a silent expulsion of air as he moved from the bed. He returned the basin to the bathroom,then set about changing the sheets of the bed as smoothly as possible. She grumbled irritably but continued to sleep as he finally tucked the fitted ends on both sides of the mattress. A clean sheet covered her then, as well as one of the quilts the women from a nearby town had donated.</p><p>She lay on her stomach, almost boneless, her breathing even and deep as she slept. The dark blonde strands of her hair fell silky and soft to her shoulders, though still damp from her earlier passion. He remembered how long it had once been, falling nearly to her hips in a fall of silk. Whyhad she cut it, he wondered. And why did he care?</p><p>He grimaced at the thought as he made himself leave the bedroom. She had once again turned his world upside down and he was left to deal with it as she slept.</p><p>Sometime between finding her once again, and finally taking her, he had accepted the mating. He had known in those damned Labs that his connection to her was unbreakable. She could make him respond when no one else could. She softened him when he wanted to be cruel; she had given him hope when he had thought it was futile.</p><p>Aiden stepped out onto the porch of the cabin, gazing out at the darkness of night, which had fallen over the compound. He could barely glimpse the high walls that ringed the ten-acre compound. Set with motion sensors and guarded by a team of highly trained enforcers and guard dogs, the chances of the area being breached were slim. But they were still enclosed, imprisoned in many ways. There was no place on earth that was truly safe.</p><p>The compound now held over two hundred Wolf Breed inhabitants, from the ages of sixteen to early thirties, and more straggled in monthly. There were several small prides of Feline Breeds that had come in, but they were quickly transferred to Callan in Kentucky, where a similar protective area had been set up.</p><p>Six years after the breaking story of the Genetics Council and theirhorrors, and still there was no resolution. The monsters still practiced their evil, and finding and destroying their Labs was becoming harder each year. Aiden often feared that it would never end.</p><p>\u201cAiden.\u201dDr. Armani stepped from the shadows of the night, joining him on the porch.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asleep. Let her rest for now,\u201d he bit out, his body tensing at the thought of Charity being awakened by yet another scientist set on more experiments.</p><p>A sigh broke the night. Regretful, yet tinged with mockery.</p><p>\u201cI never knew how selfish you could be,\u201d she snorted. \u201cI thought you were more the beta type. Where did you hide all these alpha tendencies over the years?\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest as he leaned against the rough wood of the cabin and stared at her. He was the damned security expert here, what made her think he didn\u2019t know how to fight?</p><p>\u201cEven genius doctors can be wrong, it seems,\u201d he said as though in regret. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll survive the mistake, though.This time.\u201d</p><p>She grunted in disbelief. \u201cI need to see her when she wakes up. You know that. I would have preferred to have seen her before you mated her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve discussed this.\u201d He tensed as he watched her. \u201cShe\u2019s not strong enough for more tests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need samples, Aiden. I don\u2019t need her body to run the preliminary tests. If she conceives, then your opinion won\u2019t matter. Charity knows the score here. When she\u2019s more herself, you won\u2019t be able to stop her from coming to me.\u201d</p><p>Aiden bared his teeth at her statement. \u201cYou forget, Armani, she is in my cabin, in my care.My mate. She will do as I say.\u201d</p><p>Armani smiled. Just like that, her teeth flashing in the dark as she sat down slowly in the wide, rough wood chair he had made weeks before. She crossed her legs casually, adjusted her light jacket and regarded him with a mocking glitter in her gaze.</p><p>\u201cHow the mighty will fall,\u201d she sighed sarcastically. \u201cThe male mind truly amazes me. The male Breed mind astounds me. What makes you think you can stop her, Aiden? Will you tie her to your bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have to.\u201dHe wanted to snarl, but he knew exactly how cutting the little woman could be. He had no desire to be on the wrong end of her cutting sarcasm.</p><p>She shook her head sadly. \u201cCharity is well aware of the importance of what\u2019s going on here. Trust me, Aiden; you can\u2019t control her just because it\u2019s your wish to do so. She\u2019s stronger than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t argue with you, Armani,\u201d he growled, careful to keep his voice low.</p><p>\u201cAiden, I have never considered you a stupid man. Don\u2019t start playing the role now.\u201d Her voice was cold, lethal in its sarcasm. \u201cNot just Charity\u2019s survival, but the survival of your race depends on her at this point. Don\u2019t let your possessive instincts destroy the good that came of what they did to her. She would only hate you for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know this?\u201d he bit out. \u201cYou have no idea who or what she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,and here is where you show your ignorance once again,\u201d she sighed in regret. \u201cCharity was, from the very beginning, a plant within the Council, Aiden. A very well hidden mole whose job it was to keep a careful accounting of everything that went on, day by day.All the tests, all the results. How do you think we\u2019ve gained the information we have so far?\u201d</p><p>Aiden\u2019s eyes narrowed in suspicion. \u201cWho is this \u2018we\u2019?\u201d he asked her carefully. She sighed again. \u201cDo you think I am the only doctor who turned down the Council and suffered for it?</p><p>There were several of us. You know how hard I\u2019ve worked, Aiden, for your people. There are others who have worked with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you mention this before?\u201d he asked her coldly. \u201cThis information seems rather convenient, Armani.More of a carefully prepared lie than any hidden truth.\u201d</p><p>Yet, hadn\u2019t Charity told him that it had been she who had contacted the journalists six years before? She had finally been caught in her deceit against the Council while helping the Winged Breeds. She had been in three of the Labs the Wolf Breed Enforcers had received information on, only to escape with the scientists before they could be caught. She had been in several of the Labs that freed Feline Breeds had sworn she had aided them at, in various ways.</p><p>He cursed.A low, vicious sound that grated on his own ears. Armani\u2019s chuckle didn\u2019t help the anger growing inside him.</p> <p>\u201cThe fun part in dealing with judgmental assholes, is watching them fall when the truth finally hits them. Welcome to the real world, Aiden. Let\u2019s see, you\u2019ve hated and reviled your mate for six years, and still you haven\u2019t even questioned how she came to be your mate.Or if she is even truly your mate. Have you even considered thinking past your dick yet?\u201d</p><p>The woman had an evil mouth.</p><p>\u201cShe is my mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet days ago you stood before me and said quite the opposite.\u201d She tilted her head as she watched him knowingly. \u201cWhat changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d he snapped out.</p> <p>\u201cActually, it does. Let me tell you what I know, that you are unaware of, Aiden.\u201d She held up one hand and began counting down. \u201cNumber one; six years ago, to save your worthless hide, a virgin went to her knees and forced your erection when you would have died instead. In doing so, to hide the sudden swelling beneath her hands, she was forced to swallow your semen. The change in her body began days after. I have all the tests she ran on herself carefully documented. You didn\u2019t mark her, so the saliva where the Breed hormone is more prevalent didn\u2019t create the same effects Faith had from Jacob. But your semen created changes in Charity that were not apparent in Faith until after her mating withJacob, and her ingestion of...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, I don\u2019t need to hear about my sister\u2019s sex life.\u201d He pushed his fingers through his hair, trying to fight the knowledge that they were trembling.</p><p>\u201cYou are missing the point,\u201d she sighed in exasperation. \u201cThe point is,certain changes begin with certain sexual passages. Faith was merely in heat for six years. Uncomfortable, at times painful, but Charity has gone farther than this.</p><p>\u201cThe hormone in your semen reacted in an entirely different way. I won\u2019t get too technical on you, as I\u2019m certain you wouldn\u2019t understand,\u201d she said, her tone superior, knowing. \u201cBut the fact of the matter is, she was the perfect specimen for the Council, because her body already had your DNA infecting her, slowly, too slowly, shaping itself and her ovaries, to prepare her to accept your unique sperm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to the fucking point,\u201d he snarled. He was sick of the lesson in biology and her careful sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cThe point is,\u201d she said with heavy patience. \u201cThe scientists found a way to advance the ovarian change. Her eggs must be compatible with your sperm to breed. To this point, neither my colleagues normyself</p> <p>have figured out a way to do this. Charity\u2019s body holds the answers. To help your sister and your Pack Leader\u2019s mate, we must know those answers, Aiden. Charity knows this, the rest of us know this, now you must accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey hurt her,\u201d he said softly, unable to still the rage that climbed inside his body at the thought of it.</p><p>\u201cShe nearly bled to death in my arms, whispering of rest. She sleeps now as though she hasn\u2019t slept in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t, Aiden.\u201d Armani\u2019s voice was now filled with regret, with compassion. \u201cShe has worked tirelessly to help others, even though she knew time was running out for her. Her body was making demands she couldn\u2019t answer, and the Council was growing more suspicious of her. Now that she\u2019s free, you won\u2019t be able to control her; you won\u2019t be able to bind her. You have no idea the nature, or the training of the woman you have taken. But I trust it will be amusing watching you learn.\u201d</p><p>She stood to her feet then, her dark eyes glittering from the rays of the moon, mockery lining her expression.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too smug to suit me,\u201d he bit out. \u201cWhat are you not telling me, Armani?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged slowly. \u201cThere are some things,Aiden, that you must find out for yourself. I look forward to watching you struggle through it. I expect it to be amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou find too much amusement at my expense,\u201d he grunted in disgust. Her laughter was light, amazingly feminine. \u201cI must find my pleasures, small though theyare, where I can. I gave up my fiction fetish for this practice,\u201d she growled irritably. \u201cI should be amused somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>She moved away then, obviously finished with him.</p><p>\u201cArmani,\u201d he called out softly.</p><p>She paused, glancing over her shoulder questioningly. \u201cI pity you should a Breed mate with you. You may find we\u2019re a bit more intelligent than you give us credit for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never imagined you weren\u2019t, Aiden.\u201d Her smile was less than comforting. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting on you to prove it. As for a breeding; ah well, we will see should it happen, perhaps. We shall see.\u201d</p><p>She turned back and walked away from the cabin slowly. Her shoulders were stiffly straight, her stride determined, though not hurried. A grin edged his mouth. Damn, he wanted to be there should it occur that she did mate with another Breed. Watching the doctor fall would be more than amusing.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Charity came awake slowly, for the first time in more months than she could recall there was no pain, no racking shudders twisting through her body. But the depths and severity of the arousal had changed. What had once been agony was now a deep-seated compulsion.</p><p>Behind her, Aiden slept deeply. His arm was wrapped around her waist, keeping her back locked to his chest, his body sheltering hers. His heat surrounded her, warming her. That cold core of agony that had once been lodged in the very depths of her midsection was no longer there. Instead, heat burned. She could feel the arousal tingling over her body. Like starvation, or an unquenched thirst, she couldn\u2019t convince it to ease. There, of course, had to be a scientific reason for the change, she thought, concentrating on the clinical rather than the physical aspects of the changes overwhelming her.Which meant she needed a lab. She needed blood work, vaginal and saliva samples; the list went on. If Nicole Armani were here with the Breeds, then she would have a lab. She would have the supplies and the equipment needed for the tests.</p><p>\u201cDo not move.\u201d Aiden\u2019s voice was husky and deep as she prepared to do just that. Charity bit her lip as she felt his breath fan over the tender wound at her shoulder. When she felt the long canines bite into her flesh the night before, she had expected to awaken in more pain than she had started out with. The wound wasn\u2019t painful. Rather it was sensitive, receptive to his lightest breath and aching for a deeper caress.</p><p>She fought to keep her mind distant from his touch as his hands stroked the clenching muscles of her abdomen, easing the ripples in her womb. She needed to keep as much information as possible in the forefront of her mind. The changes overwhelming her once again were varied and intense. The pain was gone, but she didn\u2019t like the sensations that had moved in instead. She closed her eyes as she fought her response to him. His cock was swelling along her buttocks now, thick and hard. The thickness of the Breed cock was overwhelming anyway. Talk about being packed. It had taken both hands to wrap around it in the Lab, and hiding the fist-sized knot that had risen halfway in the shaft had nearly been impossible.</p><p>What it had done to her cunt amazed her, even now. She should have ruptured.Should have been so filled with him that she was damaged forever. Instead, the overly sensitive tissue of her cunt had relaxed, eased,accepted the possession rather than tearing in protest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too hard,\u201d he whispered at her ear. \u201cI remember that look on your face, Charity. As thoughyour are deciphering a particularly difficult puzzle.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened, her head tilting to glance at him as he watched her from behind her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou used to watch me?\u201d It had been so long ago, but she thought she remembered every detail of their time in those damned Labs. \u201cI never saw you watching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to see.\u201d He lowered his head, his tongue swiping over the wound at her shoulder. Charity couldn\u2019t control the shudder that worked over her body. Oh, that felt good. Better than good. It was almost climactic, almost a sexual actitself . She bit her lower lip, fighting the moan that would have escaped her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked breathlessly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you want me to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had thought I was watching you, you would have changed,\u201d he breathed at her ear, his voice smoky, rough with arousal as his cock heated her backside. \u201cI wanted you to react naturally. I wanted to see your expressions, see the myriad emotions that would chase across your face when you thought no one was looking.\u201d</p><p>Charity whimpered in longing as he turned her more fully to her back. He leaned over her, his silvery eyes gleaming with sexual intent as his hand stroked her tight abdomen almost absently.</p><p>\u201cEvery time I looked at you, all I could think about was fucking you,\u201d he said ruefully. \u201cDo you have any idea how hard it was to control my body?My need for you? Each drug injected in my body made me weaker, took more strength to fight. I cannot tell you the times I nearly lost all control.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise, then in shock as his palm slid between her thighs. Charity couldn\u2019t halt her whimper of desire. She lifted to his touch, her thighs falling open of their own accord, giving him easier access to the flesh he now cupped in his hand.</p><p>There was so much to do. So many things she needed to make sense of, to find the answers to, yet her mind was fragmented, her body\u2019s demands so intense, so desperate, she couldn\u2019t hold onto the sensibility needed to probe into the puzzle before her.</p><p>\u201cSo lose control now,\u201d she whispered heatedly. The feel of his hand between her thighs, his fingers probing into her creamed slit, was driving her insane.</p><p>Practical thought was merely a whisper of a memory of what she should do. The heavy ache in her body was a demanding scream for what she better do. She needed him, every hard inch burrowing inside her clenching cunt.</p><p>His lips quirked slowly, his eyes darkening as he watched her closely.</p><p>\u201cI can still see your mind working,\u201d he whispered, his voice thick with amused patience.\u201cAs though you are cataloging and filing away each response, each sensory reaction. I don\u2019t like this clinical side you possess, Charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho can think like this?\u201d She licked her lips, desperate for his kiss. \u201cTrust me,Aiden, my mind is completely on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have no doubts there,\u201d he said gently, his fingers strumming against her wet, inner lips. He was teasing her, deliberately, knowingly. \u201cYet a part of you is watching all this, clinically dissecting each touch, each sensation, as though it were no more than an experiment.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed for a second with anger before it was carefully hidden, as though his knowledge of her attempts to reason out why and what caused such reactions angered him.</p><p>\u201cWhat more can itbe ?\u201d she asked him, watching him, not bothering to hide the conflicts within herself.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t mates, Aiden. Not as you think we are. It\u2019s the drugs...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell it is,\u201d he snarled. \u201cDo you think when the drugs are out of your system, that you will be free of me? That before the drugs you weren\u2019t destined to react to me this way? You are fooling yourself, Charity. You know this.\u201d</p><p>She breathed in roughly as his fingers moved suddenly, parting her, pressing deep inside her. She shuddered in reaction, her pussy rippling in response. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou grew wet for me before the drugs,\u201d he charged, staring down at her, daring her to deny it.</p><p>\u201cIt was only lust,\u201d she cried out. \u201cLust and some measure of caring, of hope that you would survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie.\u201d She watched him warily as he bit the words out with enough force to cause the primal, instinctive growl to echo through the room. \u201cDo you think, Charity, had I marked you before the drugs, that you would have escaped this need for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll we have to do is find a cure.\u201d She arched uncontrollably, her thighs clenching on his hand as his fingers moved gently inside her.</p><p>That gentleness was so at odds with his expression that she felt held on an edge of fear and excruciating pleasure.</p><p>\u201cA cure?\u201d he asked her carefully. \u201cDo you believe there is a cure for this, Charity?\u201d His fingers moved, pulling back,then plunging forcibly inside her once again.</p><p>Charity couldn\u2019t halt the scream that escaped her throat, or the pleasure that ripped through her body. Tiny fingers of electric energy stroked through every nerve ending. Her cunt spasmed around the two broad fingers as the hard caress drove her ever closer to the brink of climax.</p><p>\u201cAiden, don\u2019t torture me this way.\u201d She shivered, feeling his fingers inside her, stretching her, preparing her.</p><p>He leaned closer as she watched him, his expression tight, angry and aroused. He bent to her until his lips were almost touching hers, tempting her until she licked her lips in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cTake my tongue as you did the last time, Charity,\u201d he whispered. \u201cShow me how desperately you want me.\u201d</p><p>As she had last time, sucking it, glorying in the unusual taste that filled her senses.In a distant part of her brain, she knew she should be wary of doing such a thing. The sensations had increased, had inflamed her senses in such ways...</p><p>His tongue slipped between her lips, and before she could help it, her lips closed over it, her tongue stroking it back as she suckled it into her mouth. She tasted a burst of sweet spice in her mouth, a summer rainstorm, a fiery shock of need that completely overwhelmed her. Her arms went to his shoulders, her nails gripping at his flesh as he kissed her. Carnal, greedy, his lips moved over her, his tongue stroking hers even as she fought to draw more of the incredible taste into her mouth, her senses.</p><p>The arm beneath her shoulder dragged her closer as his head tilted to deepen the possession of her mouth. The hand between her thighs worked her pussy into a furious flame of need. The sounds of moist thrusts and her strangled moans mixed with his hard groans, echoing around her in a heady symphony of hunger.</p><p>When he tore his mouth free of her, she cried out in longing, reaching for him, desperate to experience</p><p>the mix of fiery temptation and sweet longing she could literally taste against her own tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d he groaned, his lips moving along her jaw to the sensitive skin of her neck, then her shoulder.</p><p>When his lips clamped on the wound, and his tongue began to stroke her with moist, hot swipes, she fought to breathe through the pleasure, and the rapidly rising heat in her body. Her blood felt as though it were boiling in her veins. Heating her from the inside out, burning her alive with the need for his touch over every inch of her body. The light stroking thrusts of his fingers inside her cunt only drove her higher, made her wilder.</p><p>\u201cMate,\u201d he growled as he moved over her, his fingers sliding free of her body as she cried out in protest.</p><p>\u201cAdmit it, Charity, you are my mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours.\u201dShe would have screamed the word if she could have found the breath to do so.\u201cYours, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>He moved between her thighs, his groan matching her strangled cry as his cock nudged against the wet opening of her pussy. Then she felt it again.The hard spurt of thick liquid warmth. She fought to clear her head, to analyze what it could be.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think,\u201d he whispered, pressing the head deeper into her opening. She felt it again, felt the rippling response of her sensitive tissue to it. Feathery fingers of reaction seemed to quake inside her, driving her crazy with the hard vibrations of longing that washed over her. She needed him inside her.Deep.Hard.</p> <p>Her senses were overwhelmed, her body screaming for relief as he slowly pressed in, filling her, possessing her. She was aware of the ejaculations from his cock at alternate phases of the entrance. Each one shook his body, heated her further. She stared up at him, dazed, fighting for sanity and realizing he had no intentions of allowing her to grasp it once again.</p><p>\u201cThere, baby,\u201d he whispered gently when he was seated fully inside her. His cock nudged against her cervix, feeling as though it were now lined perfectly to receive his release. She trembled, watching the stormy depths of his eyes, seeing the sexual intent in his expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d she cried out, her hands sliding to his arms, her thighs spread wide for him, knees bent as she pressed harder into the impalement.</p><p>\u201cMating with you, Charity,\u201d he whispered deeply. \u201cFeel our bodies. Will you ever fit so perfectly with another male? Ever feel so deeply?\u201d</p><p>Mating her.Hewas possessing her.Owning her. Tears sprang to her eyes, though her body gripped him with greedy intent.</p><p>\u201cDrugs,\u201d she whispered desperately, denying his claims. \u201cIt\u2019s the drugs.\u201d</p><p>Her neck arched as he pulled his cock nearly out of the clutching depths of her pussy, only to return with a hot, full thrust that stroked her nerve endings with delicious fire.</p><p>\u201cDrugs?\u201dHis voice vibrated with lust, with anger. \u201cFeel me, Charity. Did the drugs shape your body?</p><p>Did they shape this hot little pussy to fit me so perfectly? Feel me, damn you.\u201d He pressed deeper into her. \u201cThe opening of your womb aligns perfectly to my cock, its greedy mouth opened for my seed, and you callthis drugs ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden, please.\u201dShe was shuddering convulsively, so desperate for release now she felt as though the need would kill her.</p><p>As though he could no longer help himself, he began to thrust inside her, hard and heavy, taking her, stroke after stroke of fire as she panted and fought for breath.</p><p>\u201cI will prove to you, mate,\u201d he growled as one hand caught in her hair, pulling her head back to the side as his lips lowered to her shoulder. \u201cI will prove to you whether it is a mating or the drugs. Feel me, Charity. Feel me all the way to your soul.\u201d</p><p>His lips covered the mark at her shoulder, his teeth scraping it as he began to fuck her hard, fast. Her cunt tightened around the piston strokes plunging inside it, opening,then clamping around his cock as she lost the last shred of sanity she could have claimed.</p><p>Brilliant arcs of pleasure whipped through her body, mixing with the pinching pain as her cunt stretched to accommodate the breadth of his cock. She couldn\u2019t fight the pleasure, couldn\u2019t fight the needs that tore through her body. Her legs lifted, her ankles locking at the small of his back as she arched closer. The new position placed her swollen clit in line for his pelvis to caress it heatedly on each downward stroke as she pressed harder into the thrust.Her cunt spasmed around his cock, drowning her with pleasure. It was too good.Too hot.Too much. Her nails bit into his shoulders as his thrusts increased and she felt the hard, deep swelling in his cock begin.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She fought his hold on her hair, but the tugging pressure was just another caress, another sensation adding to the others. \u201cAiden, please,\u201d she screamed out his name as she felt her pussy clamp harder on him, instinctively preparing for what was to come. Her womb shuddered, her nipples swelling harder against his chest, the blood surging through her veins, harder, faster, erupting...</p><p>When her orgasm hit her, she lost herself. All she knew, all she could feel was the agonizing pleasure that pulsed over her as Aiden locked inside her, his cock filling her, his seed spurting inside her with heated blasts of yet more sensation.</p><p>The pleasure/pain whipped through every cell, every molecule of her body. Nerve endings exploded in rapture, muscle and tissue filled with ecstasy. Her keening cry as her legs locked tighter around him was rife with her pleasure, with her agony as her womb responded with a hard, breath-taking tremor. It stole her breath, washed over her with an echoing orgasm so fierce, so hot she knew it would change her forever.</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d His growl was a vibrating, animalistic sound at her shoulder as his body jerked with his own release.</p><p>A hard spurt of seed shot inside her. The knot anchoring him to herthrobbed, pulsed, as he shuddered in reaction. Seconds later, the action was repeated. Each throb of his cock was another pulse of agonizing</p><p>pleasure inside her body; another pulse of hot, rich semen through her womb. Her legs slid weakly from his hips, her arms falling to her sides as the swelling inside her cunt began to ease, the hard throb slowly fading away. Aiden\u2019s body was a comforting weight against her,a warmth she had thought she would never know.Until he moved.</p><p>She opened her eyes, watching carefully as he moved slowly to her side. Echoes of pleasure still trembled through her body, though the torturous arousal had, for the moment, been eased.</p><p>\u201cA mating.\u201dConfidence surged through his dark voice as he watched her. Regret filled her, washed over her as a small bitter smile shaped her lips.</p><p>\u201cA mating?\u201d she asked him sadly. \u201cNo, Aiden, not a mating.A reaction.Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cYour feet are doing much better. Evidently the fucking drugs were good for something.\u201d</p><p>He had fed her, bathed her, dried her, helped her dress, then re-bandaged her feet after apply the healing salve to the rapidly healing welts on her feet the next morning. He hadn\u2019t acknowledged her denial of the mating the night before, or this morning.</p><p>It infuriated him. He could feel the knowledge of their mating clear to his bones. It was a part of him. His body would not lock to her, the swelling would not occur, if she wasn\u2019t his mate. And it had occurred before the drugs had been given to her. He knew and he knew she knew it. Yet still she denied it.</p><p>\u201cI need to see Armani,\u201d she told him as he straightened before her and picked up the comb he had laid on the night table, beside the bed.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the mattress, watching him warily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of this. Turn around and I\u2019ll comb your hair.\u201d</p><p>She turned slowly, sitting cross-legged on the bed as he began to work the tangles free of her damp hair.</p><p>\u201cAiden.\u201dHer voice was tired. Even after the hearty breakfast he had forced on her and the long bath, she still looked too pale, her body trembling at the least exertion.</p><p>\u201cI called Armani while you were soaking,\u201d he told her quietly, knowing he couldn\u2019t put it off any longer.</p><p>\u201cNo tests, Charity. Your body isn\u2019t ready for it, even though you believe it is. The arousal and resulting sexual activity is too much as it is. I won\u2019t allow you to push yourself further than absolutely necessary.\u201d</p><p>Her body relaxed, though only marginally.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He heard the relief in her voice and wondered at the clenching of his chest.</p><p>\u201cCharity,\u201d he whispered, leaning close to her as she trembled beneath his hands. \u201cYou have your hopes set that there is a cure for this need you have of me. There is no cure. It is natural.Whether you admit it or not.\u201d</p><p>He heard her breath hitch as though she were holding back tears. He didn\u2019t check to see if it were true, didn\u2019t want to know if it was. To know she cried because of the bond they shared would shatter something inside him, he thought. He had somehow, in the space of a few short days, lost the hatred that had sustained him for six long years.</p><p>That change alone was abrupt enough. To realize his acceptance of her as his mate, and to have her deny it, more than bothered him. It infuriated him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a virus,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI\u2019ve tracked it that far. It\u2019s triggered by a hormone in the male semen that infects the ovaries...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, Charity.\u201d He smiled, though with an edge of sadness as helay his finger against her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t have any desire to know how or why it occurs. If you need this to accept what cannot be changed, then I won\u2019t fight you. But neither will I allow you to harm yourself in the process. Armani knows this, and she knows to take care. But you will hear it as well. If I see it affecting you adversely, then I will put a stop to it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She lifted a brow mockingly, causing his cock to twitch at the implied defiance. \u201cI\u2019m weak, Aiden, not stupid.\u201d</p><p>He sighed wearily. \u201cNo, you are not stupid, just incredibly stubborn. That stubbornness makes me horny, Charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell gee, Aiden, why not just be romantic about it,\u201d she snorted as her face flushed with arousal and shyness.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t help himself. He knelt before her, took her face in his hands and laid his lips on hers. He felt the silken curves tremble as they parted beneath the touch. And he waited. He went no further, just the gentle stroking of lips against lips until her tongue peeked out and stroked timidly at him. Her hands rose to his shoulders, slid to his neck as he fought to keep the kiss soft, comforting, despite the heat that rose between them. He could feel her in every cell of his body as her kiss stroked the fire in his cock brighter. Finally, in desperation he pulled back.</p><p>His thumb slid over the moist curves.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I missed the romance classes during training,\u201d he said regretfully, moving away from her as a knock sounded at the door. \u201cThat would be the good doctor,\u201d he sighed then and headed for the door. He had promised himself he would allowthis, that he would tamp down his possessive instincts, his fury that somehow she would be weakened further. He strode quickly for the door and swung it open. Armani stood there, that damned mocking glint in her eye, a smug smile about her mobile mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou trained her too well,\u201d he bit out as he moved aside for her to enter. She didn\u2019t enter. Instead she watched him closely.</p><p>\u201cBefore I see her, I want to know if you have taken her anally yet.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes the damned woman could be too nosy. He often wondered if she didn\u2019t do it deliberately, just to keep the rest of them off balance.</p><p>Aiden clenched his teeth. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally bit out. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>She nodded abruptly.\u201cAnother thing. Physically, how is she holding up?\u201d</p><p>Why the hell was she asking him?</p><p>\u201cSee foryourself ,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She shook her head.\u201cYour opinion first, Aiden. I don\u2019t ask lightly.\u201d</p> <p>He breathed in deeply. \u201cShe\u2019s trembling, even now. She\u2019s pale and weak, and the arousal is draining her strength. I worry...\u201d And for that reason he had allowed the testing to begin. She nodded abruptly and forged into the room, breezing past him as though he was no longer there. Aiden shook his head and closed the door. He knew that as far as she was concerned, he was no longer there.</p><p>Now, did he leave, or did he stay? He turned and paced to the kitchen table and sat down to wait. No way in hell was he leaving.</p><p>\u201cCharity, it\u2019s good to see you.\u201d Nikki\u2019s smile was wide, her black eyes filled with humor and more knowledge than she likely needed, Charity thought as the other woman walked into the room.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout time you got here,\u201d she griped. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you let Aiden hold you off that long.\u201d</p><p>She knew Nikki. She could have easily steamed right over Aiden at any given time. Nikki shrugged.\u201cStubborn man. Breeds are not always logical, Charity. Of course, we\u2019re talking the male Breeds here. Often the females show a bit more sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often?\u201dCharity asked in amusement.</p><p>\u201cHmm, sometimes,\u201d Nikki laughed as she dragged the chair from the wall over to the bed. \u201cThere.\u201d She sat down heavily, leaning back in the padded comfort of the seat. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Charity sighed. Nikki didn\u2019t have to say what she wanted to know; Charity knew the drill by now.</p> <p>\u201cKeegan knows much more than I do,\u201d she sighed wearily. \u201cAll I really know is that the incision made</p><p>into the womb was to apply the drugs directly and to view certain changes within the womb. They didn\u2019t check the ovaries, though, which is where I believe the change is occurring. Those tests were scheduled to begin soon. They were beginning to suspect many of the conclusions I\u2019ve come to myself.\u201d</p><p>Nikki nodded. \u201cI have tracked it that far myself, with Hope and Faith\u2019s help. The blood, saliva and vaginal samples I took while you were unconscioussupports this. The changes are much more advanced in your body, though.\u201d</p><p>Charity nodded then glanced at her friend. \u201cThey had samples of Aiden\u2019s semen, Nikki. They had the records from that last night in the Labs. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but when they matched the anomalies in my blood to his semen, the injections began. After that, there\u2019s very little that I can tell you. I just don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe how isn\u2019t as important as figuring out what they accomplished,\u201d Nikki sighed.\u201cBastards. They never were very smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki, we have to find a way to reverse it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSoon, before I actually conceive.\u201d</p><p>Nikki rubbed her brow worriedly as Charity watched her.</p><p>\u201cDoes Aiden know you love him, Charity?\u201d she finally asked her curiously. Shock shot through her. \u201cIt\u2019s the drugs...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharity, even I knew, six years ago, that you loved this man. Does he know?\u201d</p><p>Charity shook her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t love, Nikki. It really wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want him to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201dNikki watched her for long silent moments. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s get started then.\u201d The other woman picked up the thick black bag she carried with her as she rose to her feet. \u201cYou know what I need, Charity.\u201d</p><p>Charity glanced at the doorway.</p><p>\u201cHe knows better.\u201d Nikki didn\u2019t follow her gaze. \u201cHe won\u2019t come in here unless we call him, or you cry out.\u201d She looked at her. \u201cCan you stand for me to touch you?\u201d</p><p>Charity drew in a deep breath as she rubbed her arms. Already her body seemed to be rejecting the very idea of it. She could feel her skin crawling, prickling at the thought of what was to come. Bad memories, she tried to tell herself. That was all. But somehow she knew that wasn\u2019t entirely true.</p><p>\u201cIs it normal?\u201d she asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cVery normal, it would appear,\u201d Nikki sighed.\u201cMakes it damned hard to get any kind of samples at all during the first phases of the mating. Hope couldn\u2019t bear to be touched in any way for weeks after Wolfe first took her. Faith had only been marked when I first tested her, so it wasn\u2019t so bad. By the time she returned with Jacob, she had already passed the first phase. I\u2019m hoping I can get the samples I need with you, Charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt eased for them?\u201d Charity frowned, wondering what miracle it would take for that to occur.\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Nikki grimaced. \u201cAs I understand it, it has something to do witha certain strength of climax. Once that\u2019s reached, it eases.\u201d</p><p>She was hedging. Charity\u2019s eyes narrowed on her.</p><p>\u201cKeep going,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cNowhere to go.\u201dNikki shrugged as she pulled a pair of surgical gloves over her slender hands. The band snapped against her wrist as she pulled the last one in place. \u201cThough it seems it occurred in those two during anal sex. I\u2019m hoping to find a mate soon who can achieve it the normal way.\u201d Her voice was carefully bland, though her eyes were sharp as she watched her. Charity blinked up at her, shock rolling through her system. \u201cLet\u2019s hope we can find a cure then,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think the anal thing is going to work.\u201d</p><p>Nikki chuckled as she prepared the syringe for a blood sample. \u201cYes, well, we can hope.Though I was thinking more along other lines. Now, let\u2019s see if I can get a sample.\u201d</p><p>The examination was horrendous. If Charity had thought it had been bad in the Labs, strapped to the gurney, her body protesting every touch, this was worse.</p><p>Each touch was agony. Like knives scraping the flesh from her bones as Nikki touched her, no matter how gently.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Charity.\u201dThe other woman\u2019s whisper, though pitched low, was still concerned nearly an hour later. \u201cWe\u2019re almost finished.\u201d</p><p>Charity breathed in roughly as the other woman probed at her stomach, checking the inflammation of the ovaries that Charity knew had occurred. She knew her body, knew the changes in it had to be examined, tested, but she didn\u2019t know how much more she could bear.</p><p>Sweat covered her body, saturated her clothing. Her fists were clenched in the blankets as she fought the gut wrenching protest each time Nikki touched her. She had started at the mark Aiden had left. A sample of the skin had been taken, the area checked thoroughly as Charity flinched, and the reaction had only grown worse as the doctor moved farther down.</p><p>\u201cCharity, I must have vaginal samples,\u201d she said gently, glancing back at the door. \u201cCan you hold on just a bit longer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry.\u201dShe was naked, shaking from a chill she knew didn\u2019t truly exist, and terrified she couldn\u2019t hold onto her control long enough.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201dAiden\u2019s voice was coldly furious as he stalked into the room, startling the two women. \u201cGod damn, Armani,look at what the hell you\u2019ve done to her. Get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Charity gasped as he moved to her, his expression nearly murderous as he went to jerk the doctor away from her. \u201cAiden, help me.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop the shaking in her body, the chill racking her.</p><p>\u201cPlease, she has to finish.\u201d</p><p>He stopped staring at her in surprise. \u201cCharity, it\u2019s killing you. You look like a fucking corpse,\u201d he yelled down at her as she flinched in reaction. \u201cWhat the hell would you have me to do?\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, knowing what he had to do. \u201cHold me down,\u201d she bit out. \u201cLet her finish the exam, Aiden. Please, you have to help me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Her screams still echoed in his head. Aiden sat on the porch ignoring the silent doctor who sat in the swing on the other end and stared out at the slowly darkening sky. His hands were trembling. He stared down at them, wondering bleakly if he had ever trembled likethis? Even as a child he hadn\u2019t been a nervous type. His hands had stayed strong; fear had never broken him. Yet now, he trembled like a babe during a hard chill.</p><p>Not nearly as hard as Charity had shook, though. And she had screamed. The moment Armani had begun the vaginal examination her screams had torn from her throat. And he had been forced to hold her down, watching her eyes, wild and terrified as her body protested any touch other than his own.</p><p>\u201cHow long will she sleep?\u201d He cleared his throat, still fighting the reaction that had set in the moment he left the cabin.</p><p>\u201cHopefully, a while.\u201dArmani\u2019s voice was thick, filled with regret.</p><p>\u201cDid you get what you needed?\u201d He couldn\u2019t look at her. He was afraid if he did, he would kill her. Then he remembered her tears. The one time he had allowed himself to glance at her, tears had streamed from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI hope to God I did,\u201d she finally bit out. \u201cDear God, Aiden, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to her. Her ovaries areswollen, her cervix is open as though she were in the last stages of pregnancy rather than the first stages of fertility. Neither Hope nor Faith experienced such pain. How do you bring yourself to take her?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her in surprise. \u201cWhen I touch her, Armani, her body knows only pleasure. It was your touch that brought her pain.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered as he spoke. \u201cGod, Aiden. I don\u2019t know how to help her. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her,\u201d he bit out. \u201cUntil the mating is complete, Nikki, no other can touch her. I tried to tell you this, tried to explain what I felt.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYou knew this?\u201d</p><p>He pushed his fingers through his hair in agitation. \u201cNot consciously. The thought of you testing her was abhorrent to me, and I couldn\u2019t explain why. This was why. I knew instinctively...\u201d He paused as he shook his head.\u201c I knew what it would do to her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFaith and Hope have not advanced this far in the change,\u201d she whispered as she stood to her feet and picked up the bag that contained her samples. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, Aiden.Or how to help her.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head wearily. \u201cThere is no cure,\u201d he said softly. \u201cShe thinks this can be fixed. You think it can be fixed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden, I know it can\u2019t be fixed. And I think Charity knows as well. You hear her words, but I saw her fears.\u201d She walked over to him, sitting down beside him on the steps of the porch. \u201cWhen she was in the Labs, the few times I was able to talk to her, she asked about you. Were you doing well? Had you found someone to care for you? Did you ever ask of her? These questions came out in many different ways, but they were always there. And the emotions behind them terrify her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is a mating...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Aiden. Not like you try to convince yourself. Charity loved you before you ever shot that semen down her throat. She talked of you, wrote about you, and worried herself to the point of tears that you would manage to get yourself killed before the rescue could be pulled off. This isn\u2019t a mating for her, it\u2019s a loving. And it\u2019s that part of it that she denies.\u201d</p><p>Aiden shook his head. He had known that, somewhere deep inside himself. But whatever love may have existed for Charity must have died long ago. And whatever ability he may have had to live had slowly withered away in his fight for survival. He was too hard, too dominating.</p><p>\u201cWhat of her body?\u201d he finally asked. \u201cI can touch her, love her for hours and never cause her pain. What happened in there?\u201d</p><p>She stared into the night as he glanced at her. In repose, her expression was frowning, thoughtful. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to the Feline Breeds,\u201d she finally said. \u201cTo a small extent, Hope and Faith have experienced it, though not to such an extreme. Why, I\u2019m not certain, but I intend to find out.\u201d</p> <p>She stood to her feet, stepping down to the ground before turning back to face him.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks there\u2019s a cure, Aiden,\u201d she told him simply. \u201cYou and I both know better. Be careful how you deal with her, or she may run from you as well. If she does, we may never find her again.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat are you not telling me, Armani?\u201d</p><p>Her lips quirked secretively.\u201cThings that only Charity has the right to reveal to you.Watch your step, my friend, or you be may lose more than you ever dreamed of holding.\u201d</p><p>And with those words she turned and disappeared into the night. Aiden sighed wearily and walked back into the house, returning to his mate where she slept.</p><p>The sedative she had demanded halfway through the exam had made it a little easier on her. The fact that she had continued to demand the completion of it terrified him. She was desperate, certain there was a cure to the chemical reaction that bound their bodies to each other. Instinct warned Aiden there was no cure. No breaking the bonds nature hadlaid in place. He had accepted it; refused to fight it any longer. He had fed his hatred of her for years, but once he saw her again, once he touched her, he had begun accepting that he would never be free of her. What had</p> <p>happened in those Labs six years before didn\u2019t matter. She had done no more than he would have. She had saved her mate the only way she knew how. And now he would do the same. No more exams. He paced into the bedroom, undressing,staring at her as she slept restlessly. Until whatever changes her body was going through completed, no one else must be allowed to touch her, to weaken her. The progress she had made in the past two days had been destroyed within hours. She was pale once more, weak and in distress.</p><p>He moved into the bed beside her, pulling her into his arms. Her whimper caused his chest to tighten, his throat to close as she burrowed into his body. She was cold. Despite the blankets that had covered her, the fire burning across the room, she felt chilled to the bone. Finally, after agonizing seconds of body rubbing and burrowing, she found a spot that seemed to fit her. She sighed deeply and settled down to rest once again. Unfortunately, his cock was engorged now, throbbing, demanding the lithe body that had rubbed against it so sensually. He sighed tiredly. This mate business was getting more complicated by the day.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>\u201cI thought you might enjoy that ride into town today, since we didn\u2019t get to go before.\u201d</p><p>Aiden cleared the table of breakfast dishes the next morning before pulling his chair close to hers and lifting her feet to his lap. She was too quiet, too thoughtful. Too damned aroused. The scent of it was killing him. But first, he wanted her to relax, wanted her away from the compound, Armani, and a bed. She glanced up at him in surprise. \u201cI was wondering about that. Why do you want to do that?A drive-through?\u201d</p><p>He grinned up at her. \u201cTo see what I can see.\u201d</p><p>He watched the play of emotions across her face; foremost was the frustration at his vague answer. Her expressive face had always tantalized and amazed him. Others rarely noticed what he did.A shift of a brow, a certain glitter in her brown eyes, the slight twitch at her lip or the taut line of her nose, which could change at any given moment.</p><p>The subtle changes in the muscles of her face would have been undetectable, but for some reason, always drew his eye. It had been the same at the Lab.A careful shift of her body to draw attention to her breasts, which covered the movement of her hands. Or a bright agreeing smile, though the muscles at her eyes tightened, as he had noticed in each confrontation they had. The differences were varied, nearly undetectable, and most he found endearing. Especially the way her gaze seemed to still, watching him, waiting, her expression neutral, a clear indication she was becoming irritated.His lips quirked at the thought.</p> <p>\u201cIf anyone were going to attack us, they would use the town as a stopping point to gain the information they needed to do so. \u2018Find your enemies weakness\u2019 is always first priority. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d she answered slowly. The tip of her nose flexed, like a little twitch. Entranced at the small shifts, he continued.</p><p>\u201cYou and I will drive through town, perhaps stop at a fast food restaurant for a snack,just enjoy the day a bit before returning.As we do, there will be others watching, checking for oddities, or any undue attention being given us. Then we\u2019ll return here as the others wait around, listen to what is said, who is asking questions and what happens.\u201d</p><p>Her nose twitched again.Curiosity?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using the tactics the Council soldiers taught you to catch their assassins,\u201d she finally said slowly.</p><p>\u201cBasically.\u201dHe nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd they are aware of that.\u201d She tilted her head, her eyelids tightening as though she would have narrowed them. \u201cYou are underestimating your enemy now, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair as amusement swelled within him. \u201cTactics weren\u2019t your specialty, Charity,\u201d</p><p>he pointed out. \u201cI believe yours was blood work.\u201d</p><p>She was offended now. The muscles at her cheekbones tightened, the sunlight from the window could have made her eyes appear to flash with a darker color, but he doubted it. Anger, he believed, was the culprit.</p><p>\u201cAnd yours was arrogance,\u201d she sniffed, not bothering to hide the irritation in her voice. \u201cSure, Aiden, a ride into town would be nice. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve had a hamburger. I could handle one. And my feet are fine.\u201d</p><p>She pulled them back from his lap now, setting them carefully on the floor. Aiden stilled his grin, aware that it would take very little to ruin the pleasant mood she was trying to maintain. He wanted her fiery, wanted the blood pumping through her veins, sensitizing her body. He didn\u2019t want her angry, though. It would even be nice, he thought,if he could see her smile.A real smile. One filled with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cIf we could, I would like to stop and buy a few things I need. Some clothes, shoes and so forth. I can repay the expense...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Council canceled all your accounts, Charity,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cI have private accounts,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI never used the Council money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharity.\u201dHe gentled his voice, knowing the blow to come would hurt. \u201cYour personal accounts are intact, but empty. The funds were withdrawn six months before.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head, pushing her fingers wearily through her hair. \u201cI had hoped they wouldn\u2019t find them,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI should have known better, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re stronger, you will work within the compound here. You don\u2019t have to worry about money.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed. \u201cI don\u2019t need your pity, Aiden. I have other resources. It will just take a while to get to them. I would still appreciate the loan. I will pay it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe loan isn\u2019t a problem.\u201d He stood to his feet, determined to smooth her way, however he must.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stop at a few stores, get you what you need, but I won\u2019t allow you to tire yourself any more than you are already. So don\u2019t think you can sweet talk me into letting you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth almost dropped open. \u201cI have never tried to sweet talk you into anything, Aiden, other than saving your worthless hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways get your way don\u2019t you, honey,\u201d he griped. \u201cJust tie the boy up and play on his weaknesses. How the hell did you know you could make my cock that hard, anyway?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at the question. \u201cYou were so obvious, Aiden. Even limp your cock would throb when the drugs were in your system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou watched?\u201d He tried to sound scandalized as he snickered in open amusement. She drew in a deep, patient, sustaining breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d she grumped. \u201cWhat about that drive you promised me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled then, amazed that he could. The helpless irritation on her face, the flash of forced patience in her eyes, should have angered him. Instead it gave him hope. Hope for what, he wasn\u2019t certain yet.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>The early Colorado fall nights were crisp and cool. Perfect for a small fire and the warm coziness of the cabin Aiden had built. The day hadn\u2019t been easy. The demands her body was making were even more difficult to contend with. The pain was gone, but the arousal was more strongly present than ever before. Controlling it wasn\u2019t as hard as she had thought it would be. The friendly camaraderie she and Aiden had shared on the drive into town had helped. The bit of shopping she had done had been fun. The new clothes rather than Lab uniforms was nice. But now, as she fought to relax, to prepare for bed, her needs were making themselves strongly known.</p><p>After stacking her dishes from a light dinner into the dishwasher, she walked to the living room and the cheery fire that crackled in the fireplace between the living room and the bedroom. She pulled the extra large beanbag that sat against one wall to the front of the fire, and collapsed into it gratefully.</p><p>It cushioned her body, allowing her to relax as she extended her legs, pointing her feet to the warmth reflecting from the burning logs. The light gown she had donned after her shower rode to her thighs, allowing the warmth to flicker over the flesh there.</p><p>Closing her eyes she reveled in the peace, the sense of safety that permeated the Breed compound. Despite the high fences, the Enforcers and well-trained wolves, there was nothing here to remind her of the Labs and the imprisonment she had found there. But there was much here to remind her of Aiden. Each inhalation of air she breathed in was scented with him. The earthly male hint of sexuality and lust was nearly overpowering at times.Like now. When her body ached, when she wanted nothing more than to feel him against her, feel him touch her, despite her awareness of what was coming. Her breasts were swollen, the nipples hard and distended against the cotton gown she wore. Almost lazily her hands lifted. She was alone, relaxed, and she ached. Her hand went to the covered mounds, her teeth clamping on her lower lip as she fought a moan of purely sexual need. Her breasts were sensitive beneath her own fingers, her nipples rising harder to meet the touch of her fingers. She loosened the buttons that ran down the front of the garment until she could pull the edges back to expose the firm curves to the warmth of her hands. She needed Aiden\u2019s hands there. She gripped one nipple between two fingers, breathing in sharply at the sharp sting of pleasure that pulled a gasp from her lips. Aiden\u2019s hands were more calloused, larger than hers, but the fantasy worked at the edges of her mind. Aiden touching her, relieving the growing need building just beneath her flesh. He wasn\u2019t due back to the cabin for hours. She was safe, she thought as she breathed harshly in growing need. She needed relief, no matter how minor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One hand slid to her thighs, pushing the gown to her hips as her fingers moved to the bare flesh of her cunt. She jerked, shuddered, as a moan tore past her lips.</p><p>\u201cAiden,\u201d she whispered his name, seeing him there, perhaps watching her, his eyes growing dark as she stroked her own body.</p><p>Would he like that? Would his cock thicken, become erect at the sight of her fingers pushing through the narrow slit of her cunt lips? In her fantasy, it did. She stroked around her swollen clit, feeling the piercing lust that shuddered through her womb at the touch.</p><p>Her inner lips were swollen, sensitized from her arousal. The cream from her body coated them heavily, allowing her fingers to slide easily between them until they met the entrance to her gripping vagina.</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201dShe couldn\u2019t stop her cry as she pressed two fingers inside. Her pussy gushed at the pleasure, the muscles clamping around her fingers, begging for more. The wash of sensations was almost agonizing. Heat seared her fingers, her cunt,the lightest stroke into the tight muscles echoing through her body with pulsing vibrations of rapturous pleasure. She spread her legs further, the muscles of her thighs tightening as the ache rippled from her vagina to her clit. Like a firestorm of erotic torment, the sensations whipped through her body, torturing her with the need for release. She could feel them licking over her flesh with a phantom stroke, edging her passion and her need higher.</p><p>She pulled her fingers back slowly, whimpering at the surging intensity before she pushed them forward in a quick stroke designed to mimic Aiden\u2019s thrusting cock. Not nearly as good, but she couldn\u2019t halt her cry at the flash of piercing need that shuddered through her body. The heel of her palm pressed against her swollen clit, intensifying the lustful pressure. Her cunt clenched, the empty hunger radiating through her body as she fought to bring herself to climax. It had always worked before. Always, yet no matter how she fought, no matter how deeply she pushed her fingers into the sweltering depths of her pussy, she could find no relief. Her head was thrown back as she fought for relief, whimpering sighs of desperation gasping from her lips when she first felt the gentle lick to the back of her cream coated hand. Charity\u2019s eyes sprang open, her head lifting, her gaze caught by the hot intensity of Aiden\u2019s look as he watched her from between her spread thighs. He was on his knees before her, naked, his dark face heavy with sensuality, his tongue reaching out to lick her again. A forceful lick accompanied by a growl that seemed to vibrate through her hand, into the hungry depths of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cDo you know just how fucking beautiful you look to me right now?\u201d His voice was dark, heavy with lust.</p><p>When she moved to pull her hand back, he stopped her, pressing his against it until her fingers sank inside her tight flesh once again. He watched the movement, his cheekbones reddening as hunger seemed to glow in his expression.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLet me watch you, Charity. Take yourself as I watch.\u201d</p><p>It was the most erotic thing she had ever known in her life. Watching him\u2014his gaze trained on her fingers, his tongue reaching out to lick at the slick slide of her juices\u2014overwhelmed her. His tongue was rough, hot and greedy as he tried to hold her legs farther apart. His gaze locked with hers as he tried to clean every gushing surge of cream that escaped past her heated vagina and her thrusting fingers.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She was gasping for breath, her hips thrusting hard into her fingers as she stroked in again.</p><p>\u201cAiden, please. I can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>She needed his fingers inside her, stretching her, driving her higher. God no, she needed his cock filling her, overfilling her, making her scream as her muscles were forced to accommodate each powerful stroke. She pushed her fingers deeper, harder inside her then cried out as his tongue stroked between them when she pulled back. The hot tip licked at her sensitized vaginal entrance, the sensation ripping through her body like a tidal wave of fiery pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you until you beg me to stop.\u201d His voice was hard, so deep and rough it stroked over her senses like a ghostly touch. \u201cAs soon as I can quench this need to drain every drop of your juice from your body.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her fingers free, only to replace them with a hard, driving stroke from his hot tongue. Her hips jerked, thrusting into the stroke as streaking, lava-rich sensations raced through her blood stream, beneath her skin, searing her brain with the pleasure. Her hands gripped the sides of the beanbag, her thighs straining as his hard hands held them spread apart. He slurped at her entrance, his tongue fucking into her hard, then pulling back, his mouth sucking her flowing juices past his hard lips.</p><p>\u201cSo damned good.You make me drunk with my need for you,\u201d he murmured at the pulsing entrance to her pussy before licking into her again.</p><p>The mindless need for orgasm began to fill her. There was no shame, no hesitation then, there was only Aiden. Aiden holding her still as shestruggled, reached for more. Aiden\u2019s tongue stroking the overly sensitive tissue inside her blazing cunt, thrusting past the tightening muscles, probing at nerve endings she never knew she possessed. Nerve endings that exploded in pleasure at eachtouch, screamed out their need for satisfaction, for relief.</p><p>\u201cAiden, I need you.\u201d Her hands gripped the bag beneath her as she fought for climax. Her cunt, her clit, her breasts\u2014hell, her entire body\u2014were blazing, tingling, her muscles tightening at the cellular level in the quest to ease the delicious torment he was practicing on her drenched pussy. He groaned into her flesh, a sound of enjoyment, of pleasure as her vagina clenched, then drenched his tongue once again. Like a man parched from thirst and having found a well of wet, sweet relief. Now if only he would extend the relief, she could save her own sanity.</p><p>\u201cAiden, please,\u201d she panted, her voice weak, breathless, shocking her with the primal sound of desperation. \u201cPlease. If you don\u2019t fuck me I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><p>She twisted as an agonized groan tore from her chest. His thumb began to circle her clit. It tingled, pulsed. Each stroke was like ecstasy licking at the edges of orgasm, driving her higher. She was thrusting against his fucking tongue, whimpering, crying out at each thrust as her vaginal muscles parted for each forceful entrance.</p><p>The pressure at her clit intensified, fed by his driving tongue, his suckling lips at her vagina, his thumb rotating against the tortured knot of nerves. Her cries echoed around her, almost animalistic, begging as she had never thought she could beg. Until his thumb pressed closer, firmer, stroking... God yes... Right there...</p><p>She screamed. Stars exploded around her as her eyes widened, her body arching, tensing, locked tight to his spearing tongue as she felt her pussy explode. Her upper body lifted involuntarily, the breath halting in her chest as lightning tore through her body. Bolt after bolt of white-hot heat erupted inside her as she convulsed, her wail filling the room, shocking her, as Aiden jerked his head back and rose over her with a primal growl of possession.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>\u201cNow, Charity,\u201d he whispered as he came over her, unable to hold back the driving need for fulfillment that pounded through his body. \u201cBurn me alive.\u201d</p><p>Aiden felt the pulse of lubricating fluid from the tip of his cock the moment it touched the wet heat of</p><p>Charity\u2019s vagina. He grimaced, fighting for control. He wanted to enter her slowly, to savor every rippling contraction that tore through her tight cunt. And she was tight. Another pulse of fluid shot into her. Her body tightened, bucking as it splattered inside her heated channel. He eased the bulging head of his cock gingerly into the gripping entrance as yet another stream shot free. He was fighting for breath now. The ejaculations were almost orgasmic, teasing him with the ecstasy to come, the memory of the soul-searing release when his seed would fill her, soak into her pussy and ease their lusts for but a brief time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so hot. So hot and tight you make me want to howl with my need for you,\u201d he panted as he fought for breath.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he eased farther inside her, amazed at how easily her muscles parted for him, how hot and tight her grip was. Her pussy clenched, her juices flowing, easing his way as he pressed into her. Looking down, he fought the near rabid growl as he watched the plump lips of her cunt flattening and stretching around the shaft invading her. The sight of it had yet another of the ejaculations pulsing from him.</p><p>She cried out, her hands moving from the side of the beanbag she lay on to grip the wrists that clasped her hips. She stared up at him, her eyes dazed, unfocused, her face flushed with passion, glistening with perspiration.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how good you feel?\u201d he growled as he fought for control.\u201cSo wet and tight around me, Charity. I can feel the knot just under my flesh throbbing for release.\u201d</p><p>And he could. The pumping pressure midway down the length of his cock was an excruciating pleasure as he fought the impending release. Aiden eased in farther, his gaze flickering between her satiny, pink inner lips and her enthralled expression.</p><p>The head of his cock was buried inside her, easing through the fist-tight confines of her pussy as another pulse of the lubricating fluid shot inside her. It was agony. It was a pleasure so painful he swore he was going to die as he fought to maintain the steady, though slow pace inside her.</p><p>\u201cCharity,\u201d he gasped her name as he slid farther inside the tightening, building heat of her cunt.\u201cBaby. You\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201dHer nails bit into his wrists. \u201cFuck me, Aiden. Fuck me now.Hard. Please...\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help it. He powered inside her, his head falling back, a growl ripping past his throat at the brutal pleasure tearing through his body. He was buried in her to the hilt now, his scrotum tucked against her bottom, cushioned and becoming moist from the female juices that had coated the flesh there.</p><p>\u201cAiden.\u201dShe was half raised, almost in a sitting position, her eyes wide, dilated as she stared at him.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he whispered, glancing between their bodies as he pulled back slowly. He heard her whimper and wanted to cry out himself as his cock slid back, dragging against her flesh, glistening with the thick cream that coated it. He pulled nearly free, until only the crown remained.</p><p>\u201cWatch, Charity.\u201d He had to fight for breath, fight to still the tremors that wanted to shake his body, the need for release that pounded through him. \u201cWatch me take you.\u201d</p><p>He slid home again. Not so slowly, but not so fast that she didn\u2019t see, didn\u2019t feel every inch of the cock taking her. He glanced up at her again, seeing the fascinated look on her face, the arousal tightening her features.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Charity,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLook, baby.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyes; they were wide, dazed, almost black pools of surrender as he pulled back then thrust easily inside her once again.</p><p>\u201cMark me,\u201d he whispered, every muscle in his body tensing from need as he tightened his arms around her, pulling her closer.\u201cLike I marked you, Charity. Mark me now.\u201d</p><p>He thrust harder inside her as her lips touched his shoulders. He was close. So damned close he could feel the knot beginning to form, engorging,preparing for his release. His hips moved faster, thrusting his cock harder, deeper inside her as he felt the delicate scrape of her teeth, heard her whimper of nearing orgasm.</p><p>Her pussy rippled around him, contracted with deep hard pulls, milking at his flesh as though trying to suck the seed from his body.</p><p>\u201cNow, damn you.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t hold back, couldn\u2019t wait. The swelling began, the pleasure tearing through him until he wondered if he would survive it.</p><p>Her teeth clamped down on the tight muscle. Not enough to break the skin as his canines had hers, but enough, just enough to release the primal urges tearing through him. He gripped her hips, lowering her, laying over her, feeling her teeth bite down as he thrust into her harder, again, and again, until the swelling intensified, locking himself inside her as she erupted around him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The heavy contractions of her orgasm timed perfectly with the first hard expulsion of his seed inside her gripping cunt. Aiden wanted to howl, and almost did as the pleasure overcame him, surging through his body, shooting up his spine and searing his brain with the rapture of it. He couldn\u2019t stop. His hips jerked, her muscles tightened, and his seed spurted inside her again. It seemed never ending, the pleasure unlike anything he had known or imagined possible.</p><p>The engorged knot pulsed and beat as though it carried life itself.Caught in the vice of her spasming pussy as he collapsed over her, shuddering, his body jerking with each explosion of seed from his cock into her body. His breath sawed out of his chest as slowly, agonizingly, the pressure began to ease. Sweat dripped from his body to hers. Her teeth loosened from his shoulder, her head falling back as she shuddered one last time.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he whispered, raising his head just enough to stare down at her, to spear her with the intent growing in his mind.\u201cMine, Charity.Always.\u201d</p><p>Shesmiled, weak but filled with her own determination, her own stubbornness.</p> <p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she promised him softly.\u201cAnd maybe, Aiden, not ever.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>The sound was so soft at first that he was certain he was hearing wrong. There was a reason why the bathroom window was so damned small. So assassins couldn\u2019t sneak in, and so Aiden had some small sense that he wasn\u2019t totally closed in. That one concession made the necessity of bars on the windows and locks on the doors more tolerable. But even there the alarm system should have been in place. His arms tightened around Charity, his hand going over her mouth to stifle any sound she would make as he pulled her quickly from the bed. Her body tensed but moved smoothly with him, as he pulled her to the floor while shoving his hand beneath the mattress for the automatic handgun he kept ready. Grabbing Charity\u2019s arm with the other hand he pulled her to the far side of the second entrance to the bedroom intending to get her into the living room.</p><p>He moved her carefully against the thick fireplace wall, sheltering her with his body and intending to rush her to the other side of the room when he first realized the true danger they were in.</p><p>\u201cCoyotes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI smell them.\u201d</p> <p>Surprise shocked his system. He had known the scent, knew well what he was dealing with, but he hadn\u2019t expected her to smell the distinctive scent as well.</p><p>\u201cThey can smell me too, Aiden.\u201d Her voice was only a thread of sound. \u201cLeave me here and do what you have to. There\u2019s no way you can hide my scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Whoever it was had made it into the house. He had to give them credit for stealth. He pulled her carefully away from the fireplace, pulling her across the living room and pushed her quickly behind the thick, oak bar stand between the living room and the kitchen before he moved silently back through the room.</p><p>The bastard was there for Charity, and he knew it. The scent of her heat was overwhelming, and would most likely blockhis own scent. He would need that edge to surprise the bastard and take him down. Aiden didn\u2019t want the assassin dead. He wanted him talking. He moved back to the far arch, crouching low and looking around the brick wall. There he was.Small, very small for a Coyote Breed and moving slowly for the bed. Aiming the pistol carefully, Aiden cleared his throat. Then all hell broke loose.</p><p>The windows in the kitchen and the living room shattered simultaneously as the whine of muffled shots began to hum through the room.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Aiden began to fire toward the front window as he jerked one of the automatic rifles from the</p> <p>gun shelf beside him.</p><p>Charity.Fuck. She hadn\u2019t made a sound and the bullets whizzing through the house were coming through the window directly behind the bar. He rolled across the floor, the automatic rifle returning fire as he fought to get back to the other room and pull her to safety.Son of a bitch. What happened to bulletproof windows?</p><p>As he neared the doorway, gunfire erupted from the arched opening into the bedroom. Cursing, feeling the heat of the bullets whining around him as he heard the compound sirens go off, he returned the fire as he scrambled behind the dubious protection of the end of the couch.</p><p>\u201cCharity!\u201dHe screamed her name out as the house seemed to rock on its foundations. He heard her scream his name as gunfire seemed to erupt everywhere. Smoke and dust filled the room, obscuring his vision, but not his senses as he heard the scuffle going on in the other room. He was pinned down by the gunfire from the bedroom, firing back wildly as he fought to find any opening to throw himself into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cFucking bitch.\u201dThe dark male curse sounded from Charity\u2019s location. It sizzled in the air as Aiden threw himself from the protection of the couch, firing wildly into the bedroom and living room as he rushed to the kitchen.</p><p>A pain filled cry echoed from the direction of the bedroom doorway as he slid into the kitchen. And then he saw it.The large male scuffling with Charity as another came through the shattered window. He aimed and fired seeing the flash of steel as it moved at Charity\u2019s side. An agonized scream echoed through the kitchen as Aiden moved to pull her from the clutches of her would-be assailant. She was moving fast, ducking then disappearing as he fired at the injured man. She was too fucking fast. Like a whirlwind moving about the room as the shadowed figured began to twist within the dim, dust filled confines of the rooms. Such quick reaction and steady coordination could have only come from years of training. Who or what had trained her?</p><p>\u201cBastards,\u201d she screamed as he saw her rise, a gun in her hand, firing behind him. The grunt of pain he heard as he ducked and rushed for her assured him she had hit whatever she was firing at. He pulled her quickly to him, then behind him as he watched the window, training the gun at the now empty hole.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I don\u2019t need a shield Aiden,\u201d she cursed as he backed her against the counter. The howling of the wolves, the gunfire outside, and the sudden silence through the cabin assured him the danger had moved and the Enforcers had made record time getting to the cabin. Unfortunately, the cabin appeared a little worse for wear.</p> <p>\u201cAiden.\u201dThe door burst open as Stygian\u2019s rough voice called out his name. Lights speared into the room as he slowly relaxed his guard and stood up carefully among the shattered glass that littered the floor.</p><p>\u201cStygian, get a blanket for Charity and my pants and shoes from the bedroom.The room is filled with glass.\u201d His feet already smarted from the nicks and cuts inflicted on them. As Stygian rushed for the other room, battery powered lights lit up the cabin as it slowly filled with Enforcers.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s still breathing,\u201d Styx called out as he found the Coyote Charity had shot. The sudden sound of a gunshot assured Aiden the Coyote wasn\u2019t breathing any longer. Aiden grimaced. He had hoped to keep at least one of them alive. Behind him, Charity held to him weakly, her head lying against his back, her breathing rough.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he questioned her over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAlive,\u201d she bit out.</p><p>Aiden grunted. \u201cBeats dead any day of the week, huh?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled weakly as he felt her shake her head slowly against his back.</p><p>\u201cBlanket.\u201dStygian rushed back into the room. He threw the blanket to Aiden, though he carried the jeans and sneakers Aiden would need.</p><p>Catching the covering, he turned and wrapped Charity in it quickly. She was pale, her eyes wide and dark, but she appeared relatively unharmed.</p><p>\u201cLet me get dressed and I\u2019ll get you on the couch.\u201d He turned and grabbed his jeans and shoes from Stygian and quickly donned them.</p><p>Making certain the blanket was tucked aroundher, he picked Charity up and moved swiftly to the couch. First things first. He had to check her out, make certain she was okay, then he would find out just how the hell the Council\u2019s mongrels had made it past the perimeter alarms, Enforcers and Wolves. He knew what they were after, now he had to figure out how to stop them. And figure out why the hell there had been no sign of them in town.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>\u201cYou underestimated your enemy,\u201d she muttered as he sat her on the couch in another cabin and straightened away from her. \u201cCoyotes aren\u2019t stupid, Aiden.Soulless, but not stupid. The very fact that you aren\u2019t being watched should alarm you.\u201d</p><p>He grunted, which did little to assure her he had taken the point.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get your training?\u201d he asked her then, ignoring her warning.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d she bit out, chafing under his possessive attitude. He stared down at her, his eyes flat and hard. \u201cDo you want to answer me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArmy,\u201d she finally answered him bitterly. \u201cThat\u2019s where I received my scientific training as well. My foster parents were Army.Killed during a terrorist strike while they were overseas.\u201d</p><p>Her upbringing as well as her training had been unorthodox. Her foster parents had been part of a unique group of scientists working in the Biological Warfare Studies group designed, supposedly, to find cures for some of the unique viral contagions that had cropped up at the time. But he knew all this. Aiden wasn\u2019t a stupid man, she thought. He would know all there was to know about her past. His next words confirmed that.</p><p>\u201cThey were good people. There was no mention of your training, though.\u201d</p><p>She sighed wearily.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t stop trying to take me, Aiden. You know that,\u201d she warned him again, unwilling to allow him to change the subject.</p><p>Dawn was peeking over the mountains outside and the entire compound was on alert. Enforcers were pacing nervously along the walls and calls had gone out to pull more in. She stared up at him, seeing the savage determination in his expression, the stubbornness in his gray eyes. He was refusing to accept the danger she represented to the community Wolfe had slowly fought to make safe for their people</p><p>\u201cThink about it, Aiden,\u201d she told him firmly, aware of the half dozen Breeds, including Wolfe, who listened behind him. \u201cThe drugs were specifically designed to force ovulation and compatibility with your sperm. When their tests revealed the added Breed component in my blood, they checked their own records and matched it with you. They had samples of your sperm. They designed a drug that would enhance and would speed up the process my body had started...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we are mated,\u201d he bit out triumphantly, as though the ongoing argument over the mating was behind her words.</p><p>Charity rolled her eyes as she pushed her fingers through her hair in frustration. Was he never going to give up? He was the most stubborn person she had ever laid eyes on.</p><p>\u201cListen to you. You did not mate me, Aiden. You marked me somehow. The drugs mated me, not you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed like a mercurial storm, the color twisting and surging within itself.</p><p>\u201cDrugs created from my sperm. From my individual DNA,\u201d he bit out arrogantly as though the fact that it was he she had mated with made him somehow superior to anyone else she may have been tested for.</p><p>And still, he missed the point. The danger she was bringing to the compound was her concern, not the damned mating, drug related or not.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, this isn\u2019t about the fucking mating!\u201d she yelled as she came to her feet, clutching the blanket tightly around her naked body as she faced him furiously. \u201cDon\u2019t you hear what I\u2019m saying, Aiden? I\u2019m a danger to everyone here. To everything Wolfe is attempting to build. You have to let me leave.\u201d</p><p>Incredulity filled his expression. \u201cAnd go where?\u201d He spread his hands wide. \u201cWhere else would you be even reasonably safe, Charity?\u201d</p><p>She would never be safe, and she knew it. But she wouldn\u2019t hide behind the very people she had fought so many years to protect, either.</p><p>\u201cAnd if they launch an all out assault?\u201d she asked him loudly. \u201cWhat the hell will you do then? They know you\u2019ve fucked me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mated you,\u201d he yelled back, his voice dark, wickedly sensual with its angry growl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey know conception is possible, Aiden...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy God, if you haven\u2019t conceived yet it\u2019s not from lack of trying,\u201d he growled. If she hadn\u2019t needed to keep the blanket on her to preserve her modesty she would have pulled her hair in frustration.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to make me crazy?\u201d she snarled. \u201cStop changing the subject.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no subject under discussion,\u201d he informed her arrogantly. \u201cYou are my mate, and therefore part of the pack. You are safest here. When you are no longer so weak, you will realize this.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him for a moment in amazement.</p><p>\u201cGet over the mating stuff, Aiden. They won\u2019t stop. How many of your people will die before you hate me for it?\u201d she screamed back at him. \u201cLook at me, Aiden. I won\u2019t allow it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mate.My decision.\u201dHe crossed his arms over his chest stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cDrugs do not make a mate.\u201d She wondered what it took to convince him of this. \u201cDo you understand me, Aiden? Not.Your.Mate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy mate.My woman,\u201d he growled.\u201cMy child.\u201d</p><p>The last word shocked her into silence, but only for a moment. \u201cThere is no child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet.\u201dSatisfaction glittered in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>His brow arched slowly. \u201cDo you think you can deny me, Charity?\u201d he drawled sensually. \u201cAlready your body is hot, aroused. Any man in this room can scent your need.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened as she swallowed tightly then turned and looked at the interested men watching the exchange with no small amount of amusement. She felt her face flush in embarrassment as her gaze went to Wolfe questioningly.</p> <p>\u201cYou can?\u201d she asked, humiliation crawling through her body as she faced the men. Wolfe sighed deeply as he flashed Aiden a disgruntled look. \u201cCharity, it is no different for Hope or Faith. The need is natural. And the scent is very elusive, though very pleasant. There is no reason to feel shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should you feel shame?\u201d Aiden questioned almost angrily. \u201cDoes it shame you to be my mate?\u201d</p><p>She was going to cry. Charity could feel the tears rising behind her eyes, the fear blooming in her chest. The need to do so made her furious. Damn him, damn him to hell for making her cry.</p><p>\u201cMoron.\u201d Her fist connected with his chest, bringing no more than a frown of confusion to his face and an ache to her fingers. \u201cAre all male Breeds so damned stupid?\u201d</p><p>Surprise marked Aiden\u2019s face. \u201cCharity, perhaps you need to rest,\u201d he sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re no longer making sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re crazy,\u201d she accused him furiously. \u201cInsane.Completely without a clue.\u201d</p><p>She gave up. A strangled growl of fury vibrated in her throat, giving any breedalive competition in primal response as she stomped around him and headed for what was obviously the bedroom. The open door showed the inviting, turned downed blankets, but the fireplace between the two rooms was a dead giveaway. Thankfully, this one had a door. She slammed it hard.</p><p>Aiden grinned slowly as the door closed, cutting off his view of Charity and the furious twitch of her hips as she had stomped away from him. He turned back to his Pack Leader and arched a brow knowingly. Wolfe chuckled, though he was careful to keep the sound low until they heard the bathroom door as well. Moving cautiously to the empty fireplace, Aiden checked to be certain she had gone into the other room.</p> <p>\u201cHas she conceived?\u201d Wolfe asked. \u201cHer scent has changed, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>Aiden shook his head. \u201cArmani is testing the samples now. We should know soon. If she hasn\u2019t, then she is in full ovulation. Those Coyotes were too damned determined to take her, Wolfe. I tried to keep her within the cabin at all times. And the windows of the SUV were down for only a few moments while we were out. I have no idea how they knew when to strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe scientists would have some idea of the time table involved in this,\u201d Wolfe sighed tiredly. \u201cIt would be that simple. She\u2019s in grave danger, though, as your child will be if she does conceive. Those Coyotes got in too damned easy. We\u2019ll have to increase our security both inside and outside the compound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve put in a call to Satin and her Enforcers. Stygian\u2019s group will stay, and Drake and his men are on their way in. We\u2019ll have to scale back on Lab searches until her safety is assured,\u201d Wolfe decided.</p><p>\u201cCoordinate the groups and re-assign those Enforcers still in the field. Bring in as many as possible. If she does conceive, then Armani will know how to help Faith and Hope as well. We must move carefully on this. All our women are in more danger than ever before. And they are not just our hearts, Aiden. They are our future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Roberts woman?\u201d Stygian said curiously. \u201cShe was on the list as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the others get here, take four men and retrieve her,\u201d Wolfe ordered briskly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to move carefully on this. Get her here any way you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSatin\u2019s group will be of utmost importance as well,\u201d Aiden said softly. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to make them aware of that and pray she doesn\u2019t go ballistic on us. Damn, that woman should have been a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, bite your tongue,\u201d Styx laughed heartily in response to this. \u201cThat woman\u2019s so damned pretty on the eyes she makes my back teeth ache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll cut your balls off if she hears you say that,\u201d Stygian reminded him. \u201cBetter guard your goods, boy.\u201d</p><p>Styx winced. \u201cDamn if that ain\u2019t the truth. She might look like a little Barbie Doll, but that girl is pure mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s clear out of here so she can rest then,\u201d Wolfe sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll put the wolves on high alert, and two teams patrolling the grounds at all times, two men outside the cabin. You\u2019re in the middle of the compound now, so you\u2019ll be harder to get to. Let\u2019s pray it\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut a team of the wolves outside the compound,\u201d Aiden suggested. \u201cUse the most advanced pairs we have and allow them to roam wild. They\u2019ll pull in the wild packs and alert us of any danger.\u201d</p><p>Their affinity with the wolves had allowed them to raise and train select pairs for security purposes. The intelligence of the animals and their natural loyalty, added to the surprising degree of communication they shared with the animals, made them perfect for the jobs they were needed for.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll head out of here so you can rest,\u201d Wolfe sighed as he glanced at the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep her safe, Aiden. You keep her careful. All the plans in the world won\u2019t save her if she doesn\u2019t use caution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be too tired not to use caution,\u201d he murmured as he heard the bathroom door open. \u201cSee if Faith or Hope can bring her clothes later. For now, I think she needs to rest.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe nodded as the other men filed from the cabin and then he followed behind them. Weariness lay about him, and Aiden now understood why.The worry and constant strain of his mate being in distress lay heavily on his shoulders. Accepting Charity as his mate had placed the same strain on Aiden\u2019s. Her safety, her happiness, as well as the future of their race were their responsibility.A responsibility that didn\u2019t set well with any of their mates.</p><p>He sighed tiredly as he heard Charity curse from the bedroom. Her voice was thick with unshed tears, and he knew the worries that would be running through her head. He was her mate. It was his job to ease her. He smiled then. And easing her was so damned good, he thought a lifetime of it wouldn\u2019t be</p><p>nearly enough.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Adrenaline still pumped through her body, the blood pounding through her veins even now, hours after the attack. Fury nearly overwhelmed her as she thought of Aiden and his refusal to understand the danger she was bringing to the Breeds that had taken her in. The danger she was bringing to Aiden. And there lay her biggest worry.</p><p>\u201cCharity, I can protect you,\u201d he spoke from the doorway behind her, his voice dark, rough. She blinked back her tears, fighting herself and the emotions consuming her. For so many years she had fought her needs for him. Denied what her body, her heart and soul, told her on a daily basis.Just as she had tried to deny it to him.</p><p>She listened as he moved across the room, watched as he came into her line of sight, rounding the bed, walking toward her. His chest was bare, smooth tough skin and hard muscle. His abdomen was hard, tight, sun darkened. And below there, beneath the waist of his jeans, his erection swelled. She licked her lips, hungry for him, her body desperate for his touch.</p><p>\u201cCharity.\u201dHe stopped in front of her, his lean hips at level with her gaze, and she couldn\u2019t resist. She leaned forward, her hands gripping the outside of his hard thighs as her lips pressed against the tight flesh of his abdomen. She needed to touch him, to hold him, to assure herself he was unharmed.</p><p>\u201cCharity.\u201dHis voice was strangled as his hands slid through her hair, holding her close as she licked at his flesh.</p><p>The muscles contracted beneath her touch as he strained closer to her. He was hard and hot, and she was tired of the cold knot of fear and loneliness that had grown inside her for so many years. Her hands moved to the metal buttons of his jeans, her fingers trembling with anticipation as she slid the first metal disk free of its mooring.</p><p>\u201cCharity, you need to rest,\u201d he whispered, though his muscles tightened as the second disk slid free as well.</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d She pressed a kiss to the skin she hadrevealed, her mouth watering at the thought of what awaited her behind the snug confines of the jeans.</p><p>The buttons slid free easily, and with his help she managed to push the material over his hips and thighs. His cock sprang free, heavy and engorged, the thick veins standing out in stark relief against the</p><p>mahogany colored flesh.</p><p>He was so thick, so hard, it amazed her that her body could accommodate it. She blew a whispery breath over the crown, watching as it flexed then jerked at the sensation.</p><p>\u201cWould you tease me all night?\u201d His voice was strangled. \u201cDo you know how long I\u2019ve waited to fuck your mouth again, Charity?To relive the pleasure of your tongue against my cock?\u201d</p><p>She shivered, his whisky-rough voice sliding over her senses like a velvety stroke of power. Fighting for breath, one hand slid across his thigh to cup andcradle his heavy scrotum while the other gripped the base of his cock. She had no hope of enclosing it in the fingers of onehand, she wanted only to hold the heavy flesh steady as her tongue washed over the flared head of his erection. Above her, she heard him groan. His hands tightened erotically in her hair, his hips pressing the hard shaft closer to her lips. And still she teased him. Why, she didn\u2019t know. Perhaps it was to hear the hard, indrawn breaths of pleasure that echoed around her. To feel the desperate throb of his cock head under her tongue, or merely to have him force her to enclose the bulging head between her lips. His hands tightened in her hair. She allowed her tongue to stroke over the flared head, feeling the heat of it, tasting the pearly drop of pre-cum that eased from the tip. He tasted tangy, a bit salty, and completely male.</p><p>\u201cCharity.\u201dHis tone was harsh and filled with erotic warning as his hands tightened in her hair. \u201cThis is a dangerous game you\u2019re playing, mate.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, glancing up at him as she tongued the tip of the silk-encased steel. He grimaced sensually, his expression taut, his eyes stormy and intense as she savored the taste of his cock. Her tongue flickered beneath the flared head, stroking the most sensitive area as his breath caught. She wanted him filling her mouth, thrusting heavily into it, but she needed him to want it more. For years she had dreamed of the first time she had taken him like this. Knowing she had forced from him something he had been unwilling to give. She wanted to replace the memory with something so erotic he would never remember that episode in the same way again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he finally growled. \u201cDo not make me force you, Charity.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she lowered her lashes and licked again, feeling the rough edge of the heavy veins than ran just under the flesh. Restraining herself took more self-control than she ever imagined she could possess. Watching him, seeing his face become heavy with sensuality, his eyes darkening, his chest rising and falling heavily as sweat gleamed on the heavy muscles had her pussy clenching in need. She knew the moment he had enough of her teasing. His expression tightened, his eyelids lowered broodingly a second before one hand clenched in her hair as the other wrapped around the shaft of his cock, just above her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo more teasing, Charity.\u201d The wide head butted against her lips then slid smoothly into the waiting depths of her mouth.</p><p>Charity\u2019s body clenched with the dominant, aggressive move. But even more frightening, she felt a part of herself begin to melt. She was hungry for him, ravenous, and she knew from experience that the aphrodisiac contained in the drugs would have been out of her system by now. Her need for him, his</p><p>taste, his touch, the greedy hunger for him that tormented her would be natural now. And mixed with the heady arousal pumping through her was a shadow of fear.</p><p>If this were natural, then how would she ever leave him? And how could she stay, knowing the emotions she had kept carefully banked over the years were not returned by him?</p><p>She suckled at the head of his cock, moaning in shattered desire, fighting to hold onto some part of her heart as she heard his hard moan.</p><p>\u201cGod, Charity...so good.\u201d His hands tangled in her hair further as he held her still for the careful thrusts into her mouth.</p><p>Her tongue stroked the rigid flesh as she suckled at the throbbing head. Her eyelids rose, staring up at him, her chest tightening with the pleasure on his face. Sensual and savage, his eyes like thunderclouds as he stared down at her, his expression twisted with almost painful rapture. Shockingly, a hard pulse of warm, spicy fluid shot from the tip of his cock.</p><p>\u201cGod...stop...\u201d He tried to pull back, surprise and horror flashing across his face as he held her still, pulling free of her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her hands gripped his hips, her need for him so stark, so vital she couldn\u2019t bear the separation. The taste of him was dark, earthy. She had no idea what the pulse of fluid was, but she knew she needed more.Always more. She could never get enough of him. Her lips enclosed the head again, suckling it into her mouth as another pulse of the liquid filled her. His groan was tight, almost animalistic as she moaned around his flesh.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he protested, seeming to tremble before her. His thighs were tight, steel hard columns that shuddered beneath the caress on his erection.</p><p>She stared up at him, suckling at him slowly, her tongue flickering over the sensitive flesh until yet another hard pulse of the fluid shot into her mouth and his cock sank further past her lips. Hunger was a hard knot of arousal in the very depths of her womb.Ravenous, her body becoming more heated than ever before, she began to move her mouth on the throbbing flesh, her tongue flickering over it, working to draw the deep, primal growls from his throat. The head sank to the depths of her mouth, filling it as she suckled and licked. There was no discomfort, no sense of choking on the thick flesh. Her tongue felt more sensitive, the depths of her mouth experiencing a near sexual pleasure as he began to fuck her mouth with short, quick strokes. She whimpered at each thrust, greedy for another burst of the sweet ejaculation that wasn\u2019t a release, yet shuddered through his body as though it were.</p><p>\u201cCharity, baby.I can\u2019t control this.\u201d One hand gripped the base of his cock, the other tangled deeper in her hair as he thrust against her. His voice was dark, its roughness so sexual, so deep, her womb contracted with the sound of it.</p><p>Her nails bit into the sides of his muscular thighs as she fought to hold onto her own control. Her mouth</p><p>tightened on the surging erection, her tongue stroking it, needing more.</p><p>\u201cCharity, I\u2019m going to come,\u201d he warned her, his voice tight.\u201cGod, baby, stop.\u201d</p><p>She felt the jerk of his cock as her tongue stroked over the deep pulse of the knot fighting to be free beneath his flesh. She suckled at the flesh strongly, loving the way his breath hitched, his body tightened with each pull of her mouth, each lick of her tongue.</p><p>\u201cCharity.\u201dAnother hard pulse of fluid shot into her mouth as her hand tightened on his cock. His hips were moving more strongly now as he panted for air, as she panted for air. Her fingers caressed his scrotum, her nails scratching at the silken sac as he suddenly tightened.</p><p>\u201cNot like this.\u201d He moved back, ignoring her cry, her need. He jerked his jeans from his legs as she moved to him, intent on finishing what she had started.</p><p>\u201cAiden, please.\u201dHer lips went to his chest then lower, moving to her knees, starving for the taste of him.</p><p>\u201cCharity.God, baby.\u201dShe licked over his abdomen and a second later her lips covered the head of his cock again.</p> <p>And he was hers.</p><p>Both hands locked in her hair as her hands wrapped around his cock, her mouth and tongue driving him to his climax. She was desperate, needing to wipe away the memory of the time in the Labs, to replace it with this, something deeper, hotter.</p><p>His cock pulsed then as she felt her juices spill along her thighs. Beneath her hands the hard swelling in his cock began, engorging, filling her cupped palms a second before the first blast of his hot semen shot into her mouth.</p><p>His hips moved in short hard strokes as his groan echoed around her, hot and filled with pleasure as his seed coated her tongue and slid down her throat. The taste of him was an aphrodisiac all its own. The feel of the hard swelling beneath her hands, the crown pulsing, spilling his pleasure in her mouth triggered a deep, convulsive shudder in the depths of her womb.</p><p>Her hands stroked the sensitive, fist-sized swelling that had knotted in the shaft of his cock. Each gentle caress spilled yet another explosion of his seed in her mouth as he groaned weakly beneath the caress.</p><p>\u201cBaby, so good,\u201d his words whispered through her heart.\u201cCharity. Charity, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d He shuddered again, his hands kneading at her hair, his hips jerking, tugging at her hold on his cock as pleasure rippled over him.</p><p>When it was over, he drew her gently to her feet, holding her as she swayed in his grip. One hand moved to her chin, his thumb running over her swollen lips.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cProve it,\u201d she challenged him softly.</p><p>He smiled. A slow curving of his sensually molded lips as he watched her knowingly. \u201cNo need to prove it now, Charity. Soon you will know. But just because you have what you needed, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m finished with you yet.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Before Charity could protest he turned her, bending her over on the bed, her palms flat against the mattress.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he murmured, his hand trailing over the curves of her rear as he leaned close to plant a heated kiss between her shoulder blades.</p><p>\u201cWe couldlay on the bed,\u201d she panted, shivering beneath the caress. He could destroy her equilibrium with only a stroke of his lips. She felt lost, drowning beneath the sensuality of his touch. Heat flickered through her cunt, her womb, as convulsive shudders racked her muscles. She wondered if she had enough strength left to stay on her feet as his hand stroked beneath her thighs, yet never really touched the needy entrance to her vagina.</p><p>She shifted, breathing deeply, certain she would collapse at his feet.</p><p>\u201cWho needs a bed?\u201d he whispered as his lips touched her shoulder, his teeth scraping the tender skin there. \u201cI will hold you up, Charity. Trust me.\u201d His hands curved around her waist, smoothing over her abdomen, caressing up her stomach until he could cup the firm globes of her breasts. Charity couldn\u2019t hold back her cry as his fingers enclosed her nipples, rolling against them slowly as she began to burn with her own lusts. His loins cushioned her buttocks, his cock resting against the narrow crevice there, heating it,fueling fantasies she refused to delve too deeply into.</p><p>\u201cTrust you?\u201d she panted desperately. \u201cYour legs trembled too, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at her neck.\u201cSmart ass.\u201d</p><p>She would have replied if he hadn\u2019tchose that moment to move, to tuck the head of his cock against the entrance of her swollen pussy. She could feel the broad head sliding against the slick moisture there as he positioned himself for a smooth stroke.</p><p>\u201cYou decide.\u201d His teeth raked her neck.\u201cHard and fast.Or slow and gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she gasped, struggling to thrust back against him as he easily controlled her movements by gripping herhips.</p><p>\u201cDecide quickly.\u201d His voice was a hard rumble as his cock throbbed at her entrance.</p><p>She whimpered. Hell, she couldn\u2019t decide. She wanted both.Hard and fast and slow and easy, hot and strong and...</p><p>Her eyes widened, a soundless cry breaking from her throat as he finally took the decision out of her hands. He slid inside her, working his cock slow and easy into the slick, humid depths of her pussy. Her muscles clamped against the invasion, fire and lightning singing through her veins as she felt the tight impalement.</p><p>\u201cWait. Wait,\u201d she cried out desperately.</p><p>He stopped, though the primal growl that sounded behind her assured her it was only under protest that he had done so.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His voice was strained, guttural.</p><p>She fought for breath, her eyes closing in ecstasy as she clamped her muscles on his cock, milking it to intensify the heated sensations running through her body.</p><p>\u201cCharity.\u201dHis voice was warning.</p><p>His cock was buried halfway inside her, stretching her with a pleasure/pain as a hard pulse of silky fluid exploded from the tip of his erection. He moaned as she whimpered in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cFeel that,\u201d she cried out, shuddering in his arms.\u201cOh God, Aiden, what is that doing to me?\u201d</p><p>Her cunt heated further, relaxing marginally around the flared head as he suddenly thrust hard and deep inside her. Her hands went out from under her, her cheek hitting the mattress as she gasped for breath.</p><p>\u201cAre you playing scientist, Charity?\u201d he crooned seductively at the back of her neck as he pushed her farther up the mattress, tucking her knees beneath her as he mounted her more firmly. \u201cFeel what happens to bad little girls who try to play scientist as their mate fucks them.\u201d</p><p>He taught her the lesson well. He held tightly to her hips as his cock powered hard and fast inside the greedy depths of her pussy.Stroking her like a living flame, burning her with a lust that left her begging, pleading for release. Her body tightened, ripples of her impending orgasm fluttering in her womb, when he suddenly stopped.</p><p>\u201cNo. No.\u201d She twisted against him desperately as her entire body protested at the abrupt cessation. Her cunt gripped him, tightened as she fought to finish the impending explosion.</p><p>\u201cBad little mate,\u201d he whispered at her ear as he pulled back with excruciating slowness. She could feel the sensitive tissue, overfilled, stretching then aching in protest as he retreated. Only to scream out in need as he began to burrow back inside her. Slow, so fuckingslow she knew it was going to kill her. He filled her, stretching the tissue of her cunt, the fragile muscles, with an exquisitely slow push that ensured she felt every minute caress of his cock sliding into her gripping, rippling pussy.</p><p>\u201cOh God.Aiden.You\u2019re killing me.\u201d She tried to back into him with a quick thrust of her hips that he easily controlled by holding the curves in his hard, broad hands.</p><p>\u201cI am pleasuring you,\u201d he argued thickly. \u201cFeel the pleasure, Charity.\u201d</p><p>His cock throbbed inside her as a hard blast of liquid shot against the sensitized walls of her cunt. She shuddered. The heat built inside the tight confines of her vagina and blazed throughout the rest of her body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re torturing me,\u201d she cried out as he slid back until only the head of his cock rested inside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about now, mate?\u201d he growled, his breath caressing her ear, his voice strained with his own arousal. \u201cAre you thinking of what your body is doing, or are you feeling what my body is doing to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she panted, his words making no sense as heat speared through her womb. \u201cOh God, Aiden, fuck me now.\u201d</p><p>She was filled with him. In a single hard stroke he impaled her with the length of his erection, searing nerve endings, filling her pussy until the heat and pleasure catapulted her into orgasm.Hard, almost brutal strokes that had her screaming through her release, shuddering convulsively, jerking in his arms as he locked hard and tight inside her, his own release pouring into her in pulse after pulse of fire. Charity collapsed beneath him, her body still humming with the hard aftershocks of release, weariness settling over her like a dark, comforting blanket. Then she realized it was Aiden\u2019s body. Broad and heated, holding his full weight on his elbows, his breaths laboring as another explosion of seed pulsed into her pussy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep,\u201d she mumbled, knowing from experience he would be locked inside her for several moments longer. \u201cTuck me in when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>His chuckle was rough, deep at her ear as he breathed in deeply.</p><p>\u201cFirst you\u2019re analyzing our bodies\u2019 responses, now you\u2019re falling asleep on me. You\u2019ll give me a complex, mate.\u201d In retaliation he moved, causing the knot to tug within the sensitive, swollen muscles of her cunt.</p><p>She jerked, shuddered as the mini orgasm washed through her body, convulsing her womb as his seed shot inside her again.</p><p>\u201cOh hell,\u201d she whispered. \u201cGod, Aiden, don\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t stand it. I apologize. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>What else could she do? Exhaustion was like a demon inside her now, demanding her rest. Her eyes closed as she drifted in the satisfaction, the repletion of having him still locked within her, a part of her. She was warm and without pain, comforted inside and out, drifting in a haze of well being. She was only barely aware of his moving, his cock finally sliding free of her body. Within seconds, before her body had time to chill, he had moved her beneath the blankets, tucking them around her, kissing her brow gently.</p><p>\u201cSleep, love,\u201d he whispered softly as she drifted away. \u201cI will guard you better from here on out.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Charity stepped outside the cabin the next morning dressed in the soft gray cotton pants and matching tank top Aiden had purchased the day before. She wore socks and comfortable canvas sneakers on her feet and found herself amazed at the thought of how long it had been since she had worn either. She stood at the top of the steps of the small porch and tried to ignore the two men stationed close by. Aiden had warned her before leaving that morning that the guards would be present at all times.For her protection. They were protecting the very person who had brought the danger in on them. She drew in a deep breath, sitting down on the porch step as she carefully balanced the cup of coffee on her knee. Finding the can of coffee under the cabinet had been a stroke of luck. Another of the few pleasures she had been denied in the past years.</p><p>She sipped at the dark brew, barely holding back a moan of appreciation. Rich and fragrant, the liquid seemed to sink into her cells, reminding her of all the small pleasures that had been absent for so long. The sounds from the compound reminded her of other things. Laughter echoed from one of the storehouses down the graveled path as several men joked and talked while they unloaded a pickup filled with supplies. Farther down a group of men and womenwere training in one of the grassy areas. Grunts and groans and general laughter accompanied their exertions. In the Council Labs there had never been laughter. Training was a fierce \u201cdo or die\u201d exercise. If you didn\u2019t excel there were punishments awaiting that defieddescription. Charity closed her eyes, remembering well the screams of pain that resulted from those punishments. Their lives from birth hadn\u2019t been easy. And more died than ever survived the rigorous life they had been condemned to. The evil that was the Council knew no mercy, either, for their creations or for their employees. The sound of a vehicle moving from the other end of the gravel path drew her attention. She turned her head, watching with a smile as Nikki pulled up in a small, canopied golf cart-type vehicle. She stepped from the vehicle and walked to the porch with a welcoming smile.</p><p>\u201cThat coffee is very bad for you.\u201d The cup was plucked from Charity\u2019s hand and in the same movement Nikki lifted it to her own lips and finished it off quickly. \u201cThere, no more of that bad stuff for you.\u201d</p> <p>Charity blinked at her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Nikki. You know how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve had coffee?\u201d she asked her mildly, though she was more than a little upset at having her treat stolen so cavalierly.</p><p>\u201cI would say close to six years.\u201d Nikki sat down on the edge of the porch, turning to face her, her dark face thoughtful,her eyes glittering with amusement. \u201cI bet you stopped about the time the effects of Aiden\u2019s hormone hit your system.\u201d</p><p>Charity grimaced, remembering exactly why she had quit. The caffeine seemed to make everything</p><p>worse.</p><p>\u201cIt should be safe now,\u201d she grunted.\u201cOr at least easier to control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re getting fucked?\u201dNikki arched a brow as Charity felt her face flush with heat. \u201cDon\u2019t bet on it, sugarpie. Faith still has terrible side effects from it. She had to cut it out completely. I think Jacob is faltering under that strain.\u201d</p><p>The grin that shaped her lips was filled with amusement.</p> <p>\u201cSo, no coffee too, huh?\u201d she sighed, watching her friend closely. \u201cYou finished running the tests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo conception yet.But we have some definite changes going on here, Charity. Changes the others aren\u2019t experiencing yet. Your ovaries areenlarged, the breed hormone is stronger now than it was when I did the initial blood tests in the field hospital. I would guess ovulation is beginning. It shouldn\u2019t be long now.\u201d</p><p>Charity bit her lip nervously at that information.</p><p>\u201cDo you think compatibility will occur?\u201d she asked her worriedly. She wasn\u2019t ready for a child.Wasn\u2019t ready to be bound that much tighter to Aiden during such a dangerous time. Nikki sighed. \u201cI need to get into the ovaries. But Aiden and Wolfe have expressly forbidden this. I could steal the egg forming and test it. This would give us the answers to compatibility, and in your case, the time you need to accept whatever is between you and Aiden.\u201d</p><p>Charity watched the other woman in surprise. \u201cWhy would they forbid such tests?\u201d</p><p>Nikki leaned back against the post behind her, watching Charity carefully.</p><p>\u201cBecause of the Council and their tests.Remember, Charity, they have been free for only a short time. For some, only a matter of months. Many of them still have nightmares; many others are still adjusting to freedom and the lack of Council restrictions. They have no desire to experience the tests again,\u201d she said reflectively. \u201cIt is often painful to watch them adjusting after a lifetime of hell.\u201d</p><p>Charity swallowed tightly. The six months she had spent as their prisoner had been hell on earth. She clearly understood how they felt. But this was her body, her decision.</p><p>\u201cHow quickly could you do the procedure? You would have to sedate me...\u201d</p><p>Nikki shook her head negatively. \u201cThe sedative could change the outcome of the tests, make them false. The procedure would have to be done free of anesthetics in your system.\u201d</p><p>Charity inhaled roughly, remembering the exam days before. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can stand it, Nikki. The pain is excruciating. \u201c</p><p>\u201cAnother puzzle.\u201dNikki frowned. \u201cI cannot figure that one out, Charity. There is nothing in your system, no reason why you should have such an aversion to any touch but Aiden\u2019s. To a point, Faith and Hope were the same. The Feline Breeds have experienced this, but conception occurs quickly in them, without drugs or hormonal treatments. From what I\u2019ve learned the last few days, you are in the final stages before conception. If we do this, it must be done quickly.\u201d</p><p>Charity turned away from her, staring across the compound as she focused on the mountains outside the high walls. She shuddered at the thought of attempting such a procedure without a sedative. The pain was terrifying.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI know I can\u2019t, Nikki. You have to find a way to sedate me.\u201d</p><p>Silence stretched between them. \u201cLet me run a few more tests then,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI need to be certain, Charity, that I can chance a clear result on the ovum. Otherwise the test will be useless. We\u2019ll get in enough trouble just doing it.\u201d She sighed mockingly. \u201cTo think, I gave up a nice little cushy government job to follow these Breeds. How dumb was that? They are much too stubborn.\u201d</p><p>Charity gave the other woman a knowing look. She knew well her friend\u2019s dedication and affection for the Breeds she worked with. As she started to reply a shrill alarm blasted through the compound, imperative, shrieking in its loud demand.</p><p>\u201cIn the cabin.\u201dNikki jumped up, pulling at her shirt as the two guards rushed around her.</p><p>\u201cInside, Ms. Dunmore.\u201dThe automatic rifles were raised in readiness as Nikki dragged her into the open door of the cabin followed by the guards.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Charity bit out as the door slammed behind them, the guards moving to the kitchen and living room windows to peer outside them with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cFly by,\u201d Nikki bit out. \u201cWe\u2019ve been getting them with increasing regularity.\u201d</p><p>Charity moved to the other side of the window, peeking out carefully. Jeeps were racing through the compound, several with mounted guns and rocket launchers. It was like a war zone now. Men and women raced through the compound as the sound of heavy aircraft coming in low began to vibrate through the cabin.</p><p>\u201cCouncil?\u201d she asked the guard worriedly.</p><p>\u201cMongrels,\u201d he bit out. \u201cThey have hired guns now. Wolfe, Jacob and Aiden are under constant threat.\u201d</p><p>Charity turned back to Nikki. \u201cWhat is he talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMercenaries, Charity,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWe can\u2019t trace them to the Council, but we know well who is behind it. Don\u2019t worry, Aiden would have called in our government reinforcements the moment the aircraft hit the radar screens.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>The sound was coming closer. The hard, pulsing beat of a jet-powered helicopter seemed to echo through the frame of the house.</p><p>\u201cDo they attack?\u201d She could feel her heart throbbing in her chest, fear racing through her blood stream.</p><p>\u201cSometimes.Get back from the window. If there are sharp shooters watching for you, you\u2019ll make too easy a target.\u201d Charity jumped back before the words were out of his mouth. She stared at Nikki across the room, seeing the other woman\u2019s concern.</p><p>\u201cThey rarely attack in the daylight,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cThey\u2019re getting desperate.\u201d</p><p>The words were no sooner out of her mouth than the cabin trembled as a hard, shocking explosion sounded outside.</p><p>\u201cThey hit Wolfe\u2019s cabin!\u201d the guard yelled furiously.\u201cSons of bitches. They hit Wolfe\u2019s cabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope,\u201d Charity breathed out desperately as she turned to the guard. \u201cGive me your fucking weapon. Get out there and see if they need any help. I don\u2019t need a damned babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharity, stop.\u201dNikki moved quickly to her,then stumbled as another blast rocked the building. \u201cWe have to get to the Labs. The underground shelter there will protect us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d Charity was enraged, furious. She could hear the screams outside, the sounds of returning fire. \u201cWe have to get to Hope, Nikki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are trying to draw you out,\u201d Nikki yelled furiously. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Wolfe and Hope. Wolfe knows how to protect his mate. I promise you, our best men, as well as Wolfe, are guarding her now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re turning. Get the hell out of here, they\u2019re heading in our direction,\u201d the guard at the window called out as he turned and jerked the front door open quickly.</p><p>\u201cThe Labs,\u201d Nikki called out. \u201cWe\u2019ll only be safe in the Labs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He grabbed Charity\u2019s arm, rushing her for the door. \u201cThey took out Wolfe and Jacob\u2019s cabin and are heading back.\u201d</p> <p>Charity moved between the guards, making no move to question them or to delay their plans. She was aware of Nikki behind her and the sound of the helicopter as it moved in once again.</p><p>\u201cSons of bitches have to have a plant,\u201d one of the guards cursed as he rushed her from the porch and under the cover of the trees that grew alongside the gravel path. \u201cLet\u2019s move.\u201d</p><p>The helicopter was moving in faster now. Charity could hear it, the motor throbbing, rotors beating in time to the desperate throb of her own heart. The guards were runningbeside her, checking behind them often, as curses sizzled from between their lips.</p><p>One minute she was running with him, the next she felt as though some unseen hand had picked her up, throwing her through the air as another explosion sounded behind them.</p><p>She heard herself scream a second before she hit the ground, the air expelling from her body with the force of her landing. She lay still, fighting to breathe, blinking against the blinding pain that attacked her body.</p> <p>\u201cMove.\u201dShe was picked up unceremoniously and hauled backward at the exact instant that a spray of bullets littered the gravel where she had lain.</p><p>All hell was erupting around her as she fought to breathe, to make sense of the screams echoing through the air. She looked around then, gasping, as her heart thumped in fear. The guards were unconscious or dead\u2014she wasn\u2019t certain which\u2014and moving in carefully were three large males, their scent unfamiliar, their faces hard, intent.</p><p>\u201cNikki!\u201d she yelled as she backed away from them, glancing behind her desperately then coming to a stop once again.</p><p>Nikki was dazed but standing, held upright by two other men, their shadowed faces determined.</p><p>\u201cCome with us, and you won\u2019t be harmed.\u201d She turned quickly as the obvious leader spoke up. \u201cNo, Ms. Dunmore. Don\u2019t make me force you.\u201d</p><p>She would have fought, but there were five and Charity knew there wasn\u2019t a chance she would escape unharmed.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll kill us anyway,\u201d she screamed as another explosion rocked the ground. Then she gasped in horror as he smiled. The canines were curved, gleaming, proof that the Coyotes had finally found her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, but I will if I must,\u201d he snarled. \u201cBelieve what you will for now, but you will come with us.\u201d</p><p>Gloved fingers gripped her arm, pulling her to the hole that had been blasted into the compound wall. Fear snaked through her belly as her body protested the touch, sending flares of pain radiating through her. Thankfully, as he pushed her forward, he released the grip he had on her. Charity prayed that somewhere, somehow Aiden was close by. Prayed he was safe. She could feel her cheeks, damp with tears, with desperation, as she glanced back at Nikki, hearing the other woman\u2019s vicious curses. She was frightened. Nikki rarely cursed unless the fear overcame her natural restraint. That fear increasedher own .</p><p>They were rushed through the break in the wall before being pushed quickly into a waiting jeep. Within seconds the vehicle was tearing away from the compound beneath the cover of the thickly growing pines as the helicopter swooped in for another pass at the compound.</p><p>\u201cI hope you all fry in hell,\u201d Nikki cursed them as they bounced over a particularly rough piece of ground.</p><p>\u201cI hope Wolfe and Aiden castrate you all.\u201d</p><p>No answer was forthcoming. The sound of battle receded as Charity fought the rage crawling through her system.Coyotes. They were no more than the Council\u2019s lapdogs. How would Aiden find her now, even if he had managed to survive the attack? He wouldn\u2019t know what had happened to her. Would he believe she had been in the cabin when it exploded? Of course he would.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest, fighting the desperation she could feel weakening her. She had to find a way free of this.</p> <p>\u201cWolfe will pay you more than the Council ever can,\u201d she bit out, knowing the mercenary hearts of the mongrels who had taken them. The Coyotes were known to betray their masters often.If the price was right. \u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake taking us back.\u201d</p><p>The driver glanced back, his surprisingly light blue eyes gleaming with disgust. \u201cThe Council doesn\u2019t own us, Ms. Dunmore, and we have no intention of taking you to them. You\u2019ll be returned to your mate as soon as you have accomplished something for us. Now sit back and relax. You\u2019ll understand in due time.\u201d</p><p>Shock left her gasping for breath. He was Coyote. She could see in the curved canines as he snarled, but she couldn\u2019t smell the rancid scent that normally emanated from the soulless Breed. She glanced at Nikki, seeing her eyes narrow, her expression harden as she turned her gaze back to the men in front of the jeep.</p><p>\u201cThe Council has puppets in many places,\u201d she said.</p><p>Charity held her breath. The words were simple, but the meaning behind them she well knew. The passenger turned back to her slowly, his gaze narrowed, intent.</p><p>\u201cPuppets have masters. Men play the fools. Breed Law will still yet survive.\u201d</p><p>And the answer was given. An answer only a handful of men and women could know.An answer that shocked Charity to the core of her being. Breed Law was barely formed. A code of honor so strict, so tightly enforced, that if a member broke it, be he Wolf, Feline or human, then instant death resulted.</p><p>\u201cYourPack?\u201d Nikki questioned. \u201cYou aren\u2019t Wolf. You\u2019re Coyote. Who controls you?\u201d</p><p>The smile she received in return was hard, mocking in its savagery. \u201cNo one or nothing controls us, doctor, save the code we follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat attack broke the code,\u201d she informed him furiously. \u201cYou know the price to be paid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe attack was not ours,\u201d he growled. \u201cSettle back and be patient. Your questions will be answered soon. And hopefully, ours will as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who attacked, Aiden will kill you before you get a chance to explain,\u201d Charity informed him furiously. \u201cYou\u2019ve made a mistake, Coyote.\u201d</p><p>Broad shoulders shrugged negligently as he turned back to face forward. Nothing else was said. The jeep increased speed as it broke the tree line and bumped onto the main road. The engine whined as gears shifted and the distance between herself and Aiden increased. Charity rubbed her arms and turned to Nikki, questioning their options silently. The other woman sighed and shook her head. Like Charity, she knew they could only wait and see what the end of the journey brought .</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Aiden stared at the hole in the compound wall, the letter he had found tacked to it. Breed Law dictated I make contact. I did so.Many times. Now, the ball is in your court. Though, my friend, I have what I needed. Do you?Del-Rey.</p><p>Del-Rey.Aiden had heard the name several times by the spies within the intricate network of information he had built over the years.Del-Rey, the light-haired Coyote who had broken away from the Council years before and disappeared from sight. His pack numbered at several dozen, and all hand picked and trained by him years before.</p><p>There was a rumor that unlike the Council Coyotes, Del-Rey and his men had adopted an honor system more brutal than even that of the Breeds.</p><p>\u201cWhen were we contacted?\u201d he asked Wolfe, the need for violence tightening every muscle in his body. Wolfe shook his head, staring into the distance thoughtfully. \u201cThere were several messages sent while we were rescuing the Winged Breeds. When I went to answer them, they had disappeared. I haven\u2019t tracked them down yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t told of this?\u201d Aiden growled. As head of security the missing messages would have been an important bit of information.</p><p>\u201cYou were busy. Hawke\u2019s been investigating the problem and I believe he\u2019s close to an answer.\u201d Wolfe shot him a hard, dark look. \u201cYour mate was more important, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>Aiden snarled again, the growl that thrummed in his chest was harsh, warning. \u201cAnd now my mate is gone, because of a few missing messages,\u201d he bit out. \u201cOnce she\u2019s found, Wolfe, I\u2019ll personally track down the traitor and exact vengeance myself.\u201d</p><p>Around them, the compound was organized chaos as everyone worked to repair the damage the attack had reaped. The Air Force had finally made their appearance and blown the helicopter into enough pieces to shower the area with metal and burning debris. But not before extensive damage had resulted. Aiden clenched his teeth, fighting to restrain the growl that pulsed in his chest. Fury was a bleak, burning pain in his chest. Or was it fury? All he could think about was Charity. Was she hurt? Had they touched her? Made her cry out in pain? He was nearly shaking with the hard edge of violence fighting to be free at that thought.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been betrayed,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThose in the helicopter knew where to strike, and when to move in. Your cabin, Jacob\u2019s, and the one we moved to in the middle of the compound. Each one was</p><p>sheltered from their radar and from sight. They knew where to hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Wolf Breed would have betrayed that information. It had to be one of the soldiers the Army assigned,\u201d Jacob bit out. \u201cThat could explain the missing messages as well as the attack on Aiden\u2019s cabin before.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe turned, staring back at the action going on throughout the compound. There was only the three of them at the wall. They had arrived in time to watch the jeep disappear over the rise and to find the note attached to the wall.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not in danger from the Council. But why would he need Nikki and Charity?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cAnd how did they know when to be here, unless they were aware of the attack coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s rumor Del-Rey has a network within the Council,\u201d Aiden bit out. \u201cAfter this thing with Charity was resolved, I had intended to set up a meeting.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe grunted. \u201cIt would appear Del-Rey wasn\u2019t willing to wait. Comeon, let\u2019s get back to the command center. If a message comes through, we need to be certain that we alone see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinding our spy won\u2019t be as easy,\u201d Aiden bit out. \u201cWhen we do, I want him, Wolfe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not under Breed Law, Aiden,\u201d Wolfe reminded him tightly.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it quietly,\u201d Aiden bit out. He wouldn\u2019t let the betrayal go unpunished, it didn\u2019t matter who it was, or who they were with. Several of their people had been seriously wounded in this attack, and now Charity and Nikki were missing. Breed Law demanded justice. He demanded it.</p><p>\u201cWe have to find him first.\u201d He jumped into the open jeep, waiting on Jacob and Aiden to follow before he put it in gear and headed for the communications building. \u201cBreed Law only applies to those who agree to it, Aiden, you know this. But the betrayal won\u2019t go unpunished, I swear that.\u201d</p><p>The drive to the communications building was a short one. Once the vehicle came to a stop, Aiden jumped from the back seat and moved purposely to the door. The betrayer had to be part of those who manned the radios and computers for the compound. Nothing else made sense. He stepped into the room, staring around at the men and women working there. Radar, satellite communications, cell phone transmissions, email and radio all came through here. Every man and woman who worked within the large room would have had access to the messages that had come just before they left for South America. One of them had been responsible for destroying them. He moved through the room, aware of Wolfe and Jacob at his back, watching the others carefully. There were over half a dozen Army personnel. He refused to believe a Breed had betrayed the locations of the most important cabins on the compound. No Wolf Breed alive would have betrayed their Pack Leader. The code of honor was a part of them, even before the written law came into effect. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cClear out the humans,\u201d he muttered as he turned to Jacob. \u201cI want only Breeds in this room until we get a message. Assign themelsewhere, put them on cleanup duty, I don\u2019t care. But get them the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>The rage building inside him was nearly more than he could control. The distinction between Breed and full-bred humans had never beenso impressed upon him as it was now. They were fighting for equality,</p><p>fighting to make their way in a world where they had been created rather than conceived naturally. They hadn\u2019t wanted to be different. But Aiden felt the differences now more than he had in his entire life. Not that it was unheard of for a Breed to turn violent.Quite the opposite. But never did one Breed betray another to the Council or to other humans. Their crimes were often against the Council or humans suspected of working with them. A few instances of insanity had pitted a Breed against his Pack, but never to the extent that they betrayed them to the monsters who created them. Disposable soldiers.This was what they had been designed for, he thought as he sat down in front of the master computer.Disposable.Without value. Creatures designed and created to follow the whims and cruelties of those who made them.</p> <p>In the eyes of the Council they had no humanity. They were animals, nothing more. In the eyes of many full-bred humans, he knew it was the same. He had seen it in their eyes, in their actions. The Breeds were different. They were animals, undeserving of loyalty or life.Undeserving of his mercy. When he found the bastard who had betrayed them, he would kill him. It was that simple.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned I hate caves,\u201d Nikki bit out as the jeep pulled into the wide entrance of just that.A cave.</p><p>The two men in the back jumped out and within seconds an expanse of concealing foliage slid across the entrance. Charity watched the maneuver with narrowed eyes. From a distance, the fake evergreens would look real and would effectively hide the entrance of the cave.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d The driver jumped from the front and turned back to them as lights flickered on in a tunnel to the left of them.</p> <p>\u201cImpressive.\u201d Charity gave the driver a hard look as she moved from the jeep. \u201cI bet you can see the Breed compound easily from here.\u201d</p><p>She had paid attention to the drive as it was made. Several times she had glimpsed the large lake that the compound sat beside as they moved into the mountains. She roughly guessed that with the right equipment, spying into the compound would be easy enough.</p><p>No one answered. They were moved quickly, impatiently through the tunnel until they entered a large, cavernous room. There, Charity stopped in shock. It was well lit, comfortably heated and laid out almost like a large home.</p><p>On the far side stood several electric cooking rings.Rough wood shelves held an assortment of pots and pans and dry goods. A small refrigerator sat on what was obviously a homemade table. Across from it was a long plank table with simple wood chairs.</p><p>Charity was standing at the entrance of what appeared to be the living area, though, benches, a few old, beaten recliners, a couch that had seen better days, and a card table.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll redecorate one of these days.\u201d The hard-eyed Coyote glanced at her mockingly. \u201cCome on, through here.\u201d</p> <p>Another tunnel led off to the side. This one was lit by several fat candles that had been set within grooved ledges in the stone wall. Within seconds of entering the narrow walkway, Charity heard the first moan. It was low, distressed and definitely female.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she heard Nikki mutter behind her, and Charity silently agreed. She knew that sound. They entered a bedroom. Against the wall a wide bed had been set up, made from rough wood but holding a large mattress. On the mattress the woman was curled into a fetal position, her arms wrapped around her abdomen. Beside her sat a tall, roughly handsome male, his dark blonde hair falling past his shoulders, his eyes cold and unusually black in his weathered face. He rose to his feet, the damp cloth he had been holding in his hands dropping to the table beside the bed. His eyes went to the men behind her.</p><p>\u201cCasualties?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNone.The Council was attacking so we grabbed them and ran before anyone was the wiser.\u201d</p><p>His broad chest lifted with a weary breath.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m certain someone\u2019s wiser by now,\u201d Charity bit out as she moved for the bed and the woman laying on it.</p><p>\u201cI hope you at least have some medical supplies,\u201d Nikki bit out as she followed. \u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d</p><p>Charity pushed back the long, tangled red hair that lay over the woman\u2019s face and checked her shoulder first. The whimpers, the position of the body and the soft scent she detected assured her she knew exactly what she was looking at. She looked at Nikki.</p> <p>The doctor stood back.</p><p>\u201cWho bit the woman?\u201d She turned her fierce gaze on the man who had moved back at they neared the bed.</p><p>Charity watched him as well. His eyes were as black as the pits of hell, though his gaze was as cold as ice.</p><p>\u201cWhat does the mark have to do with it?\u201d he bit out. \u201cWe\u2019re not infected, woman.\u201d</p><p>Charity watched the tight, sarcastic smile that shaped Nikki\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d she almost crooned. \u201cIf what I see is true, you\u2019re infected with this amazing little hormone, Coyote. It\u2019s really quite astounding.\u201d</p><p>The Coyote\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mated the woman.\u201d Charity wasn\u2019t in the mood to listen to Nikki bicker with the Coyote. She was tired, sore, and by God, she was horny. She wanted to waste as little time here as possible so she could get back to Aiden, their bed, and relief.</p><p>\u201cMated her?\u201d he bit out. \u201cCoyotes don\u2019t mate, woman. No matter the rumors...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you swell within her, big boy?\u201d Nikki bit out. \u201cWhile you were taking her, it\u2019s more than obvious you bit her, so I\u2019ll assume you locked inside her as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn anomaly,\u201d he growled.\u201cAnimal instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the Council trains their Coyotes in sexual conquest,\u201d she sneered the term the Council used for rape. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this is your first woman.\u201d</p><p>Charity listened to the bickering going on behind her as she checked the woman\u2019s pupils, her pulse then checked for the brand the Council placed on all its creations. She stilled when she pulled the girl\u2019s hair back and found nothing on her shoulders. She moved to her hips, pulling the blanket aside, and still found nothing.</p><p>\u201cCharity?\u201dNikki questioned her actions.</p><p>She turned back watching Nikki intently. \u201cShe\u2019s not a Breed.\u201d</p><p>Nikki moved then. She didn\u2019t speak and, like Charity, ignored the men as she began to exam the woman. She pushed at their hands, whimpering at each touch. She was perspiring heavily, her face pale, her blue eyes dazed as she fought them weakly.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Nikki cursed. \u201cNow look.\u201d She turned on the male watching them with a glitter of fury in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve cursed for hours straight. Do you know how mad that makes me? Do you know how mad you are making me? Do you have any idea what you\u2019ve done? Please, tell me you didn\u2019t rape this girl.\u201d</p><p>Fury lashed through her voice. Charity herself was trembling at the thought as she glimpsed the small bruises on the woman\u2019s breasts and arms.</p><p>\u201cThere was no rape,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cWho took her?\u201d Charity turned back then, facing him with Nikki, rage trembling through her body. \u201cIt was you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d He made no excuses, though Charity had found that few Breeds did.</p><p>\u201cYou mated her. She\u2019s in heat. Does she even know what you are?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, his gaze flickering from the woman who moaned roughly on the bed back to Charity, then Nikki.</p><p>\u201cI am a Coyote. Coyotes do not mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, big boy, either you advanced or you just plain lucked the fuck out,\u201d Nikki snarled. Charity winced. She said fuck. It wasn\u2019t good when Nikki said fuck. She watched the male\u2019s stubborn jaw tighten. He looked like a blonde-haired avenger with those black eyes staring down at them, his dark face flushing with anger or embarrassment, she wasn\u2019t certain.</p><p>\u201cContact the compound now,\u201d she bit out. \u201cShe\u2019s in advanced fertility and she\u2019s in heat. Neither of you are safe because if the Council finds out, and somehow they will, then this woman\u2019s life isn\u2019t worth squat. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden has been contacted,\u201d he bit out, his gaze going to the woman once again. \u201cWhat is the mating you keep talking about?\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her breasts, watching him with an almost rabid amusement. She was mad enough, and just frustrated enough that she was beyond caring if she antagonized her captor.</p><p>\u201cShe belongs to you now,\u201d Charity bit out. \u201cHer body is preparing itself, changing, matching yours enough that she will conceive.\u201d Did he pale? \u201cShe\u2019s in heat. She needs to be fucked.A lot.Almost constantly.By only you. Go figure. You\u2019re the first Coyote to mate, and you mated a full human at that. Damn, if you haven\u2019t shot some theories to hell and back. And here we thought Coyotes were only good for their stink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do not stink,\u201d one of the men behind her growled.</p><p>\u201cWas she talking to you?\u201d Nikki asked him sweetly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t pull your chain, big boy.\u201d</p><p>Pale blue eyes narrowed fiercely. \u201cYou have a smart mouth, woman,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cOh, you just realized that? Aren\u2019t you the smart one?\u201d She used the tone Charity knew was reserved for only the most obtuse.</p><p>\u201cYou wasted your time bringing us here,\u201d Charity bit out. \u201cAnd trust me, Aiden won\u2019t be pleased. You better be finding a hole to hide in...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nohole deep enough,\u201d Aiden\u2019s furious growl interrupted her as he stalked into the room. Following him were over two-dozen Wolf Breeds, their rifles raised warningly as they stepped into the room.</p><p>\u201cWell, looks like the cavalry has arrived,\u201d Nikki sniped.\u201cAll male and all pumping testosterone.Morons.\u201d</p><p>Charity sighed. Nikki wasn\u2019t pleased. It wouldn\u2019t be a pleasant return trip.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>Aiden stood in the entrance of a smaller cave farther atop the mountain the Coyotes had taken as home base. The cave was accessed by several long tunnels, then a ladder that led into a natural opening into the floor of the upper cavern. There, within the outside entrance, the leader of the Coyote Pack had set up a long distance telescope aimed into the Breed compound.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been watching you for months,\u201d he commented as Aiden focused the telescope with its night vision sight and watched the movements below. \u201cWhen I first learned that several of your women were experiencing problems similar to Anya\u2019s, I started sending the messages. When there was no answer, I grew desperate.\u201d</p><p>The moving red targets below flitted between trees and natural shelters as they patrolled the perimeters of the compound. Aiden knew there were also several others protected against the night vision sights who were keeping careful watch within the large trees of the area.Both inside and out.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you first realize who our spy was?\u201d he asked, knowing Del-Rey\u2019s messages as well as his means of drawing an answer were designed to keep his own identity hidden, as well as his location.</p><p>\u201cSeveral days ago,\u201d the other man sighed. \u201cI received information of the attack several hours before it happened. I sent yet another message. Once more it was ignored.\u201d</p><p>Aiden grunted.</p><p>\u201cWere you able to identify the spy?\u201d He wasn\u2019t in the mood to play games. He wanted the identity of the man who had dared to betray them.</p><p>\u201cBreed Law demands death,\u201d Rey mused softly. \u201cSometimes the answer isn\u2019t always so cut and dried, Wolf.\u201d</p><p>Aiden rose from the sight of the telescope and pinned the other man with a hard look. \u201cBreed Law exists for a reason, Del-Rey.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Coyote sighed wearily as he stared out into the night sky. \u201cBeing a Breed makes us much different from others,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019ve learned this, as I know you have. Full humans are varied in their consideration, their acceptance and their own codes of honor. To exist in this world we may have to make allowances.\u201d</p><p>Aiden watched him for long minutes then. The Coyote\u2019s shoulders were defiantly straight, his expression resigned. He leaned against the entrance to the cave, staring out as though the answers to their problems could be found there, in the concealing shadows of the night.</p><p>\u201cGet to the point,\u201d he bit out. He was more than eager to head home and to take care of the problems threatening the peace of his relationship with Charity, and his people. The other man turned to look at him slowly.</p> <p>\u201cThe Wolf Breed Packs have, in some ways, adopted the residents of the town, trusting them, believing in them and the propaganda of their officials that the Breeds are welcome. You treat it as though it were a place deserving of your loyalty, when in fact the hatred breeding there could eventually be the downfall of</p><p>the Wolf Breeds.\u201d</p><p>Aiden took a deep breath, preparing himself for what was to come as he met the other man\u2019s gaze directly.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you learned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany interesting things.\u201dHe gestured back to the entrance to the main caverns. \u201cI kidnapped Anya outside a Council Lab in Russia. The information I learned from her was rather surprising. There are quite a few groups forming eager to see all the Breeds wiped from the face of the earth. Men whose fathers and grandfathers before them have perpetuated the Race wars of the past have found a new fight. The Breeds will never find acceptance, Aiden. We will always find death no matter which course we take or which land we settle. And the conspiracy against them will beginhere, centered around this compound Wolfe builds to protect his people.\u201d Del-Rey\u2019s voice was soft, consoling as he spoke of yet more treachery, more deceit and death.</p> <p>\u201cNo man is an island, Del-Rey,\u201d Aiden reminded him softly. \u201cThere are many good people out there, willing to put their lives on the line right alongside the Breeds. We can\u2019t discount them. And our numbers are too small to do anything but pray that acceptance will come, in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Breeds are treading many fine lines,\u201d Del-Rey sighed. \u201cAnd if what I am learning from my own sourcesare true, the Council will never be disbanded. Their funds are too plentiful, and those who would help them, number too high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is the spy within our compound?\u201d Aiden asked again. \u201cThe rest we will deal with, but he comes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if it is not a he?\u201d the Coyote asked patiently. \u201cIf your traitor is female and well liked within your community, how then will you justify her execution?\u201d</p><p>It would have to be complicated, Aiden thought furiously. Why did he expect anything else now?</p><p>\u201cThe same as I would any man\u2019s,\u201d he bit out. \u201cThey signed Breed Law to work within the compound. Man or woman, they accepted the risks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if they believe their fight is one justified by their beliefs?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow do you punish someone for being true to their beliefs?Or to their own conscience?\u201d</p><p>Damn it. A philosophical Coyote was the last damned thing they needed. But mixed with his irritation was his own sense of helplessness. A male traitor would have been easy to kill. A woman... He pushed his fingers tiredly through his hair as he leaned his shoulder against the rock wall beside him. A woman was to be protected, cherished,not executed.</p><p>\u201cInteresting questions,\u201d he sighed. \u201cThankfully, it\u2019s not my call. But she will be dealt with, Del-Rey.One way or the other. Who is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is the daughter of the Mayor. She mans your radios and while neither you nor Wolfeare present, she secretly slips information to your enemies through her father. But the woman can be used. She hasn\u2019t betrayed you entirely. Remember, Aiden, who made certain Hope and Faith were not in those cabins before the attack. One of my men watched her movements.Watched as she went to each one and drew them to the communications building only minutes before the helicopter was spotted on radar. The</p><p>Council wanted only one woman.The one most likely to breed.Your woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica,\u201d he breathed the name in surprise. The young woman was in her first year with the American Military. He had thought her shy, timid, not the type to so willingly betray the people she had pledged to protect.</p><p>\u201cShe may even be unaware she had betrayed you.\u201d Del-Rey shrugged. \u201cHer father, though, is aware of his crimes, as are many in her family and the town she comes from. Can you kill them all?\u201d</p><p>And there lay yet another complication. They had sworn to give each man, woman and child in the world they sought to survive in, a chance.Individually. To trust as any full human would, in the compassion and generosity of the human spirit that they had hoped existed. There had been many who had helped them over the years. Many who had betrayedthem. This blow would change how well the Breeds dealt with the town now, and the trust they had placed in them.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be best if you stay hidden here,\u201d he finally sighed, knowing that Charity and Nikki were insistent that the woman be moved to the compound. \u201cYou seem to be pretty secure. Until we get rid of the full humans working within the compound, then your woman won\u2019t be safe, and neither will you. The news that Coyotes can mate will rock the Council. It could cause more bloodshed on the heads of those serving you within the organization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are few,\u201d Del-Rey grunted. \u201cBut I agree. I will need some time to alert them and havethem head for safety. We\u2019ve grown rather fond of our new home here; we may attempt to stay as long as possible. The freedom of it is much cherished.\u201d</p><p>There was a world of weariness in the other man\u2019s voice. A weariness Aiden knew resided withinhimself</p><p>. Their fight had only just begun, and he feared it might turn into a long, bloody battle that the Breeds could ultimately lose.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll head out before daylight.\u201d Aiden moved quickly for the entrance back to the tunnels. \u201cGo take care of your woman, Del-Rey. And if you would be so kind as to provide one of your sleeping caverns, I\u2019ll take care of mine.\u201d</p><p>Charity\u2019s heat had called to him before Del-Rey had drawn him to the vantage point to discuss the reasons why they had taken Charity and the doctor as they had. Aiden had been in little mood to hear excuses but now he well understood the Coyote\u2019s secretiveness. Their problems were only just beginning, and he\u2019d be damned if he knew a way to solve any of them. As the other man had stated, there wasn\u2019t a place on earth where they could truly find safety.</p><p>\u201cAiden.\u201dDel-Rey stopped him as he moved to enter the opening in the floor. Aiden turned back watching the other man carefully.</p><p>\u201cIf they conceive, the danger only worsens. What then?\u201d</p><p>Aiden\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWe don\u2019t wait, Rey. We show them now just how savage we can be in defending what is ours. We don\u2019t make mistakes and we keep the Code. Then we start praying. Because I have a feeling it\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s going to save us.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>The scent of her need tempted him, pulled at him,filled his senses with the ambrosia of her heat. Aiden stepped into the small cave Del-Rey had made available for him and Charity. She waited on him, stretched out atop the mattress, watching him with hungry eyes as he closed the rough wooden door behind him.</p><p>Candlelight flickered over her features, highlighting the dark depths of her eyes, the creamy complexion of her skin. He could smell the light scent of soap and rainwater, proof that she had managed to browbeat the Coyote Breeds into arranging for a bath.</p><p>A sheet covered her from breast to thigh, leaving her long, tempting legs bare. His hands went to his shirt, stripping it off quickly as he reached the end of the bed. He could feel the blood beating hard and heavy through his body, his cock throbbing in demand.</p><p>The primitive need to complete the mating cycle, to take that final step, pounded in his brain, in his body. She was his mate.His woman. She had been taken from him, touched by another, no matter how impersonally, his hold on her severed for long, agonizing hours. And more.To the bottom of his soul he believed Charity would conceive this night. Her scent was wilder, like spring nearing.A rebirth. Yet, he could tell her arousal was still heated, painful in her need. Breed mating instinct had never been explained to him. Hell, no one had known it existed until just recently. Feeling his way through each phase of it was the hardest journey Aiden had ever taken. Facing what he prayed was this final phase, was the hardest. He needed her, his body clamored, demanding the final submission, and he was terrified she would refuse. Would he have the strength to walk away from her if she did?</p><p>He could feel his own lusts spiraling. Feel his needs burning through his body.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you waiting?\u201d She tilted her head, watching him curiously. He moved to the side of the bed, sitting down on the mattress slowly as he turned to face her. He would have preferred to wait till another time, but he knew his body, his instincts had finally marked the end of his patience.</p><p>He reached out to her, his fingers smoothing over her cheek, his thumb running over her lips.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d he whispered, grabbing desperately for his control to ease her into the coming experience.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Her lips trembled nervously, her gaze flickering for just a moment, indicating that perhaps she did understand, or at least suspected.</p><p>He sighed roughly. \u201cThe mating is not complete, Charity. I\u2019ve tried to wait, to give you time to accept the bonds between us, but I can wait no longer.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a hard, steady breath. \u201cThis is about the anal thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She narrowed her eyes on him as her hands tightened on the sheet that covered her.</p><p>He grimaced, feeling her body tighten in rejection. \u201cI will not do this without warning you first, Charity. I swear to you, I will not hurt you. I can do no more than that.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow with insulting sarcasm. \u201cYou actually think it\u2019s going to fit?\u201d she drawled mockingly. Aiden couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cI know it will, Charity. And soon, you\u2019ll know it as well.\u201d</p><p>The most endearing little pout sculpted her lips then. Aiden had not seen this particular expression on her face before. Equal parts determination and curiosity mixed with her disappointment that the loving she had expected would not be coming. She was burning for his touch, her body throbbing in need of release. The heat was an inferno in her cunt, her scent as wild and sweet as a summer thunderstorm.</p><p>\u201cAiden, did I neglect to tell you I\u2019m really not into pain?\u201d she finally asked him carefully, her tone filled with exaggerated patience. \u201cI\u2019m sure you couldn\u2019t have guessed it by now, but it doesn\u2019t rate very high on my list of things to experience.\u201d</p><p>He hid his smile. Her smart mouth was one of the things he most enjoyed about her.</p><p>\u201cThere will be no pain, Charity. I promise you, the moment you ask me to stop, I will do so willingly. But I bet,\u201d he whispered, \u201cOnce I start, you will be begging to continue rather than ease up in my possession of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stop if I need you to?\u201d Her breathing had increased, her breasts rising and falling against the covering, her nipples poking against the cloth.</p><p>\u201cIf you need me to,\u201d he promised feeling his own breathing roughen, his cock so hard, so engorged with lust that the pain of it was nearly overwhelming. He could only pray he could maintain the control he needed not to harm her. \u201cJust relax for me, Charity.\u201d He drew the sheet slowly from her body, staring into her eyes, keeping his voice soft, low, comforting. \u201cJust relax and feel.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed tightly. \u201cYeah well, the feeling part is what\u2019s starting to worry me,\u201d she gasped as he lowered his head, lips covering the mark on her shoulder.\u201cOh hell. I guess we\u2019ll find out now if it really is an exit only.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aiden chuckled. He couldn\u2019t help himself. He could hear her nervousness, her arousal and her acceptance of what was coming in the tone of her voice. Her hands gripped his forearms as he stroked his tongue over the mark he had left on her, relishing the sweet, slightly tangy taste of her skin. Her body was soft and delicate in his arms and he couldn\u2019t help the unfamiliar surge of emotions that welled within him. He held on to her, his hands moving to her back as he drew her closer in his arms, needing to hold her, to know she was safe, secure.</p><p>He remembered clearly that blinding fury that had surged through his soul when he realized she had been taken.Fear. He had never known fear in his life until that moment. The thought of his own death did little to affect him. The thought of so much as the slightest added pain to the delicate body in his arms sent his primal senses thundering with the need for violence.The need to mark in that final, ultimate surrender.</p><p>\u201cI lost my mind when I realized you were gone,\u201d he whispered at her ear, feeling her tremble in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI have never howled in my life, Charity. But the moment I realized you were missing, even the wolves knew my rage.\u201d</p><p>They had answered the primal call. They had tracked the jeep as it made its way up the mountain, then returned the news of its location as it stopped. Primal instinct, sharp, flashing, a communication with the animals he had never expected.</p><p>\u201cI was frightened,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI prayed you would find me, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I did,\u201d he growled. He couldn\u2019t stop the vibration that echoed through his voice. \u201cI have to finish this now, Charity. I have to complete the mating.Now.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t explain it. It made no sense. The act of anal sex would not aid in conception. The hormone in his semen would in no way affect anything to further mark her. Yet, he couldn\u2019t deny the impulse. He wanted to turn her instantly to her stomach, raise her hips and mount her immediately. Assure himself that she was his, completely his, submitting to the sexuality between them, accepting the mating they shared. And he feared it was from there that the overwhelming need was bred. The need, the overwhelming compulsion to assure himself that his mate was his alone. That she would submit to his every need. That she would give herself, no matter how he needed her.</p><p>His lips covered hers as he fought the baser instinct to take her quickly. His tongue probed her mouth, stroking over hers, licking at her teeth, her lips, growling fiercely until she drew on him, suckling at the swollen glands at the side of his tongue.</p><p>He moaned as he felt the release of the hormone, his cock jerking at the thought that within minutes her needs would outstretch his, her arousal becoming an inferno that would burn them both in the cataclysm.</p><p>\u201cAiden, wait.\u201d She pulled back from him, breathing heavy, fighting for control. He knew she was fighting for control.Fighting to analyze the responses of her body, to understand the actions and reactions of their sexuality.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want the scientist in his bed that night. He wanted the woman.His mate.Her fiery heat searing him, her juices flowing with her need. He growled at her, his lips lifting in a snarl as his fingers tangled in her hair, holding her still as his lips took her again.</p><p>When she refused to suckle his tongue into her mouth, he nipped at her lips until they parted with a hot gasp. He could feel her body growing hotter, smell the rich, feminine scent of her arousal wrapping around him, drowning him in the scent of her lusts.</p><p>His head tilted, his lips slanting over hers as he finally allowed her to release him. She was panting for breath, her hands kneading his shoulders as she rubbed her hard tipped breasts against his naked chest, as one hand slid down his abdomen to grip the shaft of his cock. He grimaced, throwing his head back as her finger stroked the heavy veins and pulsing flesh. The agony of his desire was like nothing he had known before. It tightened his body, coursed through his veins and tingled up his spine with a pleasure that surpassed anything he had heard rumor of.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d He gripped her fingers, pulling them back from his needy flesh as he pushed her to the bed.</p><p>\u201cThis is for you, Charity.All for you. You may give to me later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She stared up at him, her eyes dazed, almost black with her desire. \u201cI need to touch you, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, love,\u201d he soothed her gently as he moved beside her, his palm cupping a swollen breast with the utmost gentleness. \u201cRelax, Charity.Just feel, baby.For me. Just feel all the sensations I can bring to your body.\u201d</p><p>Then he could resist no longer. His head lowered, his mouth covering the elongated nipple awaiting his attention. He felt her body jerk, heard the tumultuous cry that escaped her lips and knew that before the night was over, she would never deny the mating again.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-One</p><p>Charity hadn\u2019t realized how frightened she had been until Aiden had arrived within the caverns. His strong arms had wrapped around her, his muscular body sheltering her, holding her in a way that reassured her, protected her. She hadn\u2019t realized how much she needed his strength until he had entered, expecting her, needing her to lean on him.</p><p>And now he needed so much more. She trembled as she watched his head lower to the breast he cupped in his hand. She couldn\u2019t restrain the near violent jerk of her body, or the gasping indrawn breath when the heat of his mouth enclosed the hard tip.</p> <p>His tongue curled around her nipple, drawing a desperate moan from her throat as her hands gripped at his shoulders. She could do nothing but feel, as he wanted her to. Nothing but ride the wave of sexuality and pleasure he was inflicting on her heated senses.</p><p>His long, knowing fingers kneaded her sensitive breasts as his tongue licked the hard, pointed tip in time to the deep suckling motions of his mouth. Then he moved over her further, his hands pressing the full mounds of her breasts together, drawing the two hard nipples together as his mouth covered both.</p><p>\u201cAiden, damn you.You\u2019re killing me.\u201d She was fighting for breath, for her sanity, but her hands were locked in his hair, holding him close to her as her body arched closer to the heated caress. Her head tossed on the mattress as sensation swelled inside her. Like a lava-hot tidal wave, it began to build within her womb, stronger, more intense than ever before. She could feel her juices sliding from her cunt, dampening the bare folds like hot honey. Her clit throbbed, pleaded for attention. Her vagina clenched spasmodically, demanding the hard throbbing length of his cock. She whimpered with that need as he gave her nipples a final lick before his lips began to travel lower.</p><p>Her fingers clenched in his hair as his canines raked the perspiration-damp skin of her abdomen. Then her breath caught in her throat as he blew a breath of heated air across her pulsing clit.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, lifting her hips to him, needing his tongue on the small nerve center as desperately as she needed air to breathe.</p><p>\u201cI want to taste you first,\u201d he whispered as he moved between her thighs slowly, his eyes dark, cloudy with desire as he spread her legs, encouraging her to bend her knees and open herself to him. She watched him, helpless in the grip of the sensations swelling through her body. She watched as his long graceful fingers caressed her thighs,then his head lowered. His tongue distended then swiped slowly through the narrow, soaked slit of her pussy.</p><p>She shuddered. Her body quaked with the intensity of pleasure that engulfed her senses. Her head fell back to the bed, her eyes closing as her hips lifted to him.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she begged, panting, nearly mindless in the grip of sensations washing over her. Heat flickered at her cunt, traveled through her womb, wrapped around her breasts. Like unseen, taunting fingers it stroked over her body, fanning the flames higher.</p><p>His hands smoothed over her thighs and the muscles there trembled as he drew slowly closer to the damp folds of flesh he was feasting ravenously at. His tongue flickered through the sensitized slit teasingly, circled her swollen clit then flickered down again to rim the clenching entrance to her vagina. Like a slow, careful figure eight, a teasing, seductive dance of fire, he stroked and licked, drawing the silky juices from her cunt, holding her open, allowing them to slide heatedly to the entrance of her anus. She knew what was coming. Her brain sounded a warning that was lost amid the suckling, licking caresses of his lips and tongue. And she thought it could get no worse. Thought she had reached the pinnacle of need, until he showed her otherwise.</p><p>She felt his hand move as his tongue tempted her clit. One long, graceful finger slid into the tight entrance of her greedy pussy. She tried to clench her thighs, to trap his finger inside her, but his broad shoulders held her open as his warning growl had her shuddering in heated response. Her hips lifted as she fought to draw him deeper inside. She needed him moving, plunging his finger inside her to free the taut need spiraling within her womb. Yet he only teased, drawing her higher, stoking the fires to a desperate pitch as her cries echoed around them. She was so desperate, poised so close to the edge of orgasm that she opened naturally for the finger that slid to her anus and pressed slowly inside.</p><p>\u201cAiden,\u201d she chanted his name as she felt the digit fill her, slowly stretching her, preparing her. Even more frightening was the sudden, intense pleasure that washed over her, as he stroked in and out, accustoming her to the feel of being invaded.</p><p>\u201cYou are so pretty, Charity,\u201d he growled. \u201cSo flushed and responsive, you make me nearly lose control, when I need to hold onto it.\u201d</p><p>She felt a second finger join the first.Working inside her tight depths, as the muscles clenched on his fingers. The streaking wash of pleasure/pain had her fighting for the nearing climax she could feel burning in her womb. She twisted in his grip, her hands falling from his head to the blankets beneath her as she fought to hold onto reality.</p><p>She was pressing against each stroke into her anus now, gasping,feeling the vibrations of the entrance tease at her hungry cunt. If only he would fill her, fuck her to orgasm before he decided to try to destroy her sanity.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand this.\u201d She wanted to scream but she had barely the breath to whimper pleadingly. \u201cPlease, Aiden. Don\u2019t tease me like this any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could sip from your honey for hours,\u201d he whispered, licking into the clenching entrance of her cunt as she shivered beneath him.</p><p>Then his tongue plunged inside her, separating sensitized muscles and sending tremors of her nearing orgasm washing over her. When his tongue drew back he rose from between her thighs, his fingers sliding from the hot depths of her anus.</p><p>\u201cTurn over for me,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI won\u2019t last much longer, Charity. Submit to me now.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. The words, the tone of voice, were more primal than ever before. His features were etched with savage lust, his eyes glittering with a hunger, a need that couldn\u2019t be missed. This had nothing to do with a sexual fetish and everything to do with sexual submission. His desires were now instinctive. He was her mate and he was getting ready to prove it to her. She turned slowly. Her heart was racing in her chest; lust pounding in her veins, burning her with her own needs. And there was Aiden, his hands turning her as he moved quickly behind her. There were few preliminaries. The need was like fire searing their nerve endings, drowning them in the drive for release. Hard hands smoothed over the curves of her rear as she shuddered before him. One moved up her back, caressing up her spine before applying pressure between her shoulders to indicate he wanted them lowered. She was left with her upper body cushioned on the mattress, her rear raised, unprotected before his heated gaze.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Two</p><p>Candlelight flickered over the room as lust steamed around them. Charity knew she should have been nervous, should have been shaking with fear. She knew what he was about to do couldn\u2019t actually be done. The thick length of his cock was too large, her anus too small. Her fingers clenched in the sheet beneath her. She couldn\u2019t deny the erotic, sexual tension that invaded her at the thought, though.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty,\u201d his words whispered over her as she felt her cunt burn in response to the fingers that moved over the curves of her buttocks, his thumbs sliding down the cleft between them. Charity could feel her body burning. Shudders of arousal shook her muscles, weakening her as Aiden moved into position behind her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSlow and easy, baby,\u201d he whispered as she felt the head of his cock nudge against the entrance to her anus.</p><p>She would have preferred that her body appear less desperate for the primal impalement, but she could feel her muscles relaxing, her greedy body attempting to open for him. Charity whimpered in desperation as she felt the head of his cock flex and throb then she jerked in surprise as she felt the heated pulse of fluid that shot into the entrance of her anus.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d His voice was guttural. One hand clamped to the side of her buttock; holding her still, he paused with just the tip of his cock buried at the entrance.</p><p>Amazingly, shockingly, Charity felt the slick fluid heating the entrance, lubricating it as it slowly relaxed her muscles. She knew she should fight to hold onto enough sanity to figure out what the hell was happening to her body, but the arousal growing inside her had a mind of its own. She pressed against the velvety crown of his cock as she felt her entrance relax further, crying out as the head buried inside her, stretching her, burning the tender, untried muscles there as they stretched to accommodate the width of his cock.</p><p>He paused. She could hear him breathing, the sound rough and hot in her ears as she realized he was fighting for his own control. Another pulse of the fluid filled her then, the silky fire blazing into her anus, igniting nerve endings, sensitizing them even as it relaxed her muscles further. She felt him slide deeper into the dark channel as a fiery wash of pleasure/pain attacked her sensitized body. The hard, heated pulses of fluid seemed to relax each muscle, allowing her body to accommodate the size of the invader stretching it so deliciously. She clenched her muscles around Aiden\u2019s cock, hearing him groan with a rush of pleasure as she caressed in turn.</p><p>His hands gripped her hips, his fingers kneading the flesh as she felt him slide deeper, deeper, until with a final thrust he was buried to the hilt inside the hot depths of her ass. Charity was shaking as she felt him cover her. His upper body lowered over her back, his teeth scraping the mark at her shoulder as his tongue swiped over it soothingly.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re hot, Charity,\u201d he growled at her ear.\u201cSo hot my cock is on fire from it.\u201d</p><p>His hips flexed, drawing his cock back several inches before thrusting forward once again. Charity cried out at the deep, forbidden caress as she felt the flames in her body burning higher, hotter. She couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t make sense of the depth of arousal churning in her womb.</p><p>\u201cYeah, tighten on me, baby,\u201d he gasped as she did just that.\u201cAh hell.Charity. You\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>The words sent a fist punch of reaction into her womb, shocking her with the power of the pleasure she was receiving from his cock buried up her ass.</p><p>She was filled with him. Her flesh stretched so tightly around him that she could feel the throb of each pulse of his cock into her cunt. The fluid that still shot in her ass had her slick, lubricated so well that there was no stress to her muscles as he began to move inside her.</p><p>\u201cAiden.\u201dShe flexed her muscles around his erection. It hurt, yet it was the most incredible pleasure she</p><p>had ever known.</p><p>\u201cThere, baby,\u201d he growled, thrusting back into her, his thick cock taking her anal channel easily. \u201cWe\u2019ll do this nice and easy, baby.\u201d</p><p>At first, slow and gentle, leaving them both gasping with the need for more.But within minutes her cries were filling the room as his thrusts began to increase.His cock stroked inside her, back and forth, alternately soothing and inflaming the nerve endings there as he fucked her with slow easy strokes. But the needs growing inside her refused to be quenched by such an easy possession. She tightened the muscles of her anus, clenching and stroking his cock as his breathing roughened further. He was nearly gasping for breath now, joining her in the insanity of arousal beginning to overtake them.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he growled.\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Charity. You keep milking my cock like that and I won\u2019t be responsible...\u201d His groan was harsh, broken as she tightened again, her hips undulating beneath him as she fought for more of the heated strokes of pleasure/pain that each thrust brought.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she moaned, pressing back into the possession.\u201cHarder, Aiden. Oh God, fuck me harder.\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe it. There was no way she could live through such intensity, such a level of pleasure and pain combined.</p><p>His cock surged into her ass, parting the muscles with a stroke of pinching pain, then sinking into the hot depth with a lightning stroke of agonizing pleasure.</p><p>He began to move faster. He drew his cock back slowly from the tight grip she had on it, their cries mingling in the steamy air around them. But when he pushed forward again, Charity fought to keep from screaming with the intensity of sensations. The hard, forceful strokes awoke such an intense driving need for more that she became helpless in its grip.</p><p>She knew later she would blush from the memory of how desperately she began to beg. Even as he began to move inside her, his thrusts increasing in speed, in desperation, she begged. Charity couldn\u2019t still the hunger raging through her. The intense pleasure, the pure eroticism of the act was too much for her to comprehend, to make sense of. All she knew was that each driving stroke, each hard thrust was throwing her closer, driving her higher to a pinnacle of pleasure she was desperate to reach.</p><p>Her back bowed, her hips tilted back, her muscles clenched on the impaling cock as yet more of the slick fluid shot into her greedy ass. His cock surged inside her, fucking her with a deep, driving rhythm. She trembled, shaking, screaming out at the sensations as he pushed one hand beneath her body, his fingers moving to her swollen clit as he began to pound into her harder, faster, torturing her anal channel with each stroke. She was on fire, the pleasure building until a painful inferno of need burned through her body.</p><p>She could feel his stroking fingers driving her clit closer to explosion.The hard thrusts up her ass driving her to mindless, insane lust. Each pulse of the heated fluid from the tip of his cock made her hungry for more.Made her desperate for the hot, surging explosion of his sperm inside her instead.</p> <p>\u201cNow, Charity.Now, baby.\u201d His fingers stroked the bundle of nerves carefully, just the right pressure, two quick strokes and she exploded.</p><p>She felt her ass clench, tighten on his flesh a second before she heard his heated cry, felt his teeth lock into her shoulder. And she would have been terrified.Should have been screaming in fear as she felt the thick swelling of the knot surge inside her already overfilled ass. She would have... Instead, she screamed out at the blinding pleasure as the engorged knot seemed to fill her pussy, tightening her muscles there, sending a surge of cascading sensations clear to her womb. The orgasm that shook through her destroyed her. It was never ending, a quaking inferno of lust, of pleasure/pain, of fiery satisfaction unlike anything she could have imagined. She felt the eruption of his sperm into her anus. A hard, almost brutal jerk of his body that tugged at the anchoring knot as his seed poured into her. Another climax rippled over her before the first could ease away, throwing her back into the abyss of sensation once again. It would never end. She was crying weakly, helpless in the grip of her body\u2019s driving response to this primal possession. How her fragile anus accommodated his size as well as the hard swelling she didn\u2019t know, she didn\u2019t care. It was taking every inch with greedy pleasure as her cunt erupted time and again from each explosion of seed from his cock, each hard throb of the knot that echoed into her sensitized pussy.</p><p>She collapsed weakly beneath him, shudders of her echoing orgasm still tearing through her as she felt the swelling slowly recede. He drew back from her then, his cock dragging through the sensitive tissue as she whimpered weakly from the nearly painful pleasure it caused. She lay dazed, weak as he moved from the bed to the pitcher of water that sat in a metal basin across the room. She heard water cascade into the large bowl, the sounds of it splashing, then silence. Seconds later his hands touched her and she groaned as he drew the cool cloth between her thighs, cleaning her gently.</p><p>Aiden was tender, as gentle as he knew how to be as he cleaned her. His large hands weren\u2019t demanding or in any way trying to evoke a response. But one came anyway. Within minutes she was moving beneath his hand, her drowsy moans marking her need. She was tired, worn, but her immediate response triggeredhis own .</p><p>There were no preliminaries as he moved between her thighs. His cock washard, his breathing as heavy as hers, and the drive to take her again was quickly making him insane. He pushed into her soaked pussy.Hearing her gasp, moan as she tightened around him. He knew her weariness was a deep as her need, and he moved quickly to ease one so the other could overtake her.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so fucking tight, Charity,\u201d he whispered, his hands gripping her hips as he stared at where his body possessed her. \u201cSo hot and wet I could drown in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrown,\u201d she moaned weakly. \u201cFuck me, Aiden.Now. Hard.\u201d She was whimpering with her need, with her arousal as her cunt clenched around his erection.</p><p>He leaned into her, holding her against his body as he began to pump inside her. His eyes closed as the fist tight heat clamped on his cock. Slick fire, the pulse of the lubricating fluid from his cock making her hotter, wetter, but the tightened muscles never let go of his flesh. He was gasping for breath as he thrust inside her. His erection was brutally hard, sensitized, and only</p><p>seconds from exploding when he felt the quaking shudders rush through her body and her own climax overtaking her.</p><p>He followed her swiftly, barely containing his cry of pleasure as he felt his cock swell, filling her, arching her body as he locked inside her, his seed spewing into the rich depths of her body as she slowly stilled beneath him.</p><p>His hands soothed her, eased her into sleep even before he was able to pull his cock from her tight grip and collapse beside her. Satisfaction unlike anything he had known washed over him then. It settled through his body, warmed his soul. And as he looked down at her, he knew he loved her. Knew he had loved her even years before, when he thought he had hated her. He kissed her cheek as he pulled her closer to his body and allowed himself to drift slowly into rest. As long as she was safe, he could sleep.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Three</p><p>Her scent had definitely changed. Aiden lay, hours later after coming awake, staring up at the ceiling as his senses picked up the slow change within her body. She lay with her back against his chest, his arms wrapped around her as he kept her warm, comforted, and noted the conception taking place. Rather than a scent that reminded him of a storm breaking across the mountains, this one reminded him of spring, of warm, surging life. His eyes closed as his hand moved to her flat abdomen, his fingers spreading across the warm expanse of flesh.</p><p>His eyes closed as he allowed the truth to wash over him. He had loved her before, fiercely, heatedly, but what he felt now overwhelmed emotions only barely being recognized. He stared across the room at the rough table, the rock wall, a frown creasing his brow as he wondered at the often confusing impulses that ran rife through his system.</p><p>He had rarely known tenderness.Had no use for softness. Yet he found he could treat Charity no other way. Everything in him softened for her, and that terrified him. Terrified and exhilarated him. He stared down at her face, sighing softly at the clench of his heart. How many times had he scoffed at Wolfe and Jacob for their attitudes toward their mates? Hell, he had flat-out laughed at Wolfe for giving into Hope\u2019s desire for a wedding. And yet, here he lay, knowing if Charity asked for such a thing, no matter howmuch the social practices of those who reviled him, irked at him, he would do it. She had conceived. He could feel the knowledge to the soles of his feet. In the last hours as he held her, the change had taken place within her body. What had triggered it, if anything had, he wasn\u2019t certain. But as he thought about it, considered the overriding need to take her in the most elemental manner, he thought that perhaps instinctively, he had known. He had known that the process was slowly evolving, her body accepting his seed, and he had needed to mark her in that final way, to impress upon her how </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>tightly they were bound.</p><p>It made sense now. Wolfe and Jacob hadn\u2019t yet seen what Aiden now saw. The need to take their mates anally had nothing to do with the changes their bodies were making. It was due to the fact that during ovulation, their senses were so well-honed, so aware that their mates were evolving to perfect fertility that they went into overload. The need for sexual submission forged a desire that would otherwise not be so imperative. It was primal.Animalistic. And it offered no apologies. Sighing deeply, he dragged himself away from her, tucking the thick quilt around her body and pulling himself to his feet. Dawn was only hoursaway, and there was much to do. The information he learned here changed several plans he, Wolfe and Jacob had been trying to find time to implement. It also raised the question of the Breed Code and how far they were willing to go to enforce it. The woman who had betrayed them had signed her agreement to it and apparently, willingly betrayed them. The thought of killing a woman, especially one so young, was abhorrent to him. He dressedslowly, the reality of the Breeds\u2019 lives a heavy burden on his soul. How would they ever fit into the world when their very DNA marked them as different, animalistic? They weren\u2019t seen as completely human, even by those who aided them. He smelled their fear, their distrust. Such basic human responses always resulted in bloodshed, eventually.</p><p>He gazed down at Charity one last time, every muscle in his body protesting the need to leave her for even a short time. Then he shook his head, still a little confused at how easily she had wormed her way into his soul, as he strode quickly from the small cave.</p> <p>The interconnecting tunnels and caves were the product of a gold mining venture from nearly a century past. Every drop of ore had been mined from the once rich veins that had run through the mountain, leaving in its place a system of caves and tunnels that the Coyotes had slowly marked as a home. The main tunnel was wider than the others and led back to the main cavern where Wolf and Coyote Breeds mingled in reluctant camaraderie. Their fight was now the same, but there were still questions to be answered.</p><p>The Coyote Breeds that inhabited the caves lacked the rancid smell of the Council mongrels that obeyed the whims of their creators. Aiden had often suspected that the evil of those men were what produced the smell of death that lay about them like an aura of shame. Del-Rey\u2019s Coyotes, like all Breeds, had their own distinctive scent, wild, untamed, but without the scent of carnage. It was perplexing, the laws of nature that were beginning to apply within the different Breeds and the framework of the almost instinctive code of honor they held. Coyotes in nature, knew little honor, unlike the Wolf, and Felines that most Breeds were related to. Coyotes were known to have no soul. Yet in this instance, with the Coyote Breeds of this pack, it seemed the human spirit itself had made up for the lack.</p><p>\u201cAiden, Wolfe has the situation back at the compound under control. The woman is being watched and all relays from her station are being monitored. She slipped out a report several hours ago of Charity\u2019s death,\u201d Hawke reported, his voice dark and filled with menace. Aiden sighed in resignation. \u201cGet ready to move out in one hour.\u201d He turned to Del-Rey. Del-Rey was leaning against the wall, his arms crossed over his chest, watching Aiden through dark, emotionless eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou are welcome to return to the compound,\u201d he told him. \u201cThe problem of the woman you\u2019ve kidnapped could cause you problems, though. You may be forced to return her.\u201d</p><p>Del-Rey smiled, though it was more a snarl. \u201cI don\u2019t think that will be happening, Aiden. I know now what I needed to know. We will stay here. Perhaps our Packs could work together, though. I believe such a union would benefit us all.\u201d</p> <p>Aiden nodded shortly. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about getting you some equipment up here. I have several ideas I\u2019ll discuss with Wolfe first. We need to move carefully, Del-Rey. World opinion could turn against the Breeds as easily as it has worked for us.\u201d</p><p>The other man tilted his head in acknowledgement. Aiden had a feeling working with him could be more difficult than working with the government liaisons who drove the Breeds crazy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll contact you soon then. Get a list together of supplies you need, equipment, whatever. Let\u2019s see about helping each other instead of working against each other. Assign one of your men to the compound; I\u2019ll leave one of mine here to coordinate as well. I have a feeling time is of the essence now.\u201d</p><p>Del-Rey nodded as he straightened from his slouch position and moved to several of his men to begin getting things together.</p><p>\u201cHawke, contact Wolfe,\u201d Aiden told him quietly. \u201cI want that woman secured before I head in with Charity. We\u2019ll deal with her on our return.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s eyes flashed, his expression hardening as though he would protest the order before he nodded abruptly and turned away. Whatever was on the other man\u2019s mind would have to wait.</p> <p>\u201cNikki.\u201d The doctor sat at the table watching the meeting with curious, dark eyes. She rose to her feet and walked to him slowly. She watched his expression carefully, he noted, her own somber and intense.</p><p>\u201cCharity?\u201dHis throat closed up. Son of a bitch, this overload of emotion was more than aggravation.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s conceived,\u201d she said a bit too loudly. \u201cI figured it would happen soon.\u201d</p><p>He watched her questioningly as her lips quirked somberly. \u201cToo many changes in her body too quickly.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cLet\u2019s hope conception eases her inability to be touched. We\u2019ll have to watch this closely, Aiden.\u201d He could see her fears, her worries. He nodded shortly, clenching his jaw against his own fears. \u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving here soon. Find out what they need in the way of medical supplies so we can get those together. We may have more need of them than we could imagine right now. We have to keep her safe.\u201d And there lay his greatest fear.</p><p>\u201cYes we do,\u201d she sighed tiredly. \u201cHer safety, Aiden, must become the Pack\u2019s ultimate goal. I\u2019ll be done quickly. I had already anticipated your order. I\u2019ve found at times, you Breeds can be highly predictable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve found they can be highly irritating.\u201d Aiden turned in surprise at the sound of Charity\u2019s voice. She stood in the entrance to the room, dressed and ready to fight. Her face was flushed, her eyes glittering with anger.</p><p>\u201cWhen were you going to tell me?\u201d she asked him with a tone of forced patience as the rest of the occupants turned to watch the confrontation.</p><p>He grinned. He could see the telltale emotion in her gaze, the love she thought she kept so carefully hidden from him. He shrugged negligently.</p> <p>\u201cWhen were you going to tell me ?\u201d He tried to keep his voice stern. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m unaware of the fact that you suspected this before the attack that you were ovulating? Come, Charity, I may be male, but I\u2019m hardly stupid.\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you were,\u201d Nikki jumped into the fray. \u201cOtherwise you wouldn\u2019t have been so reticent over the exam I wanted to perform. Really, Charity, all you had to do was say something.\u201d Her voice was smoothly mocking.</p><p>Charity frowned at her friend fiercely as she crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I was waiting for more than a damned mating,\u201d she bit out furiously, though he could hear the hurt behind her words as she speared him with another look. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I accepted that submission stuff either, Aiden,\u201d she bit out. \u201cYou say I\u2019m your mate. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled then. He paid little attention to the men who watched him or their interest in the confrontation as he moved quickly to her. He caught her around her waist, pulling her flush against his body, allowing her to feel the erection that had not yet truly eased.</p><p>\u201cI say you are my heart,\u201d he said clearly. \u201cAnd if you remember correctly, I told you this before either of us suspected the change, Charity.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cSomeone has to be, because it\u2019s clear you don\u2019t have one,\u201d she sniped trying to pull away from him.</p><p>He shook his head, more than a little confused as he stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Charity, what more do you want?\u201d He frowned as she suddenly stilled in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d she whispered faintly. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at her, amused, so filled with his love for her that at times he wondered how he could hold it all.</p><p>\u201cI love you, mate,\u201d he growled as he lowered his head until his nose touched hers. \u201cSee what is as plain as the nose on your face. You are my heart, Charity.My soul.My mate.\u201d</p><p>As slow as the dawn, as gentle as a summer morning her smile washed across her face, though she tried to narrow her eyes in intimidation, nothing could still the joy he saw spreading through her.</p><p>\u201cFine.I guess I\u2019ll let you be my mate then.\u201d She went to push away from him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He pulled her back. \u201cI expect a bit more than that after making medeclare myself in</p><p>front of Coyotes.\u201d He was more than aware of snickers sounding behind him. She peeked over his shoulder, a smile tugging at her lips as she returned her gaze to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they are kind of amused,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut their day will come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I\u2019m waiting for.\u201d His hand slid to her rear as he patted it warningly. \u201cSurely you have more to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she drawled. \u201cI would tell you how much I love you, but right now that hand patting my ass is a little too arrogant. Rein it in.\u201d</p><p>His brow arched. She filled him with joy, but he could tell it would be no small matter to keep the upper hand with her. His hand tightened on the tempting curve of her buttock as he lifted her closer. She gasped as his thigh pressed against the soft mound of her pussy. He could feel her heat, and then he could smell it.Natural, needy, a heady scent that went to his head faster than any drug.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she breathed out, suddenly serious, her eyes moist with emotion, velvet soft with feeling. \u201cI always have, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened her around her, his head lowering to catch her lips in a kiss that seared his soul. It was no more than his lips to her lips as his eyes stared into hers. No more than the meeting of souls. In that moment Aiden knew that the gift of her love, given so long before, was all that had driven him. Unknowingly, instinctively, he had known that only she could light the bleak dark corners ofwho and what he was. And she filled it, lighting it with such emotion and such need, it nearly drove him to his knees.</p><p>\u201cWe have an audience,\u201d she whispered against his lips.</p><p>\u201cFuck \u2018em,\u201d he grunted as his hands smoothed up her back, his heart glorying in her, in the many gifts she had given him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed then, joy spreading through her face. \u201cFuck me instead.Later.Maybe on a beanbag again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou liked the beanbag,\u201d he murmured as his body tightened at the thought. Keeping his arm around her, he turned quickly to face the snickering group watching him. \u201cWell, Rey, it\u2019s been informative. But it\u2019s time for us to go. Get your lists together, visit when you can.\u201d He drew Charity to the tunnel as she laughed behind him. \u201cHawke, assign someone here and get your ass to the jeep or I\u2019m leaving without you.\u201d</p><p>It was time to go home. But damned if he knew where he was going to find another beanbag on such short notice. Maybe he could improvise, he thought. Surely there was something similar.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>They had locked her into a room by herself. A steel enclosed room. No doors. No windows. There was no view out, but the large two-way mirror provided a view in. What Hawke saw bit at his soul. The woman was slender, compact, staring silently from the fold-down cot she lay on. Her big blue eyes glittered with moisture but no tears had fallen in the hours she had been confined there. Resignation and acceptance lay over her like a cloak of pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had come to the small, dark room to watch her as soon as he returned to the compound. He needed to see her to reaffirm to himself that the decision he was faced with could be carried out. The Army hadn\u2019t been notified of her betrayal. That was Faith\u2019s job and after one long searching look when he had asked her to delay the message, she had nodded her agreement. Now he stood here, merely watching, unable to step past the door at the end of the long room and give her the go ahead to do so.</p><p>Was it a difference in how he was trained, he wondered? He hadn\u2019t experienced the unjust cruelties that many of the other Breeds had faced. He had been created, observed, tested and trained by professionals. By men and women who understood that the true answers came from caring treatment. It hadn\u2019t been enough for him. The assignments he had been sent on were bloody, vicious, and he had been expected to perform with a lack of mercy.</p><p>He had done as he was ordered but always with an eye on the best opportunity to escape. When the time came he had gladly taken it. But he didn\u2019t hold the bitter, painful memories of abuse such as Wolfe, Jacob and the other Breeds held. He understood it. He accepted it. He knew their lives hung in the balance of world opinion at the moment, and that tide could change any day. He was willing to give his life for those who had adopted him. He was willing to fight for their greater freedom. But he wasn\u2019t willing to kill his mate.</p> <p>Fuck! Whenhad he accepted her as his mate, he wondered. When had he finally given in to the subtle demand his body was making on his mind?</p><p>She brushed at her cheek, wiping away a tear that had finally fallen. Her people didn\u2019t know they had locked her away. When he called in the order he had been precise. Confine her secretly. Let no one know she had been taken or where she was being held.</p><p>He watched the door to her room open. She stood to attention slowly, warily, blinking as Wolfe and his mate, Hope, walked into the room. They were a powerful pair. Hope\u2019s tall, striking good looks with their slightly Asian cast made her appear cool, untouchable as she preceded Wolfe into the room. Wolfe was over six inches taller, heavily muscled, a powerful dangerous force to be reckoned with. His dark skin and long black hair appeared Native American. His blue eyes and cruel slash of a mouth made him look primordially dangerous.</p><p>\u201cJessica.\u201d Wolfe nodded to her as he and Hope walked to the table that sat several feet from the cot and sat down. \u201cSit down, please.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe pushed the extra chair from beneath the table with his foot as he watched her. Hawke saw the</p> <p>fear that flashed in her eyes. She paled for a moment, her lower lip trembling as she walked over and took her seat.</p><p>She stared forward, not defiantly, but rather somberly. She had accepted her fate.</p><p>\u201cJessica, would you like to tell us why you betrayed us?\u201d Hope\u2019s voice was gentle, soft. Hawke watched Jessica flinch from the caring tone. She glanced at Wolfe then. He was watching her intently, his expression cold, forbidding.</p><p>\u201cI have no excuse.\u201d Her voice was husky, rough from unshed tears. It caused pain to lash through his gut, taking his breath with the need to rush into the room to protect her, if nothing else, from her fears. Hawke was aware of Jacob walking up and standing beside him then.Moving silently to the glass, watching the proceedings broodingly.</p><p>\u201cYou sent a message that Charity had died.That you yourself had seen the body. You pulled Hope and Faith into the communications building with you using a very weak excuse.\u201d Wolfe\u2019s tone had her flinching with his anger. \u201cI do not believe you wanted to see our women harmed, Jessica. Yet still, you gave your father the coordinates to our personal homes and allowed that attack. Why?\u201d He bared his teeth, the sharp canines at the side of his mouth drawing her gaze. Hawke watched her pale further as she swallowed with a sick tightness. Her creamy skin was snow white now, her dark blue eyes nearly black with fear. Her gaze flickered to Hope.</p><p>\u201cI did all I could,\u201d she whispered faintly.\u201cTo minimize damage.\u201d</p> <p>Wolfe leaned forward slowly, dangerously. A smooth ripple of motion that had her jerking, a whimper of fear breaking from her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou signed the Code,\u201d he said harshly as she trembled before him. \u201cYou knew the consequences.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s hands tightened to fists as the need to protect her surged through his body.</p><p>\u201cI knew the consequences.\u201d For all its faintness, her voice was strong. \u201cI accept them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath,\u201d Wolfe bit out ferociously. \u201cDeath, Jessica.An execution. Were you prepared for that?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed briefly before she turned her head, staring at the leader of the Packs, regret and unbearable pain shining in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was prepared for that, Pack Leader,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI knew the consequences are death.\u201d</p><p>In that moment, Hawke felt his soul shatter.</p>  </body></html>"]
