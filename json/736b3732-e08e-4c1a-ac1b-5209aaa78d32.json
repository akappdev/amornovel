Fearless to a fault, they sped and swerved through crowded streets with unnatural calm. To save my sanity, I\u2019d learned to focus on the screen of my smartphone instead of the cars rushing by only inches away. Whenever I made the mistake of paying attention, I\u2019d find my right foot pushing hard into the floorboard, my body instinctively trying to hit the brakes.</p><p>But for once, I didn\u2019t need any distractions. I was sticky with sweat from an intense Krav Maga class, and my mind was spinning with thoughts of what the man I loved had done.</p><p>Gideon Cross. Just thinking of his name sent a heated flare of longing through my tightly strung body. From the moment I first saw him\u2014saw through his stunning and impossibly gorgeous exterior to the dark and dangerous man inside\u2014I\u2019d felt the pull that came from finding the other half of myself. I needed him like I needed my heart to beat, and he\u2019d put himself in great jeopardy, risking everything\u2014for me.</p> <p>The blare of a horn snapped me back to the present.</p><p>Through the windshield, I saw my roommate\u2019s million-dollar smile flashing at me from the billboard on the side of a bus. Cary Taylor\u2019s lips had a come-hither curve and his long, lean frame was blocking the intersection. The taxi driver was hitting his horn repeatedly, as if that would clear the way.</p><p>Not a chance. Cary wasn\u2019t moving and neither was I. He lounged on his side, bare-chested and barefooted, his jeans unbuttoned to show both the waistband of his underwear and the sleek lines of his ripped abs. His dark brown hair was sexily mussed and his emerald eyes were bright with mischief.</p><p>I was suddenly struck with the knowledge that I would have to keep a dreadful secret from my best friend.</p><p>Cary was my touchstone, my voice of reason, my favorite shoulder to lean on\u2014and a brother to me in every way that mattered. I hated the thought of having to hold back what Gideon had done for me.</p> <p>I wanted desperately to talk about it, to get help working it out in my head, but I\u2019d never be able to tell anyone. Even our therapist could be ethically and legally bound to break our confidence.</p><p>A burly, neon-vested traffic cop appeared and urged the bus into its lane with an authoritative white-gloved hand and a holler that meant business. He waved us through the intersection just before the light changed. I sat back, my arms around my waist, rocking.</p><p>The ride from Gideon\u2019s Fifth Avenue penthouse to my apartment on the Upper West Side was a short one, but somehow it felt like an eternity. The information that NYPD detective Shelley Graves had shared with me just a few hours earlier had changed my life.</p><p>It had also forced me to abandon the one person I needed to be with.</p><p>I\u2019d left Gideon alone because I couldn\u2019t trust Graves\u2019s motives. I couldn\u2019t take the chance that she\u2019d told me her suspicions just to see if I\u2019d run to him and prove that his breakup with me was a well-crafted lie.</p><p>God. The riot of emotions I felt had my heart racing. Gideon needed me now\u2014as much as, if not more than, I needed him\u2014yet I\u2019d walked away.</p> <p>The desolation in his eyes as the doors to his private elevator separated us had ripped me open inside.</p><p>Gideon.</p><p>The cab turned the corner and pulled up in front of my apartment building. The night doorman opened the car door before I could tell the driver to turn around and take me back, and the sticky August air rushed in to chase the air-conditioning away.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Miss Tramell.\u201d The doorman accompanied the greeting with a tap of his fingers to the brim of his hat and waited patiently while I swiped my debit card. When I\u2019d finished paying, I accepted his help out of the back of the cab and felt his gaze slide discreetly over my tearstained face.</p><p>Smiling as if everything were okay in my world, I rushed into the lobby and headed straight for the elevator, with a brief wave at the front desk staff.</p><p>\u201cEva!\u201d</p><p>Turning my head, I discovered a svelte brunette in a stylish skirt-and-blouse ensemble rising to her feet in the lobby seating area. Her dark hair fell in thick waves around her shoulders, and her smile graced full lips that were a glossy pink. I frowned, not recognizing her.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I replied, suddenly wary. There was an avid gleam in her dark eyes that got my back up. Despite how battered I felt and probably looked, I squared my shoulders and faced her directly.</p> <p>\u201cDeanna Johnson,\u201d she said, thrusting out a well-manicured hand. \u201cFreelance reporter.\u201d</p><p>I arched a brow. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so suspicious. I\u2019d just like to chat with you a few minutes. I\u2019ve got a story I\u2019m working on, and I could use your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense, but I can\u2019t think of anything I want to talk to a reporter about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even Gideon Cross?\u201d</p><p>The hairs on my nape prickled. \u201cEspecially not him.\u201d</p><p>As one of the twenty-five richest men in the world, with a New York real estate portfolio so extensive it boggled the mind, Gideon was always news. But it was also news that he\u2019d dumped me and gotten back together with his ex-fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>Deanna crossed her arms, a move that accentuated her cleavage, something I took note of only because I was eyeing her again with more care.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she coaxed. \u201cI can keep your name out of it, Eva. I won\u2019t use anything that identifies you. This is your chance to get a bit of your own back.\u201d</p><p>A rock settled in the bottom of my stomach. She was so exactly Gideon\u2019s type\u2014tall, slender, dark-haired, and golden-skinned. So very unlike me.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to go down this road?\u201d I asked quietly, intuitively certain she\u2019d fucked my man at some point in the past. \u201cHe isn\u2019t someone I\u2019d want to cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of him?\u201d she shot back. \u201cI\u2019m not. His money doesn\u2019t give him the right to do whatever the hell he wants.\u201d</p><p>I took a slow, deep breath and remembered when Dr. Terrence Lucas\u2014someone else who was at odds with Gideon\u2014had said something similar to me. Now that I knew what Gideon was capable of, how far he would go to protect me, I could still answer honestly and without reservation, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not afraid. But I\u2019ve learned to pick my battles. Moving on is the best revenge.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cNot all of us have rock stars waiting in the wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I sighed inwardly at her mention of my ex, Brett Kline, who was front man for a band on the rise and one of the sexiest men I\u2019d ever met. Like Gideon, he radiated sex appeal like a heat wave. Unlike Gideon, he wasn\u2019t the love of my life. I was never going to wade in that pool again.</p><p>\u201cListen\u201d\u2014Deanna pulled a business card out of a pocket of her skirt\u2014\u201cpretty soon you\u2019re going to figure out that Gideon Cross was using you to get Corinne Giroux jealous enough to come back to him. When you smell the coffee, call me. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>I accepted the card. \u201cWhy do you think I know anything worth sharing?\u201d</p><p>Her lush mouth thinned. \u201cBecause whatever Cross\u2019s motivation was for hooking up with you, you got to him. The iceman thawed a bit for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he did, but it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t know something, Eva. I can help you figure out what\u2019s newsworthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your angle?\u201d I\u2019d be damned if I would sit back while someone took aim at Gideon. If she was determined to be a threat to him, I was determined to head her off at the pass.</p><p>\u201cThat man has a dark side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d What had she seen of Gideon? What had he revealed in the course of their ... association? If they\u2019d had one.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever get to the point where thinking of Gideon being intimate with another woman didn\u2019t trigger ferocious jealousy.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go somewhere and talk?\u201d she cajoled.</p><p>I shot a glance at the staffer at the front desk, who made a good show of politely ignoring us. I was too emotionally raw to deal with Deanna, and was still reeling from the conversation with Detective Graves.</p><p>\u201cMaybe some other time,\u201d I said, leaving the option open because I intended to keep tabs on her.</p><p>As if he sensed my uneasiness, Chad, one of the night crew at the front desk, approached.</p><p>\u201cMs. Johnson was just leaving,\u201d I told him, consciously relaxing. If Detective Graves hadn\u2019t been able to pin anything on Gideon, a nosy freelance reporter wasn\u2019t going to do better.</p><p>Too bad I knew what kind of information could be leaked from the police, and how easily and often it was done. My father, Victor Reyes, was a cop, and I\u2019d heard plenty on that subject.</p><p>I turned toward the elevators. \u201cGood night, Deanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be around,\u201d she called after me.</p><p>I stepped into the elevator and hit the button for my floor. As the doors slid shut, I sagged into the handrail. I needed to warn Gideon, but there was no way for me to contact him that couldn\u2019t be traced.</p><p>The ache in my chest intensified. Our relationship was so fucked up. We couldn\u2019t even talk to each other.</p><p>I exited on my floor and let myself into my apartment, crossing the spacious living room to dump my purse on one of the kitchen bar stools. The view of Manhattan showcased through my living room\u2019s floor-to-ceiling windows failed to stir me. I was too agitated to care where I was. The only thing that mattered was that I wasn\u2019t with Gideon.</p><p>As I headed down the hallway toward my bedroom, the sound of muted music floated outward from Cary\u2019s. Did he have company over? If so, who was it? My best friend had decided to try juggling two relationships\u2014one with a woman who accepted him the way he was and one with a man who hated that Cary was involved with someone else.</p><p>I shed my clothes across the bathroom floor en route to the shower. While I lathered, it was impossible not to think of the times I\u2019d showered with Gideon, occasions when our lust for one another had fueled starkly erotic encounters. I missed him so much. I needed his touch, his desire, his love. My craving for those things was a gnawing hunger, making me restless and edgy. I had no idea how I was supposed to fall asleep when I didn\u2019t know when I\u2019d get a chance to talk to Gideon again. There was so much that had to be said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wrapping a towel around me, I left the bathroom\u2014</p><p>Gideon stood just inside my closed bedroom door. The sight of him spurred a reaction so abrupt it was like a physical blow. My breath caught and my heart lurched into an excited rhythm, my entire being responding to the sight of him with a potent rush of yearning. It felt like years since I\u2019d last been with him, instead of a mere hour.</p><p>I\u2019d given him a key, but he owned the building. Getting to me without leaving a trail that could be followed was possible with that advantage ... just as he\u2019d been able to get to Nathan.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous for you to be here,\u201d I pointed out. That didn\u2019t stop me from being thrilled that he was. My gaze drank him in, roaming avidly over his lean, broad-shouldered frame.</p><p>He wore black sweats and a well-loved Columbia sweatshirt, a combination that made him look like the twenty-eight-year-old man he was and not the billionaire mogul the rest of the world knew. A Yankees ball cap was pulled low over his brow, but the shadow cast by its brim did nothing to diminish the striking blue of his eyes. They stared at me fiercely, his sensual lips drawn into a grim line. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay away.\u201d</p><p>Gideon Cross was an impossibly gorgeous man, so beautiful that people stopped and stared when he walked by. I\u2019d once thought of him as a sex god, and his frequent\u2014and enthusiastic\u2014displays of prowess constantly proved me right, but I also knew he was all too human. Like me, he\u2019d been broken.</p><p>The odds were against our making it.</p><p>My chest expanded on a deep breath, my body responding to the proximity of his. Even though he stood several feet away, I could feel the heady attraction, the magnetic pull of being near the other half of my soul. It\u2019d been that way with us from the very first meeting, both of us inexorably drawn together. We\u2019d mistaken our ferocious mutual captivation for lust until we realized we couldn\u2019t breathe without each other.</p><p>I fought the urge to run into his arms, the place where I so desperately wanted to be. But he was too still, too tightly reined. I waited in exquisite anticipation for his cue.</p><p>God, I loved him so much.</p><p>His hands fisted at his sides. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>My core tightened in response to the roughness of his voice, the rasp of it warm and luxurious.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sound so happy about it,\u201d I teased breathlessly, trying to lighten his mood before he got me beneath him.</p><p>I loved him wild, and I loved him tender. I\u2019d take him any way I could get him, but it\u2019d been so long ... My skin was already tingling and tightening expectantly, craving the greedy reverence of his touch. I feared what would happen if he came at me full force when I was so starved for his body. We might tear each other apart.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s killing me,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cBeing without you. Missing you. I feel like my fucking sanity depends on you, Eva, and you want me to be happy about that?\u201d</p><p>My tongue darted out to wet my dry lips and he growled, sending a shiver through me. \u201cWell ... I\u2019m happy about it.\u201d</p><p>The tension in his posture visibly eased. He must\u2019ve been so worried about how I would react to what he\u2019d done for me. To be honest, I\u2019d been worried. Did my gratitude mean I was more twisted than I realized?</p><p>Then I remembered my stepbrother\u2019s hands all over me ... his weight pressing me into the mattress ... the tearing pain between my legs as he rammed into me over and over ...</p><p>I trembled with renewed fury. If being glad the fucker was dead made me twisted, so be it.</p><p>Gideon took a deep breath. His hand reached up to his chest and rubbed at the area over his heart as if it hurt him.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I told him, my eyes stinging with fresh tears. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d He reached me with quick strides, dropping his keys on the floor and shoving both hands into my damp hair. He was shaking, and I cried, overwhelmed by the knowledge of how much he needed me.</p> <p>Tilting my head to the angle he wanted, Gideon took my mouth with searing possession, tasting me with slow, deep licks. His passion and hunger exploded across my senses, and I whimpered, my hands tangling in his sweatshirt. His answering groan vibrated through me, tightening my nipples and sending goose bumps racing across my skin.</p><p>I melted into him, my hands pushing the cap from his head so that my fingers could sink into the silky black mane of his hair. I fell into the kiss, swept away by the lush carnality of it. A sob escaped me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he breathed, pulling back to cradle my jaw. He looked into my eyes. \u201cIt shreds me when you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much.\u201d I trembled.</p><p>His beautiful eyes looked as weary as mine. He nodded grimly. \u201cWhat I did\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that. How I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the tip of his nose against me, his hands sliding reverently along my bare arms\u2014hands with proverbial blood on them, which only made me love his touch all the more.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>His eyes closed. \u201cGod, when you left tonight ... I didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d come back ... if I\u2019d lost you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you, too, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t apologize. I\u2019d do it again.\u201d His grip tightened on me. \u201cThe options were restraining orders, increased security, vigilance ... for the rest of your life. There was no guarantee you\u2019d be safe unless Nathan was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cut me off. Shut me out. You and me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d His fingertips pressed against my parted lips. \u201cIt\u2019s over, Eva. Don\u2019t argue about something that\u2019s too late to change.\u201d</p><p>I brushed his hand away. \u201cIs it over? Can we be together now, or are we still hiding our relationship from the police? Are we even in a relationship?\u201d</p><p>Gideon held my gaze, hiding nothing, letting me see his pain and fear. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here to ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s up to me, I\u2019ll never let you go,\u201d I said vehemently. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s hands slid down my throat to my shoulders, blazing a hot trail across my skin. \u201cI need that to be true,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d run ... that you\u2019d be afraid. Of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon, no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I caught the waistband of his sweats and tugged, even though I couldn\u2019t budge him. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>And physically, I had no doubts; he\u2019d always been careful with me, always cautious. But emotionally, my love had been used against me with meticulous precision. I was struggling with reconciling the absolute trust I had in Gideon\u2019s awareness of my needs and the wariness that came from a shattered heart still healing.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d He searched my face, as attuned as always to what wasn\u2019t said. \u201cLetting you go would kill me, but I wouldn\u2019t hurt you to keep you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled audibly. \u201cMy lawyers will be talking to the police tomorrow, to get a feel for where things stand.\u201d</p><p>Tilting my head back, I pressed my lips gently to his. We were colluding to hide a crime, and I\u2019d be lying if I said that didn\u2019t seriously bother me\u2014I was the daughter of a police officer, after all\u2014but the alternative was too awful to consider.</p><p>\u201cI have to know that you can live with what I\u2019ve done,\u201d he said softly, wrapping my hair around his finger.</p><p>\u201cI think so. Can you?\u201d</p><p>His mouth found mine again. \u201cI can survive anything if I have you.\u201d</p><p>I reached under his sweatshirt, seeking and finding his warm, golden skin. His muscles were hard and ridged beneath my palms, his body a seductive and virile work of art. I licked his lips, my teeth catching the full curve along the bottom and biting gently. Gideon groaned. The sound of his pleasure slid over me like a caress.</p><p>\u201cTouch me.\u201d The words were an order, but his tone was a plea.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Reaching behind him, he grabbed my wrist and pulled my hand around. He thrust his cock shamelessly into my palm, grinding. My fingers curled around the thick, heavy length, my pulse quickening at the realization that he was commando beneath his sweats.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d I breathed. \u201cYou make me so hot.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes were fierce on my face; his cheeks flushed and his sculpted lips parted. He never tried to hide the effect I had on him, never pretended that he had any more control over his response to me than I had to him. It made his dominance in the bedroom all the more exciting, knowing that he was similarly as helpless to the attraction between us.</p><p>My chest tightened. I still couldn\u2019t believe that he was mine, that I got to see him this way, so open and hungry and sexy as hell ...</p><p>Gideon tugged my towel open. He inhaled sharply when it hit the floor and I stood before him completely naked. \u201cAh, Eva.\u201d</p><p>His voice throbbed with emotion, making my eyes sting. He yanked his shirt up and over his head, tossing it aside. Then he reached for me, stepping carefully into me, prolonging the moment when our bare skin would touch.</p><p>He gripped my hips, his fingers flexing restlessly, his breathing quick and harsh. The tips of my breasts touched him first, sending a sudden rush of sensation through my body. I gasped. He crushed me to him with a growl, lifting my feet from the floor and carrying me backward toward the bed.</p><p>2</p><p>MY THIGHS HIT the mattress and I landed on my butt, falling to my back with Gideon leaning over me. He hitched me up with an arm banded around my back, centering me on the bed before he settled atop me. His mouth was on my breast before I knew it, his lips soft and warm, the suction fast and greedy. He plumped the heavy weight in his hand, kneading possessively.</p><p>\u201cChrist, I\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he groaned. His skin was hot against my cool flesh, his weight so welcome after the long nights without him.</p><p>I hooked my legs around his calves and shoved my hands beneath his waistband to grip his taut, hard ass. I tugged him into me, arching my hips to feel his cock through the cotton that separated us. Wanting him inside me, so that I\u2019d know for certain he was mine again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSay it,\u201d I coaxed, needing the words he swore were inadequate.</p><p>He pushed up and looked down at me, gently brushing my hair back from my forehead. He swallowed hard.</p><p>Rearing, I caught his beautifully etched mouth in a kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll say it first: I love you.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and quivered. Wrapping his arms around me, Gideon squeezed so tight I almost couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cToo much.\u201d</p><p>His fervent declaration reverberated through me. I buried my face in his shoulder and cried.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d His fist clenched in my hair.</p><p>Lifting my head, I took his mouth, our kiss flavored with the salt of my tears. My lips moved desperately over his, as if he\u2019d be gone at any second and I had no time to get my fill of him.</p><p>\u201cEva. Let me ...\u201d He cupped my face, licking deep into my mouth. \u201cLet me love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I whispered, my fingers linking behind his neck to capture him. His erection lay hot and heavy against the lips of my sex, the weight of him the perfect pressure on my throbbing clit. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His hand cupped my buttock, lifting me into a deft roll of his hips. I gasped as the pleasure radiated through me, my nipples beading hard and tight against his chest. The light dusting of crisp hair was an unbearable stimulation. My core ached, begging for the hard-driving thrust of his cock.</p><p>My nails raked his back from shoulder to hips. He arched into the rough caress with a low growl, his head thrown back in deliciously erotic abandon.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d he ordered gruffly, his face flushed and lips parted.</p><p>Surging upward, I sank my teeth into his pectoral, just over his heart. Gideon hissed, quivering, and took it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t contain the ferocious swell of emotion that needed release\u2014the love and need, the anger and fear. And the pain. God, the pain. I still felt it keenly. I wanted to tear into him. To punish as well as pleasure. To make him experience some small measure of what I had when he\u2019d pushed me away.</p><p>My tongue stroked over the slight indentations left by my teeth and his hips rocked into me, his cock sliding through the parted lips of my sex.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he whispered darkly. Leaning on one arm, the biceps thick and beautifully defined, he squeezed my breast in his other hand. His head lowered and his lips surrounded the taut point of my nipple. His mouth was scorching hot, his tongue a rough velvet lash against my tender flesh. When his teeth bit into the furled tip, I cried out, my body jerking as sharp need arrowed to my core.</p><p>I clutched at his hair, too impassioned to be gentle. My legs wrapped around him, tightening, echoing my need to claim him. Possess him. Make him mine again.</p><p>\u201cGideon,\u201d I moaned. My temples were wet from the trails of my tears, my throat tight and hurting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, angel,\u201d he breathed, nibbling across my cleavage to my other breast. His diabolical fingers tugged at the wet nipple he\u2019d left behind, pinching it gently until I pushed up and into his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t fight me. Let me love you.\u201d</p><p>I realized then that I was pulling at his hair, trying to urge him away even as I fought to get closer. Gideon had me under siege, seducing me with his stunning male perfection and intimate expertise with my body. And I was surrendering. My breasts were heavy, my sex wet and swollen. My hands roamed restlessly as my legs caged him.</p> <p>Still, he slipped farther away from me, his mouth whispering temptation across my stomach. Missed you so much ... need you ... have to have you ... I felt a hot wetness slide over my skin and looked down to see that he was crying, too, his gorgeous face ravaged by the same surfeit of emotion flooding me.</p><p>With shaking fingers, I touched his cheek, trying to smooth away the wetness that only returned the instant it was wiped away. He nuzzled into my touch with a soft, plaintive moan, and I couldn\u2019t bear it. His pain was harder for me to deal with than my own.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d He slid back onto his knees and rose, his thighs spread between mine, his cock thick and hard and bobbing under its weight.</p><p>Everything in me tightened with ravenous greed. His big body was carved with rock-hard slabs of tautly defined muscle, his tanned skin sheened with perspiration. He was so powerfully elegant, except for his penis, which was bluntly primal with its thick coursing veins and wide root. His sac, too, hung large and heavy. He would make a statue as beautiful as Michelangelo\u2019s David, but with a flagrantly erotic edge.</p><p>Honestly, Gideon Cross had been designed to fuck a woman right out of her mind.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d I said harshly, pushing up and scrambling gracelessly into him, pressing my torso tightly into his. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d He took my mouth in a rough, lust-fueled kiss. Lifting me, he moved, turning us so that his back was to the headboard and I was spread over him. Our flesh slid against each other, slickened by sweat.</p><p>His hands were everywhere, his muscled body straining upward as mine had done. I cupped his face, licking fast into his mouth, trying to satisfy my thirst for him.</p><p>He reached between my legs, his fingers delving reverently into my cleft. The roughened pads stroked over my clit and skirted the trembling opening to my sex. With my lips pressed to his, I moaned, my hips circling. He fingered me leisurely, building my need, his kiss gentling into a slow, deep fucking of my mouth.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe for the pleasure, my entire body quivering as he cupped me in his hand and his long middle finger slid lazily into me. His palm rubbed against my clit, his fingertip stroking over delicate tissues. His other hand gripped my hip, holding me in place, restraining me.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s control seemed absolute, his seduction wickedly precise, but he was trembling harder than I was and his chest was heaving more forcefully. The sounds spilling from him were tinged with remorse and entreaty.</p><p>Pulling back, I reached for his cock with both hands, gripping him firmly. I knew his body well, too, knew what he needed and desired. I pumped him from root to tip, drawing a thick bead of pre-ejaculate to the wide crest. He pushed back against the headboard with a groan, his finger curving inside me. I watched, riveted, as the thick drop rolled to one side of his glans, then slid down the length of him to pool at the top of my fist.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he panted. \u201cToo close.\u201d</p><p>I stroked him again, my mouth watering as a gush of pre-cum streamed out of him. I was wildly aroused by his pleasure and the knowledge that I had such a profound effect on such a blatantly sexual creature.</p><p>As he cursed, his fingers left me. He grabbed my hips, dislodging my grip on him. He yanked me forward, then down, his hips bucking upward, his raging cock driving into me.</p><p>I cried out and gripped his shoulders, my sex clenching against the thick penetration.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d His jaw and neck taut with strain, he started coming, spurting hot and hard inside me.</p><p>The gush of lubrication opened me, my sex sliding down his pulsing erection until he filled me too full. My nails dug into his unyielding muscles, my mouth opened to draw in desperate breaths of air.</p><p>\u201cTake it,\u201d he bit out, angling my descent to gain that last little part of me that let him to sink in to the root. \u201cTake me.\u201d</p><p>I moaned, welcoming the familiar soreness of having him so deep. The orgasm took me by surprise, my back bowing as the heated pleasure tore through me.</p><p>Instinct took over, my hips moving of their own volition, my thighs clenching and releasing as I focused only on the moment, the reclaiming of my man. My heart.</p><p>Gideon yielded to my demands.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, angel,\u201d he encouraged hoarsely, his erection still as hard as if he hadn\u2019t just had a teeth-grinding climax.</p><p>His arms fell to his sides. His hands fisted in the comforter. His biceps clenched and flexed with his movements. His abs tightened every time I took him to the hilt, the rigid lacing of muscles glistening with sweat. His body was a well-oiled machine and I was taking it to its limits.</p><p>He let me. Gave himself to me.</p><p>Undulating my hips, I took my pleasure, moaning his name. My core clenched rhythmically, another orgasm rushing up too quickly. I faltered, my senses overwhelmed.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I gasped. \u201cGideon, please.\u201d</p><p>He caught me by the nape and waist, and slid down until we were flat on the bed. Pinning me tightly, he held me immobile, thrusting upward ... over and over ... shafting my sex with fast, powerful lunges. The friction of his thick penis rubbing and surging was too much. I jolted violently and came again, my fingers clawing into his sides.</p><p>Shuddering, Gideon followed me over, his arms tightening until I could barely breathe. His harsh exhalations were the air that filled my burning lungs. I was utterly possessed, completely defenseless.</p><p>\u201cGod, Eva.\u201d He buried his face in my throat. \u201cNeed you. I need you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d I held him close. Still afraid to let go.</p><p>BLINKING up at the ceiling, I realized I\u2019d fallen asleep. Then the panic hit, the horrible inevitability of waking from a blissful dream into a nightmare reality. I surged up, gulping air into a chest that was too tight.</p><p>Gideon.</p><p>I nearly sobbed when I found him sprawled next to me, his lips barely parted with his deep, even breathing. The lover my heart had broken for, returned to me.</p><p>God ...</p><p>Sinking back against the headboard, I forced myself to relax, to savor the rare pleasure of watching him sleep. His face was transformed when he was unguarded, reminding me of how young he really was. That was easy to forget when he was awake and radiating the powerful force of will that had literally knocked me on my ass when I\u2019d first met him.</p><p>With reverent fingers, I brushed the inky strands of hair away from his cheek, noting the new lines around his eyes and mouth. I\u2019d also noted that he\u2019d grown leaner. Our separation had taken a toll on him, but he\u2019d hidden it so well. Or maybe I viewed him as flawless and inviolate.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been able to hide my devastation at all. I\u2019d believed we were over and it showed to everyone who\u2019d looked at me, which Gideon had counted on all along. Plausible deniability, he\u2019d called it. I called it hell, and until we could stop pretending we\u2019d broken up, I\u2019d still be living in it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shifting carefully, I propped my head on my hand and studied the decadent man who graced my bed. His arms were wrapped around his pillow, showing off chiseled biceps and a muscular back adorned with scratches and crescent marks from my nails. I\u2019d gripped his ass, too, insanely turned on by the feel of it clenching and releasing as he fucked me tirelessly, stroking his long, thick cock deep inside me.</p><p>Again and again ...</p><p>My legs shifted restlessly, my body stirring with renewed hunger. For all his polished urbanity, Gideon was an untamed animal behind closed doors, a lover who bared me to the soul every time he made love to me. I had no defenses against him when he was touching me, helpless to resist the drugging pleasure of spreading my thighs for such a virile, passionate male\u2014</p><p>His eyes opened, stunning me with those vivid blue irises. He gave me a lazily seductive once-over that made my heart skip a beat. \u201cHmm ... You\u2019re wearing the fuck-me look,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cAnd that would be because you\u2019re so extremely fuckable,\u201d I shot back. \u201cWaking up to you is like ... presents on Christmas morning.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved. \u201cFor your convenience, I\u2019m already unwrapped. Batteries not required.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightened with terrible yearning. I loved him too much. I was constantly worried that I wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on to him. He was lightning in a bottle, a dream I tried to hold in my hands.</p><p>I let out a shaky breath. \u201cYou\u2019re a delicious extravagance for a woman, you know. A luscious, mouthwatering\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d He rolled over and dragged me under him before I knew his intent. \u201cI\u2019m filthy rich, but you just want me for my body.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, admiring the way his dark hair framed that extraordinary face. \u201cI want the heart inside the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have it.\u201d His arms tucked against my sides and his legs tangled with mine, the coarse hair on his calves stimulating my hypersensitive skin.</p><p>I was restrained. Possessed. His warm, hard body felt so good against mine. I sighed, feeling some of the fearful hesitation easing.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have fallen asleep,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>I stroked his hair, knowing he was right, that his nightmares and atypical sexual parasomnia made sleeping with him dangerous. He sometimes lashed out in his sleep, and if I was too close, I took the brunt of the simmering rage inside him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you did, though.\u201d</p><p>He caught my wrist and pulled my fingers to his mouth for a kiss. \u201cWe need time together when we aren\u2019t looking over our shoulders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. I almost forgot. Deanna Johnson was here tonight.\u201d The moment the words left my mouth I regretted the wall they put up between us.</p><p>Gideon blinked, and in that split second, the warmth in his eyes was gone. \u201cStay away from her. She\u2019s a reporter.\u201d</p><p>My arms slid around him. \u201cShe\u2019s going for blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll have to get in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is she so interested? She\u2019s a freelancer. No one assigned her to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop it, Eva.\u201d</p><p>His dismissal of the subject irked me. \u201cI know you fucked her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. And what you should be focused on is the fact that I\u2019m about to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Certainty settled in my gut. I released him, pulling away. \u201cYou lied.\u201d</p><p>He reared back as if I\u2019d slapped him. \u201cI have never lied to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you\u2019ve had more sex since you met me than you\u2019ve had in the last two years combined, but you told Dr. Petersen you\u2019ve been getting laid twice a week. Which is it?\u201d</p><p>Rolling to his back, he scowled at the ceiling. \u201cDo we have to do this now? Tonight?\u201d</p><p>His body language was so tight and defensive that my irritation with his evasiveness left me in a rush. I didn\u2019t want to fight with him, especially over the past. What mattered was now and the future. I had to trust that he\u2019d be faithful.</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t,\u201d I said softly, turning onto my side and reaching over to place my hand on his chest. Once the sun came up, we\u2019d be right back to pretending we weren\u2019t together. I had no idea how long we\u2019d have to keep up the charade or when I\u2019d get to be with him again. \u201cI just wanted to warn you that she\u2019s digging. Watch out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Petersen asked about sexual encounters, Eva,\u201d he said flatly, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t necessarily fucking, as far as I\u2019m concerned. I didn\u2019t think that distinction would be appreciated when answering the question. So let me be clear: I took women to the hotel, but I didn\u2019t always nail them. It was the exception when I did.\u201d</p><p>I thought of his fuck pad, a stocked-with-sexual-paraphernalia suite reserved in one of his many hospitality properties. He\u2019d given it up, thank God, but I\u2019d never forget it. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s better I don\u2019t hear any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou opened this door,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWe\u2019re walking through it.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were times when I couldn\u2019t stand to be alone with myself, but I didn\u2019t want to talk. I didn\u2019t want to even think, let alone feel anything. I needed the distraction of focusing on someone else, and using my dick was too much involvement. Can you understand that?\u201d</p><p>Sadly, I could, recalling times when I\u2019d dropped to my knees for a guy just to shut off my brain for a while. Encounters like those had never been about foreplay or sex.</p><p>\u201cSo is she one of the girls you screwed or not?\u201d I hated asking the question, but we had to get it out of the way.</p><p>He turned his head to look at me. \u201cOnce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust\u2019ve been some lay for her to be so bent out of shape over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Jesus.\u201d He scrubbed at his face. \u201cWhat the hell did she tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing personal. She did mention you having a \u2018dark side.\u2019 I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s a sexual reference, but I didn\u2019t ask her for details. She was playing it like we had an affinity because we\u2019d both been thrown over by you. The \u2018Dumped by Gideon Sisterhood.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He glanced at me with cold eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t be catty. It doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t trying to be a total bitch. Just a little one. I think I\u2019m entitled, all things considered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was I supposed to do, Eva? I didn\u2019t know you existed.\u201d Gideon\u2019s voice deepened, roughened. \u201cIf I\u2019d known you were out there, I would\u2019ve hunted you down. I wouldn\u2019t have waited a second to find you. But I didn\u2019t know, and I settled for less. So did you. We both wasted ourselves on the wrong people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we did. Dumbasses.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cAre you pissed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>He stared.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou were getting ready to fight, weren\u2019t you? We can play it that way if you want. Personally, I was hoping to get laid again.\u201d</p><p>Gideon slid over me. The look on his face, the melding of relief and gratitude, caused a sharp pain in my chest. I was reminded of how important it was for him to be trusted to share the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different,\u201d he said, touching my face.</p><p>Of course I was. The man I loved had killed for me. A lot of things became inconsequential after a sacrifice like that.</p><p>3</p><p>\u201cANGEL.\u201d</p><p>I smelled the coffee before I opened my eyes. \u201cGideon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not at least seven o\u2019clock, I\u2019m going to kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>His soft laugh made my toes curl. \u201cIt\u2019s early, but we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I opened one eye, then the other, so I could fully admire his three-piece suit. He looked so edible, I wanted to take it off him\u2014with my teeth.</p><p>He settled on the edge of my bed, the embodiment of temptation. \u201cI want to make sure we\u2019re solid before I leave.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and leaned against the headboard, making no effort to cover my breasts because we were going to end up talking about his ex-fianc\u00e9e. I played dirty when warranted. \u201cI\u2019ll need that coffee for this conversation.\u201d</p><p>Gideon handed me the mug, then stroked the pad of his thumb over my nipple. \u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he murmured. \u201cEvery inch of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to distract me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re distracting me. Very effectively.\u201d</p><p>Could he possibly be as infatuated with my looks and body as I was with his? The thought made me smile.</p><p>\u201cI missed your smile, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling.\u201d Every time I\u2019d seen him and he hadn\u2019t gifted me with his smile had been another cut to my heart until I\u2019d been bleeding nonstop. I couldn\u2019t even think of those occasions without feeling echoes of the pain. \u201cWhere did you hide the suit, ace? I know it wasn\u2019t in your pocket.\u201d</p><p>With a change of clothes, he\u2019d transformed himself into a powerful, successful businessman. The suit was bespoke, and his shirt and tie were immaculately matched. Even his cuff links gleamed with understated elegance. Still, the fall of dark hair that skimmed his collar warned others he was far from tamed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things we need to talk about.\u201d He straightened, but the warmth in his gaze remained. \u201cI took over the apartment next door. We\u2019ll have to make our reconciliation seem suitably gradual, so I\u2019ll keep up the appearance of using my penthouse for the most part, but I\u2019ll be spending as much time as possible as your new neighbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a suspect, Eva. I\u2019m not even a person of interest. My alibi is airtight, and I have no known motive. We\u2019re just showing the detectives some respect by not insulting their intelligence. We\u2019re making it easy for them to justify their conclusion that they\u2019re at a dead end.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I took a sip of coffee, giving me time to contemplate what he\u2019d said. The danger might not be immediate, but it was inherent in his guilt. I felt the pressure of it, no matter how he tried to reassure me.</p><p>But we were working our way back to each other, and I sensed his need for reassurance that we were going to recover from the strain and separation of the last few weeks.</p><p>I deliberately took a light tone when I replied, \u201cSo my former boyfriend will be on Fifth Avenue, but I\u2019ve got a hunky new neighbor to play with? This could be interesting.\u201d</p><p>One of his brows arched. \u201cYou want to role-play, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to keep you satisfied,\u201d I admitted with brutal honesty. \u201cI want to be everything you ever found in the other women you\u2019ve been with.\u201d Women he\u2019d taken to a fuck pad with toys.</p><p>His irises were cool blue fire, but his voice came smooth and even. \u201cI can\u2019t keep my hands off you. That should be enough to tell you I don\u2019t need more.\u201d</p><p>I watched him stand. He took my mug and set it on the nightstand, then caught the edge of the sheet and threw it deftly aside, exposing me completely.</p><p>\u201cScoot down,\u201d he ordered. \u201cSpread your legs.\u201d</p><p>My pulse quickened as I obeyed him, sliding to my back and allowing my thighs to fall open. There was an instinctive urge to cover myself\u2014the feeling of vulnerability under that piercing gaze was so intense\u2014but I resisted it. I\u2019d be dishonest if I didn\u2019t admit that it was wildly exciting to be totally naked while he was irresistibly clothed in one of his sexy-as-hell suits. It created an instantaneous power advantage for him that was a serious turn-on.</p><p>He stroked a finger through the lips of my sex, gliding teasingly over my clit. \u201cThis beautiful cunt is mine.\u201d</p><p>My belly quivered at the rasp in his voice.</p><p>Cupping me in his palm, he met my gaze. \u201cI\u2019m a very possessive man, Eva, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed by now.\u201d</p><p>I shivered as the tip of his finger circled the clenching opening. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRole-play, restraints, modes of transportation, and varied locations ... I look forward to exploring all of that with you.\u201d Eyes glittering, he slid a finger oh-so-slowly inside me. He made a low purring noise and caught his lower lip between his teeth, a purely erotic look that told me he felt his semen inside me.</p><p>Being penetrated and so gently pleasured left me unable to speak for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou like that,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cUmm.\u201d</p><p>His finger went deeper. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if plastic, glass, metal, or leather will make you come. B.O.B. and his friends will have to find other amusements.\u201d</p><p>Heat swept over my skin like fever. He understood.</p><p>Bending over me, Gideon placed one hand on the mattress and lowered his mouth to mine. His thumb pressed against my clit and rubbed expertly, massaging me inside and out. The pleasure of his touch spread, tightening my stomach and hardening my nipples. I clutched my bare breasts in my hands, squeezing as they swelled. His touch and desire were magic. How had I ever lived without him?</p><p>\u201cI ache for you,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cCrave you constantly. Snap your fingers and I\u2019m hard.\u201d He traced my lower lip with his tongue, inhaling my panting breaths. \u201cWhen I come, I come for you. Because of you and your mouth, hands, and insatiable little cunt. And it\u2019ll be that way for you in reverse. My tongue, my fingers, my cum inside you. Just you and me, Eva. Intimate and raw.\u201d</p><p>I had no doubt I was the focal point of his world when he was touching me, the only thing he saw or thought of. But we couldn\u2019t have that physical connection all the time. Somehow, I had to learn to believe in what I couldn\u2019t see between us.</p> <p>Shameless, my body writhed as I rode his plunging finger. He added another and I dug in my heels, arching up to meet his thrusts. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen your eyes turn soft and dreamy, I\u2019ll be the one who put that look on you, not a toy.\u201d He nibbled my jaw, then moved to my chest, nudging my hands aside with his lips. He claimed my nipple in a gentle bite, his mouth surrounding the tender peak and sucking softly. The ache he created was needle-sharp, my hunger spurred by the sense that there was a lingering gulf between us, something that hadn\u2019t yet been recognized and resolved.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d I gasped, needing his pleasure as much as my own.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he murmured, his mouth curving in a wicked smile against my skin.</p><p>I groaned in frustration. \u201cI want your cock inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you should.\u201d His tongue curled around my other nipple, flickering teasingly over it until it ached for suction. \u201cYour craving should be for me, angel, not an orgasm. For my body, my hands. Eventually, you won\u2019t be able to come without my skin touching yours.\u201d</p><p>I nodded frantically, my mouth too dry to speak. Need was coiled like a spring in my core, tightening with every circle of Gideon\u2019s thumb on my clit and every thrust of his fingers. I thought of B.O.B., my trusty Battery-Operated Boyfriend, and knew that if Gideon were to stop touching me now, nothing would get me off. My passion was for him, my desire inflamed by his desire for me.</p><p>My thighs quivered. \u201cI\u2019m g-going to come.\u201d</p><p>His mouth covered mine, his beautiful lips soft and coaxing. It was the love in his kiss that pushed me over. I cried out and shuddered through a quick, hard orgasm. My moan was long and broken, my body quivering violently. I pushed my hands under his jacket to grip his back, holding him close, my mouth claiming his until the wracking pleasure eased.</p><p>Licking the taste of me from his fingers, he murmured, \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>I consciously tried to slow my racing heart. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking. I just want to look at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t always. Sometimes you close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a talker in bed and your voice is so sexy.\u201d I swallowed hard with remembered pain. \u201cI love to hear you, Gideon. I need to know that I\u2019m making you feel as good as you make me feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck me off now,\u201d he whispered. \u201cMake me come for you.\u201d</p><p>I slid from the bed in a breathless rush, my hands reaching eagerly for his fly. He was hard and thick, his erection straining. Lifting his shirttail and pushing down his boxer briefs, I freed him. He fell heavily into my hands, the thick length already glistening at the tip. I licked the evidence of his excitement away, loving his control, the way he reined in his own hungers to satisfy mine.</p><p>My eyes were on him as my open mouth slid over the plush head. I watched his lips part on a sharply indrawn breath and his eyelids grow heavy, as if the pleasure were intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d His hooded gaze was hot on my face. \u201cAh ... Yes. Like that. Christ, I love your mouth.\u201d</p><p>His praise spurred me on. I took him as deep as I could. I loved doing this to him, loved the uniquely masculine taste and smell of him. I ran my lips down the length of him, suckling gently. Worshipfully. And I didn\u2019t feel wrong for adoring his virility\u2014I deserved it.</p><p>\u201cYou love this,\u201d he said gruffly, pushing his fingers into my hair to cup my head. \u201cAs much as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore. I want to do this for hours. Make you come over and over again.\u201d</p><p>A growl rumbled in his chest. \u201cI would. I can\u2019t get enough.\u201d</p><p>The tip of my tongue traced a pulsing vein up to the head, and then I took him in my mouth again, my neck arching back as I lowered to sit on my heels, my hands on my knees, offering myself to him.</p><p>Gideon looked down with eyes that glittered with lust and tenderness.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d He widened his stance. He slid his cock to the back of my throat, then pulled back out, coating my tongue with a trail of creamy pre-ejaculate. I swallowed, savoring the rich flavor of him.</p><p>He groaned, his hands cupping my jaw. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, angel. Suck me dry.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks hollowed as we found a rhythm, our rhythm, the syncing of our hearts and breaths and drive to pleasure. We had no problem overthinking our way into trouble, but our bodies never got it wrong. When we had our hands on each other, we both knew we were in the one place we needed to be, with the one person we needed to be with.</p><p>\u201cSo fucking good.\u201d His teeth ground audibly. \u201cAh, God, you\u2019re making me come.\u201d</p><p>His cock swelled in my mouth. His hand fisted in my hair, pulling, his body shuddering as he came hard.</p><p>Gideon cursed as I swallowed. He emptied himself in thick, hot bursts, flooding my mouth as if he hadn\u2019t come all night. By the time he finished, I was gasping and trembling. He pulled me to my feet and stumbled to the bed, settling heavily with me tucked into his side. His lungs labored, his hands rough as he pulled me closer.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t what I had in mind when I brought you coffee.\u201d He pressed a quick, rough kiss to my forehead. \u201cNot that I have any complaints.\u201d</p><p>I curled into him, beyond grateful to have him in my arms again. \u201cLet\u2019s play hooky and make up for lost time.\u201d</p><p>His laugh was husky from his orgasm. He held me for a while, his fingers sifting through my hair and gliding gently down my arm.</p><p>\u201cIt ripped me apart,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cSeeing how hurt and angry you were. Knowing I was causing you pain and that you were pulling away from me ... It was hell for us both, but I couldn\u2019t take the risk that you might become a suspect.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened. I hadn\u2019t thought of that possibility. It could be argued that I was Gideon\u2019s motive to kill. And it could be assumed that I was aware of the crime as well. My complete and utter ignorance hadn\u2019t been my only protection; he\u2019d made sure I had an alibi, too. Always protecting me\u2014whatever the cost.</p><p>He pulled back. \u201cI put a burner phone in your purse. It\u2019s preprogrammed with a number that will put you in touch with Angus. If you need me for anything, you can reach me that way.\u201d</p><p>My hands clenched into fists\u2014I had to reach my boyfriend through his chauffeur. \u201cI hate this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I. Clearing my way back to you is my number one priority.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it dangerous for Angus to be put in the middle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s former MI6. Clandestine phone calls are child\u2019s play for him.\u201d He paused, then said, \u201cFull disclosure, Eva: I can track you through the phone and I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I slid out of bed and stood. My thoughts bounced back and forth between MI6\u2014British secret service!\u2014to geotracking my cell, unsure of what to latch on to first. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p> <p>He stood, too. \u201cIf I can\u2019t be with you or talk to you, I at least need to know where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be this way, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>His face was composed. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I stalked to the closet to grab a robe. \u201cAnd you said warning someone about ridiculous behavior isn\u2019t an excuse for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut me some slack.\u201d</p> <p>Glaring at him, I shoved my hands into the sleeves of a red silk dressing gown and yanked the belt into a knot. \u201cNo. I think you\u2019re a control freak who likes having me followed.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms. \u201cI like keeping you alive.\u201d</p><p>I froze. After a moment, my brain rewound to look at the events of the last few weeks again\u2014with the addition of Nathan in the picture. Abruptly, everything made sense: the way Gideon had freaked out when I\u2019d tried to walk to work one morning, why Angus had shadowed me around the city every day, Gideon\u2019s fury when he commandeered the elevator I was riding ...</p><p>All those times I\u2019d almost hated him for being an asshole, he\u2019d been thinking about keeping me safe from Nathan.</p><p>My knees weakened, and I sank inelegantly to the floor.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d I\u2019d figured out a lot of it already during the time we\u2019d been apart. I\u2019d realized Gideon would never allow Nathan to simply stroll into his office with photos of me being abused and violated, then just stroll back out again. Brett Kline had only kissed me and Gideon had beaten him up. Nathan had raped me repeatedly for years and documented it with pictures and video. Gideon\u2019s reaction to meeting Nathan the first time had to have been violent.</p><p>Nathan must have visited the Crossfire Building the day I\u2019d found Gideon freshly showered with a crimson stain on the cuff of his shirt. What I\u2019d originally suspected was lipstick was Nathan\u2019s blood. The sofa and sofa pillows in Gideon\u2019s office had been skewed from a fight, not from a lunch quickie with Corinne.</p><p>Scowling fiercely, he crouched in front of me. \u201cDamn it. Do you think I want to micromanage you? There have been extenuating circumstances. Give me credit for trying to balance your independence with keeping you safe.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Hindsight didn\u2019t just make things crystal clear; it smacked me upside the head and knocked some sense into me. \u201cI get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you do. This\u201d\u2014he gestured impatiently at himself\u2014\u201cis just a fucking shell. You\u2019re what drives me, Eva. Can you understand that? You\u2019re my heart and soul. If something ever happened to you, it would kill me, too. Keeping you safe is goddamned self-preservation! Tolerate it for me, if you won\u2019t do it for yourself.\u201d</p><p>I surged into him, knocking him off-balance and onto his back. I kissed him hard, my heart pounding and blood roaring in my ears.</p><p>\u201cI hate to freak you out,\u201d I muttered between desperate kisses, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got it real bad for me.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, he squeezed me tightly. \u201cSo we\u2019re okay?\u201d</p> <p>I wrinkled my nose. \u201cMaybe not about the burner phone. The cell stalking is nuts. Seriously. Not cool at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s temporary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He put a hand over my mouth. \u201cI put directions on how to track my phone in your purse.\u201d</p><p>That news left me speechless.</p><p>Gideon smirked. \u201cNot such a bad idea on the flip side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d I slid off him and smacked his shoulder. \u201cWe are totally dysfunctional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer \u2018selectively deviant.\u2019 But we\u2019ll keep that to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>The warmth I\u2019d felt bled away, replaced by a flare of panic at the reminder that we were hiding our relationship. How long would it be before I saw him again? Days? I couldn\u2019t repeat the last few weeks of my life. Even thinking about going without him for any length of time made me feel sick.</p><p>I had to swallow past a painful lump to ask, \u201cWhen can we be together again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight. Eva.\u201d His beautiful eyes were haunted. \u201cI can\u2019t bear that look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be with me,\u201d I whispered, my eyes stinging all over again. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s fingertips glided softly down my cheek. \u201cYou were with me. The whole time. There wasn\u2019t a second that passed when you weren\u2019t on my mind. You own me, Eva. Wherever I am, whatever I\u2019m doing, I belong to you.\u201d</p><p>I leaned into his touch, letting it soak into me and chase the chill away. \u201cNo more Corinne. I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more,\u201d he agreed, startling me. \u201cI\u2019ve told her already. I\u2019d hoped we could be friends, but she wants what she and I used to have, and I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night that Nathan died ... she was your alibi.\u201d I couldn\u2019t say more. It hurt to think of how he might have filled the hours with her.</p><p>\u201cNo, the kitchen fire was my alibi. It took most of the night dealing with the FDNY, the insurance company, and making emergency arrangements for food service. Corinne stuck around for some of that, and when she left, I had plenty of staff on hand to vouch for my whereabouts.\u201d</p><p>The surge of relief I felt must have shown on my face, because Gideon\u2019s gaze softened and filled with the regret I\u2019d seen so many times now.</p><p>He stood and held his hand out to help me up. \u201cYour new neighbor would like to invite you over for a late dinner. Let\u2019s say eight o\u2019clock. You\u2019ll find the key\u2014and the key to the penthouse\u2014on your keychain.\u201d</p><p>I accepted his hand up and tried to lighten the mood with a teasing reply. \u201cHe\u2019s seriously hot. I wonder if he puts out on the first date?\u201d</p><p>His returning smile was so wicked it revved me up a notch. \u201cI think your odds of getting laid are pretty good.\u201d</p><p>I gave a dramatic sigh. \u201cHow romantic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you romance.\u201d Pulling me into him, Gideon dipped me with consummate ease.</p><p>Pressed against him from hip to ankle and bowed backward in a yielding curve, I felt my robe slide apart, exposing my breast. He deepened my arch, until my tender sex hugged his hard thigh and I couldn\u2019t help but be hyperaware of the power of his body as he supported my weight and his.</p><p>That quickly, he seduced me. Despite hours of pleasure and a very recent orgasm, I was primed for him in that moment, aroused by his skill and strength and self-assurance, his command of himself and of me.</p><p>I rode his leg with a slow slide, licking my lips. He growled and surrounded my nipple with the wet heat of his mouth, his tongue worrying the hardened point. Effortlessly he held me, aroused me, possessed me.</p><p>I closed my eyes and moaned my surrender.</p><p>BECAUSE of the heat and humidity, I chose a lightweight linen sheath dress and pulled my blond hair back in a ponytail. I accessorized with a small pair of gold hoop earrings and kept my makeup light.</p><p>Everything had changed. Gideon and I were back together. I was now living in a world without Nathan Barker in it. I was never going to turn a corner and run into him. He was never going to appear on my doorstep out of the blue. I no longer had to worry that Gideon would learn things about my past that would drive a wedge between us. He knew it all and wanted me anyway.</p><p>But the budding peace that came with that new reality was accompanied by fear for Gideon\u2014I needed to know that he was safe from prosecution. How could he definitively be proven innocent of a crime he actually did commit? Were we going to have to live with the perpetual fear that his actions would come back to haunt us? And how had this changed us? Because there was no way we could be what we\u2019d been before. Not after something so profound.</p><p>Leaving my room, I headed out for work, looking forward to the hours of distraction I\u2019d find at my job with Waters Field &amp; Leaman, one of the leading advertising firms in the country. When I went to grab my purse off the breakfast bar, I found Cary in the kitchen. He\u2019d clearly been as Busy with a capital B as I had.</p><p>He was leaning back into the counter, his hands gripping the edge as his boyfriend, Trey, cupped his face and kissed him passionately. Trey was fully dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, while Cary wore only gray sweats that hung low and sexy on his lean hips. They both had their eyes closed and were too lost in each other to realize they were no longer alone.</p><p>It was rude to look, but I couldn\u2019t help it. For one, I\u2019d always found it fascinating to watch two hot men make out. And two, I found Cary\u2019s pose very telling. While his handsome face was markedly vulnerable, the fact that he was holding on to the counter instead of the man he loved betrayed his lingering distance.</p><p>I picked up my purse and backed out as quietly as I could, tiptoeing from the apartment.</p><p>Because I didn\u2019t want to be totally melted by the time I got to work, I hailed a cab instead of walking. From the backseat, I watched Gideon\u2019s Crossfire Building come into view. The gleaming and distinctive sapphire spire was home to both Cross Industries and Waters Field &amp; Leaman.</p><p>My job as assistant to junior account manager Mark Garrity was a dream come true. While some\u2014namely my stepfather, megafinancier Richard Stanton\u2014couldn\u2019t understand why I\u2019d take an entry-level position considering my connections and assets, I was really proud to be working my way up. Mark was a great boss, both hands-on and hands-off, which meant I was learning a lot both by instruction and from doing it myself.</p><p>The cab turned a corner and pulled up behind a black Bentley SUV I knew all too well. My heart skipped a beat at the sight of it, knowing that Gideon was nearby.</p><p>I paid the cabdriver and climbed out of the cool interior into the steamy early-morning air. My eyes were riveted to the Bentley in the hope that I might catch a glimpse of Gideon. It was crazy how excited I was by the idea, especially after a night spent rolling around with him in all his naked glory. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Smiling wryly, I spun through the Crossfire\u2019s copper-framed revolving doors and entered the vast lobby. If a building could embody a man, the Crossfire did for Gideon. The marble floors and walls conveyed an aura of power and affluence, while the cobalt glass exterior was as striking as one of Gideon\u2019s suits. Altogether, the Crossfire was sleek and sexy, dark and dangerous\u2014just like the man who\u2019d created it. I loved working there.</p><p>I passed through the security turnstiles and took the elevator up to the twentieth floor. When I exited the car, I spotted Megumi\u2014the receptionist\u2014at her desk. She buzzed me through the glass security doors and stood as I approached.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she greeted me, looking chic in black slacks and a gold silk shell. Her dark sloe eyes sparkled with excitement, and her pretty mouth was stained a daring crimson. \u201cI wanted to ask you what you\u2019re doing on Saturday night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh ...\u201d I wanted to spend the time with Gideon, but there was no guarantee that would happen. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have plans yet. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of Michael\u2019s friends is getting married and they\u2019re having a bachelor party on Saturday. If I stay home, I\u2019ll go nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael\u2019s the blind date?\u201d I asked, knowing she\u2019d been seeing a guy her roommate had set her up with.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Megumi\u2019s face lit up for a second, then fell. \u201cI really like him and I think he likes me, too, but ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d I prompted.</p> <p>She lifted one shoulder in an awkward shrug and her gaze skittered away. \u201cHe\u2019s a commitment-phobe. I know he\u2019s into me, but he keeps saying it\u2019s not serious and we\u2019re just having fun. But we spend a lot of time together,\u201d she argued. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely rearranged his life to be with me more often. And not just physically.\u201d</p><p>My mouth twisted ruefully, knowing the type. Those kinds of relationships were tough to quit. The mixed signals kept the drama and adrenaline high, and the possibility of awesomeness if the guy would just accept the risk was hard to let go of. What girl didn\u2019t want to attain the unattainable?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game for Saturday,\u201d I said, wanting to be there for her. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrinking, dancing, getting wild.\u201d Megumi\u2019s grin came back. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll find you a hot rebound guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh ...\u201d Yikes. Awkward. \u201cI\u2019m doing pretty good, actually.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow at me. \u201cYou look tired.\u201d</p> <p>I spent the entire night getting nailed to my bed by Gideon Cross ... \u201cI had a tough Krav Maga class yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Never mind. In any case, it won\u2019t hurt to check out the scenery, right?\u201d</p><p>I shifted the straps of my bag on my shoulder. \u201cNo rebound guys,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She set her hands on her trim hips. \u201cI\u2019m just suggesting you be open to the possibility of meeting someone. I know Gideon Cross has got to be a hard act to follow, but trust me, moving on is the best revenge.\u201d</p><p>That made me smile. \u201cI\u2019ll keep an open mind,\u201d I compromised.</p><p>The phone on her desk rang and I waved good-bye as I headed down the hallway to my cubicle. I needed a little time to think about the logistics of playing the role of a single woman when I was very much taken. If I owned Gideon, he possessed me. I couldn\u2019t imagine belonging to anyone else.</p><p>I was just starting to play with how to bring up Saturday night to Gideon when Megumi called after me. I turned back around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a call on hold to send your way,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I hope it\u2019s personal, because holy hell is his voice smokin\u2019 hot. He sounds like S-E-X rolled in chocolate and covered in whipped cream.\u201d</p> <p>Nervous excitement raised the hairs on my nape. \u201cDid he give his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Brett Kline.\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>I REACHED MY desk and dropped into my chair. My palms were damp just thinking about talking to Brett, and I was steeling myself for the little charge I\u2019d get from hearing his voice and the guilt that would follow it. It wasn\u2019t that I wanted him back or wanted to be with him. It was just that we had history and a sexual attraction that was purely hormonal. I couldn\u2019t shut it off, but I had absolutely no desire to act on it.</p><p>I dropped my purse and the bag holding my walking shoes into a desk drawer, my eyes caressing the framed collage of photos of Gideon and me together. He\u2019d given it to me so he would always be on my mind\u2014as if he ever left it. I even dreamed of him.</p><p>My phone rang. The rerouted call from reception. Brett hadn\u2019t given up. Determined to keep it businesslike to remind him that I was at work and not available for inappropriately personal conversations, I answered, \u201cMark Garrity\u2019s office, Eva Tramell speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva. There you are. It\u2019s Brett.\u201d</p><p>My eyes closed as I absorbed that S-E-X-rolled-in-chocolate voice. It sounded even more decadently sexual than when he was singing, which had helped to propel his band, Six-Ninths, to the brink of stardom. He was signed with Vidal Records now, the music company run by Gideon\u2019s stepfather, Christopher Vidal Sr.\u2014a company Gideon inexplicably had majority control over.</p><p>Talk about a small world.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I greeted him. \u201cHow\u2019s the tour coming along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unreal. I\u2019m still trying to get a grip on it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve wanted this a long time and you deserve it. Enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He fell silent for a minute, and in that space of time, I pictured him in my mind. He\u2019d looked amazing when I saw him last, his hair spiked and tipped with platinum, his emerald eyes dark and hot from wanting me. He was tall and muscular without being too bulky, his body ripped from constant activity and the demands of being a rock star. His golden skin was sleeved in tattoos, and he had piercings in his nipples that I\u2019d learned to suck on when I wanted to feel his cock harden inside me ...</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t hold a candle to Gideon. I could admire Brett just like any other red-blooded woman, but Gideon was in a class by himself.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Brett said, \u201cI know you\u2019re working, so I don\u2019t want to hold you up. I\u2019m coming back to New York and I\u2019d like to see you.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my ankles under my desk. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to debut the music video for \u2018Golden\u2019 in Times Square,\u201d he went on. \u201cI want you there with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere with\u2014 Wow.\u201d I massaged my forehead. Momentarily thrown by his request, I chose to think about how my mom would bitch at me for rubbing at my face, which she swore caused wrinkles. \u201cI\u2019m really flattered you asked, but I have to know\u2014are you cool with just being friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re single, golden girl. Cross\u2019s loss is my gain.\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap. It\u2019d been almost three weeks since the first pictures of Gideon and Corinne\u2019s staged reunion had hit the gossip blogs. Apparently, everyone had decided it was time for me to move on with another guy. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. I\u2019m not ready for another relationship, Brett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you out on a date, not for a lifetime commitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrett, really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to be there, Eva.\u201d His voice lowered to the seductive timbre that had always made me drop my panties for him. \u201cIt\u2019s your song. I\u2019m not taking no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll hurt me bad if you don\u2019t go,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not bullshit. We\u2019ll go as friends, if that\u2019s what it takes, but I need you there.\u201d</p><p>I sighed heavily, my head bowing over my desk. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lead you on.\u201d Or piss Gideon off ...</p><p>\u201cI promise to consider it a favor from one friend to another.\u201d</p><p>As fucking if. I didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give up. He might never give up. \u201cOkay?\u201d he prodded.</p><p>A cup of coffee appeared at my elbow and I looked up to see Mark standing behind me. \u201cOkay,\u201d I agreed, mostly so I could get to work.</p><p>\u201cYesss.\u201d There was a note of triumph in his voice that sounded like it was accompanied by a fist pump. \u201cCould be either Thursday or Friday night; I\u2019m not sure yet. Give me your cell number, so I can text you when I know for sure.\u201d</p><p>I rattled the number off in a hurry. \u201cGot it? I\u2019ve got to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a great day at work,\u201d he said, making me feel bad for being rushed and unfriendly. He\u2019d always been a nice guy, and could have been a great friend, but I blew that chance when I kissed him.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Brett ... I\u2019m really happy for you. Bye.\u201d I returned the handset to its cradle and smiled at Mark. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d he asked, his brown eyes capped with a slight frown. He was dressed in a navy suit with a deep purple tie that did great things for his dark skin.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you for the coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Ready to get to work?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>IT didn\u2019t take long for me to realize something wasn\u2019t right with Mark. He was distracted and moody, which was very unlike him. We were working on a campaign for foreign-language-learning software, but he wasn\u2019t into it at all. I suggested we talk a bit about the whole-foods locavore campaign, but that didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I asked finally, sliding uncomfortably into friend territory, where we both made an effort not to go during work.</p><p>We put work aside every other week when he invited me along to lunch with his partner, Steven, but we were careful about maintaining our roles as boss and subordinate. I appreciated that a lot, considering Mark knew my stepfather was rich. I didn\u2019t want people giving me considerations I hadn\u2019t earned.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He glanced up at me, then ran a hand over his close-cut hair. \u201cSorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laid my tablet flat in my lap. \u201cSeems like you\u2019ve got something weighing on your mind.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, swiveling away and back again in his Aeron chair. \u201cSunday is my seventh anniversary with Steven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome.\u201d I smiled. Out of all the couples I\u2019d seen over the course of my life, Mark and Steven were the most stable and loving. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He managed a weak smile.</p><p>\u201cAre you going out? Do you have reservations or do you want me to handle that?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHaven\u2019t decided. I don\u2019t know what would be best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s brainstorm. I haven\u2019t had many anniversaries myself, I\u2019m sad to say, but my mom is spectacular with them. I\u2019ve picked up a thing or two.\u201d</p><p>After playing hostess to three wealthy husbands, Monica Tramell Barker Mitchell Stanton could\u2019ve been a professional event planner if she ever had to work for a living.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want something private,\u201d I suggested, \u201cwith just the two of you? Or a party with friends and family? Do you exchange gifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to get married!\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d I sat back in my chair. \u201cAs far as romance goes, I can\u2019t top that.\u201d</p><p>Mark barked out a humorless laugh and followed it with a miserable look at me. \u201cIt should be romantic. God knows when Steven asked me a few years ago, it was hearts and flowers to the max. You know drama is his middle name. He went all out.\u201d</p><p>Startled, I blinked at him. \u201cYou said no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said not yet. I was just starting to get my legs under me here at the agency, he was starting to get some really lucrative referrals, and we were picking up the pieces after a painful breakup. It seemed like the wrong time and I wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to marry for the right reasons.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one ever knows that for sure,\u201d I said softly, as much to myself as to him.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t want him to think I had doubts about us,\u201d Mark went on, as if I hadn\u2019t spoken, \u201cso I blamed my refusal on the institution of marriage, like a total ass.\u201d</p><p>I suppressed a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re not an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver the last couple years, he\u2019s made more than a few comments about how right I was to say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t say no. You said not yet, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Jesus, I don\u2019t know what I said.\u201d He leaned forward, resting his elbows on the desktop and dropping his face into his hands. His voice came low and muffled. \u201cI panicked. I was twenty-four. Maybe some people are up for that kind of commitment then, but I ... I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re twenty-eight and ready?\u201d The same age as Gideon. And thinking of that made me quiver, in part because I was the same age Mark had been when he\u2019d said not yet and I could relate.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lifting his head, Mark met my gaze. \u201cI\u2019m beyond ready. It\u2019s like some timer is counting down the minutes, and I\u2019m getting more impatient by the hour. But I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to say no. Maybe his time was four years ago and now he\u2019s over it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate to sound trite, but you won\u2019t know unless you ask.\u201d I offered him a reassuring smile. \u201cHe loves you. A lot. I think your odds of hearing yes are pretty darn good.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, revealing charmingly crooked teeth. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know about those reservations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d His expression sobered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bring this up when you\u2019re going through a tough breakup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Mark studied me a minute, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cYOU up for lunch?\u201d</p><p>I glanced up into Will Granger\u2019s earnest face. Will was the newest assistant at Waters Field &amp; Leaman and I\u2019d been helping him settle in. He wore sideburns and square-framed black glasses that gave him a slightly retro beatnik look, which worked for him. He was super laid-back and I liked him. \u201cSure. Whatcha feelin\u2019 like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPasta and bread. And cake. Maybe a baked potato.\u201d</p><p>My brows rose. \u201cAll right. But if I end up passed out and drooling on my desk from a carbohydrate coma, you\u2019d better get me out of trouble with Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a saint, Eva. Natalie\u2019s on some low-carb kick and I can\u2019t go another day without starch and sugar. I\u2019m wasting away. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>Will and his high school sweetheart, Natalie, seemed to have it together, from the stories he told. I never doubted he\u2019d walk on hot coals for her, and she seemed to look after him as well, although he grumbled good-naturedly about her fussing.</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d I said, suddenly feeling wistful. Being separated from Gideon was torture. Especially when surrounded by friends who were invested in relationships of their own.</p><p>Noon rolled around and while I waited for Will, I sent a quick text to Shawna\u2014Mark\u2019s almost-sister-in-law\u2014asking if she was available for a girls\u2019 night out on Saturday. I\u2019d just hit the send button when my desk phone rang.</p><p>I answered briskly, \u201cMark Garrity\u2019s office\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>My toes flexed at the sound of Gideon\u2019s low, raspy voice. \u201cHi, ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me we\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lower lip, my heart twisting in my chest. He had to be feeling the same unsettling rift between us that was troubling me. \u201cWe are. Don\u2019t you think so? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He paused. \u201cI just had to hear it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make it clear last night?\u201d When I was clawing at your back ... \u201cOr this morning?\u201d When I was on my knees ...</p><p>\u201cI needed to hear you say it when you\u2019re not looking at me.\u201d Gideon\u2019s voice caressed my senses. I turned hot with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered, feeling awkward. \u201cI know you get annoyed with women objectifying you. You shouldn\u2019t have to put up with it from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never complain about being what you want, Eva. Christ.\u201d His voice turned gruff. \u201cI\u2019m damned glad you like what you see, because God knows I fucking love looking at you.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes against a surge of longing. To know what I did now\u2014how important he thought I was to him\u2014made it so much harder to stay away. \u201cI miss you so much. And it\u2019s weird because everyone thinks we\u2019re broken up and I need to move on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The one word exploded across the line between us, sharp enough to make me jump. \u201cGoddamn it. Wait for me, Eva. I waited my whole life for you.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard, opening my eyes in time to see Will walking toward me. I lowered my voice. \u201cI\u2019d wait forever for you, as long as you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be forever. I\u2019m doing everything I can. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>In the background, another phone beeped for his attention. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at eight sharp,\u201d Gideon said briskly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The line clicked off in my ear, and I instantly felt lonely.</p><p>\u201cReady to chow down?\u201d Will asked, rubbing his hands together with anticipation. Megumi was having lunch with her commitment-phobe, so she\u2019d taken a rain check. It was Will, me, and all the pasta he could eat within an hour.</p><p>Thinking a carbohydrate-induced stupor might be just what I needed, I stood and said, \u201cHell yeah.\u201d</p><p>I picked up a zero-carb energy drink at a Duane Reade drugstore on the way back from lunch. By the time five o\u2019clock rolled around, I knew I was hitting a treadmill after work.</p><p>I had a membership at Equinox, but I really wanted to go to a CrossTrainer gym. I was feeling the gulf between Gideon and me keenly. Spending time in a place where we had good memories would help lessen it. Plus, I felt a sense of loyalty. Gideon was my man. I was going to do everything I could to spend the rest of my life with him. To me that meant supporting him in everything he did.</p><p>I walked back to my place, no longer caring if I wilted since I was going to get messy at the gym anyway. When the elevator in my apartment building let me out on my floor, I found my gaze drifting to the door next to mine. My fingers toyed with the key Gideon had given me. The idea of letting myself in to check out his apartment was intriguing. Would it be similar to his Fifth Avenue place? Or totally different?</p><p>Gideon\u2019s penthouse was stunning, with prewar architecture and old-world charm. It was a space that exuded affluence, while still remaining warm and inviting. I could as easily picture children in the space as I could foreign dignitaries.</p><p>What would his temporary digs be like? Scarce furniture, nonexistent art, and a bare kitchen? How settled in was he?</p><p>Pausing outside my apartment, I stared at his door and debated with myself. In the end, I resisted the temptation. I wanted him to walk me inside.</p><p>I stepped into my living room to the sound of female laughter. I wasn\u2019t surprised to find a long-legged blonde curled up next to Cary on my white couch, her hand in his lap, stroking him through his sweats. He was still shirtless, his arm tossed around Tatiana Cherlin\u2019s shoulders, his fingers idly stroking her biceps.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby girl,\u201d he greeted me with a grin. \u201cHow was work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame old. Hi, Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>Her reply was a chin jerk. She was striking, which was to be expected since she was a model. Looks aside, I hadn\u2019t really liked her all that much the first few times I met her, and I still didn\u2019t. But looking at Cary, I had to admit she might be good for him for now.</p><p>His bruises were gone, but he was still recovering from a brutal beating, an ambush by Nathan that had set in motion the events separating me from Gideon now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to change and head out to the gym,\u201d I said, moving toward the hallway.</p><p>Behind me, I heard Cary tell Tatiana, \u201cHang on a sec, I\u2019ve got to talk to my girl.\u201d</p><p>I entered my room and tossed my purse on my bed. I was digging in my dresser when Cary came to lounge in my doorway. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d I asked him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBetter.\u201d His green eyes glittered wickedly. \u201cHow \u2019bout you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his bare chest. \u201cIs that thanks to whoever was knocking boots with you last night?\u201d</p><p>Closing the drawer with my hip, I shot back, \u201cSeriously? I can\u2019t hear you in your room. How come you can hear me in mine?\u201d</p><p>He tapped his temple. \u201cSex radar. I has it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? That I don\u2019t have sex radar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like Cross blew your circuits during one of his sexathons. Still can\u2019t get over that man\u2019s stamina. Wish he\u2019d swing my way and wear me out.\u201d</p><p>I threw my sports bra at him.</p><p>He caught it deftly, laughing. \u201cSo? Who was it?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, not wanting to lie to the one person who always gave it to me straight, even when it hurt. But I had to. \u201cA guy who works in the Crossfire.\u201d</p><p>His smile fading, Cary stepped into the room and shut the door behind him. \u201cAnd you just up and decided to bring him home and fuck his brains out all night? I thought you went to your Krav Maga class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. He lives near here and I ran into him after class. One thing led to another ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be worried?\u201d he asked quietly, studying my face as he handed my sports bra back to me. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had a random screw in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d I forced myself to hold Cary\u2019s gaze, knowing that if I didn\u2019t, he\u2019d never believe me. \u201cI\u2019m ... seeing him. We\u2019re having dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I going to meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Not today, though. I\u2019m going to his place.\u201d</p><p>His lips pursed. \u201cYou\u2019re not telling me something. Spit it out.\u201d</p><p>I sidestepped the question. \u201cI saw you kissing Trey in the kitchen this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings going good with you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t complain.\u201d</p><p>Yikes. When Cary was on to something, he wouldn\u2019t let it go. I sidestepped again.</p> <p>\u201cI talked to Brett today,\u201d I said as casually as possible, trying not to make a big deal out of it. \u201cHe called me at work. And no, he wasn\u2019t the guy from last night.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cWhat\u2019d he want?\u201d</p><p>Kicking off my shoes, I headed to the bathroom to wash off what was left of my makeup. \u201cHe\u2019s coming back to New York for the debut of a music video for \u2018Golden.\u2019 He asked me to go with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva\u2014\u201d he began, in that low warning tone parents save for bratty children.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come with.\u201d</p><p>That set him back a bit. \u201cAs a chaperone? Don\u2019t you trust yourself?\u201d</p><p>I looked at his reflection in the mirror. \u201cI\u2019m not getting back together with him, Cary. Not that we were ever really together to begin with, so stop worrying about that. I want you there because I think you\u2019ll have fun and I don\u2019t want to lead Brett on. He agreed we\u2019d go as friends, but I think the concept needs to be drummed into him, just to be safe. And fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo is no, baby girl. Not that difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I scrubbed at one eye with a makeup remover towelette. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough I got guilted into going! You thought it\u2019d be funny for me to attend that concert without knowing who I\u2019d see there. I don\u2019t need shit from you.\u201d</p><p>Because I was sure to get enough of that from Gideon ...</p><p>Cary scowled. \u201cWhat the hell do you have to feel guilty for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrett got his ass kicked because of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooo, he got an ass-kicking because he kissed a beautiful girl without thinking about the consequences. He should\u2019ve expected you to be taken. And what burrowed up your anal cavity and rotted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a lecture about Brett, okay?\u201d What I needed was Cary\u2019s take on my relationship with Gideon and the concerns I had, but I couldn\u2019t reach out to my best friend. That made everything going wrong in my life even more unsettling. I felt totally alone and adrift. \u201cI\u2019ve told you, I\u2019m not taking that road again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>I told him what I could of the truth, because I knew he wouldn\u2019t judge. \u201cI\u2019m still in love with Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d he agreed simply. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sure your breakup is eating at him, too.\u201d</p><p>I hugged him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing you.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you should wait for him. Whatever Cross\u2019s deal is doesn\u2019t matter\u2014he snoozes, he loses. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready to jump into some other dude\u2019s bed. You can\u2019t do casual sex, Eva. It means something to you; that\u2019s why you get so fucked up when you just give it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt never works,\u201d I agreed, stepping away to finish cleaning my face. \u201cWill you go with me to the video premiere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to bring Trey or Tatiana?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he turned to the mirror and arranged his hair with practiced sweeps of his hands. \u201cThen it\u2019d be like a double date. Better if I\u2019m the third wheel. More impact.\u201d</p><p>I watched his reflection, my mouth curving in a soft smile. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He blew me a kiss. \u201cThen take care of yourself, baby girl. That\u2019s all I need.\u201d</p><p>MY favorite housewarming gift was Waterford martini glasses. To me, it was just the right blend of luxury, fun, and usefulness. I\u2019d given a set to a college friend who had no idea what Waterford crystal was but loved appletinis, and I\u2019d given a set to my mother, who didn\u2019t drink martinis but loved Waterford. It was a gift I\u2019d even feel comfortable giving to Gideon Cross, a man who had more money than was comprehensible.</p><p>But stemware wasn\u2019t what I clutched in my hands as I knocked on his door.</p><p>Nervous, I shifted on my feet and ran a hand down my hip to smooth my dress. I\u2019d dolled myself up after getting back from the gym, taking the time to really work my New Eva hairstyle and smoky eye shadow. My pale pink lipstick was smudgeproof and I wore a little black dress that was a halter with a low draping neckline and an even lower back.</p><p>The short dress showed a lot of leg, which I accentuated with peep-toe Jimmy Choos. I wore the diamond hoops I\u2019d chosen for our first date and the ring he\u2019d given me, a striking piece that had interlacing gold ropes hugged by diamond Xs\u2014the Xs representing Gideon holding on to the various threads of me.</p><p>The door opened and I swayed a little on my feet, struck by the gorgeous, sexy-as-sin man who greeted me. Gideon must have been feeling sentimental, too. He had on the same black sweater he\u2019d worn to the nightclub where we\u2019d first really hung out together. It looked amazing on him\u2014the perfect blend of casual and elegant sexiness. Paired with graphite gray dress slacks and bare feet, the effect on me was pure, white-hot desire.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou look amazing. Next time warn me before I open the door.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cHello, Dark and Dangerous.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>GIDEON\u2019S MOUTH CURVED in a devastating grin as he held his hand out to me. When my fingers touched his palm, he caught me and drew me inside, pulling me close to place his lips softly over mine. The door shut behind me and he reached past me to lock it, shutting the world out.</p><p>My hand clenched around a fistful of his sweater. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing my favorite sweater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Abruptly, he sank into a graceful crouch, taking my hand that he held and placing it on his shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s make you comfortable, angel. You won\u2019t need these heels until you\u2019re ready for me to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>My core clenched with anticipation. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m ready now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not. You\u2019ll know when the time comes.\u201d</p><p>As Gideon removed my shoes, I shifted my weight from one foot to the other. \u201cWill I? How?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at me with those intensely blue eyes. He was nearly on his knees, taking my shoes off, yet he was undeniably in command of himself and of me. \u201cI\u2019ll be pushing my cock inside you.\u201d</p><p>I shifted on my feet for a different reason. Yes, please ...</p><p>Straightening, he once again loomed over me. His fingertips drifted across my cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I mentally shook off the sexual spell he had me under. \u201cHousewarming gift.\u201d</p><p>I looked around. The space was a mirror image of my own. The apartment was lovely and comfortably inviting. I\u2019d partly expected a semi-lived-in space, mostly bare with only the essentials. Instead, it was very much a home. One that was lit only by candlelight, which cast a warm golden glow on furniture I recognized because it was Gideon\u2019s and mine.</p><p>Stunned, I barely noticed when he took the gift bag and my purse from my fingers. Barefoot, I skirted him, seeing my coffee and end tables placed around his sofa and side chairs; my entertainment center holding his knickknacks and framed photos of the two of us together; my drapes with his unlit floor and table lamps.</p><p>On the wall, where my flat-screen TV would be hanging, was a massive photo of me blowing him a kiss, a much larger version of the photo I\u2019d given him that he kept on his desk in his Crossfire office.</p><p>I turned slowly, trying to take it all in. He\u2019d shocked me like this once before, when he\u2019d re-created my bedroom in his penthouse, giving me a familiar place to run when things got too intense.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you move in here?\u201d I loved it. The mix of my modern traditional with his old-world elegance was oddly perfect. He\u2019d blended just the right pieces to create a space that was ... us.</p><p>\u201cThe week Cary was in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>That was when Gideon had begun pulling away from me, cutting me off. He\u2019d started hanging out with Corinne again and become difficult to reach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Getting this place set up must have kept him busy, too.</p><p>\u201cI needed to be near you,\u201d he said absently, looking into the bag. \u201cI had to be sure I could get to you quickly. Before Nathan could.\u201d</p><p>Shock rippled through me. At a time when I\u2019d felt Gideon drifting further and further away from me, he\u2019d been physically close. Watching over me. \u201cWhen I called you from the hospital\u201d\u2014I swallowed past a dry lump\u2014\u201cyou had someone with you ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRa\u00fal. He was coordinating the move-in. I had to get it done before you and Cary came home.\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cTowels, angel?\u201d he asked, with more than a hint of amusement.</p><p>He pulled the white hand towels embroidered with CROSSTRAINER out of the bag. I\u2019d picked them up at the gym. At the time, I\u2019d been envisioning him having a bare bones bachelor pad. Now, they were ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, still reeling from his disclosure about the apartment. \u201cI had a different idea of what this place looked like.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the towels away when I reached for them. \u201cYour gifts are always thoughtful. Tell me what you were thinking about when you bought these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about making you think about me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvery minute of every day,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cLet me clarify: Me\u2014all hot and sweaty and desperate for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm ... a fantasy I indulge in often.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly, the memory of Gideon pleasuring himself in my shower punched into my mind. There really were no words for how fucking amazing that sight was. \u201cDo you think about me when you get yourself off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t masturbate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Come on. Every guy does.\u201d</p> <p>Gideon caught my hand and laced our fingers, then drew me toward the kitchen from which the most heavenly smell was emanating. \u201cLet\u2019s talk over wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to ply me with alcohol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He released me and set the bag of towels on the counter. \u201cI know the way to your heart is with food.\u201d</p><p>I slid onto a bar stool just like the ones in my apartment, touched by his unique way of making me feel at home. \u201cThe way to my heart? Or into my pants?\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he poured a glass of red wine from a bottle he\u2019d previously opened to let breathe. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot wearing any panties, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful, Eva.\u201d Gideon shot me a stern look. \u201cOr you\u2019ll derail my attempt to seduce you properly before I ride you on every flat surface in this apartment.\u201d</p><p>My mouth went dry. The look in his eyes when he brought my glass over made me feel flushed and light-headed.</p> <p>\u201cBefore you,\u201d he murmured, with his lips to the edge of his glass, \u201cI stroked off every time I took a shower. It was as much a part of my ritual as washing my hair.\u201d</p><p>That I believed. Gideon was a very sexual man. When we were together, he\u2019d fuck me before bed, first thing in the morning, and sometimes fit in a quickie during the course of the day.</p><p>\u201cSince you, only once,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou were there with me.\u201d</p><p>I paused with my glass halfway to my mouth. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>I took a drink, gathering my thoughts. \u201cWhy did you stop? The last few weeks ... We went a long time without.\u201d</p><p>A ghost of a smile curved his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t have a drop to waste if I\u2019m going to keep up with you.\u201d</p><p>I set the wineglass down and pushed at his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re always making me sound like a nymphomaniac!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like sex, angel,\u201d he purred. \u201cNothing wrong with that. You\u2019re greedy and insatiable, and I love it. I love knowing that once I get inside you, you\u2019re going to suck me dry. Then you\u2019ll want to do it again.\u201d</p><p>I felt my face heat. \u201cFor your information, I didn\u2019t get off even once while we were apart. Never even got the urge because we weren\u2019t together.\u201d</p><p>He leaned into the counter, resting one elbow on the cool black granite. \u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like fucking you because you\u2019re you, not because I\u2019m a cock-hungry slut. If you don\u2019t like it, grow a gut or stop showering or something.\u201d I slid off the stool. \u201cOr just say no, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>I marched into the living room, trying to get away from the unsettled feeling I\u2019d had all day.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s arms came around me from behind, halting me midstep. \u201cStop,\u201d he said, with the familiar authoritative bite that always turned me on.</p><p>I tried to squirm free.</p><p>\u201cNow, Eva.\u201d</p><p>I gave up, my hands falling to my sides to clench my dress.</p><p>\u201cExplain what the fuck just happened,\u201d he said calmly.</p><p>My head bowed and I didn\u2019t say anything, because I didn\u2019t know what to say. A moment of silence later, he moved, swinging me up into the cradle of his arms and carrying me to the couch. He sat and arranged me on his lap. I snuggled into him.</p><p>His chin came to rest on the crown of my head. \u201cYou want to pick a fight, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cGood. Me neither.\u201d His hands stroked up and down my back. \u201cSo let\u2019s talk instead.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my nose into his throat. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He tilted his head back, giving me room to nestle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a sex addict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why it\u2019d be a problem if you were. God knows making love with you is my favorite thing to do. In fact, if you ever wanted me to take care of you more often, I\u2019d go so far as to schedule sex with you into my day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I nipped him with my teeth, and he laughed softly.</p><p>Gideon wrapped my hair around his fist and tugged my head back. His gaze on my face was soft and serious. \u201cYou\u2019re not upset about our incredible sex life. It\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is. I\u2019m just ... off.\u201d</p><p>Adjusting me in his lap, Gideon snuggled me closer, pulling me into his warmth. We fit so perfectly together, my curves aligning with his sculpted lines. \u201cDo you like the apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His voice was laced with satisfaction. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s an example\u2014taken to the extreme.\u201d</p><p>My heart rate jumped a little. \u201cOf what our place could look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start fresh, of course. Everything new.\u201d</p><p>I was moved by his pronouncement. Still, I had to say, \u201cIt was so risky doing this. Moving in here, getting in and out of the building. It makes me nervous just thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn paper, someone lives here. So of course, he\u2019d move furniture in, and come and go. He enters through the garage, just like all the other tenants with cars. When I\u2019m being him, I dress a little differently, take the stairs, and check the security feeds so I know if I\u2019m going to run into anyone before it happens.\u201d</p><p>The amount of planning involved was mindboggling to me, but then he\u2019d had practice getting to Nathan without a trace. \u201cAll this trouble and expense. For me. I can\u2019t\u2014 I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay you\u2019ll plan on moving in with me.\u201d</p><p>I savored the surge of pleasure his words brought me. \u201cDo you have a time frame in mind for this fresh start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as we can get away with it.\u201d His hand on my thigh squeezed gently.</p><p>I set my hand over his. There was so much standing in the way of us living together: the lingering trauma of our pasts; my dad, who disliked rich guys and thought Gideon was a cheater; and me, because I liked my apartment and believed that striking out in a new city meant doing as much as I could on my own.</p><p>I jumped to the biggest issue for me, though. \u201cWhat about Cary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe penthouse has an attached guest apartment.\u201d</p><p>Pulling back quickly, I stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019d do that for Cary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d do it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon, I ...\u201d My words trailed off because there were no words. I was awed. Something inside me shifted a little.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not upset about the apartment,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething else is on your mind.\u201d</p><p>I decided to save Brett for last. \u201cI\u2019ve got a girls\u2019 night out on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>He stilled. Maybe someone who didn\u2019t know him as well as I did wouldn\u2019t catch that subtle, sharp alertness, but I caught it. \u201cGirls\u2019 night doing what, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDancing. Drinking. The usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a manhunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I licked my dry lips, mesmerized by the change in him. He\u2019d gone from intimately playful to intensely focused. \u201cWe\u2019re all attached. At least I think we all are. I\u2019m not sure about Megumi\u2019s roommate, but Megumi\u2019s got a man and you know Shawna\u2019s got her chef.\u201d</p><p>He was suddenly all business when he said, \u201cI\u2019ll make the arrangements\u2014car, driver, and security. If you stick with a circuit of my clubs, your security will stay in the car. You want to branch out, he\u2019s going in with you.\u201d</p><p>Blinking in surprise, I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>From the kitchen, the oven timer began beeping.</p><p>Gideon went from sitting to standing, with me in his arms, in one powerfully graceful surge. My eyes widened. My blood hummed through my veins. I wrapped my arms around his neck and let him carry me to the kitchen. \u201cI love how strong you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re easy to impress.\u201d Settling me on a bar stool, he gave me a lingering kiss before heading to the oven.</p><p>\u201cYou cooked?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure why the thought surprised me, but it did.</p><p>\u201cNo. Arnoldo had ready-to-cook lasagna and a salad delivered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds awesome.\u201d I knew from having eaten in celebrity chef Arnoldo Ricci\u2019s restaurant that the food would be killer.</p><p>Grabbing my glass, I wasted the wonderful wine by gulping it down for courage, thinking it was time to tell him what he wouldn\u2019t want to hear. I took the plunge and said, \u201cBrett called me at work today.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a minute or two, I didn\u2019t think Gideon heard me. He slid on a pot holder, opened the oven, and pulled out the lasagna without looking my way. It wasn\u2019t until he set the pan on the stovetop and glanced at me that I knew for certain he hadn\u2019t missed a word.</p><p>He tossed the glove onto the counter, grabbed the wine bottle, and came directly to me. Calmly, he took my wineglass and refilled it before he spoke. \u201cI expect he wants to see you when he\u2019s in New York next week.\u201d</p><p>It took me the space of a breath to respond. \u201cYou knew he was coming back!\u201d I accused.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I knew.\u201d</p><p>Whether that was because Brett\u2019s band was signed to Vidal Records or because Gideon was keeping an eye on him, I didn\u2019t know. Both reasons were entirely plausible.</p><p>\u201cDid you agree to meet up?\u201d His voice was smooth and soft. Dangerously so.</p><p>Ignoring the fluttering of nerves in my belly, I held his gaze. \u201cYes, for the reveal of the new Six-Ninths music video. Cary\u2019s going with me.\u201d</p><p>Gideon nodded, leaving me anxious and clueless about his feelings.</p> <p>I slid off the stool and went to him. Wrapping me up in his arms, he rested his cheek against the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll back out,\u201d I offered quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to go anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Swaying from side to side, rocking me, he whispered, \u201cI broke your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I agreed to go!\u201d</p><p>His hands came up and pushed through my hair, combing it back from my forehead and cheeks with a gentleness that brought tears to my eyes. \u201cWe can\u2019t just forget the last few weeks, Eva. I cut you deep and you\u2019re still bleeding.\u201d</p><p>It struck me then that I hadn\u2019t been ready to pick up the pieces of our relationship as if nothing had gone wrong. A part of me was holding a grudge, and Gideon had picked up on it.</p> <p>I struggled out of his hold. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I have no right to leave you and hurt you\u2014for whatever reason\u2014then expect you to forget how that felt and forgive me overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed a man for me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe me anything,\u201d he snapped. \u201cMy love for you is not an obligation.\u201d</p><p>It still tore through me like a bullet every time he said he loved me, despite how often he proved it with his actions.</p><p>My voice was softer when I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d He kissed me with heartrending tenderness. \u201cLet\u2019s eat, before the food gets cold.\u201d</p><p>I changed into a Cross Industries T-shirt and a pair of Gideon\u2019s pajama bottoms that I rolled up at the ankles. We took candles over to the coffee table and ate cross-legged on the floor. Gideon kept my favorite sweater on but swapped his slacks for a pair of black lounging pants.</p> <p>Licking a dab of tomato sauce off my lip, I told him about the rest of my day. \u201cMark\u2019s gathering the nerve to ask his partner to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m remembering correctly, they\u2019ve been together awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince college.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s mouth curved. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s still a tough question to ask, even if the answer is a sure thing.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my plate. \u201cWas Corinne nervous when she asked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d He waited until the lengthy silence brought my head up. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>I searched his face. \u201cHow would you feel if you knew there was someone out there I\u2019d said yes to? Theoretically.\u201d</p><p>He shot me an irritated look. \u201cThat would be different because you wouldn\u2019t say yes unless the guy really meant something to you. What I felt was ... panic. The feeling didn\u2019t go away until she broke the engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you buy her a ring?\u201d The thought of him shopping for a ring for another woman hurt me. I looked down at my hand, at the ring he\u2019d bought for me.</p><p>\u201cNothing like that one,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>My hand fisted, guarding it.</p><p>Reaching over, Gideon set his right hand over mine. \u201cI bought Corinne\u2019s ring in the first store I went to. I had nothing in mind, so I picked one that looked like her mother\u2019s. Very different circumstances, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I hadn\u2019t designed the ring Gideon wore, but I\u2019d searched six shops before I found the right one. It was platinum studded with black diamonds, and it reminded me of my lover, with its cool masculine elegance and bold, dominant style.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, wincing. \u201cI\u2019m an ass.\u201d</p><p>He lifted my hand to his lips and kissed my knuckles. \u201cSo am I, on occasion.\u201d</p><p>That made me grin. \u201cI think Mark and Steven are perfect for each other, but Mark has this theory that men get the urge to marry, and then it goes away if it isn\u2019t acted on quickly enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think it\u2019d be more about the right partner than the right time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my fingers crossed for it to work out for them.\u201d I picked up my wine. \u201cWant to watch TV?\u201d</p><p>Gideon leaned his back against the front of the sofa. \u201cI just want to be with you, angel. I don\u2019t care what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>WE cleaned up the mess from dinner together. As I reached for the rinsed dish Gideon held out for me to put in the dishwasher, he faked me out. He grabbed my hand instead and deftly set the plate on the counter. Catching me around the waist, he spun us into a dance. From the living room, I caught the strains of something beautiful laced with a woman\u2019s pure, haunting voice.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d I asked, already breathless from the feel of Gideon\u2019s powerful body flexing against mine. The desire that always smoldered between us flared, making me feel vibrant and alive. Every nerve ending sensitized, preparing for his touch. Hunger coiled tight with heated anticipation.</p><p>\u201cNo clue.\u201d He swept me around the island and into the living room.</p><p>I surrendered to his masterful lead, loving that dancing was a passion we shared and awed by the obvious joy he felt in just being with me. That same pleasure effervesced within me, lightening my steps until it felt like we were gliding. As we approached the sound system, the music rose in volume. I heard the words dark and dangerous in the lyrics and stumbled in surprise.</p><p>\u201cToo much wine, angel?\u201d Gideon teased, pulling me closer.</p><p>But my attention was riveted to the music. The singer\u2019s pain. A tormented relationship she likened to loving a ghost. The words reminded me of the days when I believed I\u2019d lost Gideon forever, and my heart ached.</p><p>I looked up into his face. He was watching me with dark, glittering eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou looked so happy when you were dancing with your dad,\u201d he said, and I knew he wanted treasured memories like that between us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy now,\u201d I assured him, even as my eyes stung at the sight of his yearning, a longing I knew intimately. If souls could be mated with wishes, ours would be inextricably entwined.</p><p>Cupping his nape, I pulled his mouth down to mine. As our lips touched, his rhythm faltered. He stopped, hugging me so tightly my feet left the floor.</p><p>Unlike the heartbroken singer, I wasn\u2019t in love with a ghost. I was in love with a flesh-and-blood man, one who made mistakes but learned from them, a man who was trying hard to better himself for me, a man who wanted us to work as desperately as I did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never happier than when I\u2019m with you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cAh, Eva.\u201d</p><p>He took my breath away with his kiss.</p><p>\u201cIT was the kid,\u201d I said.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s fingertips drew circles around my navel. \u201cThat\u2019s twisted.\u201d</p><p>We were sprawled lengthwise on the couch, watching my favorite police procedural television show. He was spooned behind me, his chin on my shoulder and his legs tangled with mine.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way these things work,\u201d I told him. \u201cShock value and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was the grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I tilted my head to look back at him. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t think that\u2019s twisted?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and smacked a kiss on my cheek. \u201cWanna bet on who\u2019s right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t gamble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on.\u201d His hand splayed against my belly, anchoring me as he rose up on his elbow to look down at me.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I felt him against the curve of my buttocks, a solid, weighty length. He wasn\u2019t erect, but that didn\u2019t stop him from gaining my attention. Curious, I reached between us and cupped him in my hand.</p><p>He hardened instantly. One black brow arched. \u201cYou copping a feel, angel?\u201d</p><p>I squeezed him gently. \u201cNow I\u2019m hot and bothered, and wondering why my new neighbor isn\u2019t putting the moves on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t want to push you too far, too fast and scare you off.\u201d Gideon\u2019s eyes glittered in the light of the television.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled his nose against my temple. \u201cIf he has half a brain, he\u2019d know not to let you get away.\u201d</p><p>Oh ... \u201cMaybe I should make the first move,\u201d I whispered, wrapping my fingers around his wrist. \u201cBut what if he thinks I\u2019m too easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be too busy thinking he\u2019s damned lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then ...\u201d I wriggled around to face him. \u201cHowdy, neighbor.\u201d</p><p>He traced my eyebrow with the tip of his finger. \u201cHi. I really like the view around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hospitality isn\u2019t bad, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Plenty of towels?\u201d</p><p>I pushed at his shoulder. \u201cDo you want to suck face or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck face?\u201d His head fell back and he laughed, his chest vibrating against me. It was a lusty, full-bodied sound and my toes curled at hearing it. Gideon laughed so rarely.</p><p>My hands slid under his sweater and glided over warm skin. My lips moved over his jaw. \u201cIs that a no?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAngel, I\u2019ll suck on any part of your body I can get my mouth on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart here.\u201d I offered him my lips and he took them, sealing his mouth softly over mine. His tongue traced the seam, then dipped inside me, licking and teasing.</p><p>I burrowed into his body, moaning when he shifted to lie half over me. My hands slid up and down his back, my leg lifting to hook over his hip. I caught his lower lip between my teeth and stroked the curve with the tip of my tongue.</p><p>His groan was so erotic it made me wet.</p><p>My back arched as his hand crept beneath the hem of my T-shirt and captured my bare breast, rolling my nipple between his thumb and forefinger.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so soft,\u201d he murmured. He kissed his way to my temple, and then buried his face in my hair. \u201cI love touching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d I pushed beneath his waistband to grip his bare buttocks. The scent and heat of his skin intoxicated me, made me feel drunk with lust and longing. \u201cA dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my dream. Christ, you\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d His mouth covered mine and I fisted a hand in his hair, clutching him to me with my arms and legs wrapped around him.</p><p>My world narrowed to just him. The feel of him. The sounds he made.</p><p>\u201cI love how much you want me,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand being in this alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you, baby,\u201d I promised, my mouth moving feverishly beneath his. \u201cI am so with you.\u201d</p><p>Gideon possessed me with one hand at my nape and the other at my waist. Settling over me, he aligned his hardness to my softness, his cock to my sex, and rolled his hips. I gasped, my nails digging into the rock-hard cheeks of his ass.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I moaned shamelessly. \u201cYou feel so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d feel better inside you,\u201d he purred.</p><p>I bit his earlobe. \u201cAre you trying to talk me into going all the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go anywhere, angel.\u201d He sucked gently on my throat, making my sex clench hungrily. \u201cI can put it in right here. I promise I\u2019ll make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve changed my ways. I\u2019m not that kind of girl anymore.\u201d</p><p>His hand at my waist pushed my pants down. I gave a token wiggle and make a soft sound of protest. My skin tingled where he\u2019d touched me, my body awakening to his demands.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Brushing his mouth over mine, he whispered, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it once it\u2019s in you, I promise I\u2019ll pull out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas that line ever worked for anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not feeding you lines. I mean every word.\u201d</p><p>I gripped the steely curves of his butt and rocked up against him, knowing damn well he didn\u2019t need any lines. A crook of his finger was all it would take for him to get laid by anyone he wanted.</p> <p>Thankfully, he only wanted me.</p><p>Reveling in his playfulness, I teased, \u201cI bet you say that to all the girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a rep, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re the one wearing my ring.\u201d As he lifted his head, his fingertips brushed the hair from my temple. \u201cDay One of my life was the day I met you.\u201d</p><p>The words hit me like a blow. I swallowed hard and whispered, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s a winner. You can put it in.\u201d</p><p>The shadows left his face, chased away by his smile. \u201cGod, I\u2019m crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>I WOKE IN a cold sweat, my heart pounding violently. I lay in the master bed, panting, my mind clawing up from the depths of sleep.</p><p>\u201cGet off me!\u201d</p><p>Gideon. My God.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me!\u201d</p><p>Throwing off the covers, I scrambled out of bed and ran down the hallway to the guest room. I searched frantically for the switch on the wall, hitting it with the flat of my palm. Light exploded in the room, exposing Gideon writhing on the bed, his legs twisted in the bedding.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Ah, Christ ...\u201d His back arched up from the bed, his hands fisting in the fitted sheet. \u201cIt hurts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon!\u201d</p><p>He jerked violently. I raced to the bedside, my heart twisting to see him flushed and drenched with sweat. I placed my hand on his chest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me!\u201d he hissed, seizing my wrist and squeezing it so hard I cried out in pain. His eyes were open, but unfocused, still trapped in his nightmare.</p><p>\u201cGideon!\u201d I struggled to get away.</p><p>He jackknifed upward, his lungs heaving and his eyes wild. \u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>Releasing me as if I had burned him, he shoved his damp hair out of his face and lunged out of bed. \u201cJesus. Eva ... did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>I held my wrist with my other hand and shook my head.</p><p>\u201cI want to see,\u201d he said hoarsely, reaching for me with trembling hands.</p><p>I dropped my arms and stepped into him, hugging him as tightly as I could, my cheek pressed to his sweat-slick chest.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d He clung to me, shaking. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, baby. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me hold you,\u201d he whispered, sinking to the floor with me. \u201cDon\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d I promised, my lips whispering over his skin. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>I ran a bath and climbed into the triangular corner tub with him. Sitting behind him on the highest step, I washed his hair and ran soapy hands over his chest and back, washing the icy sweat of the nightmare away. The heat of the water stopped his quivering, but nothing so simple could remove the dark desolation in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever talked to anyone about your nightmares?\u201d I asked, squeezing warm water out of the sponge onto his shoulder.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d I said softly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m your girl.\u201d</p><p>He took a long time to speak. \u201cEva, when you have nightmares ... are they more like re-creations of actual events? Or does your mind switch them around? Change them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re mostly memories. True to life. Are yours not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. Sometimes they\u2019re different. Make-believe.\u201d</p><p>I absorbed that a minute, wishing I had the training and knowledge to be truly helpful. Instead, I could only love him and listen. I hoped that was enough, because his nightmares were ripping me apart as surely as they were him. \u201cAre they changed in a good way? Or bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fight back,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cAnd he still hurts you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he still wins, but at least I hold him off as long as I can.\u201d</p><p>I dipped the sponge again, squeezing water over him, trying to maintain a soothing rhythm. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t judge yourself. You were only a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo were you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes closed tightly against the knowledge that Gideon had seen the photos and videos Nathan had taken of me. \u201cNathan was a sadist. It\u2019s natural to struggle against physical pain, so I did. That\u2019s not bravery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it had hurt me more,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI hate that he made me enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t enjoy it. You felt pleasure and that\u2019s not the same thing. Gideon, our bodies react to things by instinct, even when we don\u2019t consciously want them to.\u201d I hugged him from behind, resting my chin on the top of his head. \u201cHe was your therapist\u2019s assistant, someone you\u2019re supposed to be able to trust. He had the training to fuck with your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen make me understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ... seduced me. And I let him. He couldn\u2019t make me want it, but he made sure I didn\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><p>Moving, I pressed my cheek to his temple. \u201cAre you worried you\u2019re bisexual? It won\u2019t freak me out if you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He turned his head and brushed his mouth across mine, his hands lifting out of the water to link our fingers together. \u201cI\u2019ve never been attracted to men. But the fact that you\u2019d accept me if I were ... Right now I love you so much it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d I kissed him sweetly, our lips parting and clinging. \u201cI just want you to be happy. Preferably with me. And I really want you to stop hurting yourself over what was done to you. You were raped. You were a victim and now you\u2019re a survivor. There\u2019s no shame in that.\u201d</p><p>He turned and pulled me deeper into the water.</p><p>I settled beside him, my hand on his thigh. \u201cCan we talk about something? Sexual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me once that you don\u2019t do anal play.\u201d I felt him tense. \u201cBut you\u2019ve ... we\u2019ve ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had my fingers and tongue inside you,\u201d he finished, studying me. He\u2019d altered with the change of subject, his hesitation replaced by calm authority. \u201cYou enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d I asked, before I lost the courage.</p><p>He breathed heavily, his cheekbones burnished by the heated water, his face exposed by his slicked-back hair.</p><p>After long moments, I feared he wasn\u2019t going to answer me. \u201cI\u2019d like to give you that, Gideon, if you want it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed. \u201cAngel.\u201d</p><p>I reached a hand between his legs, cupping his heavy sac. My middle finger extended beneath him, brushing lightly over the puckered opening. He jerked violently, his legs slamming shut, sending water sloshing to the lip of the tub. His cock hardened like stone against my forearm.</p><p>I pulled my trapped hand free and gripped his erection in my fist, stroking, my mouth taking his when he groaned. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything for you. There are no limits in our bed. No memories. Just us. You and me. And love. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>His tongue thrust into my mouth, a greedy and slightly angry foray. His hand at my waist tightened, his other hand covering mine and urging me to tighten my grip.</p><p>Gentle waves lapped against the sides of the bathtub as I pumped his erection. His moan tightened my nipples.</p><p>\u201cI own your pleasure,\u201d I whispered into his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll take it if you won\u2019t give it to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He growled, his head falling back. \u201cMake me come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny way you want,\u201d I vowed.</p><p>\u201cWEAR the blue tie. The one that matches your eyes.\u201d I had a direct view into the walk-in closet, where Gideon was picking out the suit he\u2019d wear to wrap up the week.</p> <p>He glanced over to where I sat on the edge of the bed in the master bedroom, a cup of coffee in my hands. His mouth curved in an indulgent smile.</p><p>\u201cI love your eyes,\u201d I told him with an easy shrug. \u201cThey\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>He unhooked the tie from the rack and stepped back into the bedroom with a graphite gray suit draped over his forearm. He wore only black boxer briefs, affording me the joy of admiring his leanly ripped body and taut golden skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s uncanny how often we think alike,\u201d he said. \u201cI picked out this suit because the color reminds me of your eyes.\u201d</p><p>That made me smile. I swung my legs, too full of love and happiness to sit still.</p> <p>Laying his clothes on the bed, Gideon came to me. I tilted my head back to look up at him, my heart beating strong and sure.</p><p>He cupped the sides of my head, his thumbs brushing over my eyebrows. \u201cSuch a beautiful stormy gray. And so very expressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA totally unfair advantage for you. You read me like a book, while you\u2019ve got the best poker face I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Bending over, he kissed my forehead. \u201cAnd yet I can never get away with anything with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d I watched him start to dress. \u201cListen, I want you to do something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you need a date and it can\u2019t be me, take Ireland.\u201d</p><p>He paused in the act of buttoning up his shirt. \u201cShe\u2019s seventeen, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? Your sister is a beautiful, classy young woman who adores you. She\u2019d do you proud.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he grabbed his slacks. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine her being anything but bored at the few events appropriate for her to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said she\u2019d be bored having dinner at my place and you were wrong about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there,\u201d he argued, yanking up his pants. \u201cShe had fun with you.\u201d</p><p>I took a drink of my coffee. \u201cYou said anything,\u201d I reminded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem going dateless, Eva. And I told you I won\u2019t be seeing Corinne anymore.\u201d</p> <p>I stared at him over the rim of my mug and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Gideon shoved his shirttails into his slacks with obvious frustration. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could refrain from grinning like the Cheshire cat,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI could.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, his narrowed eyes sliding down my body to where my robe had fallen away from my bare legs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas, ace. I already put out this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a passport?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>Nodding briskly, he reached for the tie I loved. \u201cYou\u2019ll need it.\u201d</p><p>Excitement tingled through me. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh.\u201d I slid off the bed onto my feet. \u201cTravel to where?\u201d</p><p>His eyes held a wicked gleam as he swiftly and expertly knotted his tie. \u201cSomewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you shipping me off to parts unknown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t I love to,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou and me on a deserted tropical island where you\u2019d be perpetually naked and I could slide into you at any moment.\u201d</p><p>I set one hand on my hip and shot him a look. \u201cSunburned and bowlegged. Sexy.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and my toes flexed into the carpet.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you tonight,\u201d he said, as he shrugged into his vest.</p><p>\u201cYou just want to put it in me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you did tell me not to stop. Repeatedly.\u201d</p><p>Snorting, I put my coffee down on the nightstand and shrugged out of my robe. Naked, I crossed the room, skirting him when he made a grab for me. I was opening a drawer to choose one of the lovely Carine Gilson bra and panty sets he kept stocked for me, when he came up behind me, slid his arms beneath mine, and cupped my breasts in both hands.</p><p>\u201cI can remind you,\u201d he purred.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a job to get to? Because I do.\u201d</p><p>Gideon pressed against my back. \u201cCome work with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd pour your coffee while waiting for you to fuck me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d I spun so quickly to face him that I knocked my purse onto the floor. \u201cI have a job and I like it a lot. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re good at it.\u201d He gripped my shoulders. \u201cBe good at it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, for the same reason I didn\u2019t accept help from my stepfather. I want to make it on my own!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. I respect that about you.\u201d His hands caressed my arms. \u201cI clawed my way up, too, with the Cross name trying to drag me down. I\u2019d never take the effort away from you. You wouldn\u2019t get anything you didn\u2019t earn.\u201d</p><p>I suppressed the twinge of sympathy I felt for Gideon\u2019s suffering over his father, a Ponzi scheme swindler who\u2019d taken his own life rather than face jail time. \u201cDo you really think anyone is going to believe I got the job for any reason other than I\u2019m the chick you\u2019re sticking it to now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d He shook me. \u201cYou\u2019re pissed off and that\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t talk about us that way.\u201d</p><p>I pushed at him. \u201cEveryone else will.\u201d</p><p>Growling, he released me. \u201cYou signed up for a CrossTrainer membership even though you\u2019ve got Equinox and Krav Maga. Explain why.\u201d</p><p>I pivoted to yank a pair of panties on so I wasn\u2019t arguing while buck naked. \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>I faced him again, stepping on stuff that had fallen out of my purse, which only made me madder. \u201cWaters Field and Leaman isn\u2019t in competition with Cross Industries! You use the agency\u2019s services yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll never work on a campaign for one of my competitors?\u201d</p><p>Standing there in his unbuttoned vest and impeccable tie, he was making it hard for me to think properly. He was beautiful and passionate and everything I\u2019d ever wanted, which made it nearly impossible for me to deny him anything.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. I won\u2019t be happy, Gideon,\u201d I said with quiet honesty.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He held his arms open for me and hugged me when I walked into them. He spoke with his lips against my temple. \u201cOne day, the \u2018Cross\u2019 in Cross Industries won\u2019t refer to just me.\u201d</p><p>My anger and frustration simmered. \u201cCan we not talk about this now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne last thing: You can apply for a position just like anyone else, if that\u2019s the way you need to do it. I won\u2019t interfere. If you get the job, you\u2019d be working on a different floor of the Crossfire and climbing the career ladder all on your own. Whether you advance won\u2019t be up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to you.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. We\u2019re working hard to build a future together. This is a natural step in that direction.\u201d</p><p>I nodded reluctantly. \u201cI have to be independent.\u201d</p><p>His hand cupped my nape, holding me close. \u201cDon\u2019t forget what matters most. If you work hard and show skill and talent, that\u2019s what people will base their judgments on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get ready for work.\u201d</p><p>Gideon searched my face, then kissed me softly.</p><p>He released me and I bent down to pick up my purse. Then I noticed that I\u2019d stepped on my mirrored compact and shattered its case. I wasn\u2019t heartbroken over it, because I could always pick up another at Sephora on the way home. What froze my blood was the electrical wire sticking out of the cracked plastic.</p><p>Gideon crouched down to help me. I looked at him. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>He took the compact from me and broke off more of the shell to expose a microchip with a small antenna. \u201cA bug, maybe. Or a tracking device.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him with horror. My lips moved silently. The police?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got jammers in the apartment,\u201d he answered, shocking me further. \u201cAnd no. There\u2019s no way any judge would\u2019ve authorized a tap on you. There\u2019s nothing to justify it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d I fell back on my ass, feeling sick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have my guys look at it.\u201d He lowered to his knees and brushed the hair back from my face. \u201cCould it be your mother?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him helplessly.</p><p>\u201cEva\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, Gideon.\u201d I held him off with an uplifted hand and grabbed my phone with the other. I dialed Clancy, my stepfather\u2019s bodyguard, and the moment he answered, I said, \u201cIs the bug in my compact one of yours?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, then, \u201cTracking device, not a bug. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Clancy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour job sucks,\u201d I shot back, picturing him in my head. Clancy was solid muscle. He wore his dirty-blond hair in a military crew cut and radiated a vibe that was deadly dangerous. But I wasn\u2019t afraid of him. \u201cThis is bullshit and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeping you safe became a bigger concern when Nathan Barker showed up again. He was slippery, so I had to cover both of you. The minute his death was confirmed, I turned off the receiver.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the damn tracker! I don\u2019t have a problem with that. It\u2019s the keeping-me-in-the-dark part that\u2019s wrong on so many levels. I feel violated, Clancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you, but Mrs. Stanton didn\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an adult! I get to decide if I worry or not.\u201d I shot a look at Gideon when I said that, because what I was saying was totally applicable to him, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His arch look told me he got the message.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t hear me arguing,\u201d Clancy said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me,\u201d I told him, knowing just how I was going to collect. \u201cBig-time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>I killed the call, then sent a text to my mom: We need to talk.</p><p>My shoulders sagged with disappointment and frustration.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d</p><p>I shot Gideon a look that warned him not to push me. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare make excuses\u2014for yourself or for her.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes were soft and shadowed, but the set of his jaw was resolute. \u201cI was there when you were told Nathan was in New York. I saw your face. There\u2019s no one who loves you who wouldn\u2019t do whatever they could to shield you from that.\u201d</p><p>And that was really hard for me to deal with, because I couldn\u2019t deny that I was glad I hadn\u2019t known about Nathan until after he was dead. But I also didn\u2019t want to be insulated from bad things. They were part of living.</p><p>Reaching for his hand, I gripped it tightly. \u201cI feel the same way about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken care of my demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mine.\u201d But we were still sleeping apart from each other. \u201cI want you to go back to Dr. Petersen,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI went on Tuesday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did?\u201d I couldn\u2019t hide my surprise at learning he\u2019d kept his regular schedule.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did. I only missed the one appointment.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d killed Nathan ...</p><p>His thumb brushed over the back of my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and me now,\u201d he said, as if he\u2019d read my mind.</p><p>I wanted to believe that.</p><p>I was dragging when I got to work, which wasn\u2019t a good omen for the rest of the day. At least it was Friday and I could be a slug over the weekend, which would probably be a necessity Sunday morning if I partied too hard Saturday night. I hadn\u2019t had a girls\u2019 night out in ages and I felt the need for a good stiff drink or two.</p><p>In the previous forty-eight hours, I\u2019d learned that my boyfriend had killed my rapist, one of my exes was hoping to spread me across his sheets, one of my boyfriend\u2019s exes was hoping to smear him in the press, and my mother had microchipped me like a damned dog.</p><p>Really, how much was a girl supposed to take?</p> <p>\u201cYou ready for tomorrow?\u201d Megumi queried, after she buzzed me through the glass doors.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah. My friend Shawna texted me this morning and she\u2019s in.\u201d I mustered a genuine smile. \u201cI arranged for a club limo for us. You know ... one of those that take you to all the VIP spots, cover included.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She couldn\u2019t hide her excitement, but still had to ask, \u201cHow much is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNada. It\u2019s a favor from a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome favor.\u201d Her grin made me happy, too. \u201cThis is going to be awesome! You\u2019ll have to tell me the deets over lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on. I expect you to dish about your lunch yesterday, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about mixed signals, right?\u201d she complained. \u201c \u2018We\u2019re just having fun,\u2019 but he shows his face at my work? I would never pop into a guy\u2019s office for an impromptu lunch if we were just messing around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d I huffed sympathetically, even as I acknowledged that I was grateful for the one who was mine.</p><p>I went to my desk and got ready to start my workday. When I saw the framed photos of Gideon and me in my drawer, I was struck by the need to reach out to him. Ten minutes later, I\u2019d asked Angus to place an order for black magic roses to be sent to Gideon\u2019s office with the note:</p><p>You\u2019ve got me under your spell.</p><p>I\u2019m still thinking about you.</p><p>Mark came to my cubicle just as I was closing the window on my browser. One look at his face and I could tell he wasn\u2019t doing so hot. \u201cCoffee?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He nodded and I stood. We headed to the break room together.</p><p>\u201cShawna was over last night,\u201d he began. \u201cShe said you\u2019re going out tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Is that still okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs what still okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your sister-in-law and I hang out,\u201d I prodded.</p><p>\u201cOh ... yeah. Sure. Go for it.\u201d He ran a restless hand over his short, dark curls. \u201cI think it\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I knew there was more on his mind, but I didn\u2019t want to push. \u201cShould be fun. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is she.\u201d He reached for two single-serving coffee pods, while I took mugs from the shelf. \u201cShe\u2019s also looking forward to Doug getting back. And popping the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Now that\u2019s cool! Two weddings in your family in a year. Unless you\u2019re planning a long engagement ... ?\u201d</p><p>He handed the first cup of coffee to me and I went to the fridge for half-and-half.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, Eva.\u201d</p><p>Mark\u2019s tone was weighted with dejection, and when I turned to face him, his head was down.</p><p>I patted his shoulder. \u201cDid you propose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s no point. He was asking Shawna if she and Doug were planning on having kids right away, since she\u2019s still in school part-time, and when she said they weren\u2019t, he went into this lecture about how marriage is for couples ready for a family. Otherwise, it\u2019s better to keep things simple. It\u2019s the same crap I once shoveled to him.\u201d</p><p>I rounded him and lightened my coffee. \u201cMark, you won\u2019t know Steven\u2019s answer until you ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d he admitted, looking into his steaming mug. \u201cI want more than we\u2019ve got, but I don\u2019t want to ruin what we have. If his answer is no and he thinks we want different things out of our relationship ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCart before the horse, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t live with no?\u201d</p><p>Ah ... I could understand that. \u201cCan you live with not knowing for sure either way?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThen you have to tell him everything you\u2019ve told me,\u201d I said sternly.</p><p>His mouth quirked. \u201cSorry to keep dumping this on you. But you\u2019re always great at giving me perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what to do. You just want a kick in the ass to do it. I\u2019m always up for ass-kicking.\u201d</p><p>He smiled full on. \u201cLet\u2019s not work on the divorce attorney\u2019s campaign today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about the airline instead?\u201d I suggested. \u201cI have some ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Let\u2019s hit it.\u201d</p><p>WE hard-charged through the morning, and I was energized by our progress. I wanted to keep Mark too occupied to worry. Work was a cure-all for me, and it quickly became clear that it was for him as well.</p><p>We\u2019d just wrapped up for lunch and I had stopped by my desk to drop off my tablet when I saw the interoffice envelope on my desk. My pulse leaped with excitement and my hands shook slightly as I unwound the thin twine and let the note card inside slide out.</p><p>YOU\u2019RE THE MAGIC.</p><p>YOU MAKE DREAMS COME TRUE.</p><p>X</p><p>I held the card to my chest, wishing it were the writer I was holding instead. I was thinking about sprinkling rose petals on our bed when my desk phone rang. I wasn\u2019t all that surprised when I heard my mother\u2019s breathy bombshell voice on the other end.</p><p>\u201cEva. Clancy talked to me. Please don\u2019t be upset! You have to understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it.\u201d I opened my drawer and tucked Gideon\u2019s precious note into my purse. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: You don\u2019t have Nathan as an excuse anymore. If you\u2019ve got any more bugs or trackers or whatever in my stuff, you better fess up now. Because I promise you, if I find something else moving forward, our relationship will be irrevocably damaged.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cCan we talk in person, please? I\u2019m taking Cary out to lunch and I\u2019ll just stay over until you get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d The irritation that had started prickling at me dissipated just as quickly as it had come up. I loved that my mother treated Cary like the brother he was to me. She gave him the maternal love he\u2019d never had. And they were both so appearance- and fashion-conscious that they always had a blast together.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Eva. More than anything.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI know, Mom. I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>My other line flashed a call from reception, so I said good-bye and answered it.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Megumi\u2019s voice was low and hushed. \u201cThe chick who came by for you once before, the one you wouldn\u2019t see, she\u2019s here again asking for you.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, my brain taking a second to latch on to what she was talking about. \u201cMagdalene Perez?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. That\u2019s the one. What should I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I pushed to my feet. Unlike the last time Gideon\u2019s friend-who-wished-she-were-more had come around, I was prepared to deal with her myself. \u201cOn my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! I\u2019ll be there in a minute. This won\u2019t take long, then we\u2019ll head out to lunch.\u201d</p><p>Vanity had me smearing on some lip gloss before I slung my purse over my shoulder and headed out front. Thinking of Gideon\u2019s note put the smile on my face that greeted Magdalene when I found her in the waiting area. She stood when I came into view, looking so amazing I couldn\u2019t help but admire her.</p><p>When I\u2019d first met her, her dark hair had been long and sleek, like Corinne Giroux\u2019s. Now, it was cut in a classic bob that showed off the exotic beauty of her face. She wore cream slacks and a black sleeveless shell that had a big bow tied at the hip. Pearls at her ears and throat completed the elegant look.</p><p>\u201cMagdalene.\u201d I gestured for her to return to her seat and took the armchair on the opposite side of the small conversation table. \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to barge in on you at work like this, Eva, but I was visiting Gideon and thought I\u2019d stop here, too. I have something to ask you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d I set my purse down beside me and crossed my legs, smoothing my burgundy skirt. I resented her for being able to spend time with my boyfriend openly when I couldn\u2019t. There was no way around it.</p><p>\u201cA reporter stopped by my office today, asking personal questions about Gideon.\u201d</p><p>My fingertips curled into the cushion of the armrest. \u201cDeanna Johnson? You didn\u2019t answer her, did you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Magdalene leaned forward, setting her elbows on her knees. Her dark eyes were somber. \u201cShe\u2019s already talked to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s his type,\u201d she pointed out, studying me.</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThe type he doesn\u2019t stick with long.\u201d Her full red lips twisted ruefully. \u201cHe\u2019s told Corinne that it\u2019s best if they remain long-distance friends, rather than social ones. But I suspect you know that.\u201d</p> <p>I felt a ripple of pleasure over that news. \u201cHow would I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure you have ways.\u201d Magdalene\u2019s eyes sparkled with knowing amusement.</p><p>Oddly, I found myself at ease with her. Maybe because she seemed so at ease with herself, which hadn\u2019t been the case the previous times we\u2019d crossed paths. \u201cSeems like you\u2019re doing good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting there. I had someone in my life who I thought was a friend but was really just toxic. Without him around, I can think again.\u201d She straightened. \u201cI\u2019ve just started seeing someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d In that respect, I wished her only the best. She\u2019d been horribly used by Gideon\u2019s brother, Christopher. She didn\u2019t know I knew. \u201cI hope it works out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Gage is different from Gideon in a lot of ways. He\u2019s one of those brooding artist types.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDeep souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Very deep, I think. I hope I get to find out for sure.\u201d She stood. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t mean to keep you. I was worried about the reporter and wanted to discuss her with you.\u201d</p><p>I corrected her as I rose. \u201cYou were worried about me discussing Gideon with the reporter.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cBye, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d I watched her exit through the glass doors.</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t look too bad,\u201d Megumi said, joining me. \u201cNo scratching or hissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see how long it lasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady for lunch?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m starved. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>WHEN I walked in my front door five and a half hours later, Cary, my mom, and a dazzling silver Nina Ricci formal gown laid out on the sofa greeted me.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it fantastic?\u201d my mother gushed, looking fantastic herself in a fifties-style fitted dress with cap sleeves and a pattern of tiny cherries. Her blond hair framed her beautiful face in thick, glossy curls. I had to hand it to her; she could make any era look glamorous.</p><p>I\u2019d been told my whole life that I looked just like her, but I had my father\u2019s gray eyes instead of her cornflower blue, and my abundant curves were from the Reyes side. I had a butt no amount of exercise would rid me of and breasts that prevented me from wearing anything without a lot of support. It still amazed me that Gideon found my body so irresistible when he\u2019d previously been drawn only to tall, slender brunettes.</p><p>Dropping my bag and purse on a bar stool, I asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shelter fund-raiser, a week from Thursday.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Cary for confirmation that he\u2019d be escorting me. His nod allowed me to shrug and say, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>My mother beamed, looking radiant. In my honor, she supported charities benefiting abused women and children. When the fund-raisers were formal, she always purchased seats for Cary and me.</p><p>\u201cWine?\u201d Cary asked, clearly picking up on my restless mood.</p><p>I shot him a grateful look. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>As he headed off to the kitchen, my mom glided over to me on sexy red-soled slingbacks and pulled me in for a hug. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird.\u201d I hugged her back. \u201cGlad it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have plans this weekend?\u201d She pulled away, her gaze sliding warily over my face.</p><p>That got my back up. \u201cSome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCary tells me you\u2019re seeing someone new. Who is he? What does he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d I got to the point. \u201cAre we good? Clean slate and all that? Or is there something you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>She started to fidget, almost wringing her hands. \u201cEva. You won\u2019t be able to understand what it\u2019s like until you have children of your own. It\u2019s terrifying. And knowing for certain that they\u2019re in danger\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there are additional dangers that come just from being a beautiful woman,\u201d she rushed on. \u201cYou\u2019re connected to powerful men. That doesn\u2019t always make you safer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are they, Mom?\u201d</p><p>She huffed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to take that tone with me. I was only trying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go,\u201d I cut in coldly, the chill I felt on the inside leaching out through my voice.</p><p>\u201cYour Rolex,\u201d she snapped, and it was like a slap to my face.</p><p>I staggered back a step, my right hand instinctively covering the watch on my left wrist, a treasured graduation gift from Stanton and my mother. I\u2019d had the silly sentimental idea of passing it on to my daughter, should I be lucky enough to have one.</p><p>\u201cAre you shitting me?\u201d My fingers clawed at the clasp and the watch fell to the carpet with a muffled thud. It hadn\u2019t been a gift at all. It\u2019d been a shackle on my wrist. \u201cYou\u2019ve seriously crossed the line!\u201d</p><p>She flushed. \u201cEva, you\u2019re overreacting. It\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverreacting? Ha! My God, that\u2019s laughable. Really.\u201d I shoved two pinched-together fingers in her face. \u201cI\u2019m this close to calling the police. And I\u2019ve half a mind to sue you for invasion of privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your mother!\u201d Her voice trailed off, took on a note of pleading. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to look after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a twenty-four-year-old adult,\u201d I said coldly. \u201cBy law, I can look after myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva Lauren\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I lifted my hands, then dropped them. \u201cJust don\u2019t. I\u2019m going to leave now, because I\u2019m so pissed off I can\u2019t even look at you. And I don\u2019t want to hear from you, unless it\u2019s with a sincere apology. Until you admit you\u2019re wrong, I can\u2019t trust you not to do it again.\u201d</p><p>I walked to the kitchen and grabbed my purse, my gaze meeting Cary\u2019s just as he was coming out with a tray of half-filled wineglasses. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just walk out like this!\u201d my mother cried, clearly on the verge of one of her emotional fits. I couldn\u2019t deal with it. Not then.</p><p>\u201cWatch me,\u201d I muttered under my breath.</p><p>My goddamned Rolex. Just thinking of it hurt like hell, because the gift had meant so much to me. Now, it meant nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cLet her go, Monica,\u201d Cary said, his voice low and soothing. He knew how to deal with hysteria better than anyone. It was crappy sticking him with my mom, but I had to go. If I went to my room, she would just cry and plead at my door until I felt sick. I hated seeing her like that, hated causing her to feel that way.</p><p>Exiting my apartment, I went to Gideon\u2019s next door, rushing to get inside before the tears overwhelmed me or my mother came after me. There was nowhere else for me to go. I couldn\u2019t go out in public shell-shocked and crying. My mother wasn\u2019t the only one who had me under surveillance. There was also the possibility of the police, Deanna Johnson, and maybe even some paparazzi.</p><p>I got as far as Gideon\u2019s couch, sprawling across the cushions and allowing the tears to flow.</p><p>7</p><p>\u201cANGEL.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s voice and the feel of his hands on me pulled me from sleep. I mumbled a protest as he shifted me onto my side, and then the heat of his body was warming my back. One of his muscular arms wrapped around my waist, tucking me close.</p><p>Spooned with him, the biceps of his other arm hard beneath my cheek, I slid back into unconsciousness.</p><p>WHEN I woke again, it felt like days later. I lay on the couch with my eyes closed for long minutes, soaking in the warmth of Gideon\u2019s powerful body and breathing air that smelled of him. After a while, I decided that sleeping longer would only throw off my body clock even more. We\u2019d had a lot of late nights and early mornings since we had gotten back together, and they were taking their toll.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been crying,\u201d he murmured, burying his face in my hair. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arms over his, snuggling into him. I told him about the watch. \u201cMaybe I overreacted,\u201d I finished. \u201cI was tired, which makes me irritable. But God ... it hurt like hell. It totally ruined a gift that meant a lot to me, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d His fingers drew gentle circles across my stomach, caressing me through the silk of my shirt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I looked toward the windows and saw that night had fallen. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little after eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time did you get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf past six.\u201d</p><p>I wriggled around to face him. \u201cEarly for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce I knew you were here, I couldn\u2019t stay away. I\u2019ve wanted to be with you since your flowers arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou liked them?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI have to say, reading your words in Angus\u2019s handwriting was ... interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to be safe.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the tip of my nose. \u201cWhile still spoiling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to. I want to ruin you for other women.\u201d</p><p>The pad of his thumb brushed over my bottom lip. \u201cYou did that the moment I saw you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSweet talker.\u201d My depression lifted just from being with Gideon and knowing I was his sole focus at that moment. \u201cYou trying to get in my pants again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wearing pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a yes, I want under your skirt.\u201d His eyes darkened when I nipped his thumb with my teeth. \u201cAnd inside your hot, wet, tight little cunt. I\u2019ve wanted that all day. I want it every day. I want it now, but we\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re feeling better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could kiss it and make it better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss what, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. Everywhere.\u201d</p><p>I knew I could get used to having him all to myself like this. Knew I wanted to. Which was impossible, of course.</p><p>Thousands of little pieces of him were committed to thousands of people and projects and commitments. If I\u2019d learned anything from my mother\u2019s multiple marriages to successful businessmen, it was that wives were often mistresses, almost invariably taking second place because their husbands were also married to their work. There was a reason why a man became a captain in his chosen field\u2014he gave it his all. The woman in his life got what was left.</p><p>Gideon tucked my hair behind my ear. \u201cI want this. Coming home to you.\u201d</p><p>It always startled me when it seemed like he\u2019d read my thoughts. \u201cWould it have been better if you\u2019d found me barefoot in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be opposed, but naked in bed would work best for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a decent cook, but you just want me for my body.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s the very delicious package holding everything else I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you mine, if you show me yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove to.\u201d His fingertips slid gently down my cheek. \u201cBut first, I want to make sure you\u2019re in the right frame of mind after the situation with your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d His tone warned me that he wouldn\u2019t be put off.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll forgive her, I always do. I don\u2019t have a choice, really, because I love her and I know she means well, even if she is seriously misguided. But this thing with the watch ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed at the ache in my chest. \u201cIt broke something in our relationship. And no matter how we move forward, there\u2019s always going to be that crack there that didn\u2019t exist before. That\u2019s what hurts.\u201d</p><p>Gideon was quiet for a long time. One of his hands slid into my hair, while the other curled possessively over my hip. I waited for him to say what was on his mind.</p> <p>\u201cI broke something in our relationship, too,\u201d he said finally, his voice somber. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s always going to be between us.\u201d</p><p>The sadness in his eyes twisted into me, hurting me. \u201cLet me up.\u201d</p><p>He did, reluctantly, watching me warily as I stood. I hesitated before I unzipped my skirt. \u201cNow I know what it feels like to lose you, Gideon. How badly it hurts. If you shut me out, it\u2019s probably going to make me panic a little. You\u2019ll just have to be careful of that, and I\u2019ll just have to trust that your love is going to stick.\u201d</p><p>He nodded his understanding and acceptance, but I could see it was eating at him.</p><p>\u201cMagdalene came by today,\u201d I said, to take his mind off the lingering rift between us.</p><p>He tensed. \u201cI told her not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. She was probably concerned about me nursing a grudge, but I think she realized I love you too much to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>He sat up as I let my skirt drop. It pooled on the floor, revealing my garters and stockings, which earned me a slow hiss through his clenched teeth. I climbed back onto the couch and straddled his thighs, draping my arms around his neck. His breath was hot through the silk of my shirt, stirring my blood.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I ran both hands through his hair, nuzzling my cheek against him. \u201cStop worrying about us. I think we need to be worrying about Deanna Johnson. What\u2019s the worst she could possibly dig up on you?\u201d</p><p>His head fell back, his gaze narrowing. \u201cShe\u2019s my problem. I\u2019ll deal with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s after something really juicy. Calling you out as a heartless playboy isn\u2019t going to be enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop worrying. The only reason I would care is because I don\u2019t want my past shoved in your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too confident.\u201d My fingers went to his vest and began freeing the buttons. I exposed his shirt and removed his tie, draping it carefully over the back of the sofa. \u201cAre you going to talk to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ignore her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the right way to handle this?\u201d I went to work on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cShe wants my attention; she\u2019s not going to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll find another way, then.\u201d</p><p>He settled deeper into the seat back, his neck tilting to look up to me. \u201cThe only way for a woman to get my attention is to be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAce.\u201d I kissed him, tugging at his shirttails. He shifted to make it easier for me to pull them out of his pants. \u201cI need you to explain Deanna,\u201d I murmured. \u201cWhat set her off like this?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cShe was a mistake in every sense. She made herself available once, and I make it a rule to avoid overly eager women a second time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t make you sound like an asshole at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t change what happened,\u201d he said coldly.</p><p>I could tell he was embarrassed. He could be as much of a dick as any guy, but he was never proud of it.</p><p>\u201cDeanna happened to be covering an event where Anne Lucas was making me uncomfortable,\u201d he continued. \u201cI used Deanna to keep Anne from approaching me. I didn\u2019t feel good about it afterward and I didn\u2019t handle it well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the picture.\u201d I pushed his shirt apart, exposing his warm, firm skin.</p><p>Remembering how he reacted after the first time we\u2019d had sex, I could imagine how he\u2019d handled Deanna. With me, he\u2019d immediately shut down and shut me out, leaving me feeling used and worthless. He\u2019d fought to win me back after that, but the reporter hadn\u2019t been so lucky.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to lead her on with any contact,\u201d I summed up. \u201cShe\u2019s probably still digging on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that. I don\u2019t think I said more than a dozen words to her altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were an ass to me, too. I fell in love with you anyway.\u201d</p><p>My hands slid lovingly across his hard chest, caressing the light dusting of dark hair before coasting down the thin, silky trail that led below his waistband. His abs quivered beneath my touch, the tempo of his breathing changing.</p><p>Sinking to sit on his lap, I adored his body. My thumbs circled the tiny points of his nipples and I watched his reaction, waiting for him to succumb to the subtle pleasure of my touch. I lowered my head and pressed a kiss to his throat, feeling his pulse leap beneath my lips and inhaling the virile scent of his skin. Enjoying him was something I didn\u2019t get to do enough of, because he always turned it back around on me.</p><p>Gideon groaned, his hand coming up to grip my hair. \u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the way you respond to me,\u201d I whispered, seduced by having such an unabashedly sexual male completely at my mercy. \u201cLike you can\u2019t help yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He let the sleep-tousled strands sift through his fingers. \u201cYou touch me like you worship me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel it in your hands ... your mouth. The way you look at me.\u201d His throat worked on a swallow and I followed the movement with my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted anything more.\u201d I caressed his torso, tracing muscled pecs, then the line of every rib. Like a connoisseur admiring the perfection of a priceless work of art. \u201cLet\u2019s play a game.\u201d</p><p>His tongue did a slow sweep along the curve of his lip, making my sex clench with jealousy. He knew it, too. I saw it in the way his eyes glittered dangerously. \u201cDepends on the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight, you\u2019re mine, ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always yours.\u201d</p><p>I unbuttoned my blouse and shrugged out of it, exposing my white lace demi-bra and matching thong.</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d he breathed, his gaze so hot I felt it slide over my bared flesh. His hands moved to touch and I caught his wrists, staying him.</p><p>\u201cRule number one: I\u2019m going to suck you, stroke you, and tease you all night long. You\u2019re going to come until you can\u2019t see straight.\u201d I cupped him through his slacks, massaging his rigid length with my palm. \u201cRule number two: You\u2019re just going to lie back and enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo returning the favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening,\u201d he said decisively.</p><p>I pouted. \u201cPretty please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel, getting you off is ninety-nine percent of the fun for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then I\u2019m so busy coming I don\u2019t get to enjoy you!\u201d I complained. \u201cJust for once\u2014one night\u2014I want you to be selfish. I want you to let go, be an animal, come just because it feels good and you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cI can\u2019t do that with you. I need you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d say that.\u201d Because I\u2019d once told him that feeling used by a man for his pleasure was a trigger for me. I needed to feel loved and wanted, too. Not as an interchangeable female body to ejaculate into, but as Eva, an individual woman who needed genuine affection with sex. \u201cBut this is my game and it\u2019s played by my rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t agreed to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear me out.\u201d</p><p>Gideon exhaled slowly. \u201cI can\u2019t do it, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could do it with other women,\u201d I argued.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in love with them!\u201d</p><p>I melted. I couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cBaby ... I want this,\u201d I whispered. \u201cReal bad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He made an exasperated noise. \u201cHelp me understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear your heart racing when I\u2019m gasping for breath. I can\u2019t feel you shaking when I\u2019m shaking, too. I can\u2019t taste you when my mouth is dry from begging you to finish me off.\u201d</p><p>His beautiful face softened. \u201cI lose my mind every time I come inside you. Let that be enough.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou\u2019ve said I\u2019m like your favorite wet dream made real. Those dreams couldn\u2019t have all been about getting the girl off. What about the blowjobs? The hand jobs? You love my tits. Don\u2019t you want to fuck them until you come all over me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Eva.\u201d His cock thickened in my grip.</p><p>Brushing my parted lips across his, I deftly opened his slacks. \u201cI want to be your dirtiest fantasy,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI want to be filthy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already what I want you to be,\u201d he said darkly.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d I ran my nails lightly down his sides, biting my lower lip when he hissed. \u201cThen do it for me. I love those moments after you\u2019ve seen to me and you\u2019re chasing your own orgasm. When your rhythm and focus changes, and you get ferocious. I know you\u2019re just thinking about how good it feels and how hot you are and how hard you\u2019re going to come. It makes me feel so good to get you that worked up. I want a whole night of feeling like that.\u201d</p><p>His hands squeezed my thighs. \u201cWith one stipulation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get tonight. Next weekend, the game\u2019s on me.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open. \u201cI get a night, you get a whole weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm ... a whole weekend of seeing to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d I muttered, \u201cyou drive a hard bargain.\u201d</p><p>His smile was razor sharp. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOUR mom says that our dad is a real sex machine.\u201d</p><p>Gideon glanced at me, grinning, from where he sat beside me on the floor. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a weird catalog of movie lines in that gorgeous head of yours, angel.\u201d</p><p>I took a swig from my bottled water and swallowed just in time to recite the next line from Kindergarten Cop. \u201cMy dad\u2019s a gynecologist and he looks at vaginas all day long.\u201d</p><p>His laughter made me so happy I felt as if I could float away. He was bright-eyed and more relaxed than I\u2019d seen him since forever. Some of that had to do with the straight-to-the-point blowjob I\u2019d given him on the couch, followed by a long, slow, slippery hand job in the shower. But a lot of it came from me, I knew.</p><p>When I was in a good mood, he was, too. It amazed me that I had a profound influence on such a man. Gideon was a force of nature, his magnetic self-possession so powerful it put everyone around him in his shadow. I saw flashes of it every day and was awed by it, but not nearly as much as I was by the charming, wryly amusing lover I had entirely to myself in our private moments together.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, \u201cyou won\u2019t be laughing when your kids tell their teachers the same things about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince they\u2019d have to hear it from you, I\u2019d know who it was that really needed the spanking.\u201d</p> <p>He turned his head to resume watching the movie, as if he hadn\u2019t just knocked the wind out of me. Gideon was a man who\u2019d lived an entirely solitary life, and yet he\u2019d accepted me into it so completely that he could envision a future I was afraid to imagine. I was so scared I\u2019d only be setting myself up for a heartbreak I couldn\u2019t survive.</p><p>Noting my silence, he set his hand on my bare knee and glanced at me again. \u201cStill hungry?\u201d</p><p>My gaze remained trained on the open Chinese take-out boxes on the coffee table in front of us, and the black magic roses, which Gideon had brought home from work so we could enjoy them over the weekend.</p><p>Not wanting to make more of his statement than he\u2019d intended, I said, \u201cOnly for you.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand in his lap, feeling the soft heft of his cock within the black boxer briefs I\u2019d allowed him to wear for dinner.</p><p>\u201cYou are a dangerous woman,\u201d he murmured, leaning closer.</p><p>Moving quickly, I caught his mouth with my own, sucking on his lower lip. \u201cHave to be,\u201d I murmured, \u201cto keep up with you, Dark and Dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>\u201cI need to check in with Cary again,\u201d I said with a sigh. \u201cSee if Mom\u2019s left yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I leaned my head on his shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like a little Gideon therapy to make things look up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention I make house calls? Twenty-four-seven.\u201d</p><p>I sank my teeth into his biceps. \u201cLet me take care of this, then I\u2019ll make you come again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, thanks,\u201d he shot back, clearly amused.</p><p>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t played with the girls yet.\u201d</p><p>He bent down and buried his face in my cleavage. \u201cHello, girls.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I shoved at his shoulders and he pushed me backward until I sprawled on the floor between the sofa and coffee table. He hovered above me, his arms tight and hard from supporting his weight. His gaze roamed, caressing my bra, then my bare tummy, then my thong and garters. The ensemble I wore post-shower was fire-engine red, chosen to keep Gideon revved.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my lucky charm,\u201d he said.</p><p>I squeezed his biceps. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He licked the upper swell of my breast. \u201cYou\u2019re magically delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I laughed. \u201cCheesy.\u201d</p><p>His eyes smiled at me. \u201cI did warn you about me and romance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied. You\u2019re the most romantic guy I\u2019ve ever dated. I can\u2019t believe you hung those CrossTrainer towels in your bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I not? And I wasn\u2019t kidding about you being lucky.\u201d He kissed me. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on offloading my share of a casino in Milan. Those black magic roses arrived just as a bidder threw in a small winery in Bordeaux that I\u2019ve had my eye on. Guess what it\u2019s called ... La Rose Noir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA winery for a casino, huh? So you remain the god of sex, vice, and recreation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEndeavors that help me satisfy you, my goddess of desire, pleasure, and corny one-liners.\u201d</p><p>I ran my hands down his sides and slid my fingers beneath his waistband. \u201cWhen do I get to try the wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re helping me brainstorm the advertising campaign for it.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t give up, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when I want something, no.\u201d He rose to his knees and then helped me sit up. \u201cAnd I want you. Very, very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have me,\u201d I said, using his words.</p><p>\u201cI have your heart and your insanely sexy body. Now, I want your brain. I want everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to save something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Take me instead.\u201d Gideon\u2019s hands reached around to cup the bare cheeks of my ass. \u201cNot an even trade in quality, I\u2019m sorry to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bargaining like mad today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiroux was happy with his deal. You will be, too, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiroux?\u201d My heart thudded. \u201cNo relation to Corinne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer husband. Although they\u2019re estranged and facing divorce, as you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. You do business with her husband?\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted ruefully. \u201cFirst time. And likely the last, although I did tell him that I\u2019m involved with a special woman\u2014and she\u2019s not his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is that she\u2019s in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know me.\u201d He cupped the back of my head and rubbed our noses together. \u201cHurry up and call Cary. I\u2019ll clean up dinner. Then we\u2019ll suck face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexpot.\u201d</p><p>I scrambled up to head to my purse for my phone. Gideon grabbed a garter and snapped it, sending a shock wave of sensation across my skin. Surprisingly aroused by the nip of pain, I slapped his hand away and hurried out of reach.</p><p>Cary answered on the second ring. \u201cHey, baby girl. You still doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And you\u2019re still the best friend ever. Is Mom still hanging around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe bailed a little over an hour ago. You stayin\u2019 over at loverman\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, unless you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good. Trey\u2019s on his way over now.\u201d</p><p>That news made me feel a lot better about spending a second night away. \u201cSay hi to him for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll kiss him for you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if it\u2019s from me, don\u2019t make it too hot and wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoilsport. Hey, remember how you asked me to do some digging on the Good Doctor Lucas? So far, I\u2019ve come up with a whole lotta nada. He doesn\u2019t seem to do much else besides work. No kids. Wife is a doctor, too. A shrink.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Gideon, cautiously ensuring that he didn\u2019t overhear. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is that important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess not. I just ... I guess I expect psychologists to be astute judges of character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Eva? You\u2019re all cloak-and-dagger lately, and it\u2019s starting to piss me off.\u201d</p><p>Climbing onto a bar stool, I explained as much as I could. \u201cI met Dr. Lucas at a charity dinner one night, then again when you were in the hospital. Both times he said some nasty things about Gideon and I\u2019m just trying to figure out what his deal is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Eva. What else could it be besides Cross banged his wife?\u201d</p><p>Unable to reveal a past that wasn\u2019t mine to share, I didn\u2019t answer. \u201cI\u2019ll be home tomorrow afternoon. I\u2019ve got that girls\u2019 night out. You sure you don\u2019t want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, change the subject,\u201d Cary bitched. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to come. I\u2019m not ready to hit the scene. Just thinking about it gives me hives.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nathan had jumped Cary outside a club, and Cary was still recovering physically from that. Somehow, I\u2019d forgotten that it was the mind that took longer to heal. He played it so cool, but I should\u2019ve known better. \u201cThe weekend after next, you want to fly out to San Diego? See my dad, our friends ... maybe even Dr. Travis, if we\u2019re up for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubtle, Eva,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cBut yeah, sounds good. I may need you to front me some money, since I\u2019m not working right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll make the arrangements and we can square up later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, before you hang up. One of your friends called earlier\u2014Deanna. I forgot to tell you when we talked before. She has news and she wants you to call her back.\u201d</p><p>I shot a look at Gideon. He caught my eye and something on my face must have given me away, because his eyes took on that familiar hard gleam. He headed toward me with that long, agile stride, the remnants of dinner carted neatly in the original delivery bag.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her anything?\u201d I asked Cary in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cTell her anything? Like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike something you wouldn\u2019t want to tell a reporter, because that\u2019s what she is.\u201d</p> <p>Gideon\u2019s face took on a stony cast. He passed me to drop the trash in the compactor, then came back to my side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re friends with a reporter?\u201d Cary asked. \u201cAre you nuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not friends with her. I have no idea how she got my home number, unless she called up from the front desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn expos\u00e9 on Gideon. She\u2019s starting to get on my bad side. She\u2019s all over him like a rash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll blow her off if she calls back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t.\u201d I held Gideon\u2019s gaze. \u201cJust don\u2019t give her any information about anything. Where did you tell her I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Thanks, Cary. Call if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a banging good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Cary.\u201d Shaking my head, I killed the call.</p><p>\u201cDeanna Johnson called you?\u201d Gideon asked, his arms crossing his chest.</p><p>\u201cYep. And I\u2019m about to call her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up, caveman. I\u2019m not into that \u2018me Cross, you Cross little woman\u2019 bullshit,\u201d I snapped. \u201cIn case you\u2019ve forgotten already, we made a trade. You got me, and I got you. I protect what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva, don\u2019t fight my battles for me. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. You\u2019ve been doing it your whole life. Now, you\u2019ve got me. I can handle this one.\u201d</p><p>Something shifted over his features, so swiftly I couldn\u2019t identify whether he was getting pissed. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have to deal with my past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dealt with mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA threat is a threat, ace. We\u2019re in this together. She\u2019s reaching out to me, which makes me your best shot at figuring out what she\u2019s up to.\u201d</p><p>He threw up one hand in frustration, then raked it through his hair. I had to force myself not to get distracted by the way his entire torso flexed with his agitation\u2014his abs clenching, his biceps hardening. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what she\u2019s up to. You know the truth, and you\u2019re the only one who matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to sit around while she crucifies you in the press, you need to revisit and revise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t hurt me unless she hurts you, and it\u2019s possible that\u2019s what she\u2019s really after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know unless I talk to her.\u201d I pulled Deanna\u2019s card out of my purse and dialed, blocking my number from showing on her Caller ID.</p><p>\u201cEva, damn it!\u201d</p><p>I put the phone on speaker and set it on the counter.</p><p>\u201cDeanna Johnson,\u201d she answered briskly.</p><p>\u201cDeanna, it\u2019s Eva Tramell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva, hi.\u201d The tone of her voice changed, assuming a friendliness we hadn\u2019t yet established. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. You?\u201d Studying Gideon, I tried to see if hearing her voice had any effect whatsoever. He glared back, looking deliciously pissed off. I\u2019d become resigned to the fact that whatever his mood, I always found him irresistible.</p><p>\u201cThings are churning. In my line of work that\u2019s always good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is getting your facts straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is one of the reasons I called you. I have a source who claims Gideon walked in on a m\u00e9nage composed of you, your roommate, and another guy, and flew into a rage. The guy ended up in the hospital and is now pressing assault charges. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>I froze, my hearing drowned by my roaring blood. The night I\u2019d met Corinne, I\u2019d come home to find Cary in a four-body sexual tangle that included a guy named Ian. When Ian had lewdly\u2014and nakedly\u2014propositioned me to join them, Gideon had refused the offer with his fist.</p><p>I looked at Gideon and my stomach cramped. It was true. He was being sued. I could see the proof of it in his face, which was devoid of all emotion, his thoughts hidden behind a flawless mask. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not true,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing further to say to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also have a firsthand account of an altercation between Gideon and Brett Kline, allegedly over you being caught in a hot clinch with Kline. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>My knuckles whitened as I gripped the edge of the counter.</p><p>\u201cYour roommate was recently assaulted,\u201d she went on. \u201cDid Gideon have anything to do with that?\u201d</p><p>Oh my God ... \u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind,\u201d I said coldly.</p><p>\u201cThe footage of you and Gideon arguing in Bryant Park shows him being very aggressive and physically rough with you. Are you in an abusive relationship with Gideon Cross? Is he violent with an uncontrollable temper? Are you afraid of him, Eva?\u201d</p><p>Gideon spun on his heel and walked away, striding down the hallway and turning into his home office.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Deanna,\u201d I bit out. \u201cYou\u2019re going to rip an innocent man\u2019s reputation apart because you can\u2019t deal with casual sex? Way to represent the sophisticated modern woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe answered the phone,\u201d she hissed, \u201cbefore he was done. He answered the fucking phone and started talking about an inspection at one of his properties. Midconversation he looked at me lying there waiting for him and he said, \u2018You can go.\u2019 Just like that. He treated me like a whore, only I didn\u2019t get paid. He didn\u2019t even offer me a drink.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. Jesus. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Deanna. I mean that sincerely. I\u2019ve met my share of assholes and it sounds like he was one to you. But what you\u2019re doing is wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not wrong if it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in the middle of this, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d I hit the end button and stood with my head bent, holding on to the counter while the room spun around me.</p><p>8</p><p>I FOUND GIDEON pacing like a caged panther behind his desk. He had an earpiece in his ear and he was either listening or on hold, since he wasn\u2019t talking. He caught my eye, his face hard and unyielding. Even dressed in boxer briefs, he seemed invulnerable. No one would be fool enough to take him for anything else. Physically, his power was evident in every slab of muscle. Beyond that, he radiated a ruthless menace that sent a chill down my spine.</p><p>The indolent, well-pleasured male I\u2019d eaten dinner with was gone, replaced by an urban predator who dominated his competition.</p><p>I left him to it.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s tablet was what I wanted, and I found it in his briefcase. It was password protected and I stared at the screen for a long while, startled to realize I was shaking. Everything I\u2019d feared was happening.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d</p><p>Looking up, I caught his eye as he appeared from the hallway.</p><p>\u201cThe password,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s angel.\u201d</p><p>Oh. All the rampant energy inside me vanished, leaving me feeling drained and tired. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told me about the lawsuit, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point in time there isn\u2019t a lawsuit, only the threat of one,\u201d he said without inflection. \u201cIan Hager wants money, I want nondisclosure. We\u2019ll settle privately and be done with it.\u201d</p><p>I sagged back into the couch, dropping the tablet onto my thighs. I watched as he walked toward me, drinking him in. It was so easy to become dazzled by his looks, enough that one could fail to see how alone he was at heart. But it was past time he learned to include me when he faced difficulties.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a nonstarter,\u201d I argued. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told me.\u201d</p><p>His arms crossed his chest. \u201cI meant to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou meant to?\u201d I shoved to my feet. \u201cI tell you I\u2019m broken up over my mother not telling me something and you don\u2019t say a word about your own secrets?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, he remained hard-faced and immovable. Then he cursed under his breath and unfolded. \u201cI came home early, planning to tell you, but then you told me about your mom and I thought that was enough shit for you to deal with in one day.\u201d</p><p>Deflating, I sank back onto the couch. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way a relationship works, ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just getting you back, Eva. I don\u2019t want all the time we spend together to be about what\u2019s wrong and fucked up in our lives!\u201d</p><p>I patted the cushion beside me. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>He took a seat on the coffee table in front of me instead, his spread legs bracketing mine. He caught my hands in both of his, lifting them to his lips to kiss my knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you. But if there\u2019s anything else you have to tell me, now would be the time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pressed forward, urging me to stretch out on the couch. Coming over me, he whispered, \u201cI\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>With everything going wrong, that was the one thing that was totally right.</p><p>It was enough.</p> <p>WE fell asleep on the couch, wrapped up in each other. I drifted in and out of consciousness, plagued by anxiety and thrown off my schedule by our earlier long nap. I was awake enough to sense the change in Gideon, hear his fast breathing, followed by the tightening of his grip on me. His body jerked powerfully, shaking me. His whimper pierced my heart.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d I wriggled around to face him, my agitated movements waking him. We\u2019d drifted off with the lights on and I was grateful that he woke to the brightness.</p><p>His heart was pounding beneath my palm, a fine mist of sweat blooming on his skin. \u201cWhat?\u201d he gasped. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were slipping into a nightmare, I think.\u201d I pressed soft kisses over his hot face, wishing my love could be enough to banish the memories.</p><p>He tried to sit up and I clung tighter to hold him down.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He ran a hand over me, searching. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d He fell back and covered his eyes with his forearm. \u201cI can\u2019t keep falling asleep with you. And I forgot to take my prescription. Goddamn it, I can\u2019t be this careless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I propped myself up on my elbow and ran my other hand down his chest. \u201cNo harm done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make light of this, Eva.\u201d He turned his head and looked at me, his gaze fierce. \u201cNot this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never.\u201d God, he looked so weary, with dark smudges under his eyes and deep grooves framing that wickedly sensual mouth.</p> <p>\u201cI killed a man,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s never been safe for you to be with me when I\u2019m sleeping, and that\u2019s even truer now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon ...\u201d I suddenly understood why he\u2019d been having his nightmares more frequently. He could rationalize what he\u2019d done, but that didn\u2019t alleviate the weight on his conscience.</p><p>I brushed the thick strands of hair off his forehead. \u201cIf you\u2019re struggling, you need to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you safe,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI never feel safer than when I\u2019m with you. I need you to stop beating yourself up for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t your life perfectly uncomplicated before I came along?\u201d I challenged.</p><p>He shot me a wry look. \u201cI seem to have a taste for complicated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen stop bitching about it. And don\u2019t move, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>I went to the master bedroom and swapped my garters, stockings, and bra for an oversized Cross Industries T-shirt. Pulling the velour throw off the foot of the bed, I went to Gideon\u2019s room and grabbed his medicine.</p><p>His gaze followed me as I dropped off the throw and prescription before heading to the kitchen for a bottle of water. In short order, I had him settled in, the both of us huddled together beneath the blanket and the majority of the lights turned off.</p><p>I snuggled closer, hooking my leg over his. The medication prescribed for Gideon\u2019s parasomnia was no cure, but he was religious about taking it. I loved him all the more for that dedication, because he did it for me. \u201cDo you know what you were dreaming about?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Whatever it was, I wish it were you instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d I laid my head on his chest, listening to his heartbeat slow. \u201cIf it had been a dream about me, what would it be like?\u201d</p><p>I felt him relax, sinking into the sofa and into me.</p><p>\u201cIt would be a cloudless day on a Caribbean beach,\u201d he murmured. \u201cA private beach, with a cabana on the white sand, enclosed on three sides with the view in front of us. I\u2019d have you spread out on a chaise longue. Naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be sun-warmed and lazy, your hair blowing in the breeze. You\u2019d be wearing that smile you give me after I\u2019ve made you come. We would have nowhere to go, no one waiting. Just the two of us, with all the time in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like paradise,\u201d I murmured, feeling his body growing heavier by the moment. \u201cI hope we swim naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm ...\u201d He yawned. \u201cI need to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a bucket of iced beer, too,\u201d I said, hoping to detain him long enough that he\u2019d fall asleep in my arms. \u201cWith lemons. I\u2019d squeeze the juice over your eight-pack and lick it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I love your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should dream about that, then. And all the naughty things it can do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me some examples.\u201d</p><p>I gave him plenty, talking in a low soothing voice, my hands stroking over his skin. He slipped away from me with a deep exhalation.</p><p>I held him close until long after the sun rose.</p><p>GIDEON slept until eleven. I\u2019d been strategizing for hours by then and he found me in his office, his desk littered with my notes and drawings.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I greeted him, lifting my lips for his kiss as he rounded the desk. He looked sleep-mussed and sexy in his boxer briefs. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>He looked over my work. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you caffeinated before I explain.\u201d I rubbed my hands together, excited. \u201cWant to grab a quick shower while I make you a cup of coffee? Then we\u2019ll dig in.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid over my face and he gave me a bemused smile. \u201cAll right. However, I suggest I grab you in the shower. Then we\u2019ll have coffee and dig in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave that thought\u2014and your libido\u2014for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out, remember?\u201d I prodded. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to drink too much, which makes me horny. Don\u2019t forget to take your vitamins, ace.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cWell, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. You\u2019ll be lucky if you can crawl out of bed tomorrow,\u201d I warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to stay hydrated, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d I returned my attention to his tablet, but had to look when he walked his very fine ass out of the room.</p><p>When I saw him again, he was damp-haired and wearing black sweats that hung low enough on his hips that I knew he was commando underneath. Forcing myself to focus on my plans, I gave him the desk chair and stood next to him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I began, \u201cfollowing the adage that the best defense is a good offense, I\u2019ve been taking a look at your public image.\u201d</p><p>He took a sip of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d I admonished. \u201cI didn\u2019t pay any attention to your personal life, since I\u2019m your personal life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He gave me an approving pat on my behind.</p><p>I stuck my tongue out at him. \u201cI\u2019m mostly thinking of how to combat a smear campaign focused on your temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt helps that I haven\u2019t previously been known as having one,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>Until you met me ... \u201cI\u2019m a terrible influence on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>That earned him a quick, smacking kiss to the temple. \u201cIt took me a ridiculous amount of time to find out about the Crossroads Foundation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know where to look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour search optimization really blows,\u201d I countered, pulling up the website. \u201cAnd there\u2019s only this splash page, which is pretty, but ridiculously bare. Where are the links and info about the charities that have benefited? Where\u2019s the About page on the foundation and what you hope to accomplish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA packet detailing all of that information is sent out to charities, hospitals, and universities twice a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Now, let me introduce you to the Internet. Why isn\u2019t the foundation tied to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrossroads isn\u2019t about me, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it isn\u2019t.\u201d I met his raised brows with my own and shoved a to-do list in front of him. \u201cWe\u2019re defusing the Deanna bomb before it blows. This website needs to be overhauled by Monday morning, with the addition of these pages and the information I\u2019ve outlined.\u201d</p><p>Gideon took a cursory glance at the paper, then picked up his mug and leaned back in his chair. I studiously focused on the mug and not his amazing torso.</p><p>\u201cThe Cross Industries site should cross-link with the foundation from your Bio page,\u201d I continued. \u201cWhich also needs an overhaul and updating.\u201d</p><p>I slid another paper in front of him.</p><p>He picked it up and began reading the biography I\u2019d drafted. \u201cThis was clearly written by someone in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be shy, Gideon. Sometimes you just have to be blunt and say, \u2018I rock.\u2019 There\u2019s so much more to you than a gorgeous face, hot body, and insane sex drive. But let\u2019s focus on the stuff I don\u2019t mind sharing with the world.\u201d</p><p>Flashing a grin, Gideon asked, \u201cHow much coffee have you had this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough to take you to the mat, so watch out.\u201d I bumped my hip into his arm. \u201cI also think you should consider a press release announcing the acquisition of La Rose Noir, so that your name and Giroux\u2019s are linked. Remind people that Corinne\u2014who you\u2019ve been seen around with so much lately\u2014has a husband, so Deanna can\u2019t paint you as a total bad guy for cutting Corinne off. If she decides to go that route.\u201d</p><p>He caught me unawares and pulled me into his lap. \u201cAngel, you\u2019re killing me. I\u2019ll do whatever you want, but you need to understand that Deanna has nothing. Ian Hager isn\u2019t going to risk a nice settlement to publicize his story. He\u2019ll sign the necessary releases, take the money, and go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix-Ninths isn\u2019t going to want their \u2018Golden\u2019 girl linked with another guy. Ruins the love story of the song. I\u2019ll be speaking to Kline and we\u2019ll get on the same page.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking to Brett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in business together,\u201d he pointed out, with a twist to his lips, \u201cso yes. And Deanna\u2019s using Cary\u2019s attack as a bluff. You and I both know there\u2019s nothing there.\u201d</p><p>I considered all that. \u201cYou think she\u2019s yanking my chain? Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m yours, and if she had a press pass to any event we attended together, she knows it.\u201d He leaned his forehead against mine. \u201cI can\u2019t hide how I feel around you, which is what\u2019s made you a target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hid it well enough from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour insecurity made you blind.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t argue with that. \u201cSo she freaks me out with the threat of the story. What does she achieve?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back. \u201cThink about it. The lid is about to blow on a scandal involving you and me. What\u2019s the swiftest way to defuse it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay away from me. That\u2019s what you\u2019d be advised to do. Distancing yourself from the source of a scandal is Crisis Management 101.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr do the opposite and marry you,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>I froze. \u201cIs that\u2014? Are you\u2014?\u201d Swallowing hard, I whispered, \u201cNot now. Not like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not like this,\u201d Gideon agreed, rubbing his lips back and forth over mine. \u201cWhen I propose, angel, trust me, you\u2019ll know it.\u201d</p><p>My throat was tight. I could only nod.</p><p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d he ordered gently. \u201cOne more time. Now, reassure me that\u2019s not panic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot really. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just ...\u201d I blurted it out in a rush. \u201cI want you to ask me when I can say yes.\u201d</p><p>Tension gripped his body. He leaned back, his eyes wounded beneath his frown. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t say yes now?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>His mouth thinned into a determined line. \u201cLay out what you need from me to make that happen.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arms around his shoulders, so that he\u2019d feel the connection between us. \u201cThere\u2019s so much I don\u2019t know. And it\u2019s not that I need to know more in order to make up my mind, because nothing could make me stop loving you. Nothing. I just feel like your hesitance to share things with me means that you\u2019re not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I followed that,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t take the risk that you won\u2019t want forever with me. I won\u2019t survive you, either, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>He made a frustrated noise. \u201cBe specific. Start with something.\u201d</p><p>The first thing that came to mind was what came out of my mouth, because I\u2019d been buried in his business all morning. \u201cVidal Records. Why are you in control of your stepfather\u2019s company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was going under.\u201d His jaw hardened. \u201cMy mother had already suffered through one financial meltdown; I wasn\u2019t going to let it happen to her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was able to convince her to talk them\u2014Chris and Christopher\u2014into taking the company public, then she sold Ireland\u2019s shares to me. In addition to what I acquired, I had the majority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I squeezed his hand. I\u2019d met both Christopher Vidal Sr.\u2014Chris\u2014and Christopher Vidal Jr. As alike as father and son were in appearance, with their dark copper waves and grayish-green eyes, I suspected they were very different men. Certainly I knew Christopher was a douche. I didn\u2019t think his father was. At least I hoped he wasn\u2019t. \u201cHow did that go over?\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s arch look was all the answer I needed. \u201cChris would ask for my advice, but Christopher always refused to take it and my stepdad wouldn\u2019t choose sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did what had to be done.\u201d I kissed his jaw. \u201cThank you for telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I was about to ask him more when I heard my phone ringing with my mother\u2019s ring tone. I was surprised it had taken her so long to call; I\u2019d taken my smartphone off mute around ten o\u2019clock. Groaning, I said, \u201cI have to get that.\u201d</p><p>He let me up, his hand stroking over my butt as I walked away. When I turned at the doorway to look back, he was poring over my notes and suggestions. I smiled.</p><p>By the time I reached my phone on the breakfast bar, it had stopped ringing, but it immediately started up again. \u201cMom,\u201d I answered, jumping in before she started flipping out. \u201cI\u2019m going to come over today, okay? And we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva. You have no idea how worried I\u2019ve been! You can\u2019t do this to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be over in an hour,\u201d I interjected. \u201cI just need to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep last night, I was so upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I didn\u2019t sleep much, either,\u201d I retorted. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about you all the time, Mom. I\u2019m the one who had her privacy violated. You\u2019re just the one who got caught doing it.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>It was rare for me to be assertive with my mother because she always seemed so fragile, but it was time to redefine our relationship or we\u2019d end up not having one. I looked to my wrist for the time, remembered I didn\u2019t have a watch anymore, and glanced at the cable box by the television instead. \u201cI\u2019ll be over around one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send a car for you,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThank you. See you soon.\u201d I hung up.</p><p>I was about to drop my phone back into my purse when it beeped with a text from Shawna: What r u wearing 2nite?</p><p>A number of ideas ran through my mind, from casual to outrageous. Even though I was inclined toward outrageous, I was checked by thoughts of Deanna. I had to think about what I\u2019d look like in the tabloids. LBD, I replied, thinking the little black dress was a classic for a reason. Wild heels. Too much jewelry.</p><p>Got it! See u at 7, she texted back.</p><p>On the way to the bedroom, I paused by Gideon\u2019s office and lounged against the doorjamb to watch him. I could watch him for hours; he was such a joy to look at. And I found him very sexy when he was focused.</p><p>He glanced up at me with a soft curve to his lips, and I knew he\u2019d been aware of my staring. \u201cThis is all very good,\u201d he praised, gesturing at his desktop. \u201cEspecially considering you pulled this together in a matter of hours.\u201d</p><p>I preened a little, thrilled to have impressed a businessman whose acumen had made him one of the most successful individuals in the world.</p><p>\u201cI want you at Cross Industries, Eva.\u201d</p><p>My body reacted to the unwavering determination in his voice, which reminded me of when he\u2019d said, I want to fuck you, Eva, when he\u2019d first come on to me.</p><p>\u201cI want you there, too,\u201d I said. \u201cOn your desk.\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed. \u201cWe can celebrate that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like my job. I like my co-workers. I like knowing I\u2019ve earned every milestone I reach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can give you that and more.\u201d His fingers tapped against the side of his coffee mug. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you went with advertising because you like the spin. Why not public relations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much like propaganda. At least with advertising, you know the bias right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned crisis management this morning. And clearly\u201d\u2014he gestured at his desk\u2014\u201cyou have an aptitude for it. Let me exploit it.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms. \u201cCrisis management is PR and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a problem solver. I can make you a fixer. Give you real, time-sensitive problems to solve. Keep you challenged and active.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d I tapped my foot. \u201cHow many crises do you have in a given week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re intrigued. I can see it on your face.\u201d</p><p>Straightening, I pointed out, \u201cYou have people to handle that kind of stuff already.\u201d</p><p>Gideon leaned back in his chair and smiled. \u201cI want more. So do you. Let\u2019s have it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like the devil himself, you know that? And you\u2019re stubborn as hell. I\u2019m telling you, working together would be a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working together just fine now.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cBecause you agreed with my assessment and suggestions, plus you had me sitting in your lap and you copped a feel of my ass. It\u2019s not going to be the same when we\u2019re not on the same page and arguing about it in your office in front of other people. Then we\u2019ll have to bring that irritation home and deal with it here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can agree to leave work at the door.\u201d His eyes slid over me, lingering on my legs, which were mostly bared by my silk robe. \u201cI won\u2019t have any problem thinking of more enjoyable things.\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I backed out of the room. \u201cSex maniac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love making love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d I complained, having no defense against that. No defense against him.</p><p>Gideon grinned. \u201cI never said I play fair.\u201d</p><p>WHEN I entered my apartment fifteen minutes later, it felt weird. The floor plan was identical to Gideon\u2019s next door, but reversed. The blending of his furniture and mine had helped to make his space feel like ours but had the side effect of making me feel like my home was ... alien.</p><p>\u201cHey, Eva.\u201d</p><p>I looked around and saw Trey in the kitchen, pouring milk into two glasses. \u201cHey,\u201d I greeted him back. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>He looked it. His blond hair, which was usually unruly, had been nicely styled\u2014one of Cary\u2019s talents. Trey\u2019s hazel eyes were bright, his smile charming beneath his once-broken nose.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you around more,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI rearranged my schedule a bit.\u201d He held up the milk and I shook my head, so he put it away. \u201cHow are you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDodging reporters, hoping my boss gets engaged, planning on setting one parent straight, fitting in a phone call to the other parent, and looking forward to hitting the town with the girls tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d I smiled. \u201cHow\u2019s school? And work?\u201d</p> <p>I knew Trey was studying to be a veterinarian and juggling jobs to pay for it. One of those gigs was as a photographer\u2019s assistant, which was how he\u2019d met Cary.</p><p>He winced. \u201cBoth brutal, but it\u2019ll pay off someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should have another movie-and-pizza night when you get a chance.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help rooting for Trey in the tug-of-war between him and Tatiana. It could just be me, but she\u2019d always seemed very adversarial toward me. And I didn\u2019t like the way she\u2019d put herself forward when she met Gideon.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll see what Cary\u2019s schedule is like.\u201d</p><p>I regretted bringing it up to Trey first instead of Cary, because some of the light left his eyes. I knew he was thinking about Cary having to fit him in between time with Tatiana. \u201cWell, if he\u2019s not up for it, we can always go out without him.\u201d</p> <p>His mouth tilted up on one side. \u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>AT ten minutes to one, I exited the lobby to find Clancy already waiting for me. He waved aside the doorman and opened the town car door for me, but no one looking at him would believe he was just a driver. He carried himself like the weapon he was, and in all the years I\u2019d known him, I couldn\u2019t recall ever seeing him smile.</p><p>Once he\u2019d resumed his seat behind the wheel, he turned off the police scanner he routinely listened to and pulled his sunglasses down enough to catch my eye in the rearview mirror. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than my mom, I\u2019m guessing.\u201d</p><p>He was too professional to give anything away in his expression. Instead, he slid his shades back into place and synced my phone to the car\u2019s Bluetooth to start my playlist. Then he pulled away from the curb.</p><p>Reminded of his thoughtfulness, I said, \u201cHey. I\u2019m sorry I took it out on you. You were doing a job and you didn\u2019t deserve to get bitched at for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not just a job, Miss Tramell.\u201d</p><p>I was silent for a bit, absorbing that. Clancy and I had a distant, polite association. We saw each other quite a bit because he was responsible for getting me to and from my Krav Maga classes in Brooklyn. But I\u2019d never really thought about him having any sort of personal stake in my safety, although it made sense. Clancy was a guy who took pride in his work.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that one thing, though,\u201d I clarified. \u201cA lot of stuff happened before you and Stanton ever came into the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology accepted.\u201d</p><p>The brusque reply was so like him that it made me smile.</p><p>Settling more comfortably into the seat, I looked out the window at the city I\u2019d adopted and loved passionately. On the sidewalk beside me, strangers stood shoulder to shoulder over a tiny counter, eating individual slices of pizza. As close as they were, they were distant, each displaying a New Yorker\u2019s ability to be an island in a crashing tide of people. Pedestrians flowed past them in both directions, avoiding a man pushing religious flyers and the tiny dog at his feet.</p><p>The vitality of the city had a frenetic pulse that made time seem to move faster here than anywhere else. It was such a contrast to the lazy sensuality of Southern California, where my dad lived and I\u2019d gone to school. New York was a dominatrix on the prowl, cracking a mean whip and tantalizing with every vice.</p><p>My purse vibrated against my hip and I reached into it for my phone. A quick glance at the screen told me it was my dad. Saturdays were our weekly catch-up days and I always looked forward to our chats, but I was almost inclined to let the call go to voice mail until I was in a better frame of mind. I was too aggravated with my mom, and my dad had already been overly concerned about me since he\u2019d left New York after his last visit.</p> <p>He\u2019d been with me when the detectives had come to my apartment to tell me Nathan was in New York. They\u2019d dropped that bomb before they revealed that Nathan had been murdered, and I hadn\u2019t been able to hide my fear at the thought of him being so close. My dad had been after me about my violent reaction ever since.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I answered, mostly because I didn\u2019t want to be at odds with both my parents at the same time. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissing you,\u201d he replied in the deep, confident voice I loved. My dad was the most perfect man I knew\u2014darkly handsome, self-assured, smart, and rock solid. \u201cHow \u2019bout you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t complain too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, complain just a little. I\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>I laughed softly. \u201cMom\u2019s just driving me a little batty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she do now?\u201d he asked, with a note of warm indulgence in his voice.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been sticking her nose in my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Sometimes we parents do that when we\u2019re worried about our babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never done that,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done it yet,\u201d he qualified. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t, if I\u2019m worried enough. I just hope I could convince you to forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m on my way to Mom\u2019s now. Let\u2019s see how convincing she can be. It would help if she\u2019d admit she\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Right?\u201d I sighed. \u201cCan I call you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Is everything all right, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. Cop instincts plus daddy instincts meant I rarely got anything by Victor Reyes. \u201cYep. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m almost to Mom\u2019s now. I\u2019ll let you know how it goes. Oh, and my boss might be getting engaged. Anyway, I have stuff to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may have to stop by the station in the morning, but you can reach me on my cell no matter what. I love you.\u201d</p><p>I felt a sudden surge of homesickness. As much as I loved New York and my new life, I missed my dad a lot. \u201cI love you, too, Daddy. Talk to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Killing the call, I looked for my wristwatch, and its absence reminded me of the confrontation ahead. I was upset with my mother about the past, but was most concerned with the future. She\u2019d hovered over me for so long because of Nathan, I wasn\u2019t sure she knew any other way to behave.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I leaned forward, needing to clarify something that was bothering me. \u201cThat day when me, Mom, and Megumi were walking back to the Crossfire and Mom freaked out ... Did you guys see Nathan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d been there before and got his ass beat by Gideon Cross. Why would he go back?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me through the mirror. \u201cMy guess? To be seen. Once he made himself known, he kept the pressure up. Likely, he expected to frighten you and managed to scare Mrs. Stanton instead. Effective in either case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one told me,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cI can\u2019t get over that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted you frightened. No one wanted to give him that satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>Oh. I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way.</p><p>\u201cMy big regret,\u201d he went on, \u201cis not keeping an eye on Cary. I miscalculated, and he paid the price.\u201d</p><p>Gideon hadn\u2019t seen Nathan\u2019s attack on Cary coming, either. And God knew I felt guilty about it, too\u2014my friendship was what had put Cary in danger to begin with.</p><p>But I was really touched that Clancy cared. I could hear it in his gruff voice. He was right; I wasn\u2019t just a job to him. He was a good man who gave his all to everything he did. Which made me wonder: How much did he have left over for the other things in his life?</p><p>\u201cDo you have a girlfriend, Clancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m married.\u201d</p><p>I felt like an ass for not knowing that. What was she like, the woman married to such a hard, somber man? A man who wore a jacket year-round to hide the sidearm he was never without. Did he soften for her and show her tenderness? Was he fierce about protecting her? Would he kill for her?</p><p>\u201cHow far would you go to keep her safe?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>We slowed at a light and he turned his head to look at me. \u201cHow far wouldn\u2019t I go?\u201d</p><p>9</p><p>\u201cWHAT WAS WRONG with that one?\u201d Megumi asked, watching the guy in question walk away. \u201cHe had dimples.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and polished off my vodka and cranberry. Primal, the fourth stop on our club-hopping list, was pumping. The line to get in wrapped around the block and the guitar-heavy tracks suited the club\u2019s name, the music pounding through the darkened space with a primitive, seductive beat. The d\u00e9cor was an eclectic mix of brushed metals and dark woods, with the multihued lighting creating animal-print silhouettes.</p><p>It should\u2019ve been too much, but like everything Gideon, it skirted the edge of decadent excess without falling over it. The atmosphere was one of hedonistic abandon and it did crazy things to my alcohol-fueled libido. I couldn\u2019t sit still, my feet tapping restlessly on the rungs of my chair.</p><p>Megumi\u2019s roommate, Lacey, groaned at the ceiling, her dark blond hair arranged in a disheveled updo I admired. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you flirt with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might,\u201d Megumi said, looking flushed, bright-eyed, and very hot in a slinky gold halter dress. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll commit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want out of commitment?\u201d Shawna asked, nursing a drink as fiery red as her hair. \u201cMonogamy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonogamy is overrated.\u201d Lacey slid off her bar stool at our tallboy table and wriggled her butt, the rhinestones on her jeans glittering in the semidarkness of the club.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d Megumi pouted. \u201cI happen to like monogamy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Michael sleeping with other women?\u201d I asked, leaning forward so I didn\u2019t have to shout.</p><p>I had to lean back right away to make room for the waitress, who brought another round and cleared the previous one away. The club\u2019s uniform of black stiletto boots and hot pink strapless minidresses stood out in the crowd, making it easy to know who to flag. It was also really sexy\u2014as was the staff wearing them. Had Gideon had any hand in picking the outfit? And if so, had anyone modeled it for him? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Megumi picked up her new drink and sucked at her straw with a sad face. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to ask.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing one of the four shot glasses in the center of the table and a lime wedge, I shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s do shots and dance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah!\u201d Shawna tossed back her shot of Patr\u00f3n without waiting for the rest of us, then shoved a lime in her mouth. Dropping the juiceless wedge into her empty glass, she shot us all a look. \u201cHurry up, laggers.\u201d</p> <p>I went next, shuddering as the tequila washed away the tang of cranberry. Lacey and Megumi went together, toasting each other with a loud \u201cKanpai!\u201d before downing theirs.</p><p>We hit the dance floor en masse, Shawna leading the way in her electric blue dress that was damn near as bright under the black lights as the club uniform. We were swallowed into the mass of writhing dancers, quickly finding ourselves pressed between steamy male bodies.</p><p>I let go, giving myself over to the grinding beat of the music and the sultry atmosphere of the rocking club. Lifting my hands in the air, I swayed, releasing the lingering tension from the long, pointless afternoon with my mother. At some point, I\u2019d lost my trust in her. As much as she promised that things would be different without Nathan, I found I couldn\u2019t believe her. She\u2019d crossed the line too many times.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d someone yelled by my ear.</p><p>I looked over my shoulder at the dark-haired guy curved against my back. \u201cThanks!\u201d</p> <p>It was a lie, of course. My hair clung to my sweat-damp temples and neck in a sticky tangle. I didn\u2019t care. The music raged on, songs sliding into each other.</p><p>I reveled in the utter sensuality of the venue and the shameless drive for casual sex that everyone seemed to exude. I was pressed between a couple\u2014the girlfriend at my back and her boyfriend at my front\u2014when I spotted someone I knew. He must have seen me first, because he was already working his way toward me.</p><p>\u201cMartin!\u201d I yelled, breaking out of my bump-and-grind sandwich. In the past, I\u2019d only crossed paths with Stanton\u2019s nephew during the holidays. We\u2019d met up once since I moved to New York, but I hoped we would eventually see each other more.</p><p>\u201cEva, hi!\u201d He caught me up in a hug, then pulled back to check me out. \u201cYou look fantastic. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a drink!\u201d I shouted, feeling too parched to hold a conversation at the decibel level required in the crowd.</p><p>Grabbing my hand, he led me out of the crush and I pointed to my table. The moment we sat down, the waitress was there with another vodka and cranberry.</p> <p>It\u2019d been that way all night, although I\u2019d noted that my drinks were getting darker as the hours progressed, a sure sign that the vodka-to-cranberry ratio was slowly becoming more cranberry than not. I knew that was deliberate and was suitably impressed by Gideon\u2019s ability to carry his instructions from club to club. Since no one was stopping me from supplementing with shots, I didn\u2019t mind too much.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I began, taking a welcome sip before rolling the icy-cold tumbler across my forehead. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He grinned, looking quite handsome in a camel-hued V-neck T-shirt and black jeans. His dark hair wasn\u2019t nearly the length of Gideon\u2019s, but it fell attractively across his forehead, framing eyes that I knew were green although no one would be able to tell in the club\u2019s lighting. \u201cHow\u2019s the ad biz treating you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love my job!\u201d</p><p>He laughed at my enthusiasm. \u201cIf only we could all say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked working with Stanton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Like the money, too. Can\u2019t say I love the job, though.\u201d</p><p>The waitress brought his scotch on the rocks, and we clinked glasses.</p> <p>\u201cWho are you here with?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cA couple friends\u201d\u2014he looked around\u2014\u201cwho are lost in the jungle. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d I caught Lacey\u2019s eye on the dance floor and she gave me two thumbs up. \u201cAre you seeing anyone, Martin?\u201d</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like blondes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hitting on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d I raised my brows at Lacey and jerked my head toward Martin. She looked surprised for a minute, then grinned and rushed over.</p><p>I introduced them and felt pretty good about the way they hit it off. Martin was always fun and charming, and Lacey was vivacious and attractive in a unique way\u2014more charismatic than beautiful.</p><p>Megumi made her way back over and we did another round of shots before Martin asked Lacey to dance.</p><p>\u201cYou got any other hot guys in your pocket?\u201d Megumi asked, as the couple melted away.</p><p>I was wishing I had my smartphone in my pocket. \u201cYou\u2019re miserable, girl.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me for a long minute. Then her lips twisted. \u201cI\u2019m drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too. Want another shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>We did a shot each, polishing them off just as Shawna came back with Lacey, Martin, and his two friends, Kurt and Andre. Kurt was gorgeous, with sandy brown hair, square jaw, and cocky smile. Andre was cute, too, with a mischievous twinkle in his dark eyes and shoulder-length dreadlocks. He focused on Megumi, which cheered her right up.</p><p>Our expanded group was roaring with laughter in no time.</p><p>\u201cAnd when Kurt came back from the bathroom,\u201d Martin finished his story, \u201che sacked the whole restaurant.\u201d</p><p>Andre and Martin started howling. Kurt threw limes at them.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I asked, smiling even though I didn\u2019t get the punch line.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s when you leave your sac hanging out of your fly,\u201d Andre explained. \u201cAt first people can\u2019t figure out what it is they\u2019re seeing, then they try to figure out if you just somehow don\u2019t know your nads are swinging in the breeze. No one says a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d Shawna nearly fell off her chair.</p><p>We got so rowdy, our waitress asked us to tone it down\u2014with a smile. I caught her by the elbow before she walked away. \u201cIs there a phone I can use?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ask one of the bartenders,\u201d she said. \u201cTell them Dennis\u2014he\u2019s the manager\u2014okayed it and they\u2019ll hook you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I slid off my seat as she moved on to another table. I had no idea who Dennis was, but I\u2019d just been going with the flow all night, knowing Gideon would\u2019ve set up everything flawlessly. \u201cAnyone up for water?\u201d I asked the group.</p><p>I got booed and pelted with wadded-up napkins. Laughing, I went to the bar and waited for an opening to ask for Pellegrino and the phone. I dialed Gideon\u2019s cell number, since it was the one I had memorized. I figured it was safe since I was calling from a public place he owned.</p><p>\u201cCross,\u201d he answered briskly.</p><p>\u201cHi, ace.\u201d I leaned into the bar and covered my other ear with my hand. \u201cI\u2019m drunk-dialing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d His voice changed for me, slowed and grew warm. It captivated me even over the music. \u201cAre you having a good time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I miss you. Did you take your vitamins?\u201d</p><p>He had a smile in his voice when he asked, \u201cAre you horny, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your fault! This club is like Viagra. I\u2019m hot and sweaty and dripping in pheromones. And I\u2019ve been a bad girl, you know. Dancing like I\u2019m single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad girls get punished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should be really bad, then. Make the punishment worth it.\u201d</p><p>He growled. \u201cCome home and be bad with me.\u201d</p><p>The thought of him at home, ready for me, made me even more eager for him. \u201cI\u2019m stuck here \u2019til the girls are done, which looks to be a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can come to you. Within twenty minutes, you could have my cock inside you. Do you want that?\u201d</p><p>I glanced around the club, my entire body vibrating with the hard-driving music. Imagining him here, fucking me in this no-holds-barred place, made me squirm with anticipation. \u201cYes. I want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see the skywalk?\u201d</p><p>Turning around, I looked up and saw the suspended walkway hugging the walls. Dancers dry-fucked to the music from twenty feet above the dance floor. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a section where it wraps around a mirrored corner. I\u2019ll meet you there. Be ready, Eva,\u201d he ordered. \u201cI want your cunt naked and wet when I find you.\u201d</p><p>I shivered at the familiar command, knowing it meant he\u2019d be rough and impatient. Just what I wanted. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel, a crowd of millions couldn\u2019t hide you from me. I found you once. I\u2019ll always find you.\u201d</p><p>Longing seared my veins. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>Reaching over to replace the receiver on the business side of the bar, I grabbed my mineral water and drank until the bottle was empty. Then I headed to the bathroom, where I waited in line forever in order to get ready for Gideon. I was giddy with booze and excitement, so thrilled that my boyfriend\u2014arguably one of the busiest men in the world\u2014would drop everything to ... service me.</p><p>I licked my lips, shifting on my feet.</p><p>I hurried through the ladies\u2019 room to a stall, ditching my panties before hitting the sink and mirror to freshen up with a damp napkin. Most of my makeup had melted off, leaving me with smudged eyes and cheeks reddened by heat and exertion. My hair was a mess, both wildly mussed and wet around my face.</p><p>Oddly, I didn\u2019t look half bad. I looked sexual and ready.</p><p>Lacey was in line and I stopped by her as I inched my way through the crowded bathroom threshold.</p><p>\u201cHaving fun?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d She grinned. \u201cThanks for introducing me to your cousin.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother to correct her. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Can I ask you something? About Michael?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, she said, \u201cGo for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went out with him first. What didn\u2019t you like about him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo chemistry. Good-looking guy. Successful. Sadly, I didn\u2019t want to fuck him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToss him back,\u201d the girl next in line interjected.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I could totally respect not progressing with a relationship lacking sexual heat, but I was still bothered by the situation. I didn\u2019t like seeing Megumi so bummed. \u201cI\u2019m going to go grind against some hot guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHit it, girl,\u201d Lacey said with a nod.</p><p>I took off in search of the stairs to the skywalk. I found them guarded by a bouncer policing the number of bodies allowed to venture up. There was a line and I eyed it with dismay.</p><p>As I debated how much of a delay I was facing, the bouncer unfolded his powerful arms from across his chest and pressed his earpiece deeper into his ear with one hand, clearly focusing on whatever was being relayed through his receiver. He could have been Samoan or Maori, with dark caramel skin, a shaved head, and massive barrel chest and biceps. He had a baby face and was downright adorable when his fierce scowl was replaced by a wide grin.</p><p>His hand dropped away from his ear and he crooked a finger at me. \u201cYou Eva?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He reached behind him and unhooked the velvet rope blocking the stairway. \u201cHead on up.\u201d</p><p>A roar of protests came from those who were waiting. I offered an apologetic smile, then raced up the metal stairs as fast as my heels would allow. When I reached the top, a female bouncer let me through and pointed to my left. I saw the corner Gideon had mentioned, where two mirrored walls connected and the skywalk wrapped around it in an L shape.</p><p>I weaved my way through writhing bodies, my pulse rate increasing with every step. The music was less loud up here and the air more humid. Sweat glistened on exposed skin and the elevation lent a sense of danger, even though the glass railing surrounding the skywalk was shoulder-high. I was almost to the mirrored section when I was caught around the waist and pulled back into a man\u2019s rolling hips.</p><p>Looking over my shoulder, I saw the guy I\u2019d danced with before, the one who\u2019d called me beautiful. I smiled and started dancing, closing my eyes to lose myself in the music. When his hands started to slide over my waist, I caught them, pinning them to my hips with my own. He laughed and dipped his knees, aligning his body with mine.</p><p>We were three songs out before I felt the ripple of awareness that told me Gideon was nearby. The electrical charge swept over my skin, heightening every sensation. Abruptly the music was louder, the temperature hotter, the sensuality of the club more arousing.</p><p>I smiled and opened my eyes, spotting him arrowing toward me. I was instantly hot for him, my mouth watering as I ate up the sight of him in a dark T-shirt and jeans, his hair pulled back from that breathtaking face. No one seeing him would put him together with Gideon Cross, the international mogul. This guy appeared younger and rougher, distinctive only for his incredible smokin\u2019 hotness. I licked my lips with anticipation, leaning into the guy behind me and rubbing my ass voluptuously into the next roll of his hips.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s hands fisted at his sides, his posture aggressive and predatory. He didn\u2019t slow as he neared me, his body on a collision course with mine. Turning, I met him the last step, surging into him. Our bodies crashed together, my arms encircling his shoulders and my hands pulling his head down so I could take his mouth in a wet, hungry kiss.</p><p>With a growl, Gideon cupped my ass and yanked me up hard against him, my feet leaving the floor. He bruised my lips with the ferocity of his passion, his tongue filling my mouth with hard, deep plunges that warned me of the violent shades of his lust.</p><p>The guy I\u2019d been dancing with came up behind me, his hands in my hair and his lips at my shoulder blade.</p><p>Gideon pulled back, his face a gorgeous mask of fury. \u201cGet lost.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the guy and gave a shrug. \u201cThanks for the dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, beautiful.\u201d He caught the hips of a girl walking by and moved away.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d With a growl, Gideon pressed me into the mirror, his hard thigh thrust between my legs. \u201cYou\u2019re a bad girl.\u201d</p> <p>Shameless and eager, I rode him, gasping at the feel of denim against my tender sex. \u201cOnly for you.\u201d</p><p>He gripped my bare buttocks beneath my dress, spurring me on. His teeth caught the shell of my ear, my silver chandelier earrings brushing my neck. He was breathing hard, low rumbles vibrating in his chest. He smelled so good and my body responded, trained to associate his scent with the wildest, hottest of pleasures.</p><p>We danced, straining together, our bodies moving as if there were no clothes between us. The music pounded around us, through us, and he moved his amazing body to it, captivating me. We\u2019d danced before, ballroom style, but never like this. This sweaty, dirty grinding. I was surprised, turned on, fell even deeper in love.</p><p>Gideon watched me with a hooded gaze, seducing me with his need and his uninhibited moves. I was lost in him, wrapped around him, clawing to get closer.</p><p>He kneaded my breast through the thin black jersey of my spaghetti-strapped dress. The built-in shelf bra was no barrier. His fingers stroked, then tugged the hardened point of my nipple.</p><p>As I moaned, my head fell back against the mirror. Dozens of people surrounded us and I didn\u2019t care. I just needed his hands on me, his body against mine, his breath on my skin.</p><p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d he said harshly, \u201cright here.\u201d</p><p>I quivered at the thought. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want them to watch. You want them to see me fuck my cock into your greedy little cunt until you\u2019re dripping in cum. You want me to prove you\u2019re mine.\u201d His teeth sank into the top of my shoulder. \u201cMake you feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to prove that you\u2019re mine,\u201d I shot back, shoving my hands into the pockets of his jeans to feel his hard ass flex. \u201cI want everyone to know it.\u201d</p><p>Gideon hitched one arm beneath my rear and lifted me, his other hand slapping flat against a pad on the wall by the mirror. I heard a faint beeping, and then a door opened in the mirror at my back and we stepped into almost total darkness. The concealed entrance closed behind us, muting the music. We were in an office, with a desk, a seating area, and a 180-degree view of the club through two-way mirrors.</p><p>He put me down and spun me, pinning my front to the transparent side of the glass. The club was spread out before me, the dancers on the skywalk only inches away. His hands were up my skirt and in the bodice of my dress, fingers sliding into my cleft and rolling my nipple.</p><p>I was snared. His big body covered mine, his arms around me, torso to hips, his teeth in my shoulder holding me in place. He owned me.</p><p>\u201cTell me if it\u2019s too much,\u201d he murmured, his lips drifting up my throat. \u201cSafeword before I scare you.\u201d</p><p>Emotion flooded me, gratitude for this man who always\u2014always\u2014thought of me first. \u201cI provoked you. I want to be taken. I want you wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so hot for it,\u201d he purred, pumping two fingers quick and hard into me. \u201cYou were made for fucking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade for you,\u201d I gasped, my breath fogging the glass. I was on fire for him, my desire pouring out from the inside, from the well of love I couldn\u2019t contain.</p><p>\u201cDid you forget that tonight?\u201d His hand left my sex to reach between us and yank open his fly. \u201cWhen other men were touching you, rubbing against you? Did you forget you\u2019re mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. I never forget.\u201d My eyes closed as his erection, so stiff and warm, rested heavily against the bare cheek of my ass. He was hot for it, too. Hot for me. \u201cI called you. Wanted you.\u201d</p><p>His lips moved over my skin, forging a scorching trail to my mouth. \u201cTake me, then, angel,\u201d he coaxed, his tongue touching mine with teasing licks. \u201cPut me inside you.\u201d</p><p>Arching my back, I reached between my legs, my hand circling his thickness. He bent his knees, lining himself up for me.</p><p>I paused, turning my head to press my cheek to his. I loved that I could have this with him ... be this way with him. Circling my hips, I stroked my clit with the wide crest of his cock, making him slick with my arousal.</p><p>Gideon squeezed my swollen breasts, plumping them. \u201cLean into me, Eva. Push away from the glass.\u201d</p><p>With my palm to the two-way mirror, I pushed back, my head pillowed on his shoulder. He wrapped my throat with his hand, gripped my hip, and thrust so hard into me that my feet left the floor. He held me there, suspended in his arms, filled with his cock, his groan cascading over my senses.</p><p>On the other side of the glass, the club raged on. I abandoned myself to the wickedly intense pleasure of seemingly exhibitionist sex, an illicit fantasy that always drove us wild.</p><p>I writhed, unable to bear the decadent pressure. My hand between my legs reached lower, cradled his sac. He was tight and full, so ready. And inside me ... \u201cOh God. You\u2019re so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was made to fuck you,\u201d he whispered, sending shivers of delight through me.</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d I set both hands on the glass, beyond needy. \u201cDo it now.\u201d</p><p>Gideon lowered me to my feet, his hands steadying me as I bent at the waist, opening myself to him so he could slide deep. A low, keening cry escaped as he seized my hips and angled me, knowing just how to position me to make me fit him. He was too big for me, too long and thick. The stretching was intense. Delicious.</p><p>My core trembled, clenching desperately around him. He made a rough sound of pleasure, pulling out just a little before sliding back slowly. Again, then again. The wide crest of his cock massaging the bundle of nerves deep inside me that only he\u2019d ever reached.</p><p>Fingers clawing restlessly, leaving steamy trails on the glass, I moaned. I was achingly aware of the distant throb of the music and the mass of people I saw as clearly as if they were in the room with us.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, angel,\u201d he said urgently. \u201cLet me hear how much you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d My legs shook violently on a particularly skillful stroke, my weight supported only by the glass and his secure hold.</p><p>I was unbearably excited, greedy, feeling both the submission of my pose and the dominance of being serviced. I could do nothing but take what Gideon gave me, the rhythmic slide and retreat, the sounds of his hunger. The scrape of his jeans against my thighs told me he\u2019d pushed them down only far enough to free his cock, a sign of impatience that thrilled me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One of his hands left my hip, then returned to rest atop my ass. I felt the pad of his thumb, wet from his mouth, rubbing over the tight pucker of my rear.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I begged, afraid I\u2019d lose my mind. But it wasn\u2019t my safeword\u2014Crossfire\u2014and I flowered open for him, giving way under the questing pressure.</p><p>He growled as he claimed that dark place. He came over me, his other hand moving to finger my sex, to spread me and rub my pulsing clit. \u201cMine,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>It was too much. I came with a scream, shaking violently, my hands squeaking on the glass as my sweaty palms slipped. He began pounding the ecstasy into me, his thumb in my rear an irresistible torment, his clever fingers on my clit driving me insane. One orgasm rolled into another, my sex rippling along his plunging cock.</p><p>He made a rough sound of desire and swelled inside me, chasing his climax. I gasped, \u201cDon\u2019t come! Not yet.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s tempo slowed, his breathing harsh in the darkness. \u201cHow do you want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to watch you.\u201d I moaned as my core tightened again. \u201cWant to see your face.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew and pulled me upright. Turned and lifted me. Pressed me to the glass and thrust hard into me. In that moment of possession, he gave me what I needed. The glazed look of helpless pleasure, the instant of vulnerability before the lust seized his control.</p><p>\u201cYou want to watch me lose it,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I pulled the straps from my shoulders and exposed my breasts, lifting and squeezing them, toying with my nipples. The glass was vibrating with the beat against my back; Gideon was vibrating against my front, his body barely reined.</p><p>I pressed my lips to his, absorbing his panting breaths. \u201cLet go,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Holding me effortlessly, he withdrew, dragging the thick, heavy crown across the hypersensitive tissues inside me. Then he powered into me, taking me to my limits.</p><p>\u201cAh, God.\u201d I writhed in his grip. \u201cYou\u2019re so deep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>He fucked me hard, thrusting like a man possessed. I held on, trembling, spread wide for the relentless drives of his rigid penis. He was lost to instinct, the insistent desire to mate. Raw moans spilled from him, making me so hot and slick that my body offered no resistance, welcoming his desperate need.</p><p>It was rough and messy and sexy as hell. His neck arched and he gasped my name.</p><p>\u201cCome for me,\u201d I demanded, tightening around him, squeezing.</p><p>His whole body jerked hard, then shuddered. His mouth twisted in a grimace of agonized bliss, his eyes losing their focus as the climax built.</p><p>Gideon came with an animal roar, spurting so hard I felt it. Over and over, heating me from the inside with thick washes of semen.</p><p>My lips were all over him, my arms and legs holding tight.</p><p>He collapsed against me, his lungs heaving for breath.</p><p>Still coming.</p> <p>10</p><p>THE FIRST THING I saw when I woke up Sunday morning was an amber bottle labeled HANGOVER CURE in an old-fashioned font. A raffia bow adorned the neck and a cork stopper kept the stomach-turning contents safe. The \u201ccure\u201d worked, as I\u2019d learned the last time Gideon had given me the stuff, but the sight of it reminded me of how much alcohol I\u2019d consumed the night before.</p><p>Squeezing my eyes shut, I groaned and buried my head in the pillow, willing myself back to sleep.</p><p>The bed shifted. Warm, firm lips drifted down my bare spine. \u201cGood morning, angel mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound ridiculously pleased with yourself,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cPleased with you, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was referring to your crisis management suggestions, but of course the sex was phenomenal, as always.\u201d His hand slid beneath the sheet that was pooled around my waist and he squeezed my ass.</p><p>I lifted my head and found him propped against the headboard beside me with his laptop on his thighs. He looked mouthwatering, as usual, completely relaxed in drawstring lounging pants. I was certain I was looking far less attractive. I\u2019d taken the limo home with the girls, then met up with Gideon at his apartment. It was nearly dawn before I\u2019d finished with him and I\u2019d been so tired, I crashed with hair still wet from a hasty shower.</p><p>A tingle of pleasure moved through me at finding him next to me. He\u2019d slept in the guest room, and he had an office to work in. The fact that he chose to work in the bed I slept in meant he\u2019d just wanted to be near me, even while I was unconscious.</p><p>I turned my head to look at the bedside clock, but my gaze snagged on my wrist instead.</p><p>\u201cGideon ...\u201d The watch that had been placed on my arm while I slept enchanted me. The Art Deco\u2013inspired timepiece sparkled with hundreds of tiny diamonds. The band was a creamy satin and the mother-of-pearl face was branded with both Patek Philippe and Tiffany &amp; Co. \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are only twenty-five of those in the world, which isn\u2019t nearly as unique as you are, but then, what is?\u201d He smiled down at me.</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d I pushed up onto my knees. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He shoved his laptop aside in time for me to straddle him and hug him tightly.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I murmured, touched by his thoughtfulness. He would\u2019ve gone out for it while I was at my mother\u2019s or maybe just after I left with the girls.</p><p>\u201cUmm. Tell me how to earn one of these naked hugs every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be you, ace.\u201d I rubbed my cheek against his. \u201cYou\u2019re all I need.\u201d</p><p>I slid out of bed and padded over to the bathroom with the small amber bottle in my hand. I guzzled the contents down with a shudder, brushed my teeth and hair, and then washed my face. I pulled on a robe and returned to the bedroom, finding Gideon gone and his laptop lying open in the middle of the bed.</p><p>I passed him in his office, seeing him standing with his feet planted wide and his arms crossed, facing the window. The city stretched out in front of him. Not the skyline view he had in his Crossfire office or his penthouse, but a closer vantage. More grounded and immediate. The connection with the city more intimate.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t share your concern,\u201d he said briskly into his earpiece mic. \u201cI\u2019m aware of the risk ... Stop talking. The subject isn\u2019t open to debate. Draw up the agreement as specified.\u201d</p><p>Recognizing that all-business note of steel in his voice, I kept walking. I still wasn\u2019t sure exactly what was in the bottle, but I suspected it was vitamins and liquor of some sort. Hair of the dog. It was warming my belly and making me feel lethargic, so I went to the kitchen and made a cup of coffee.</p><p>Supplied with caffeine, I plopped down on the couch and checked my smartphone for messages. I frowned when I saw that I\u2019d missed three calls from my dad, all before eight in the morning in California. I also noted a dozen missed calls from my mom, but I figured Monday was soon enough to deal with her again. And there was a text from Cary that shouted, CALL ME!</p><p>I called my dad back first, trying to swallow a quick drink of coffee before he answered.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>The anxious way my dad said my name told me something was wrong. I sat up straighter. \u201cDad ... Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about Nathan Barker?\u201d His voice was hoarse and filled with pain. Goose bumps swept across my skin.</p><p>Oh, fuck. He knew. My hand shook so badly, I spilled hot coffee on my hand and thigh. I didn\u2019t even feel it; I was so panicked by my father\u2019s anguish. \u201cDad, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t tell me. Or Monica. My God ... She should\u2019ve said something. Should\u2019ve told me.\u201d He sucked in a shaky breath. \u201cI had the right to know!\u201d</p><p>Sorrow spread through my chest like acid. My dad\u2014a man whose self-control rivaled Gideon\u2019s\u2014sounded like he was crying.</p><p>I set my mug on the coffee table, my breathing fast and shallow. Nathan\u2019s sealed juvenile records had broken open upon his death, exposing the horror of my past to anyone who had the knowledge and means to find it. As a cop, my dad had those means.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you could\u2019ve done,\u201d I told him, stunned, but trying to hold it together for his sake. My smartphone beeped with an incoming call, but I ignored it. \u201cBefore or after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2019ve been there for you. I could\u2019ve taken care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, you did. Putting me together with Dr. Travis changed my life. I didn\u2019t really start dealing with anything until then. I can\u2019t tell you how much that helped.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, and it was a low sound of torment. \u201cI should\u2019ve fought your mother for you. You should\u2019ve been with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d My stomach cramped. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame Mom. She didn\u2019t know what was happening for a long time. And when she did find out, she did everything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me!\u201d he shouted, making me jump. \u201cShe should\u2019ve fucking told me. And how could she not know? There must\u2019ve been signs ... How could she not see them? Jesus. I saw them when you came to California.\u201d</p><p>I sobbed, unable to contain my anguish. \u201cI begged her not to tell you. I made her promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t your decision to make, Eva. You were a child. She knew better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d I cried. The insistent, relentless beeping of an incoming call pushed me over the edge. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I just didn\u2019t want Nathan to hurt anyone else I loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming to see you,\u201d he said, with a sudden burst of calm. \u201cI\u2019m getting the next flight out. I\u2019ll call you when I land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, sweetheart. You\u2019re everything.\u201d</p><p>He hung up. Shattered, I sat there in a daze. I knew the knowledge of what had been done to me would eat my father alive, but I didn\u2019t know how to combat that darkness.</p><p>My phone started vibrating in my hand and I just stared down at the screen, seeing my mother\u2019s name and unable to think of what to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Standing on unsteady feet, I dropped my cell on the low table as if it had burned me. I couldn\u2019t talk to her then. I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone. I just wanted Gideon.</p><p>I stumbled down the hallway, my shoulder sliding along the wall. I heard Gideon\u2019s voice as I neared his office and my tears came faster, my steps quickening.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that you thought of me, but no,\u201d he said in a low, firm voice that was different from the one I\u2019d heard him using before. It was gentler, more intimate. \u201cOf course we\u2019re friends. You know why ... I can\u2019t give you what you want from me.\u201d</p> <p>I rounded the corner into his office and saw him at his desk, his head down as he listened.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said icily. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the tack you want to take with me, Corinne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon,\u201d I whispered, my hand gripping the doorjamb with white-knuckled force.</p><p>He glanced up, then straightened abruptly, surging to his feet. The scowl on his face fled.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he said, pulling the earpiece from his ear and dropping it on the desk as he rounded it. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you sick?\u201d</p> <p>He caught me as I rushed into him, needing him. Relief flooded me as he pulled me close and held me tight.</p><p>\u201cMy dad found out.\u201d I pressed my face to his chest, my mind filled with echoes of my father\u2019s pain. \u201cHe knows.\u201d</p><p>Gideon swung me up in his arms, cradling me. His phone started ringing. Cursing under his breath, he walked out of the room.</p><p>In the hallway, I could hear my phone rattling on the coffee table. The irritating sound of two phones going off simultaneously ratcheted up my anxiety.</p><p>\u201cLet me know if you need to get that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my mom. I\u2019m sure my dad\u2019s called her already, and he\u2019s so angry. God ... Gideon. He\u2019s devastated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand how he feels.\u201d</p><p>He carried me into the guest bedroom and kicked the door closed behind him. Laying me on the bed, he grabbed the remote off the nightstand and turned on the television, lowering the volume to a level that drowned out all other sound but my hiccupping sobs. Then he lay down beside me and hugged me, his hands rubbing up and down my back. I cried until my eyes felt raw and I had nothing left.</p><p>\u201cTell me what to do,\u201d he said when I quieted.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming here. To New York.\u201d My stomach knotted at the thought. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to fly out today, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you find out, I\u2019ll go with you to pick him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I can\u2019t,\u201d he said without heat.</p><p>I offered my mouth and sighed when he kissed me. \u201cI should really go alone. He\u2019s hurt. He won\u2019t want anyone else to see him that way.\u201d</p> <p>Gideon nodded. \u201cTake my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour new neighbor\u2019s DB9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ll know it when you see it.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t doubt that. Whatever it was, the car would be sleek, fast, and dangerous\u2014just like its owner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d I murmured, my legs tangling even tighter with his. He was so strong and solid. I wanted to hang on to him and never let go.</p><p>His fingers sifted through my hair. \u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings are already fucked up between my mom and me. If my parents have a falling-out, I don\u2019t want to get stuck in the middle. I know they wouldn\u2019t handle it well\u2014especially my mom. They\u2019re crazy in love with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t realized that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see them together. Major sizzle,\u201d I explained, remembering that Gideon and I had been separated when I learned the sexual chemistry between my parents was still white-hot. \u201cAnd my dad confessed to still being in love with her. Makes me sad to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re not together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but not because I want one big happy family,\u201d I qualified. \u201cI just hate the thought of going through life without the person you\u2019re in love with. When I lost you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never lost me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was like part of me died. Going through a whole lifetime like that ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould be hell.\u201d Gideon ran his fingertips across my cheek and I saw the bleakness in his eyes, the lingering specter of Nathan haunting him. \u201cLet me handle Monica.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at him. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>His lips curled on one side. \u201cI\u2019ll call her and ask how you\u2019re dealing with everything and how you\u2019re doing. Start the process of publicly working my way back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows I told you everything. She might break down on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter me than you.\u201d</p><p>That was almost enough to make me smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll distract her and get her thinking about something else.\u201d He reached for my hand and touched my ring.</p><p>Wedding bells. He didn\u2019t say it, but I got the message. And of course that was what my mother would think. A man in Gideon\u2019s position didn\u2019t come back to a woman through her mother\u2014especially one like Monica Stanton\u2014unless his \u201cintentions\u201d were serious.</p><p>That was an issue we\u2019d tackle another day.</p><p>FOR the next hour, Gideon pretended like he wasn\u2019t hovering. He stayed close, following me from room to room on some pretext or another. When my stomach growled, he tugged me immediately into the kitchen, pulling together a plate of sandwiches, potato chips, and prepared macaroni salad.</p><p>We ate at the island, and I let the comfort of his attentiveness soothe my nerves. As rough as things were, he was there for me to lean on. It made a lot of the troubles we were facing seem surmountable.</p><p>What couldn\u2019t we accomplish, as long as we stayed together?</p><p>\u201cWhat did Corinne want?\u201d I asked. \u201cBesides you.\u201d</p><p>His features hardened. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about Corinne.\u201d</p><p>There was an edge to his voice that niggled at me. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething lame that I\u2019m choosing to ignore.\u201d</p><p>He made an exasperated noise, but relented. \u201cShe\u2019s upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScreaming upset? Or crying upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s a difference between being mad at a guy and being a teary mess over him. For example: Deanna is mad and can plot your destruction; I was a teary mess and could barely crawl out of bed every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. Eva.\u201d He reached over and set his hand over mine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it out with the apologies, already! You\u2019ll make it up to me having to deal with my mother. So is Corinne mad or teary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was crying.\u201d Gideon winced. \u201cChrist. She lost it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that. Don\u2019t let her guilt-trip you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used her,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cto protect you.\u201d</p><p>I set my sandwich down and narrowed my gaze at him. \u201cDid you or did you not tell her that all you could offer was friendship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I did. But I also deliberately fostered the impression that we might be more, for the sake of the press and the police. I sent her mixed signals. That\u2019s what I feel guilty about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, stop. That bitch tried to make me think you\u2019d banged her\u201d\u2014I wiggled two fingers\u2014\u201ctwice. And the first time she did, it hurt so bad I\u2019m still getting over it. Plus she\u2019s married, for fuck\u2019s sake. She\u2019s got no business making moves on my man when she\u2019s got her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack up to the part about banging her. What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>I explained the incidents\u2014the lipstick-on-the-cuff disaster at the Crossfire and my impromptu visit to Corinne\u2019s apartment, when she\u2019d tried to play it like she\u2019d just got done screwing him.</p><p>\u201cWell, that changes things considerably,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more she and I need to say to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He reached over to tuck my hair behind my ear. \u201cWe\u2019ll eventually be on the other side of all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever will we do with ourselves then?\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure I can think of something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex, right?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019ve created a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget work\u2014together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. You don\u2019t quit.\u201d</p><p>He crunched on a chip and swallowed. \u201cI want you to see the revamped Crossroads and Cross Industries websites when we\u2019re done with lunch.\u201d</p><p>I wiped my mouth with a napkin. \u201cReally? That was fast. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have you look at them first before you decide that.\u201d</p><p>GIDEON knew me well. Work was my escape and he put me to it. He set me up with his laptop in the living room, made my phone stop ringing, then went into his office to call my mother.</p><p>For the first few minutes after he\u2019d left me alone, I listened to the low murmur of his voice and tried to focus on the websites he\u2019d pulled up for me, but it was no use. I was too scattered to pay attention. I ended up calling Cary instead.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck are you?\u201d he barked by way of greeting.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s been crazy,\u201d I said quickly, having no doubt my mother and father would\u2019ve been calling the apartment Cary and I shared when I didn\u2019t answer my smartphone. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The background noise on Cary\u2019s end told me he was somewhere out on the streets.</p><p>\u201cMind telling me what\u2019s going on? Everyone\u2019s calling me\u2014your parents, Stanton, Clancy. They\u2019re all looking for you and you\u2019re not answering your cell. I\u2019ve been freaking out wondering what happened to you!\u201d</p><p>Crap. I closed my eyes. \u201cMy dad found out about Nathan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was silent, the sounds of distant traffic and honking the only indication he was still on the line. Then, \u201cHoly shit. Oh, baby girl. That\u2019s bad.\u201d</p><p>The compassion in his voice made my throat too tight to speak. I didn\u2019t want to cry any more.</p><p>The background noise suddenly muted, as if he\u2019d stepped into someplace quiet. \u201cHow is he?\u201d Cary asked.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s torn up. God, Cary, it was awful. I think he was crying. And he\u2019s furious with Mom. That\u2019s probably why she\u2019s calling so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s flying out to New York. I don\u2019t know when, but he said he\u2019d be calling when he landed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s flying out now? Like today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I said miserably. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how he\u2019s managing to get time off work again so soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll fix up the guest room when I get home, if you haven\u2019t done it already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatching lunch and a matinee with Tatiana. I had to get out for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve been fielding my calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a big deal,\u201d he dismissed, in his usual Cary way. \u201cI was more worried than anything. You haven\u2019t been around much lately. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing or who you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re not acting like yourself.\u201d</p><p>The note of accusation in his tone deepened my remorse, but there was nothing I could share. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>He waited, as if for an explanation, then said something under his breath. \u201cI\u2019ll be home in a couple hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. See you then.\u201d</p><p>I hung up, then called my stepfather.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Richard.\u201d I dug right in. \u201cDid my dad call Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a moment.\u201d There was silence on the phone for a minute or two, then I heard a door shut. \u201cHe did call, yes. It was ... unpleasant for your mother. This weekend has been very hard on her. She\u2019s not well, and I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is hard on all of us,\u201d I said. \u201cI wanted to let you know that my dad is coming back to New York and I\u2019ll need to spend some quiet time with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to talk to Victor about being a little more understanding of what your mother went through. She was on her own, with a traumatized child.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou need to understand that we\u2019ve got to give him time to come to grips with this,\u201d I shot back. My tone was harsher than I intended, but reflective of my feelings. I was not going to be forced to take sides between my parents. \u201cAnd I need you to deal with Mom and get her to stop calling me and Cary nonstop. Talk to Dr. Petersen if you have to,\u201d I suggested, referring to my mother\u2019s therapist.</p><p>\u201cMonica\u2019s on the phone now. I\u2019ll discuss it with her when she\u2019s free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t just discuss it. Do something about it. Hide the phones somewhere if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s extreme. And unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if she doesn\u2019t quit!\u201d My fingers drummed on the coffee table. \u201cYou and me, we\u2019re both guilty of tiptoeing around Mom\u2014Oh no, don\u2019t upset Monica!\u2014because we\u2019d rather just give in than deal with her meltdowns. But that\u2019s emotional extortion, Richard, and I\u2019m done paying out.\u201d</p><p>He was silent, then, \u201cYou\u2019re under a lot of strain right now. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d In my head I was screaming. \u201cTell Mom I love her and I\u2019ll call when I can. Which won\u2019t be today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClancy and I are available if you need anything,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Richard. I appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>I hung up and fought the urge to throw the phone at the wall.</p><p>I\u2019D managed to calm down enough to go over the Crossroads website before Gideon reappeared from his office. He looked wiped and a bit dazed, which was to be expected, considering. Dealing with my mom when she was upset was a challenge for anyone, and Gideon didn\u2019t have much experience to fall back on.</p><p>\u201cI warned you,\u201d I said.</p><p>He lifted his arms over his head and stretched. \u201cShe\u2019ll be all right. I think she\u2019s tougher than she lets on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was stoked to hear from you, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>He smirked.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cShe thinks I need a rich man to take care of me and keep me safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to assume you meant that in a noncaveman way.\u201d I stood. \u201cI have to head out and get ready for my dad\u2019s visit. I\u2019ll need to be home at night for however long he\u2019s here, and it\u2019s probably not wise for you to sneak into my apartment. If he mistakes you for a burglar, it won\u2019t be pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also disrespectful. I\u2019ll use the time to be seen at the penthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d I stood and scrubbed at my face before admiring my new watch. \u201cAt least I\u2019ve got a lovely way to count the minutes until we\u2019re together again.\u201d</p><p>He came to me, catching me by the nape. His thumb drew tantalizing circles on the back of my neck. \u201cI need to know you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m tired of Nathan running my life. I\u2019m working toward that fresh start.\u201d</p><p>I imagined a future in which my mom wasn\u2019t a stalker, my dad was back on solid footing, Cary was happy, Corinne was in another country far away, and Gideon and I weren\u2019t ruled by our pasts.</p><p>And I was finally ready to fight for it.</p><p>11</p><p>MONDAY MORNING. TIME to go to work. I hadn\u2019t heard from my dad, so I got ready to head in. I was digging in my closet when a knock came on my bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I yelled.</p><p>A minute later, I heard Cary shout back, \u201cWhere the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn here.\u201d</p><p>His shadow darkened the doorway. \u201cAny word from your dad?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cNot yet. I sent him a text and didn\u2019t get a reply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s still on the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr he missed a connection. Who knows?\u201d I scowled at my clothes.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He came in and stepped around me, pulling a pair of gray linen palazzo pants off the bottom rack and a black lace cap-sleeved shirt.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d And because he was close, I hugged him.</p><p>His returning hug was so tight it squeezed the air out of me. Startled by his exuberance, I held him for a long while, my cheek over his heart. For the first time in a few days, he was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, and as usual, he managed to look striking and expensive.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, baby girl,\u201d he murmured into my hair.</p><p>\u201cJust trying to make sure you don\u2019t get sick of me.\u201d I tried to sound like I was teasing, but his tone niggled at me. It lacked all the vivacity I was so used to hearing in it. \u201cI\u2019m taking a cab to work, so I\u2019ve got some time. Why don\u2019t we have a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He pulled back and smiled at me, looking boyishly beautiful.</p><p>Taking my hand, he led me out of the closet. I tossed my clothes on an armchair before we headed out to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cAre you going out?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a shoot today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good news!\u201d I headed to the coffeemaker while he went to pull half-and-half out of the fridge. \u201cSounds like another occasion to dig into the case of Cristal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cNot with everything that\u2019s going on with your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else are we going to do? Sit around staring at each other? There\u2019s nothing more that can be done. Nathan is dead and even if he weren\u2019t, what he did to me is long over.\u201d I pushed a steaming mug over to him and filled another. \u201cI\u2019m ready to shove his memory in a cold, dark hole and forget about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver for you.\u201d He lightened my coffee and slid it back. \u201cIt\u2019s still news to your dad. He\u2019ll want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not talking about it with my dad. I\u2019m not talking about it ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might not go along with that.\u201d</p><p>I turned and faced him, leaning back into the counter with my mug cradled between my hands. \u201cAll he needs is to see me doing okay. This isn\u2019t about him. It\u2019s about me, and I\u2019m surviving. Pretty well, I think.\u201d</p><p>He stirred his coffee, a thoughtful look on his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are,\u201d he said after a few seconds. \u201cAre you going to tell him about your mystery man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a mystery. I just can\u2019t talk about him, and that has nothing to do with our friendship. I trust you and love you and rely on you like always.\u201d</p><p>His green eyes challenged me over the rim of his mug. \u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend. When I\u2019m old and gray, you\u2019ll still be my best friend. Not talking about the guy I\u2019m seeing isn\u2019t going to change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I not supposed to feel like you don\u2019t trust me? What\u2019s the big deal with this guy that you can\u2019t even give me a name or anything?\u201d</p><p>I sighed and told him a partial truth. \u201cI don\u2019t know his name.\u201d</p><p>Cary stilled, staring. \u201cYou\u2019re shitting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never asked him what it is.\u201d As evasive answers went, it begged to be challenged. Cary gave me a long look.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not supposed to be worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m comfortable with the whole thing. We\u2019re both getting what we need and he cares about me.\u201d</p><p>He studied me. \u201cWhat do you call him when you\u2019re coming? You\u2019ve got to be shouting something if he\u2019s any good at it. Which I assume he is, since you obviously aren\u2019t getting to know each other by talking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh ...\u201d That tripped me up. \u201cI think I just say, \u2018Oh, God!\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Throwing his head back, he laughed.</p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up with juggling two relationships?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d He shoved one hand in his pocket and rocked back on his heels. \u201cI think Tat and Trey are as close to monogamy as I\u2019ve ever been.

He was incorrigible. \u201cAre you going to introduce Tatiana to Trey?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the best idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana\u2019s a bitch on a good day, and Trey\u2019s just a nice guy. Not a great combo, in my book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou once told me you didn\u2019t like Tatiana very much. Has that changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is who she is,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cI can live with it.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him.</p><p>\u201cShe needs me, Eva,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cTrey wants me, and I think he loves me, but he doesn\u2019t need me.\u201d</p> <p>That I understood. It was nice to be needed sometimes. \u201cGotcha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says there\u2019s only one person in the world who can give us everything?\u201d He snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying that. Look at you and your no-name guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a mix-and-match situation can work for people who don\u2019t get jealous. It wouldn\u2019t work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He held out his mug and I tapped it with my own.</p><p>\u201cSo Cristal and ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm ...\u201d His lips pursed. \u201cTapas?\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cYou want to take my dad out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad idea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great idea, if we can get him to go along with it.\u201d I smiled. \u201cYou rock, Cary.\u201d</p><p>He winked at me and I felt a little more settled.</p><p>Everything in my life seemed to be shaken up, most especially my relationships with the people I loved most. That was hard for me to deal with, because I relied on them to keep me on an even keel. But maybe when everything settled down, I\u2019d be a bit stronger. Able to stand a bit straighter on my own.</p><p>It would be worth all the turmoil and pain if so.</p><p>\u201cWant me to fix your hair?\u201d Cary asked.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>WHEN I got to work, I was disappointed to find a very unhappy Megumi. She gave me a lethargic wave as she buzzed me in, then dropped back into her chair.</p><p>\u201cGirl, you need to kick Michael to the curb,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is not working out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She brushed back the long bangs of her asymmetrical bob. \u201cI\u2019m going to break it off the next time I see him. I haven\u2019t heard from him since Friday, and I\u2019m driving myself crazy wondering if he picked up anyone while doing his bachelor barhopping thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right? It\u2019s just not cool worrying about if the guy you\u2019re sleeping with is shagging someone else.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of my earlier conversation with Cary. \u201cMe and Ben and Jerry\u2019s are only a phone call away. Holler if you need us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your secret?\u201d She gave a short laugh. \u201cWhat flavor got you over Gideon Cross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not over him,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>She nodded sagely. \u201cI knew that. But you had fun on Saturday, right? And he\u2019s an idiot, by the way. One day, he\u2019s going to figure that out and coming crawling back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called my mom over the weekend,\u201d I said, leaning over the desk and lowering my voice. \u201cAsking about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Megumi leaned forward, too. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you get back together with him?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t say. Depends on how well he grovels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d She high-fived me. \u201cYour hair looks great, by the way.\u201d</p><p>I thanked her and headed to my cubicle, mentally preparing my request to take off from work if my dad called. I\u2019d barely turned the corner at the end of the hall when Mark bounded out of his office with a huge grin.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I stopped midstep. \u201cYou look insanely happy. Let me guess. You\u2019re engaged!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d I dropped my purse and bag on the floor and clapped. \u201cI\u2019m so excited for you! Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Bending down, he picked up my stuff. \u201cCome into my office.\u201d</p><p>He gestured me in ahead of him, then closed the glass door behind us.</p><p>\u201cWas it tough?\u201d I asked him, taking a seat in front of his desk.</p><p>\u201cToughest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d Mark handed me my bags. Sinking into his chair, he rocked back and forth. \u201cAnd Steven let me stew over it. Can you believe that? He knew all along I was going to propose. Said he could tell by how I freaked out I was.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cHe knows you well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he waited a minute or two before he answered me. And let me tell you, it seemed like hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet. So was all of his anti-marriage talk a front?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, still grinning. \u201cHis pride took a hit when I put him off before, so he wanted a little payback. Said he\u2019d always known I\u2019d come around eventually. Wanted to make me work for it when I finally did.\u201d</p><p>It sounded like Steven, who was playful and gregarious. \u201cSo where did you pop the question?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it somewhere with atmosphere, right? Like the candlelit restaurant or the nice dark bar after the show. No, I had to wait until the limo dropped us off at home at the end of the night and we were standing outside our brownstone and I knew I was going to lose my chance. So I just blurted it out right there on the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s really romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a romantic,\u201d he shot back.</p><p>\u201cWho cares about wine and roses? Anyone can do that. Showing somebody you can\u2019t live without them? That\u2019s romance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs usual, you make a good point.\u201d</p><p>I blew on my nails and buffed them on my shirt. \u201cWhat can I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Steven give you all the details at lunch on Wednesday. He\u2019s told the story so many times already, he\u2019s got the delivery down pat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see him.\u201d As excited as Mark was, I was sure Steven was bouncing off the walls. The big, muscled contractor had a personality as vibrant as his bright red hair. \u201cI\u2019m so thrilled for you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to rope you into helping Shawna with the planning, you know that, right?\u201d He sat up and set his elbows on the table. \u201cBesides his sister, he\u2019s recruiting every woman we know. I\u2019m sure the whole thing will be over-the-top craziness all the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that now,\u201d he warned, his dark eyes laughing. \u201cLet\u2019s grab some coffee and get this week started, shall we?\u201d</p><p>I stood. \u201cUm, I hate to ask this, but my dad is making an emergency trip into the city this week. I\u2019m not sure when he\u2019ll be coming in. It could be today. I\u2019ll need to pick him up and get him settled when he arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need to take some time off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to get him situated in my apartment. A few hours at most.\u201d</p><p>Mark nodded. \u201cYou said \u2018emergency trip.\u2019 Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I don\u2019t have a problem with you taking time when you need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>As I dropped my stuff off at my desk, I thought\u2014for the millionth time\u2014how much I loved my job and my boss. I understood how much Gideon wanted to keep me close and I appreciated the vision of us building something together, but my work nurtured me as an individual. I didn\u2019t want to give that up, and I didn\u2019t want to end up resenting him if he kept pushing me to do so. I\u2019d have to come up with an argument Gideon would accept.</p><p>I started working on it as Mark and I headed to the break room.</p><p>ALTHOUGH Megumi hadn\u2019t yet kissed Michael good-bye, I took her out to lunch at a nearby deli with delicious wraps and a decent selection of Ben &amp; Jerry cups. I chose Chunky Monkey, she went with Cherry Garcia, and we both enjoyed the cool treat in the middle of the hot day.</p><p>We sat at a small metal table in the back, the remnants of our lunch on a tray between us. The deli wasn\u2019t as crazed during the noon hour as some of the other restaurants and full-service eateries in the area were, which suited us both fine. We could hold a conversation without raising our voices.</p><p>\u201cMark\u2019s floating,\u201d she said, licking her spoon. She wore a lime green dress that went really well with her dark hair and pale skin. Megumi always dressed in bold colors and styles. I envied her ability to pull them off so well.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s so cool to see someone that happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilt-free happiness. Unlike this ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a little guilt every now and then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fat ass?\u201d</p><p>I groaned. \u201cThanks for the reminder that I have to hit the gym today. I haven\u2019t worked out in days.\u201d</p><p>Unless one counted mattress gymnastics ...</p><p>\u201cHow do you stay motivated?\u201d she asked me. \u201cI know I should go, but I can always find an excuse not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you keep that amazing figure anyway?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cYou make me sick.\u201d</p><p>Her lips quirked. \u201cWhere do you work out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI alternate between a regular gym and a Krav Maga studio in Brooklyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you go after work or before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter. I am not a morning person,\u201d I said. \u201cSleep is my friend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould you mind if I tag along sometime? I don\u2019t know about that Krav what-a, but the gym. Where do you go?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed a bit of chocolate and was about to reply when I heard a phone ringing.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to get that?\u201d Megumi asked, which alerted me to the fact that the phone was mine.</p> <p>The burner phone, which was why I didn\u2019t recognize it.</p><p>I dug it out quickly and answered with a breathless \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d</p><p>For a second, I savored the rasp of Gideon\u2019s voice. \u201cHey. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy attorneys just notified me that the police might have a suspect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My heart stopped. My stomach began to revolt against lunch. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t remember getting back to the office. When Megumi asked me for the name of my gym, she had to ask twice. The fear I felt was like nothing I\u2019d ever suffered before. It was so much worse when you felt it on behalf of someone you loved.</p><p>How could the police possibly suspect someone else?</p><p>I had the horrible feeling they were just trying to shake Gideon up. Shake me up.</p><p>If that was the goal, it was working. At least on me. Gideon had sounded calm and collected during our brief conversation. He\u2019d told me not to get upset, that he just wanted to warn me that the police might come by with more questions. Or they might not.</p> <p>Jesus. I walked slowly back to my desk, my nerves shot. I felt like I\u2019d gulped down an entire pot of coffee. My hands were trembling and my heart was beating too fast.</p><p>I sat down at my desk and tried to get back to work, but I couldn\u2019t concentrate. I stared at my monitor and didn\u2019t see anything.</p><p>What if the police did have a suspect who wasn\u2019t Gideon? What would we do? We couldn\u2019t let an innocent person go to prison.</p><p>And yet there was a tiny voice in my head whispering that Gideon would be safe from prosecution if someone else were convicted of the crime.</p><p>The moment the thought entered my mind, I felt sick over it. My gaze went to the photo of my dad. He was in his uniform, looking dashingly handsome standing next to his patrol car.</p><p>I was so confused, so frightened.</p><p>When my smartphone started vibrating on my desk, I jumped. Dad\u2019s name and number flashed on the screen. I answered quickly. \u201cHey! Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCincinnati. I\u2019m switching planes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHang on, let me write down your flight info.\u201d I snagged a pen and jotted down the details he gave me. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you when you land. I can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah ... Eva. Sweetheart.\u201d He sighed heavily. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>He hung up, and the subsequent silence was deafening. I knew then that the strongest emotion he was feeling was guilt. It colored his voice and made my chest ache.</p><p>Standing, I made my way over to Mark\u2019s office. \u201cI just heard from my dad. His flight lands at LaGuardia in a couple hours.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, then frowned, his gaze searching. \u201cSo go home, get ready, and pick him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d That one word would have to do. Mark seemed to understand that I didn\u2019t want to stick around and talk.</p><p>I used the burner phone to send a text while I took a cab ride home: Heading to the apt. Leaving in 1 hour to get dad. Can u talk?</p><p>I needed to know what Gideon was thinking ... how he was feeling. I was a wreck and I didn\u2019t know what to do about it.</p><p>When I got home, I changed into a simple, lightweight summer dress and sandals. I answered a text from Martin, agreeing that it was great we\u2019d hung out Saturday night and that we should do it again. I double-checked the kitchen, making sure all of my dad\u2019s favorite foods that I\u2019d stocked up on were exactly where I\u2019d put them. I checked the guest room again, even though I\u2019d gone over it the day before. I got online and checked my dad\u2019s flight.</p><p>Done. I had enough time left over to drive myself crazy.</p><p>I did a search for \u201cCorinne Giroux and husband\u201d on Google, looking specifically at images.</p><p>What I discovered was that Jean-Fran?ois Giroux was a really good-looking guy. Hot, actually. Not as hot as Gideon, but then who was? Gideon was in a league by himself, but Jean-Fran?ois was a head-turner in his own right, with dark wavy hair and eyes the color of pale jade. He was tan and had a goatee, which really worked for him. He and Corinne made a stunning couple.</p><p>My burner phone rang and I lunged to my feet in a rush, stumbling around the coffee table to get to it. I snatched it out of my purse and answered, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m next door,\u201d Gideon said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my purse and left my place. One of my neighbors was just unlocking her door, so I offered a polite, distant smile and pretended to wait for the elevator. The moment I heard her go inside her apartment, I darted over to Gideon\u2019s door. It opened before I could use my key.</p><p>The Gideon who greeted me was in jeans and T-shirt, with a ball cap on his head. He caught my hand and pulled me inside, tugging the hat off before lowering his mouth to mine. His kiss was surprisingly sweet, his firm lips soft and warm.</p><p>I dropped my purse and wrapped my arms around him, snuggling into him. The feel of his strength eased my anxiety enough to allow me to take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to come home.\u201d I could only imagine how doing so had disrupted his day. Changing clothes, making the trip back and forth ...</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. You need me.\u201d His hands slid up my back, and then he pulled away just enough to look down into my face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about this, Eva. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes were cool, his expression one of confidence. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m waiting on more information. Who are they looking at? Why are they looking at him? Chances are very good that it won\u2019t pan out. You know that.\u201d</p><p>I search his face. \u201cWhat if they do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I let someone else pay for my crime?\u201d His jaw tightened. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I smoothed his brow with my fingertips. \u201cI know you won\u2019t let that happen. I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019ll prevent it.\u201d</p><p>His scowl deepened. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to predict the future, Eva. I can\u2019t do that. You just have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I promised fervently. \u201cBut I\u2019m still scared. I can\u2019t help being freaked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m worried, too.\u201d His thumb brushed over my bottom lip. \u201cDetective Graves is a very intelligent woman.\u201d</p><p>His observation clicked with me. \u201cYou\u2019re right. That makes me feel better.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know Shelley Graves, not really. But in the few interactions I\u2019d had with her, she\u2019d struck me as being intelligent and street-smart. I hadn\u2019t factored her into the equation, and I should have. It was odd to be in a position where I both feared who she was and appreciated it.</p><p>\u201cYou set up for your dad?\u201d</p><p>The reminder brought some of the jitters back. \u201cEverything\u2019s ready. Except me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes softened. \u201cAny idea how you\u2019re going to handle him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCary went back to work today, so we\u2019ll celebrate with champagne and then head out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s going to be up for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m up for it,\u201d I admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s screwy to be making plans to drink Cristal and kick up my heels in the middle of everything going on. But what else can I do? If my dad doesn\u2019t see I\u2019m okay, he\u2019s not going to get over finding out about Nathan. I have to show him all of that ugliness is in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you need to let me handle the rest,\u201d he admonished. \u201cI will take care of you, of us. Focus on your family for a while.\u201d</p><p>Stepping back, I grabbed his hand and led him toward the couch. It was weird being home so early after going in to work. Seeing the brightness of the afternoon sun beating down on the city outside the windows had me feeling out of step, reinforcing the notion that we\u2019d stolen time to be together.</p><p>I sat, curled my legs, and faced him, watching as he settled beside me. We were so alike in many ways, including our pasts. Did Gideon need to get everything out in the open with his family, too? Is that what he\u2019d need to fully heal?</p><p>\u201cI know you have to get back to work,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I\u2019m glad you came home for me. You\u2019re right\u2014I needed to see you.\u201d</p><p>He lifted my hand to his lips. \u201cDo you know when your father\u2019s heading back to California?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy appointment with Dr. Petersen would\u2019ve made tomorrow a late night for us anyway.\u201d Gideon looked at me with a slight smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to be together.\u201d</p><p>Having him near ... touching him ... seeing him smile ... hearing those words. I could get through anything as long as I had him next to me after a long day.</p><p>\u201cCan I have five minutes?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can have whatever you want, angel,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cJust this.\u201d I slid closer and curved into his side.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s arm came around my shoulders. Our hands linked together in our laps. We formed a perfect circle. Not as glittering as the rings we wore on our fingers, but priceless all the same.</p><p>After a moment, I felt him lean into me. He sighed. \u201cI needed this, too.\u201d</p><p>I hugged him tighter. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to need me, ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I needed you a little less. Just enough to make it bearable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would be the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>His soft laugh made me fall even harder for him.</p><p>GIDEON had been right about the DB9. As I watched the parking attendant pull the sleek metallic gray Aston Martin to a stop in front of me, I thought it was pretty much Gideon on wheels. It was sex with a gas pedal; so much brute elegance it damn near made my toes curl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was scared as hell to get behind the wheel.</p><p>Driving in New York was nothing like driving in Southern California. I hesitated before accepting the keys from the bow-tied attendant, debating the wisdom of just calling for a town car.</p><p>The burner phone started ringing and I fumbled for it quickly. \u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust do it,\u201d Gideon purred. \u201cStop worrying and drive it.\u201d</p><p>I spun around, my gaze searching for security cameras. Awareness shivered down my spine. I could feel Gideon\u2019s gaze on me. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWishing I were with you. I\u2019d love to spread you across the hood and fuck you real slow. Push my cock deep inside you. Give those shocks a workout. Umm. God, I\u2019m hard.\u201d</p><p>And he was making me wet. I could listen to him endlessly; I loved his voice so much. \u201cI\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to screw up your pretty car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about the car, only about your safety. So scratch it up all you want, just don\u2019t get hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf that was supposed to calm me down, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could have phone sex until you come, that should do it.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my gaze at the parking attendants, who were pretending not to watch me. \u201cShould I be worried about what got you so horny in the short time since I was with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking about you driving the DB9 turns me on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it now?\u201d I fought to hold back a smile. \u201cRemind me, which one of us has the transportation fetish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlide behind the wheel,\u201d he coaxed. \u201cImagine I\u2019m in the passenger seat. My hand between your legs. My fingers fucking your soft, slick cunt.\u201d</p> <p>Stepping closer to the car on shaky legs, I muttered, \u201cYou must have a death wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d take my cock out and stroke it with my fist while I fingered you, get us both good and hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lack of respect for this vehicle\u2019s upholstery is appalling.\u201d I settled into the driver\u2019s seat and spent a minute figuring out how to move it forward.</p><p>His voice rasped through the car\u2019s sound system. \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d</p><p>It totally figured that he\u2019d synced my burner phone to the car\u2019s Bluetooth. Gideon always thought of everything.</p><p>\u201cExpensive,\u201d I answered. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy for letting me drive this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m crazy about you,\u201d he replied, sending delight skipping through me. \u201cLaGuardia is programmed in the GPS.\u201d</p><p>It made me feel good to know that coming home to see me had lightened his mood so much. I knew just how he felt. It meant a lot to know he felt the same way.</p> <p>I pulled up the GPS, then hit the button to put the transmission into drive. \u201cYou know what, ace? I want to blow you while you\u2019re driving this thing. Throw a pillow across this center console here and suck your cock for miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take you up on that. Tell me how she feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmooth. Powerful.\u201d I waved at the attendants as I eased out of the subterranean parking garage. \u201cVery responsive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cOf course, you\u2019re my favorite ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s sweet, baby. And you\u2019re my favorite joystick.\u201d I merged carefully into traffic.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI better be your only joystick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not your only ride,\u201d I pointed out, loving him so much in that moment because I knew he was looking out for me, making sure I was comfortable. Back in California, driving had been like breathing to me, but I hadn\u2019t been behind the wheel of a car since I moved to New York.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one I enjoy naked,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s real lucky for you, because I\u2019m very possessive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His voice was filled with masculine satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMultitasking, I\u2019m sure.\u201d I stepped on the gas and prayed as I cut across lanes. \u201cWhat\u2019s a little calming distraction for your girlfriend in the midst of world entertainment domination?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d stop the world from spinning for you.\u201d</p><p>That silly line oddly touched me. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiked that one, did you?\u201d</p><p>I grinned, startled and pleased by his ridiculous sense of humor.</p><p>I was hyperaware of my surroundings. There were signs in every direction prohibiting everything. Driving in Manhattan was a fast trip to nowhere. \u201cHey, I can\u2019t turn left or right. I think I\u2019m heading for the Midtown Tunnel. I could lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never lose me, angel,\u201d he vowed. \u201cWherever you go, however far, I\u2019ll be right here with you.\u201d</p><p>WHEN I spotted my dad outside the baggage claim area, I lost all the confidence Gideon had instilled in me since I\u2019d left work. Dad looked drawn and haggard, his eyes reddened and his jaw shadowed by stubble.</p><p>I felt the sting of tears as I walked toward him, but I blinked them back, determined to reassure him. Holding my arms open, I watched him drop his carry-on and then all the air left my lungs as he hugged me tightly.</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy,\u201d I said, with a tremor in my voice I hoped he missed.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d His lips pressed hard to my temple.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired. When\u2019s the last time you slept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the leg out of San Diego.\u201d He pulled back and looked at me with gray eyes that were the same as mine. He searched my face.</p><p>\u201cDo you have more luggage?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, still studying me.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI grabbed something in Cincinnati.\u201d Finally, he backed up and retrieved his bag. \u201cBut if you\u2019re hungry ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m good. But I was thinking we could take Cary out for dinner later, if you\u2019re up for it. He went back to work today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He paused with his bag in his hand, looking a bit lost and unsure.</p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I want to hurt something and there\u2019s nothing for me to hit.\u201d</p><p>That gave me an idea.</p><p>Grabbing his hand, I started leading him out of the airport. \u201cHold that thought.\u201d</p><p>12</p><p>\u201cHE\u2019S REALLY MAKING Derek work for it,\u201d Parker noted, wiping the light sheen of sweat off his shaved head with a hand towel.</p><p>I turned to watch, seeing my father wrestling with the instructor who was twice his size, and my dad wasn\u2019t a small guy. Standing over six feet tall and weighing in at two hundred pounds of solid, rippling muscle, Victor Reyes was a formidable opponent. Plus, he\u2019d told me he was going to check out Krav Maga himself after I\u2019d shared my interest in it, and it seemed he had\u2014he had some of the moves down pat. \u201cThanks for letting him jump in.\u201d</p><p>Parker looked at me, his dark eyes steady and calm in that way he had. He\u2019d been teaching me more than just how to defend myself. He had also taught me to focus on the steps to be taken, not the fear.</p><p>\u201cUsually I\u2019d say class isn\u2019t the place to bring your anger,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Derek needed the challenge.\u201d</p><p>Although he didn\u2019t ask it, I could feel the unspoken question in the air. I decided it was best to answer it, since Parker was doing me a favor by letting my dad monopolize his co-instructor. \u201cHe just found out that someone hurt me a long time ago. Now it\u2019s too late to do anything about it and he\u2019s having a hard time with that.\u201d</p><p>He reached down and grabbed the bottle of water sitting just off the side of the training mat. After a minute, he said, \u201cI have a daughter. I can imagine how that feels.\u201d</p><p>When he looked at me before taking a drink, I saw the understanding in his thickly lashed dark eyes and I was reassured that I\u2019d brought my dad to the right place.</p><p>Parker was easygoing and had a great smile, and was genuine in a way that I\u2019d rarely come across. But he had an air about him that warned people to tread carefully. One knew right away that it would be stupid to try to pull anything over on him. His street smarts were as obvious as his tribal tattoos.</p><p>\u201cSo you bring him here,\u201d he said, \u201clet him work it out and let him see you taking care of your own protection. Good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to do,\u201d I confessed. Parker\u2019s studio was located in a revitalizing area of Brooklyn. It was a converted warehouse, and the exposed brick and giant sliding loading-bay doors added to the atmosphere of tough chic. It was a place where I felt confident and take-charge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some ideas.\u201d He grinned and jerked his chin toward the mat. \u201cLet\u2019s show him what you can do.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my towel over my water bottle and nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t see any of the uniformed parking attendants as we pulled into the underground garage of my apartment building. Since I wanted to do the honors myself anyway, that worked for me. I slid the DB9 into an empty slot and cut the engine. \u201cFabulous. Right by the elevator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see,\u201d my dad said. \u201cIs this your car?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been waiting for that question. \u201cNo. A neighbor\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriendly neighbor,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cA cup of sugar. An Aston Martin. It\u2019s all the same, right?\u201d I glanced at him with a smile.</p><p>He looked so tired and worn, and not from the workout. The weariness came from the inside, and it was killing me.</p><p>Turning the car off, I released my seat belt and turned to look at him. \u201cDad. I ... It\u2019s shredding me to see you torn up over this. I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d</p><p>Heaving out his breath, he said, \u201cI just need some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never wanted you to find out.\u201d I reached out and gripped his hand. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be glad you did, if we can put Nathan behind us for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read the reports\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. Daddy ...\u201d I swallowed back a rush of bile. \u201cI don\u2019t want that stuff in your head.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI knew there was something wrong.\u201d He stared at me with such sorrow and pain in his eyes it hurt to look into them. \u201cThe way Cary went to sit beside you when Detective Graves said Nathan Barker\u2019s name ... I knew you weren\u2019t telling me something. I kept hoping you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried very hard to put Nathan in my past. You were one of the few things in my life he hadn\u2019t infected. I wanted to keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>His grip on my hand tightened. \u201cTell me the truth. Are you okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDad. I\u2019m the same daughter you came to see a couple weeks ago. The same daughter who hung out with you in San Diego. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were pregnant\u2014\u201d His voice broke and a tear slid down his cheek.</p><p>I brushed it away, ignoring my own. \u201cAnd I will be again someday. Maybe more than once. Maybe you\u2019ll be crawling with grandkids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Leaning across the console, he hugged me. We sat in the car for a long time, crying. Getting it out.</p> <p>Was Gideon watching the security feeds, sending me silent support? It gave me comfort to think he might be.</p><p>DINNER out that night wasn\u2019t quite as boisterous a meal as usual for Cary, my dad, and me, but it wasn\u2019t as grim as I\u2019d feared it might be. The food was great, the wine better, and Cary was snarking out.</p><p>\u201cShe was worse than Tatiana,\u201d he said, talking about the model he\u2019d shared the shoot with that day. \u201cShe kept going on about her \u2018good side,\u2019 which I personally thought was her ass as it walked out the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done shoots with Tatiana?\u201d I asked, then explained to my dad, \u201cShe\u2019s a girl Cary\u2019s seeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Cary licked red wine off his lower lip. \u201cWe work together a lot, actually. I\u2019m the Tatiana Tamer. She starts one of her fits and I calm her down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do\u2014 Never mind,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know how.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou already know.\u201d He winked.</p><p>I looked at my dad and rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow about you, Victor?\u201d Cary asked around a bite of saut\u00e9ed mushroom. \u201cYou seeing anyone?\u201d</p><p>My dad shrugged. \u201cNothing serious.\u201d</p><p>That was by his choice. I\u2019d seen how women acted around him\u2014they fell all over themselves trying to get his attention. My dad was hot, with an amazing body, gorgeous face, and Latin sensuality. He had his pick of women and I knew he wasn\u2019t a saint, but he never seemed to meet anyone who really got to him. I\u2019d recently realized that was because my mother had gotten there first.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ll ever have more kids?\u201d Cary asked him, surprising me with the question.</p><p>I\u2019d long ago become resigned to being an only child.</p><p>My dad shook his head. \u201cNot that I\u2019m opposed to the idea, but Eva is more than I ever thought I\u2019d have in my life.\u201d He looked at me with so much love it made my throat tight. \u201cAnd she\u2019s perfect. Everything I could ever hope for. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s room in my heart for anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, Daddy.\u201d I leaned my head into his shoulder, so glad he was with me, even if it was for the worst possible reason.</p><p>When we got back to the apartment, we decided to watch a movie before calling it a night. I went to my room to change and was stoked to find a gorgeous bouquet of white roses on my dresser. The card, written in Gideon\u2019s distinctive bold penmanship, made me almost giddy.</p><p>I\u2019M THINKING OF YOU, AS ALWAYS.</p><p>AND I\u2019M HERE.</p><p>YOURS, G.</p><p>I sat on the bed, hugging the card, certain he was thinking of me that very moment. It was also starting to sink in that he\u2019d been thinking of me every moment of the weeks we\u2019d been apart, too.</p><p>That night, I fell asleep on the couch after watching Dredd. I woke briefly to the feeling of being lifted and carried to my room, smiling sleepily as my dad tucked me into bed like a child and kissed my forehead.</p><p>\u201cLove you, Daddy,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cLove you, too, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>I woke up before my alarm the next morning and felt better than I had in a long while. I left a note on the breakfast bar telling my dad to call me if he wanted to get together for lunch. I wasn\u2019t sure if he had anything planned for the day. I knew Cary had a shoot in the afternoon.</p><p>During the cab ride to work, I answered a text from Shawna squeeing over her brother\u2019s engagement to Mark. So happy for all of u, I texted back.</p><p>I\u2019m drafting u! she shot back.</p><p>I smiled down at my phone. What\u2019s that? Signal\u2019s breaking up ... Can\u2019t read u ...</p><p>As the cab stopped in front of the Crossfire, the sight of the Bentley at the curb gave me the usual thrill. When I hopped out, I peeked into the front seat and waved when I saw Angus sitting inside.</p><p>He stepped out, setting his chauffeur hat on his head. Like Clancy, you couldn\u2019t tell he was carrying a sidearm by looking at him; he wore it so comfortably.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Miss Tramell,\u201d he greeted me. Although he wasn\u2019t a young man and his red hair was liberally threaded with silver, I\u2019d never had any doubts about Angus\u2019s ability to protect Gideon.</p><p>\u201cHi, Angus. It\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking lovely today.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at my pale yellow dress. I\u2019d chosen it because it was bright and cheery, which was the impression I wanted my dad to have of me. \u201cThank you. I hope your day rocks.\u201d I backed up toward the revolving door. \u201cSee you later!\u201d</p><p>His pale blue eyes were kind as he tipped his hat to me.</p><p>When I got upstairs, I found Megumi looking more like her usual self. Her smile was wide and real, and her eyes had the sparkle I enjoyed seeing every morning.</p><p>I stopped by her desk. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Michael\u2019s meeting me for lunch and I\u2019m ending it. Nice and civilized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a killer outfit you\u2019ve got on,\u201d I told her, admiring the emerald green dress she wore. It was fitted and had leather piping that gave it just the right amount of edge.</p><p>She stood and showed off her knee-high boots.</p><p>\u201cVery Kalinda Sharma,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be scrambling to hold on to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cThese boots were made for walking. He didn\u2019t call me back until last night, which made it nearly four days without contact. Not totally unreasonable, but I\u2019m ready to find a guy who\u2019s crazy about me. A guy who thinks about me as much as I\u2019m thinking about him and hates it when we can\u2019t be together.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, thinking about Gideon. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it to hold out for one. Do you want me to give you a bailout phone call during your lunch?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cNah. But thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let me know if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>I headed back to my desk and dug right in to work, determined to get ahead to make up for leaving early the day before. Mark was fired up, too, segueing from work only long enough to tell me that Steven had a binder full of wedding ideas he\u2019d been collecting for years.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Mark\u2019s mouth curved with affection. \u201cHe\u2019s kept it in his office all this time so I wouldn\u2019t know about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get a look at it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went through the whole thing with me. It took hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have the wedding of the century,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d The word held more than a little exasperation, but his expression remained so happy I couldn\u2019t stop smiling.</p><p>My dad called just before eleven.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetheart,\u201d he said, in reply to my usual work greeting. \u201cHow\u2019s your day going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I leaned back in my chair and looked at the picture of him. \u201cHow\u2019d you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard. I\u2019m still trying to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Go back to bed and be lazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to let you know that I\u2019m going to take a rain check on lunch. We\u2019ll get together tomorrow. Today, I need to talk to your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I knew that tone. It was the same one he used when he pulled people over, that perfect mixture of authority and disapproval. \u201cListen. I\u2019m not going to step in the middle of this with you two. You\u2019re both adults and I\u2019m not picking sides. But I have to say that Mom wanted to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was alone,\u201d I pressed on, my feet tapping restlessly on the carpet, \u201cgoing through a divorce and the trial against Nathan, and dealing with my recovery. I\u2019m sure she desperately wanted a shoulder to lean on\u2014you know how she is. But she was drowning in guilt. I could\u2019ve gotten her to agree to anything then, and I did.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cI just want you to keep that in mind when you talk to her,\u201d I finished.</p><p>\u201cAll right. When will you be home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little after five. Want to go to the gym? Or back to Parker\u2019s studio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see how I\u2019m feeling when you get in,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I forced myself to ignore how anxious I was over the upcoming conversation between my parents. \u201cCall me if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>We hung up and I got back to work, grateful for the distraction.</p><p>When lunch rolled around, I decided to grab something quick and bring it back to my desk to work through the hour. I braved the midday sauna outside to hit the local Duane Reade for a bag of beef jerky and a bottled health drink. I\u2019d skipped my workouts pretty frequently since Gideon and I had gotten back together, and I figured it was time to pay a penalty for that.</p><p>I was debating the wisdom of sending Gideon an \u201cI\u2019m thinking of you\u201d note when I twirled through the revolving front door of the Crossfire. Just a little something to say thanks for the flowers, which had made a tough day more bearable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then I saw the woman I\u2019d prefer never to see again\u2014Corinne Giroux. And she was talking to my man, with her palm resting intimately against his chest.</p><p>They stood off to the side, sheltered by a column outside the stream of traffic heading in and out of the security turnstiles. Corinne\u2019s long black hair fell nearly to her waist, a glossy curtain that stood out even against her classic black dress. Both she and Gideon were in profile so I couldn\u2019t see her eyes, but I knew they were a gorgeous aquamarine hue. She was a beautiful woman and together, they made a stunning couple. Especially right then, with both of them dressed in black, the only spot of color being Gideon\u2019s blue tie. My favorite one.</p><p>Abruptly, Gideon\u2019s head turned and found me, as if he\u2019d felt me watching him. The instant our gazes met, I felt that soul-deep recognition pierce through me, that primitive awareness I\u2019d only ever felt with him. Elementally, something inside me knew he was mine. Had known it from the moment I first laid eyes on him.</p> <p>And some other woman had her hands on him.</p><p>My brows rose in a silent WTF? At that moment, Corinne followed his gaze. She didn\u2019t look happy to see me paused in the middle of the massive lobby, staring at them.</p><p>She was lucky I didn\u2019t go up to her and yank her away from him by her hair.</p><p>Then she cupped his jaw, urged his attention back to her, and lifted onto her tiptoes to press a kiss against his hard mouth, and I really considered doing it. Even took a step toward them.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s head jerked back just before she accomplished her goal, his hands catching her by the arms and thrusting her away.</p> <p>Reining in my temper, I exhaled my irritation and left him to it. I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t feel jealous, because of course I did\u2014Corinne could be with him publicly and I couldn\u2019t. But I didn\u2019t have the sick fear in my gut I\u2019d felt before, the horrible insecurity that told me I was going to lose the man I loved more than anything.</p><p>It was weird not to feel that panic. There was still a little voice in my head cautioning me against being too confident, telling me it\u2019d be better to be afraid, to guard myself from getting hurt. But for once, I was able to ignore it. After all Gideon and I had been through, all that we were still going through, all he\u2019d done for me ... it was harder to disbelieve than to believe.</p><p>Despite everything, we were stronger than we\u2019d ever been.</p><p>I hopped on an elevator and headed up to work, my thoughts drifting to my parents. I was choosing to take it as a good sign that neither my mother nor Stanton had called to bitch about my dad. I crossed my fingers and hoped that when I got home we could all put Nathan behind us for good. I was so ready for that. Beyond ready to move on to the next phase of my life, whatever that might be.</p><p>The elevator car slowed to a stop on the tenth floor and the doors opened to the high-pitched whirring sound of power tools and the rhythmic banging of hammers. Directly ahead of the elevator, plastic sheeting hung from the ceiling. I hadn\u2019t realized any part of the Crossfire was under construction, and I peered around the people in front of me, trying to get a look.</p><p>\u201cAnyone getting out?\u201d the guy nearest the door asked, looking over his shoulder.</p> <p>I straightened and shook my head, even though he hadn\u2019t been talking to me personally. No one else moved. We waited for the doors to close and shut out the construction noise.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t move, either.</p><p>When the guy began hitting the elevator buttons to no avail, I realized what was going on.</p><p>Gideon.</p><p>Smiling to myself, I said, \u201cExcuse me, please.\u201d</p><p>The occupants of the car shifted to let me out and another guy stepped out with me. The doors closed behind us and the car continued on.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d the guy said, scowling as he turned and surveyed the other three elevators. He was a little taller than me, but not much, and wore dress slacks with a short-sleeved shirt and tie.</p><p>The ding announcing the arrival of another car was nearly drowned out by the construction noise. When the doors to that elevator opened, Gideon stepped out, looking suave and dashing and irritated.</p> <p>I wanted to jump him, he looked so hot. Plus, I\u2019ll admit it totally turned me on when he went all alpha male on me.</p><p>I\u2019d stop the world from spinning for you. Sometimes, it felt like he did.</p><p>Grumbling under his breath, the short-sleeved guy walked into Gideon\u2019s vacated elevator and left us.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s hand went to his hips, his jacket parting to reveal the sleekness of his suit. All three pieces were black with a subtle sheen that was unmistakably costly. His dress shirt was black and his cuff links were a familiar gold and onyx.</p><p>He was dressed as he\u2019d been that very first day I\u2019d met him. At the time, I\u2019d wanted to climb up his scrumptious body and screw him senseless.</p><p>All these weeks later, that hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>\u201cEva,\u201d he began in that toe-curlingly sexy voice of his. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. Corinne came by because I\u2019m not taking her calls\u2014\u201d</p><p>I held up my hand to cut him off and glanced at his gift, my beautiful watch, on my other wrist. \u201cI\u2019ve got thirty minutes. I\u2019d rather fuck you than talk about your ex, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>He stood silent and unmoving for a long minute, staring at me, trying to gauge my mood. I watched his brain and body switch gears, adjusting from aggravation to awareness. His gaze narrowed, his eyes darkened. A flush came to his cheekbones and his lips parted on a sharp breath. His weight shifted as his blood heated and his cock thickened, his sexuality stirring like a panther stretching after a lazy nap.</p><p>I could almost feel the sexual current crackle between us, sparking to life. I responded to it as I\u2019d been trained to do, softening and quickening, my core clenching gently. Begging for him. The commotion around us only made me hornier, adding urgency to the beat of my heart.</p><p>Gideon reached into an inner pocket of his jacket and withdrew his phone. He speed-dialed, then lifted the phone to his ear, his eyes locked with mine. \u201cI\u2019m running thirty minutes late. If that won\u2019t work for Anderson, reschedule.\u201d</p><p>He hung up, casually dropping his phone back in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so hot for you right now,\u201d I told him, my voice husky with want.</p><p>Reaching down, he adjusted himself, then approached me, his eyes smoldering. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>He set his hand at the small of my back in that way I loved so much, the pressure and warmth hitting a spot that sent tingles of anticipation through me. I looked up at him over my shoulder and saw the slight smile on his mouth, proof that he knew what that innocent touch was doing to me.</p><p>We pushed through plastic sheeting, leaving the bank of elevators behind us. In front of us was sunlight and cement and hanging sheeting everywhere I looked. Through the plastic I could see the watery, foggy shadows of workers. I heard music that was nearly drowned out by the din, and men shouting to each other.</p><p>Gideon led me through the plastic, knowing his way. His silence was spurring me on, the weight of expectation growing with every step we took. We reached a door and he opened it, urging me into a room that would be someone\u2019s corner office.</p><p>The city was spread out before me, the view of the modern urban jungle dotted with buildings that wore their history proudly. Steam billowed into the cloudless blue sky at irregular intervals, and the cars seemed to flow along the streets like tributaries.</p><p>I heard the door lock behind me and I turned to face Gideon, catching him shrugging out of his jacket. There was furniture in the room. A desk and chairs, and a seating area positioned in the corner. All of it was draped in tarps, the space still unfinished.</p><p>With methodical deliberation, he removed his vest, tie, and shirt. I watched him, obsessed with the masculine perfection of him. \u201cWe could be interrupted,\u201d he said. \u201cOr overheard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if it bothers you.\u201d He approached me with his fly open and the waistband of his boxer briefs clearly visible in the gap.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re provoking me. You\u2019d never risk us being interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019d stop. I can\u2019t think of anything capable of stopping me once I\u2019m inside you.\u201d He took my purse from my hand and dropped it into one of the chairs. \u201cYou\u2019ve got too many clothes on.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping his arms around me, Gideon lowered the zipper at my back with practiced ease, his lips whispering across mine. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to get you too messy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like messy.\u201d I stepped out of my dress and was about to unhook my bra when he tossed me over his shoulder.</p><p>I squealed in surprise, smacking his taut ass with both of my hands. He spanked me hard enough to sting, then threw my dress aside so perfectly it landed directly across his jacket. He was walking across the room when his hand reached up and tugged my panties down below the curve of my butt.</p><p>He caught the edge of the tarp draped over the couch and threw it back, then sat me down, crouching in front of me. As he pulled my underwear past my strappy heels, he asked, \u201cEverything okay, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I smiled and touched his cheek, knowing that question encompassed everything from my parents to my job. He always checked to see where my head was at before he took over my body. \u201cEverything\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Gideon pulled my hips to the very edge of the sofa with my legs on either side of him, exposing my cleft to his gaze. \u201cSo tell me what\u2019s got this pretty cunt so greedy today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent answer.\u201d</p><p>I pushed at his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing the suit you wore when I met you. I wanted to fuck you so bad then, but I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Now I can.\u201d</p><p>He pressed my thighs wide with gentle hands, his thumb stroking over my clit. My sex quivered as pleasure pulsed through me.</p><p>\u201cAnd now I can,\u201d he murmured, his dark head lowering.</p><p>I grasped desperately at the cushion beneath me, my stomach tightening as his tongue licked leisurely through my slit. He rimmed the trembling opening to my sex, teasing me before his tongue sank into me. I arched violently, my back bowing while he tormented the tender flesh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet me tell you how I imagined you that day,\u201d he purred, circling my clit with the tip of his tongue, his hands holding me down when I would\u2019ve bucked into the caress. \u201cSpread beneath me on black satin sheets, your hair fanned all around you, your eyes wild and hot from the feel of my cock pounding into your tight, silky cunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. Gideon,\u201d I moaned, seduced by the sight of him savoring me so intimately. It was a fantasy come true\u2014the dark and dangerous sex god in the breathtaking suit, servicing me with that sculpted mouth made for driving women wild.</p><p>\u201cI imagined your wrists pinned down by my hands,\u201d he went on roughly, \u201cme forcing you to take it over and over. Your hard little nipples swollen from my mouth. Your lips red and wet from sucking my cock. The room filled with those sexy sounds you make ... those helpless whimpers when you can\u2019t stop coming.\u201d</p> <p>I whimpered then, biting my lip as he fluttered over my clit with the wicked lash of his tongue. I hooked one leg over his bare shoulder, the heat of his skin scorching the sensitive flesh at the back of my knee. \u201cI want what you want.\u201d</p><p>His grin flashed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He sucked me, drawing on the tight bundle of nerves. I climaxed with a breathless cry, my legs shaking with the rush of release.</p><p>I was still quivering with pleasure when he urged me back lengthwise on the couch, his big body looming over me, his cock thrusting upward from where he\u2019d shoved his briefs down just enough to free it. I reached for him, wanting to feel him in my hands, but he caught my wrists and pinned my arms.</p><p>\u201cI like you like this,\u201d he said darkly. \u201cHeld prisoner for my lust.\u201d</p> <p>Gideon\u2019s eyes were intent on my face, his lips glistening from my climax, his chest heaving. I was mesmerized by the difference between the virile male about to take me like an animal and the civilized businessman who\u2019d inspired my searing lust to begin with.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I told him, panting as the broad head of his cock slid heavily through my swollen cleft. He pushed against me, parting the slick opening.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d With a groan, he buried his face in my throat and surged inside me, the thick length of his rigid penis tunneling deep. Gasping my name, he ground his hips against me, trying to get deeper, shoving and circling, screwing. \u201cChrist, I need you.\u201d</p><p>The desperation in his voice took me by surprise. I wanted to touch him, but he held me down, his hips working restlessly. The feel of him inside me, so hot, the wide crest rubbing and massaging, was driving me out of my mind. I screwed him back, unable to stop, the two of us straining together.</p><p>His lips brushed against my temple. \u201cWhen I saw you standing in the lobby just now, in your pretty yellow dress, you looked so bright and beautiful. So perfect.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightened. \u201cGideon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe sun was shining behind you, and I thought you couldn\u2019t possibly be real.\u201d</p><p>I struggled to get my hands free. \u201cLet me touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came after you because I couldn\u2019t stay away and when I found you, you wanted me.\u201d He held both my wrists in one hand and cupped my butt in the other, lifting me as he pulled out, then thrust deep.</p><p>I moaned, rippling around him, my sex sucking ravenously at his thickness. \u201cOh God, it\u2019s so good. You feel so good ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to come all over you, come inside you. I want you on your knees and on your back. And you want me this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI push inside you and I can\u2019t take it.\u201d His mouth lowered to mine, sucking erotically. \u201cI need you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon. Let me touch you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve captured an angel.\u201d His kiss was wild and wet, passionate. His lips slanted over mine, his tongue fucking deep and fast. \u201cAnd I put my greedy hands all over you. I defile you. And you love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He stroked into me and I writhed, my thighs grasping his pumping hips. \u201cFuck me. Oh, Gideon. Fuck me hard.\u201d</p><p>Digging his knees in, he gave me what I begged for, powering into me. His cock plunged into me over and over, his groans and fevered words of lust gusting against my ear.</p><p>My core tightened, my clit throbbing with every impact of his pelvis against mine. His heavy sac smacked against the curve of my buttocks and the couch thumped against the bare concrete, inching forward as Gideon pounded into me, every muscle in his body flexing on his downstrokes.</p><p>The obscene sounds of furious sex drowned out the awareness of the workers only yards away. The race to climax drove us both, our bodies the outlet for the violence of our emotions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come in your mouth,\u201d he growled, sweat sliding down his temple.</p><p>Just the thought of him finishing that way set me off. My sex spasmed in climax, clutching and grabbing at his driving cock, the endless pulses of orgasm radiating outward to my fingers and toes. And still he didn\u2019t stop, his hips circling and lunging, expertly pleasuring me until I sagged limp beneath him.</p><p>\u201cEva. Now.\u201d He reared back and I followed, scrambling to my knees and sliding my mouth down his glistening erection.</p><p>At the first hint of suction, he was coming, spilling over my tongue in powerful bursts. I swallowed repeatedly, drinking him down, relishing the gruff sounds of satisfaction that rumbled from his chest.</p><p>His hands were in my hair, his head bowed over me, sweat glistening on his abs. My mouth slid up and down his cock, my cheeks hollowing on drawing pulls.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he gasped, pulling me off. \u201cYou\u2019ll make me hard again.\u201d</p><p>He was still hard, but I didn\u2019t point that out.</p><p>Gideon cupped my face in his hands and kissed me, our flavors mingling. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thanking me for? You did all the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no work involved in fucking you, angel.\u201d His slow smile was pure satiated male. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the privilege.\u201d</p><p>I sank back onto my heels. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me. You can\u2019t be that gorgeous and sexy and say stuff like that. It\u2019s overload. It fries my brain. Sends me into a meltdown.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened and he kissed me again. \u201cI know the feeling.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>MAYBE IT WAS because I\u2019d just gotten laid myself that I saw the signs on Megumi. Or maybe my sex radar, as Cary called it, wasn\u2019t on the fritz anymore. Whatever the reason, I knew my friend had slept with the guy she\u2019d been planning on breaking up with and I could tell she wasn\u2019t happy about it.</p><p>\u201cIs it on or off?\u201d I asked leaning on the reception counter.</p><p>\u201cOh, I broke it off,\u201d she said glumly. \u201cAfter I hit it with him again first. I figured it\u2019d be liberating. Plus who knows how long my next dry spell will last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you second-guessing your decision to end it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. He just acted all hurt about it, like I\u2019d used him for sex. Which I guess I did, but he\u2019s a no-strings-attached guy. I figured he wouldn\u2019t have a problem with a no-strings-attached nooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now your head\u2019s all fucked up.\u201d I gave her a sympathetic smile. \u201cRemember, this is the guy who hadn\u2019t called you since Friday. He got lunch with a beautiful girl and an orgasm, not a bad deal.\u201d</p><p>Her head canted to the side. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Her mood visibly lifted. \u201cAre you working out tonight, Eva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should, but my dad\u2019s in town and I\u2019m playing it on his schedule. If we go, you\u2019re welcome to tag along, but I won\u2019t know until after work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an excuse I hear?\u201d</p><p>Her grin was sheepish. \u201cMaybe a little one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want, you can come home with me after work and meet him. If he wants to work out, you can borrow something of mine to wear. If not, we can come up with something else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then we\u2019re set.\u201d It would be good for both of us. It would give my dad another look at the normalcy in my life and it would keep Megumi from torturing herself over Michael. \u201cWe\u2019ll head out at five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYOU live here?\u201d Megumi tipped her head back to look at my apartment building. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>Like the others on the tree-lined street, it had history and showed it off with the kinds of architectural detailing contemporary builders didn\u2019t use anymore. The building had been updated and now sheltered residents with a modern glass overhang above the entrance. The addition meshed surprisingly well with the fa?ade.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I said to her, smiling at Paul as he opened the door for us.</p><p>When we exited the elevator on my floor, I forced myself not to glance at Gideon\u2019s door. What would it be like to take a friend home to a place I shared with Gideon?</p><p>I wanted that. Wanted to build that with him.</p><p>I unlocked my apartment and took Megumi\u2019s purse when we stepped inside. \u201cMake yourself at home. I\u2019m just going to let my dad know we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She stared wide-eyed at the open floor plan of the living room and kitchen. \u201cThis place is huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need all this room, really.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cBut who\u2019s going to complain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>I was turning toward the hallway leading to the guest room when my mom emerged from the hall leading to my bedroom and Cary\u2019s, which was on the opposite side of the living area. I came to a halt, startled to see her wearing my skirt and blouse. \u201cMom? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Her reddened eyes locked on a point somewhere around my waist, her skin pale enough to make her makeup look overdone. That was when I realized she was wearing my cosmetics, too. Although we\u2019d been mistaken for sisters on occasion, my gray eyes and soft olive skin tone came from my dad and necessitated a different color palette than the pastels my mom used.</p><p>Queasiness spread through my stomach. \u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t meet my gaze. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realized it was so late.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you wearing my clothes?\u201d I asked, even though I knew.</p><p>\u201cI spilled something on my dress. I\u2019ll get these back to you.\u201d She rushed past me, coming to another abrupt stop when she saw Megumi.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t move; my feet felt rooted to the carpet. My hands fisted at my sides. I knew the walk of shame when I saw it. My chest tightened with anger and disappointment.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Monica.\u201d Megumi came forward to give her a hug. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegumi. Hi.\u201d My mom clearly scrambled for more to say. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see you. I wish I could stay and hang out with you girls, but I really have to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Clancy here?\u201d I asked, not having paid attention to the other vehicles on the street when I\u2019d arrived.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll grab a cab.\u201d She still didn\u2019t look directly at me, even when she turned her head in my direction.</p><p>\u201cMegumi, would you mind sharing a cab with my mom? I\u2019m sorry to flake on you, but I\u2019m suddenly not feeling well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, sure.\u201d She searched my face and I could see her picking up on my change of mood. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>My mom looked at me then and I couldn\u2019t think of a thing to say to her. I was almost as disgusted by the look of guilt on her face as I was by the thought of her cheating on Stanton. If she was going to do it, she could at least own it.</p><p>My dad chose that moment to join us. He walked into the room dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, with bare feet and hair still damp from a shower.</p><p>As always, my luck was impeccably bad.</p><p>\u201cDad, this is my friend Megumi. Megumi, this is my dad, Victor Reyes.\u201d</p><p>As my dad walked to Megumi and shook her hand, my parents gave each other a wide berth. The precaution did nothing to stop the electricity arcing between them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d thought maybe we could hang out,\u201d I told him to fill the sudden awkward silence, \u201cbut now I\u2019m not feeling up to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d my mom said again, grabbing her purse. \u201cMegumi, did you want to ride with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d My friend hugged me good-bye. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later and see how you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I caught her hand and squeezed it before she pulled away.</p><p>The moment the door shut behind them, I headed to my room.</p><p>My dad came after me. \u201cEva, wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be childish about this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I rounded on him. \u201cMy stepdad pays for this apartment. He wanted me to have a place with great security so I\u2019d be safe from Nathan. Were you thinking about that when you were fucking his wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth. You\u2019re still my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. And you know what?\u201d I backed up toward the hallway. \u201cI\u2019ve never been ashamed about that until now.\u201d</p><p>I lay on my bed and stared up the ceiling, wishing I could be with Gideon, but knowing he was in therapy with Dr. Petersen.</p><p>I texted Cary instead: I need u. Come home ASAP.</p><p>It was close to seven when the knock came on my bedroom door. \u201cBaby girl? It\u2019s me. Let me in.\u201d</p><p>I rushed to open it and surged into him, hugging him tight. He picked me up so that my feet left the floor and carried me into the room, kicking the door shut behind him.</p><p>He dropped me on the bed and took a seat beside me, his arm around my shoulders. He smelled good, his cologne familiar. I leaned into him, grateful for his unconditional friendship.</p><p>After a few minutes, I told him. \u201cMy parents slept with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head back to look up at him.</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cI heard \u2019em when I was heading out to the shoot this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww.\u201d My stomach churned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, doesn\u2019t work for me, either,\u201d he muttered. His fingers sifted through my hair. \u201cYour dad\u2019s on the couch looking beat. Did you say something to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately. I was mean, and now I\u2019m feeling awful about it. I need to talk to him but it\u2019s weird, because the person I\u2019m feeling most loyal to is Stanton. I don\u2019t even like the guy half the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been good to you, and to your mom. And getting cheated on is never cool.\u201d</p><p>I groaned. \u201cI\u2019d be less freaked about it if they\u2019d gone somewhere else. I mean, it\u2019d still be wrong, but these are Stanton\u2019s digs. That makes it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cHow would you feel about moving?\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cBecause your parents shagged here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I stood and started pacing. \u201cSecurity was the reason we got this place. It made sense to let Stanton help out when Nathan was a threat and safety was a priority, but now ...\u201d I looked at him. \u201cIt\u2019s all different now. It doesn\u2019t seem right anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove where? Someplace else in New York we can afford on our own? Or out of New York altogether?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave New York,\u201d I assured him. \u201cYour work is here. Mine, too.\u201d</p><p>And Gideon.</p><p>Cary shrugged. \u201cSure. Whatever. I\u2019m game.\u201d</p><p>Walking over to where he still sat on my bed, I hugged him. \u201cWould you mind ordering something in for dinner while I talk to my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot anything particular in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Surprise me.\u201d</p><p>I joined my dad on the couch. He\u2019d been surfing through my tablet but put it aside when I sat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said earlier,\u201d I began. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did.\u201d He scrubbed wearily at the back of his neck. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t blame you. I\u2019m not proud of myself right now. And I have no excuse. I knew better. She knew better.\u201d</p><p>Pulling my legs up, I sat facing him with my shoulder resting against the back of the sofa. \u201cYou guys have a lot of chemistry. I know what that\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>He shot me an examining glance, his gray eyes stormy and serious. \u201cYou have that with Cross. I saw it when he came over for dinner. Are you going to try to work things out with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to. Would you have a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My mouth curved. \u201cBut more than that, I\u2019m ... necessary to him. There\u2019s nothing he wouldn\u2019t do for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why aren\u2019t you together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... it\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it always?\u201d he said ruefully. \u201cListen. You should know ... I\u2019ve loved your mother since the moment I saw her. What happened today shouldn\u2019t have happened, but it meant something to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it.\u201d I reached for his hand. \u201cSo what happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI head home tomorrow. Try to get my head on straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCary and I were talking about coming out to San Diego the weekend after next. We thought we\u2019d drop in and just hang out. See you and Dr. Travis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to Travis about what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You saved my life hooking me up with him,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for that. Mom had been sending me to all these stuffy shrinks and I just couldn\u2019t connect with any of them. I felt like a case study. Dr. Travis made me feel like I was normal. Plus I met Cary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two done talking about me?\u201d As if on cue, Cary walked into the room waving a take-out menu. \u201cI know I\u2019m fascinating, but you might want to save your jaws for the Thai food we\u2019ve got coming. I ordered a ton of it.\u201d</p><p>MY dad caught an eleven o\u2019clock flight out of New York, so I had to leave it to Cary to see him off. We said our good-byes before I left for work, promising to make plans for the trip to San Diego the next time we talked.</p><p>I was in the back of a cab on the way to work when Brett called. For just a moment, I debated letting the call go to voice mail, and then I got over it and answered. \u201cHi, you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, gorgeous.\u201d His voice rolled over my senses like warm chocolate. \u201cReady for tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be. What time is the video launch? When do we need to be in Times Square?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to arrive at six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I don\u2019t know what to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll look amazing no matter what you\u2019ve got on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope. How\u2019s the tour going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having the time of my life.\u201d He laughed, and the husky, sexy sound brought back memories. \u201cIt\u2019s a helluva long way from Pete\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Pete\u2019s.\u201d I\u2019d never forget that bar, although some of the nights I\u2019d spent there were a bit hazy. \u201cAre you excited about tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get to see you. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m excited about the video launch, too.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cI wish I could see you tonight, but I\u2019m taking a red-eye into JFK. Plan on dinner tomorrow, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan Cary come? I invited him to the video launch already. You two know each other, so I figured you wouldn\u2019t mind. Too much, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a cockblocker, Eva. I can restrain myself.\u201d</p><p>The cab pulled over in front of the Crossfire and the driver stopped the meter. I pushed cash through the Plexiglas slot and slid out, leaving the door open for the guy rushing over to hop in. \u201cI thought you liked Cary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but not as much as I like having you to myself. How about we compromise and agree that Cary comes to the launch and you come to dinner alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d I figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to make the situation easier for Gideon to deal with by picking a restaurant he owned. \u201cHow about I make the reservation?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to run.

See you around five.\u201d</p><p>Tucking my phone away, I entered the nearest open elevator. When I got upstairs and was buzzed through the glass security doors, I was greeted by Megumi\u2019s phone thrust in my face.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I pulled back enough to bring the screen into focus. \u201cThree missed calls from Michael.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate guys like him,\u201d she complained. \u201cHot and cold and all over the place. They want you until they have you, then they want something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraight up. You could just avoid his calls, but that\u2019ll drive you crazy. Don\u2019t agree to meet with him, though. Having sex with him again would be bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Megumi nodded. \u201cSex is bad, even when it\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I headed back to my cubicle. I had other things to do besides referee someone else\u2019s love life. Mark was juggling several accounts at once, with three campaigns rolling into the final stages. Creatives were at work and mock-ups were slowly making their way across his desk. That was my favorite part\u2014seeing all the strategizing come together.</p> <p>By ten o\u2019clock, Mark and I were deep into debating the various approaches to a divorce attorney\u2019s ad campaign. We were trying to find the right mix of sympathy for a difficult time in a person\u2019s life and the most prized qualities of a lawyer\u2014the ability to be cunning and ruthless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to need one of these,\u201d he said, somewhat out of the blue.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied, once my brain caught up to the fact that he was talking about divorce attorneys. \u201cYou never will. I\u2019m dying to congratulate Steven at lunch. I\u2019m really so thrilled for you two.\u201d</p><p>Mark\u2019s grin exposed his slightly crooked teeth, which I thought were cute. \u201cI\u2019ve never been happier.\u201d</p><p>It was nearing eleven and we\u2019d switched to a guitar manufacturer\u2019s campaign when my desk phone rang. I ran out to my cubicle to grab it and had my usual greeting cut off by a squeal.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Eva! I just found out we\u2019re both going to be at that Six-Ninths thing tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIreland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d Gideon\u2019s sister was so excited, she sounded younger than her seventeen years. \u201cI love Six-Ninths. Brett Kline is so freakin\u2019 hot. So is Darrin Rumsfeld. He\u2019s the drummer. He\u2019s fine as hell.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed. \u201cDo you happen to like their music, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPfft. That\u2019s a given. Listen\u201d\u2014her voice turned serious\u2014\u201cI think you should try talking to Gideon tomorrow. You know, just kinda walk by and say hi. If you open the door, he\u2019ll totally barge through it, I swear. He misses you like crazy.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back in my chair, I played along. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Like how his voice changes when he talks about you. I can\u2019t explain it, but I\u2019m telling you, he\u2019s dying to get you back. You\u2019re the one who told him to bring me along tomorrow, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot precisely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! I knew it. He always does what you tell him.\u201d She laughed. \u201cThanks, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank him. I\u2019m just looking forward to seeing you again.\u201d</p><p>Ireland was the one person in Gideon\u2019s family for whom he felt untarnished affection, although he tried hard not to show it. I thought maybe he was afraid to be disappointed or afraid he might ruin it somehow. I wasn\u2019t sure what the deal was, but Ireland hero-worshipped her brother and he\u2019d kept his distance, even though he needed love terribly.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll try to talk to him,\u201d she pressed. \u201cYou still love him, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than ever,\u201d I said fervently.</p><p>She was quiet for a minute, then said, \u201cHe\u2019s changed since he met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. I\u2019ve changed, too.\u201d I straightened when Mark stepped out of his office. \u201cI have to get back to work, but we\u2019ll catch up tomorrow. And make plans for that girls\u2019 day we talked about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet. Catch you later!\u201d</p><p>I hung up, pleased that Gideon had followed through and made plans with Ireland. We were making progress, both together and on our own.</p><p>\u201cBaby steps,\u201d I whispered. Then I got back to work.</p><p>AT noon, Mark and I headed out to meet Steven at a French bistro. Once we entered the restaurant, it was easy to spot Mark\u2019s partner, even with the size of the place and the number of diners.</p><p>Steven Ellison was a big guy\u2014tall, broad shouldered, and heavily muscled. He owned his own construction business and preferred to be working the job sites with his crew. But it was his gloriously red hair that really drew the eye. His sister Shawna had the same hair\u2014and the same fun-loving nature.</p><p>\u201cHey, you!\u201d I greeted him with a kiss on the cheek, able to be more familiar with him than I was with my boss. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, darlin\u2019. Mark is finally going to make an honest man out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d take more than marriage to do that,\u201d Mark shot back, pulling out my chair for me.</p><p>\u201cWhen haven\u2019t I been honest with you?\u201d Steven protested.</p><p>\u201cUm, let\u2019s see.\u201d Mark got me settled in my seat, then took the one beside me. \u201cHow about when you swore marriage wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I never said it wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d Steven winked at me, his blue eyes full of mischief. \u201cJust that it wasn\u2019t for most people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was really twisted up over asking you,\u201d I told him. \u201cI felt bad for the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Mark flipped through the menu. \u201cShe\u2019s my witness to your cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel bad for me,\u201d Steven retorted. \u201cI wooed him with wine, roses, and violin players. I spent days practicing my proposal. I still got shot down.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes, but I could tell there was a wound there that hadn\u2019t quite healed. When Mark placed his hand over his partner\u2019s and squeezed, I knew I was right.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019d he do it?\u201d I asked, even though Mark had told me.</p><p>The waitress, asking if we wanted water, interrupted us. We held her back a minute and ordered our food, too, and then Steven started relaying their anniversary night out.</p><p>\u201cHe was sweating like mad,\u201d he went on. \u201cWiping at his face every other minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s summer,\u201d Mark muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnd restaurants and theaters are climate controlled,\u201d Steven shot back. \u201cWe went through the whole night with him like that and finally headed home. I got to thinking he wasn\u2019t going to do it. That the night was gonna end and he still wasn\u2019t going to get the damn words out. And there I am wondering if I\u2019ll have to ask him again, just to get it over with. And if he says no again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say no the first time,\u201d Mark interjected.</p><p>\u201c\u2014I\u2019m going to deck him. Just knock his ass out, toss him on a plane, and head to Vegas, because I\u2019m not getting any younger here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not mellowing with age, either,\u201d Mark grumbled.</p><p>Steven gave him a look. \u201cSo we\u2019re climbing out of the limo, and I\u2019m trying to remember that fan-fucking-tastic proposal I came up with before, and he grabs my elbow and blurts out, \u2018Steve, damn it. You have to marry me.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I laughed, leaning back as the waitress put my side salad in front of me. \u201cJust like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d Steven said, with an emphatic nod.</p><p>\u201cVery heartfelt.\u201d I gave Mark a thumbs-up. \u201cYou rocked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Mark said. \u201cI got it done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you writing your own vows?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause that\u2019ll be really interesting.\u201d</p><p>Steven guffawed, snagging the attention of everyone nearby.</p><p>I swallowed the cherry tomato I was munching on and said, \u201cYou know I\u2019m dying to see your wedding binder, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it just so happens ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d Mark shook his head as Steven reached down and pulled a bulging binder out of a messenger bag on the floor by his chair.</p><p>It was so packed that papers were sticking out of the top, bottom, and side.</p><p>\u201cWait \u2019til you see this cake I found.\u201d Steven pushed the breadbasket aside to make room to open the binder.</p><p>I bit back a grin when I saw the dividers and table of contents.</p><p>\u201cWe are not having a wedding cake in the shape of a skyscraper with cranes and billboards,\u201d Mark said firmly.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, intrigued. \u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>WHEN I got home that night, I dropped my purse and bag off in their usual place, kicked off my shoes, and went straight to the couch. I sprawled across it, staring up the ceiling. Megumi was going to meet me at CrossTrainer at six thirty, so I didn\u2019t have a lot of time, but I felt like I just needed a breather. Starting my period the afternoon before had me riding the edge of irritation and grumpiness, with a dash of exhaustion tossed in for shits and giggles.</p><p>I sighed, knowing I was going to have to deal with my mom at some point. We had a ton of crap to work through, and putting it off was starting to bug me. I wished it were as easy to work things out with her as it was with my dad, but that wasn\u2019t an excuse to avoid addressing our issues. She was my mother and I loved her. It was hard on me when we weren\u2019t getting along.</p><p>Then my thoughts drifted to Corinne. I guess I should have figured that a woman who would leave her husband and move from Paris to New York for a man wasn\u2019t going to give up on him easily, but still. She had to know Gideon well enough to realize hounding him wasn\u2019t going to work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Brett ... what was I going to do about him?</p><p>The intercom buzzed. Frowning, I pushed to my feet and headed over to it. Had Megumi misunderstood and thought we were meeting here? Not that I minded, but ...</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi, Eva,\u201d the guy at the front desk said cheerfully. \u201cNYPD detectives Michna and Graves are here.\u201d</p><p>Crap. Everything else lost significance in that moment. Fear spread through me with crawling fingers of ice.</p><p>I wanted a lawyer with me. Too much was on the line.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t want to seem like I had anything to hide.</p><p>I had to swallow twice before I could answer. \u201cThanks. Can you send them up, please?\u201d</p> <p>14</p><p>MY HEART WAS pounding as I hurried to my purse and silenced the burner phone, tucking it into a zippered pocket. I turned around, looking for anything that might be out of place, anything I should hide. There were the flowers in my bedroom and the card.</p><p>Unless the detectives had a warrant, though, they could only take note of what was in plain sight.</p><p>I ran to shut my door, then went ahead and shut Cary\u2019s, too. I was breathing hard when the doorbell rang. I had to force myself to slow down and walk calmly to the living room. When I reached the front door, I took a deep, calming breath before opening it.</p><p>\u201cHello, detectives.\u201d</p><p>Graves, a rail-thin woman with a severe face and foxlike blue eyes, was in the lead. Her partner, Michna, was the quieter of the two, an older man with receding gray hair and a paunch. They had a rhythm between the two of them\u2014Graves was the heavy who kept the subjects occupied and off-balance. Michna was obviously good at fading into the background while his cop\u2019s eyes cataloged everything and missed nothing. Their success rate had to be pretty high.</p> <p>\u201cCan we come in, Miss Tramell?\u201d Graves asked in a tone that made the question a demand. She\u2019d tied her curly brown hair back and wore a jacket to cover her holstered gun. There was a satchel in her hand.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I pulled the door open wider. \u201cCan I get you anything? Coffee? Water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater would be great,\u201d Michna said.</p><p>I led them to the kitchen and pulled bottled water out of the fridge. The detectives waited at the breakfast bar\u2014Graves with her eyes pinned to me while Michna scoped out his surroundings.</p><p>\u201cYou just get home from work?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I figured they knew the answer, but replied anyway. \u201cA few minutes ago. Would you like to sit in the living room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s good,\u201d Graves said in her no-nonsense way, putting the worn leather satchel on the counter. \u201cWe\u2019d just like to ask you a few questions, if you don\u2019t mind. And show you some photos.\u201d</p><p>I stilled. Could I bear to see any of the photos Nathan had taken of me? For a wild moment, I thought they might be pictures taken at the death scene or even autopsy shots. But I knew that was highly unlikely. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome new information has come to light that could be related to Nathan Barker\u2019s death,\u201d Michna said. \u201cWe\u2019re pursuing all leads, and you may be able to help.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep, shaky breath. \u201cI\u2019m happy to try, of course. But I don\u2019t see how I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you familiar with Andrei Yedemsky?\u201d Graves asked.</p><p>I frowned at her. \u201cNo. Who\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She dug in her bag and pulled out a sheaf of eight-by-ten photos, setting them down in front of me. \u201cThis man. Have you seen him before?\u201d</p><p>Reaching out with shaking fingers, I pulled the top photo toward me. It was of a man in a trench coat, talking to another man about to climb into the back of a waiting town car. He was attractive, with extremely blond hair and tanned skin. \u201cNo. He\u2019s not someone you\u2019d forget meeting, either.\u201d I looked up at her. \u201cShould I know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had pictures of you in his home. Candid shots of you on the street, coming and going. Barker had the same photos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. How did he get them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresumably from Barker,\u201d Michna said.</p><p>\u201cIs that what this Yedemsky guy said? Why would Nathan give him pictures of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYedemsky didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Graves said. \u201cHe\u2019s dead. Murdered.\u201d</p><p>I felt a headache coming on. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t know anything about this man, and I have no idea why he\u2019d know anything about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrei Yedemsky is a known member of the Russian mob,\u201d Michna explained. \u201cIn addition to smuggling alcohol and assault weapons, they\u2019ve also been suspected of trafficking women. It\u2019s possible Barker was making arrangements to sell or trade you for that purpose.\u201d</p><p>I backed away from the counter, shaking my head, unable to process what they were saying. Nathan stalking me was something I could believe. He\u2019d hated me on sight, hated that his father had remarried instead of mourning his mother forever. He\u2019d hated me for getting him locked up in psychiatric treatment, and my being awarded the five-million-dollar settlement he thought of as his inheritance. But the Russian mob? Sex trafficking? I couldn\u2019t comprehend that at all.</p><p>Graves flipped through the photos until she came to one of a platinum sapphire bracelet. An L-square ruler framed it\u2014unmistakably a forensics shot. \u201cDo you recognize this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That belonged to Nathan\u2019s mother. He had it altered to fit him. He never went anywhere without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYedemsky was wearing it when he died,\u201d she said without inflection. \u201cPossibly as a souvenir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf Barker\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>I stared at Graves, who knew better. \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting Yedemsky could be responsible for Nathan\u2019s death? Then who killed Yedemsky?\u201d</p><p>She held my gaze, understanding the motivation behind my question. \u201cHe was taken out by his own people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about that?\u201d I needed to know that they knew Gideon wasn\u2019t involved. Yes, he\u2019d killed for me\u2014to protect me\u2014but he\u2019d never kill just to avoid going to jail.</p><p>Michna frowned at my query. It was Graves who replied. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt. We have the hit on surveillance footage. One of his associates didn\u2019t take too kindly to Yedemsky sleeping with his underage daughter.\u201d</p><p>Hope surged, followed by chilling fear. \u201cSo what happens now? What does this mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know anyone who has connections to the Russian mob?\u201d Michna asked.</p><p>\u201cGod, no,\u201d I said vehemently. \u201cThat\u2019s ... another world. I\u2019m having trouble believing Nathan had any connections. But then it\u2019s been years since I knew him ...\u201d</p><p>I rubbed at the tightness in my chest and looked at Graves. \u201cI want to put this behind me. I want him to stop ruining my life. Is that ever going to happen? Is he going to haunt me even after he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>She quickly and efficiently collected the photos, her face impassive. \u201cWe\u2019ve done all we can. Where you go from here is up to you.\u201d</p><p>I showed up at CrossTrainer at quarter after six. I went because I\u2019d told Megumi I would and I\u2019d already flaked on her once. I also felt a tremendous restlessness, an urge to move that I had to exhaust before it drove me insane. I\u2019d sent a text to Gideon as soon as the detectives left, telling him I needed to see him later, but I hadn\u2019t heard back by the time I\u2019d put my purse in a locker.</p><p>Like all things Gideon, CrossTrainer was impressive in both size and amenities. The three-story club\u2014one of hundreds around the country\u2014had everything a fitness enthusiast could want, as well as spa services and a smoothie bar.</p><p>Megumi was slightly overwhelmed and needed help with some of the high-tech machinery, so she was taking advantage of the trainer-supervised workout for new members and guests. I got on a treadmill. I started out at a brisk walk, warming up, and then eventually progressed to a run. Once I hit my stride, I let my thoughts run, too.</p><p>Was it possible that Gideon and I were free to pick up the pieces of our lives and move on? How? Why? My mind raced with questions that I needed to ask Gideon\u2014with the hope that he was as clueless as I was. He couldn\u2019t be involved in Yedemsky\u2019s death. I wouldn\u2019t believe he was.</p><p>I ran until my thighs and calves burned, until sweat ran down my body in steady streams and my lungs ached with the effort of breathing.</p><p>It was Megumi who finally got me to stop, waving her hand in my line of sight as she moved in front of my treadmill. \u201cI am so totally impressed right now. You\u2019re a machine.\u201d</p><p>I slowed my pace to a jog, then a walk, before stopping altogether. Grabbing my towel and water bottle, I stepped off, feeling the effects of pushing myself too long and hard.</p><p>\u201cI hate running,\u201d I confessed, still panting. \u201cHow\u2019d your workout go?\u201d</p><p>Megumi looked chic even in gym clothes. Her chartreuse racerback tank had bright blue threading that matched her spandex leggings. The ensemble was summer-bright and stylish.</p><p>She bumped shoulders with me. \u201cYou make me feel like an underachiever. I just did a circuit and checked out the hot guys. The trainer I worked with was good, but I wish I\u2019d gotten that guy instead.\u201d</p><p>I followed the point of her finger. \u201cThat\u2019s Daniel. Want to meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>I walked with her toward the mats in the center of the open space, waving at Daniel when he lifted his gaze and caught sight of us. Megumi quickly yanked out the rubber band holding her hair back, but I thought she\u2019d looked great with it on, too. She had beautiful skin and I envied her mouth.</p><p>\u201cEva, great seeing you.\u201d Daniel extended his hand to me for a shake. \u201cWho\u2019s this you have with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend Megumi. She just joined today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you working with Tara.\u201d He flashed Megumi his megawatt smile. \u201cI\u2019m Daniel. If you ever need help with anything, just let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take you up on that,\u201d she warned, as she shook his hand.</p><p>\u201cPlease do. Do you have any particular fitness goals?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As they started talking more in-depth, my gaze wandered. I checked out the equipment, looking for something easy I could do while I waited for them to wrap it up. Instead I found a familiar sight.</p><p>Tossing my towel over my shoulder, I noticed my not-so-favorite reporter on the floor. I took a deep breath and walked over, watching her do curls with a ten-pound hand weight. Her dark brown hair was in a fishtail braid, her long legs on display in skintight shorts, and her stomach tight and flat. She looked great. \u201cHi, Deanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ask if you come here often,\u201d she replied, setting the weight back on the rack and standing, \u201cbut that\u2019s too clich\u00e9d. How are you, Eva?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good. You?\u201d</p><p>Her smile had the edge that never failed to get my back up. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it bother you that Gideon Cross buries his sins under all his money?\u201d</p><p>So Gideon had been right about Ian Hager disappearing once he\u2019d gotten paid. \u201cIf I really thought you were after the truth, I\u2019d give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all true, Eva. I\u2019ve talked to Corinne Giroux.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? How\u2019s her husband?\u201d</p> <p>Deanna laughed. \u201cGideon should hire you to manage his public image.\u201d</p><p>That struck uncomfortably close to home. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go to his office and chew him out? Let him have it. Throw a drink in his face or slap him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t care. It wouldn\u2019t make a damn bit of difference to him.\u201d</p><p>I wiped at the sweat still sliding down my temples and admitted that might be true. I knew damn well Gideon could be a coldhearted ass. \u201cEither way, you\u2019d probably feel a whole lot better.\u201d</p><p>Deanna snatched her towel off the bench. \u201cI know exactly what\u2019ll make me feel better. Enjoy the rest of your workout, Eva. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be talking again soon.\u201d</p><p>She sauntered off and I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she was on to something. It made me twitchy not knowing what it was.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m done,\u201d Megumi said, joining me. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one important.\u201d My stomach chose that moment to growl, loudly announcing that I\u2019d burned off the boeuf bourguignon I\u2019d had for lunch.</p><p>\u201cWorking out always makes me hungry, too. You want to grab dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d We set off toward the showers, skirting equipment and other members. \u201cI\u2019ll call Cary and see if he wants to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cHave I told you I think he\u2019s delicious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than once.\u201d I waved bye to Daniel before we left the floor.</p><p>We reached the locker room and Megumi tossed her towel in the discard bin just inside the entrance. I paused before dropping mine, my thumb rubbing over the embroidered CrossTrainer logo. I thought of the towels hanging in Gideon\u2019s bathroom.</p><p>Maybe next time I\u2019d be calling him, too, asking him to join friends and me for dinner.</p> <p>Maybe the worst was over.</p><p>WE found an Indian restaurant near the gym and Cary showed up for dinner with Trey, the two of them walking in with their hands linked together. Our table was right in front of the street-level window by the entrance, which lent the pulse of the city to our dining experience.</p><p>We sat on cushions on the floor, drank a little too much wine, and let Cary run commentary on the people passing by. I could almost see little hearts in Trey\u2019s eyes when he looked at my best friend, and I was happy to see Cary being openly affectionate in return. When Cary was really into someone, he held himself back from touching him or her. I deliberately chose to see his frequent, casual touching with Trey as a sign of the two men growing closer, rather than Cary losing interest.</p><p>Megumi got another call from Michael while we were eating, which she ignored. When Cary asked if she was playing hard to get, she told him the story.</p><p>\u201cIf he calls again, let me answer it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, no,\u201d I groaned.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cary blinked innocently. \u201cI can say she\u2019s too tied up to get to the phone and Trey can bark out sex commands in the background.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiabolical!\u201d Megumi rubbed her hands together. \u201cMichael\u2019s not the right guy for that, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll take you up on that offer someday, knowing my luck with men.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I dug stealthily into my purse for the burner phone and was bummed to see there was still no reply from Gideon.</p><p>Cary made a show of peering over the table. \u201cYou hoping for a booty call from loverman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Megumi\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing someone and didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p><p>I shot a narrow-eyed look at Cary. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the total opposite of complicated,\u201d Cary drawled, rocking back on his pillow. \u201cIt\u2019s straight-up lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Cross?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Cary shot back.</p><p>Megumi persisted. \u201cHe wants her back.\u201d</p><p>It was Cary\u2019s turn to glare at me. \u201cWhen did you talk to him?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHe called Mom. And he didn\u2019t say he wanted me back.\u201d</p><p>Cary\u2019s smile was sly. \u201cWould you ditch your new loverman for a repeat with Cross, the marathon man?\u201d</p><p>Megumi poked me in the leg. \u201cGideon Cross is a marathon man in bed? Holy shit ... And he looks like that. Jesus.\u201d She fanned herself with her hand.</p><p>\u201cCan we please stop talking about my sex life?\u201d I muttered, looking to Trey for a little support.</p><p>He jumped in. \u201cCary tells me you two are going to a video premiere tomorrow. I didn\u2019t realize music videos were a big thing anymore.\u201d</p><p>I grasped at the lifeline gratefully. \u201cI know, right? Surprises me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s good ol\u2019 Brett,\u201d Cary said, leaning across the table toward Megumi like he was about to impart a secret. \u201cWe\u2019ll call him backstage man. Or backseat man.\u201d</p><p>I stuck my fingers in my glass and flicked water at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Eva. You\u2019re making me wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it up,\u201d I warned,\u201d and you\u2019ll be soaked.\u201d</p><p>I still hadn\u2019t heard from Gideon by the time we got home at quarter to ten. Megumi had taken the subway back to her place, while Cary, Trey, and I shared a cab back to the apartment. The guys headed straight to Cary\u2019s room, but I lingered in the kitchen, debating whether I should run next door and see if Gideon was there.</p><p>I was about to pull my keys out of my purse when Cary came into the kitchen, shirtless and barefoot.</p><p>He grabbed whipped cream out of the fridge but paused before he headed back out. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk to your mom yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m planning on it.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his hip against the counter. \u201cAnything else on your mind?\u201d</p><p>I shooed him off. \u201cGo have fun. I\u2019m all right. We can talk tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that. What time should I be ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrett wants to pick us up at five, so can you meet me at the Crossfire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He leaned over and pressed a kiss to the top of my head. \u201cSweet dreams, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>I waited until I heard Cary\u2019s door shut, then grabbed my keys and went next door. The moment I entered the dark and quiet apartment, I knew Gideon wasn\u2019t there, but I searched the rooms anyway. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was ... off.</p><p>Where was he?</p><p>Deciding to call Angus, I walked back to my apartment, grabbed the burner phone, and took it into my bedroom.</p><p>And found Gideon gripped in a nightmare.</p><p>Startled, I shoved my door shut and locked it. He thrashed on my bed, his back arching with a hiss of pain. He was still dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, his big body stretched atop the comforter as if he\u2019d fallen asleep waiting for me. His laptop had been knocked to the floor, still open, and papers were crackling under the violence of his movements.</p><p>I rushed to him, trying to figure out a way to wake him that wouldn\u2019t put me in danger, knowing he\u2019d hate himself if he hurt me by accident.</p><p>He growled, a low feral sound of aggression. \u201cNever,\u201d he bit out. \u201cYou\u2019ll never touch her again.\u201d</p><p>I froze.</p><p>His body jerked violently, and then he moaned and curled to his side, shuddering.</p><p>The sound of his pain galvanized me. I climbed onto the bed, my hand touching his shoulder. The next moment I was on my back, pinned as he loomed over me, his eyes fixed and sightless. Fear paralyzed me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to know what it feels like,\u201d he whispered darkly, his hips ramming against mine in a sick imitation of the love we shared.</p><p>I turned my head and bit his biceps, my teeth barely denting the rigid muscle.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d He yanked away from me and I dislodged him as Parker had taught me to do, throwing him to the side and freeing myself to leap from the bed and run.</p><p>\u201cEva!\u201d</p><p>Spinning, I faced him, my body poised to fight.</p><p>He slid from the bed, nearly landing on his knees before he found his balance and straightened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I fell asleep ... Christ, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, with forced calm. \u201cRelax.\u201d</p><p>He raked a hand through his hair, his chest heaving. His face was sheened with sweat, his eyes reddened. \u201cGod.\u201d</p><p>I stepped closer, fighting the lingering fear. This was part of our lives. We both had to face it. \u201cDo you remember the dream?\u201d</p><p>Gideon swallowed hard and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it. You have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were dreaming about Nathan. How often do you do that?\u201d I reached him and took his hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d he snapped, bristling. \u201cI rarely remember my dreams.\u201d</p><p>I pulled him toward the bathroom, deliberately keeping him moving forward both physically and mentally. \u201cThe detectives came to see me today.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The hoarseness of his voice concerned me. How long had he been asleep and dreaming? The thought of him tormented by his own mind, alone and in pain, wounded me. \u201cDid they visit you, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But they\u2019ve been making inquiries.\u201d</p> <p>I flicked the lights on and he stopped, his grip tightening to make me stop, too. \u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHop in the shower, ace. We\u2019ll talk when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>He cupped my face in his hands, his thumbs brushing over my cheekbone. \u201cYou\u2019re moving too fast. Slow down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get hung up every time you have a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a minute,\u201d he murmured, lowering his forehead to rest against mine. \u201cI frightened you. I\u2019m frightened. Let\u2019s just take a minute and deal with that.\u201d</p> <p>I softened, my hand coming up to rest over his racing heart.</p><p>He buried his nose in my hair. \u201cLet me smell you, angel. Feel you. Say I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not okay,\u201d he argued, his voice still low and coaxing. \u201cI should\u2019ve waited for you at our place.\u201d</p><p>I rested my cheek against his chest, loving the idea of \u201cour\u201d place. \u201cI\u2019ve been checking my phone all night, waiting for a text or message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked late.\u201d His hands slid under my shirt, brushing over the bare skin of my back. \u201cThen I came here. I wanted to surprise you ... make love to you ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we might be free,\u201d I whispered, clutching at his shirt. \u201cThe detectives ... I think we\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathan had this bracelet he always wore\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSapphires. Very feminine.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey found it on the arm of a dead mob guy. Russian Mafia. They\u2019re running with the theory that it was a criminal association gone bad.\u201d</p><p>Gideon stood very still, his gaze narrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird. They were talking about photos of me and sex trafficking, which just doesn\u2019t mesh with\u2014\u201d</p><p>His fingers pressed against my lips, quieting me. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting because Nathan was wearing that bracelet when I left him.\u201d</p><p>I watched Gideon take a shower while I brushed my teeth. His soapy hands slid over his body with economical indifference, his movements brisk and rough. There was none of the intimate worship I caressed him with, none of the awe or love. He was done in minutes, stepping out of the shower in all his nude glory before grabbing a towel and scrubbing away the water on his skin.</p><p>He came up behind me when he was done, gripping my hips and pressing a kiss to my nape. \u201cI don\u2019t have any underworld ties,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I finished rinsing my mouth and looked at him through the mirror. \u201cDoes it bother you to have to say that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather say it than have you ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone went to a lot of trouble to protect you.\u201d Turning, I faced him. \u201cCould it be Angus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Tell me how the mob guy died.\u201d</p><p>My fingertips drifted over the ridges of his abdomen, loving the way the muscles flexed and clenched in response to my touch. \u201cOne of his own took him out. Retaliation. He was under surveillance, so Graves said they\u2019ve got proof of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s someone connected, then. To either the mob or the authorities, or both. Whoever\u2019s responsible, they chose a fall guy who could take the blame and not pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care who arranged it, just so long as you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my forehead. \u201cWe need to care,\u201d he said softly. \u201cTo protect me, they have to know what I did.\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>SHORTLY AFTER FIVE in the morning, I went from unconscious to wide awake in a heartbeat. The remnants of a dream clung to me, one in which I\u2019d still believed Gideon and I had broken up. Loneliness and grief weighed me down, pinning me to the bed for several minutes. I wished Gideon were beside me. I wished I could just roll over and press my body to his.</p><p>Partly due to my period, we hadn\u2019t had sex the night before. Instead, we had enjoyed the simple comfort of just being together. We\u2019d curled up on my bed and watched television until the exhaustion of my overkill run on the treadmill pulled me under.</p><p>I loved those quiet moments when we just held each other. When the sexual attraction simmered just beneath the surface. I loved the feel of his breath on my skin and the way my curves fit into his hard planes as if we\u2019d been designed for each other.</p><p>Sighing, I knew what had me on edge. It was Thursday and Brett was coming to New York, if he wasn\u2019t in the city already.</p><p>Gideon and I were just starting to find a new rhythm again, which made it the worst possible time for Brett to come back into my life. I was anxious about something going wrong, some gesture or look that would be misconstrued and cause fresh problems for Gideon and me to work through.</p><p>It\u2019d be the first time Gideon and I would be out together in public since our \u201cbreakup.\u201d That was going to be torture. Standing next to Brett while my heart was with Gideon.</p><p>Sliding from bed, I went to the bathroom and cleaned up, and then pulled on a pair of shorts and a tank top. I needed to be with Gideon. We needed to spend some time together before the day started with a vengeance.</p><p>I moved quietly from my apartment to his, feeling slightly naughty as I ran down the corridor to his\u2014our\u2014front door.</p><p>Once I\u2019d gone inside, I tossed my keys on the breakfast bar and headed down the hallway to the guest room. He wasn\u2019t there and my heart sank, but I kept searching, because I could feel him. There was a tingling awareness I experienced only when he was nearby.</p><p>I found him in the master bedroom, his arms wrapped around my pillow as he slept partially on his stomach. The sheet clung to his hips, leaving his powerful back and sculpted arms bare, and revealing just a hint of the topmost curve of his amazing ass.</p><p>He looked like an erotic fantasy come to life. And he was mine.</p><p>I loved him so much.</p><p>And I wanted him to wake up to me, at least once, with pleasure instead of fear, sadness, and regret.</p><p>I undressed quietly in the early light of dawn, my thoughts spinning with ways I could pleasure my man. I wanted to run my hands and mouth all over him, make him breathless and hot, feel his body quiver. I wanted to reaffirm our connection to each other, my whole and irrevocable commitment to him, before the harsh realities we faced came between us.</p><p>As my knee sank into the mattress, he stirred. I crawled to him, pressing my lips to the small of his back and working my way up slowly.</p><p>\u201cUmm. Eva,\u201d he said in a husky voice, lightly stretching beneath me.</p><p>\u201cYou better hope it\u2019s me, ace.\u201d I nipped his shoulder blade. \u201cThis would turn out bad for you, if not.\u201d</p><p>I lowered onto him, laying my body over his. His warmth was divine and I took a moment to savor it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early for you,\u201d he murmured, resting easily, just as content as I was to be touching each other.</p><p>\u201cWay,\u201d I agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re hugging my pillow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmells like you. Helps me sleep.\u201d</p><p>I brushed his hair aside and pressed my lips to his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful thing to say. I wish I could lie around like this with you for the entire day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember I want to take you away this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I ran my hand over his biceps, my fingers gliding over the hard muscle. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave as soon as you get off work on Friday and fly back just in time for work Monday. You won\u2019t need anything but your passport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you.\u201d I kissed his shoulder, then spoke in a nervous rush. \u201cI want you and came prepared to have you, but it could be messy. I mean, it\u2019s the tail end, so maybe not, but if period sex isn\u2019t your thing\u2014which I\u2019d totally get, because it has never been my thing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my thing, angel. I\u2019ll take you any way I can get you.\u201d</p><p>He flexed, warning me he was going to turn around. I slid to the side, watching his body roll with a fluid rippling of muscle.</p><p>\u201cSit up for me,\u201d I told him, thinking he was even more amazing than I\u2019d given him credit for. Or more horny, which I would never hold against him. \u201cWith your back against the headboard.\u201d</p><p>He arranged himself to my liking, looking sleepy-eyed and sexy, his jaw shadowed with stubble. I climbed into his lap, straddling him. I took a long moment to savor the attraction between us, the delicious and provocative edge of danger he exuded even while at rest. Because Gideon wasn\u2019t tamed and never would be. Just like a panther still had its claws, even when they were sheathed.</p><p>That was one of my joys. He gentled for me but remained true to himself. He was still the man I\u2019d fallen in love with\u2014hard with rough edges\u2014yet he\u2019d changed, too. He was all things to me, everything I wanted and needed in one imperfect man.</p><p>Smoothing his hair back from his face, I traced the curve of his lower lip with the tip of my tongue. His hands, so warm and strong, gripped my hips. His mouth opened, his tongue touching mine.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d Tilting his head, he took over the kiss, deepening it. His lips, so firm yet soft, pressed against mine. His tongue stroked deep, licking and tasting. The soft rasp of it against the tender flesh inside my mouth caused goose bumps to spread in a wave over my skin. His cock began to thicken and lengthen between us, the silky flesh hot against my lower belly.</p><p>My nipples tightened, aching, and I shimmied, rubbing them against his chest.</p><p>One of his hands cupped my nape, capturing me, holding me steady as he kissed me passionately. His mouth slanted across mine, seeking and ravenous, sucking on my lips and tongue. Moaning, I arched into him, my fingers clutching at his black hair.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you turn me on,\u201d he growled, pulling his knees up. He urged me back, his body forming a cradle that supported me. His hands cupped my breasts, his thumbs circling the hard points of my nipples. \u201cLook at you. You\u2019re so fucking gorgeous.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Warmth spread through me. \u201cGideon ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you\u2019re this icy, hands-off blonde.\u201d His jaw tightened and he slipped one hand between my legs, his fingers gliding gently through my cleft. \u201cAnd then you\u2019re like this. So hot and needy. Wanting my hands all over you, my cock inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m like this for you. This is what you do to me. What you\u2019ve been doing to me from the moment I met you.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s gaze slid over me, followed by his hand. As his fingertips caressed the outside curve of my breast and stroked over my clit at the same time, I shivered.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cAnd here I am\u2014naked.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved in a slow, sexy smile. \u201cI couldn\u2019t miss that.\u201d</p><p>The tip of his finger circled my opening. I lifted a little to give him better access, my hands sliding over his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t talking about sex,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAlthough I want that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you,\u201d he agreed. His thumb brushed feather light over my nipple. \u201cForever and always.\u201d</p><p>I moaned and reached for his cock, gripping him in my hands, stroking him from root to tip.</p><p>\u201cI look at you, angel, and I want you so badly. I want to be with you, listen to you, talk to you. I want to hear you laugh and hold you when you cry. I want to sit next to you, breathe the same air, share the same life. I want to wake up to you like this every day forever. I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d I leaned forward and kissed him softly. \u201cI want you, too.\u201d</p><p>He teased the tip of my breast, tugging and rolling the hardened peak between his fingers. He rubbed my clit and a soft sound escaped me. Gideon hardened in my hands, his body responding to my growing desire.</p><p>The room was lightening as the sun rose higher, but the world outside seemed a lifetime away. The intimacy of the moment was both searing and sweet, filling me with joy.</p><p>My hands caressed his erection with tender reverence, my only goal to please him and show him how much I loved him. He touched me the same way, his eyes windows to a wounded soul that needed me as much as I needed him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy with you, Eva. You make me happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you happy the rest of your life,\u201d I promised him. My hips churned, desire sliding hot and thick through my veins. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I want more.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, Gideon flicked the tip of his tongue over my nipple, a quick swipe that sent a sharp ache through my breast. \u201cI love your tits. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so that\u2019s what did you in\u2014the rack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep teasing me, angel. Give me an excuse to spank you. I love your ass, too.\u201d</p> <p>He pressed a hand to my back, arching me toward his mouth. Hot wetness surrounded the sensitive peak of my breast. His cheeks hollowed on a deep suck and my sex echoed his mouth, hungry for his cock.</p><p>I felt him everywhere, all around me and inside me. His heat and warmth. His passion. In my hands, his cock was hard and throbbing, the plush head slick with pre-cum.</p><p>\u201cTell me you love me,\u201d I pleaded.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s eyes met mine. \u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine if I never said the words to you. If you never heard them from me.\u201d</p><p>His chest expanded on a deep breath. \u201cCrossfire.\u201d</p><p>My hands stilled on him.</p><p>He swallowed, his throat working. \u201cIt\u2019s your word for when things get to be too much, when it\u2019s too intense. It\u2019s my word, too, because that\u2019s how you make me feel. All the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon, I ...\u201d He\u2019d made me speechless.</p><p>\u201cWhen you say it, it means stop.\u201d His fingertips left my breast and slid down my cheek. \u201cWhen I say it, it means never stop. Whatever you\u2019re doing to me, I need you to keep doing it.\u201d</p><p>Lifting, I hovered above him. \u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His fingers left my cleft, and a heartbeat later his cock was filling me, the flared crown stretching sensitive tissues.</p><p>\u201cSlow,\u201d he ordered softly, his gaze hooded as he licked his fingers with long, sensuous laps of his tongue. He looked so wicked, so shamelessly decadent.</p><p>\u201cHelp me.\u201d It was always more difficult for me to take him this way, using only gravity and the weight of my body. As desperate as he\u2019d made me, he was still a tight fit.</p><p>He caught my hips, sliding me up and down leisurely, working me onto his thick erection. \u201cFeel every inch, angel,\u201d he crooned. \u201cFeel how hard you make me.\u201d</p><p>My thighs trembled as he rubbed over a tender spot inside me. I gripped his wrists, my sex rippling.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come,\u201d he warned, with that authoritative bite that practically ensured I would. \u201cNot until you\u2019ve taken all of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d The slow, steady friction of his careful penetration was driving me insane.</p><p>\u201cThink of how good it feels when I\u2019m in you, angel. When your greedy little cunt has something to tighten down on when you\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>I tightened down on him then, seduced by the coaxing rasp in his voice. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who has to let me in.\u201d His eyes gleamed with humor. He urged me to lean back, changing the angle of my descent.</p><p>I slid onto him, taking him to the root in one smooth, slick glide. \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d His head fell back, his breathing quick and rough. \u201cYou feel amazing. You\u2019re squeezing me like a fist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d I couldn\u2019t hide the plea in my voice. He was so hard and thick inside me, so deep I could barely catch my breath ...</p><p>He shot me a look that scorched. \u201cI want this. You and me, nothing between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said fervently, panting. Wriggling. Losing my mind. I needed to come so badly.</p><p>\u201cShh. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d Lifting his thumb to his mouth, Gideon licked the pad, then reached between us, rubbing my clit with expertly applied pressure. Heat bloomed across my skin in a mist of sweat, the flush spreading until I felt feverish.</p><p>I climaxed in a searing rush of pleasure, my sex spasming in hard, desperate clutches. His growl was a sound of pure animal sexuality, his cock swelling in response to the covetous milking of my body.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t come, which made my orgasm all the more intimate. I was open, vulnerable, wrenched by desire. And he watched me fall apart with those haunting blue eyes, his control absolute. The fact that he didn\u2019t move, just held himself deep, enhanced the feeling of connection between us.</p><p>A tear slid down my cheek, the orgasm pushing my emotions over the edge.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said hoarsely, his hands sliding up my back and pulling me into him. He licked the tear away, then nudged me sweetly with the tip of his nose. My breasts pressed against his chest, my arms went around his waist, slipping into the space between him and the headboard. I held him close, my body quivering with aftershocks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSo soft and sweet. Kiss me, angel.\u201d</p><p>Tilting my head, I offered him my mouth. The melding was hot and wet, an erotic mixture of his unsated lust and my overwhelming love.</p><p>I pushed my fingers into his hair, cupping the back of his head to hold him still. He did the same to me, the two of us communicating without words. His lips sealed over mine, his tongue fucking my mouth even as his cock remained unmoving inside me.</p><p>I felt the undercurrent of strain in his kiss and his touch, and I knew he worried about the day\u2019s events, too. I arched my back, curving into him, wishing I could make us inseparable. His teeth caught my lower lip, sinking gently into the swollen curve. I whimpered and he murmured, soothing me with rhythmic strokes of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he said hoarsely, restraining me with his grip at my nape. \u201cI want to come just feeling you around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I breathed. \u201cCome in me. Let me feel you.\u201d</p><p>We were completely entwined, grasping and pulling at each other, his cock rigid inside me, our hands in each other\u2019s hair, our lips and tongues mating frantically.</p><p>Gideon was mine, completely. Yet still some part of my mind was stunned that I had him like this, that he was naked in a bed we shared, in an apartment we shared, that he was inside me, a part of me, taking every bit of my love and passion and giving me back so much more.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I moaned, tightening my core and squeezing him. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva. God.\u201d He shuddered, coming. He groaned into my mouth, his hands flexing against my scalp, his breath gusting hard across my lips.</p><p>I felt him spurting inside me, filling me, and I trembled with another orgasm, the pleasure pulsing gently through me.</p><p>His hands roamed restlessly, rubbing up and down my back, his kiss that perfect blend of love and desire. I felt his gratitude and need, recognized it because I felt the same way.</p><p>It was a miracle that I\u2019d found him, that he could make me feel this way, that I could love a man so deeply and completely and sexually with all the baggage I carried. And that I could offer the same refuge to him in return.</p><p>Laying my cheek against his chest, I listened to his heart pounding, his perspiration mingling with mine.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d He exhaled harshly. \u201cThose answers you want from me ... I need you to ask the questions.\u201d</p><p>I held him for a long minute, waiting for our bodies to recover and my own panic to subside. He was still inside me. We were as close as we could be, but it wasn\u2019t enough for him. He had to have more, on every front. He wasn\u2019t going to quit until he possessed every part of me and infiltrated every aspect of my life.</p><p>Pulling back, I looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, Gideon. You don\u2019t have to push yourself if you\u2019re not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am ready.\u201d His gaze held mine, blazing with power and determination. \u201cI need you to be ready. Because it won\u2019t be long before I\u2019m going to ask you a question, Eva. And I\u2019m going to need you to give me the right answer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon,\u201d I whispered, my throat tight. I lifted slightly, trying to gain some distance, but he pulled me back and held me down. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d he reminded, his jaw set. \u201cAnd neither am I. Why put off the inevitable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way you need to look at it. We\u2019ve got too many triggers. If we\u2019re not careful, one or both of us will shut down, cut the other one\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAsk me, Eva,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cGideon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated by his obstinacy, I stewed for a minute, then decided that whatever the reason, there were questions that needed answers no matter what. \u201cDr. Lucas. Do you know why he lied to your mother?\u201d</p><p>His jaw worked as he clenched his teeth, his eyes turning hard and cold. \u201cHe was protecting his brother-in-law.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I sat back, my thoughts spinning. \u201cAnne\u2019s brother? The woman you were sleeping with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking,\u201d he corrected harshly. \u201cEveryone in Anne\u2019s family is in the mental health field. The whole fucked-up lot of them. She\u2019s a shrink. Did any of your Google searches dig that up?\u201d</p><p>I nodded absently, more concerned with the vehemence with which he said the word shrink, practically spitting it out. Was that why he hadn\u2019t gotten help before? And how much did he love me to make the effort to see Dr. Petersen despite his loathing?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it right away,\u201d he went on. \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure out why Lucas lied. He\u2019s a pediatrician, for chrissakes. He\u2019s supposed to care about kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew that. He\u2019s supposed to be human!\u201d Rage filled me, a white-hot desire to find Lucas and hurt him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he could look me in the eye like he did and say all that shit he said.\u201d</p><p>Blaming Gideon for everything ... trying to drive a wedge between us ...</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I met you that I finally started to get it,\u201d he said, his hands tightening around my waist. \u201cHe loves Anne. Maybe as much as I love you. Enough to overlook her cheating and cover up for her brother to spare her the truth. Or embarrassment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be practicing medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why is his office in one of your buildings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought the building because his practice is in it. Helps me keep an eye on him and how well he\u2019s doing ... or not.\u201d</p><p>Something about the way he said \u201cor not\u201d led me to wonder: Did he have anything to do with Lucas\u2019s less profitable times? I remembered when Cary had been taken to the hospital and how special arrangements had been made for him and for me, because Gideon was such a generous benefactor. How much could he influence?</p><p>If there were ways to put Lucas at a disadvantage, I was certain Gideon knew them all.</p><p>\u201cAnd the brother-in-law?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p> <p>Gideon\u2019s chin lifted and his gaze narrowed. \u201cThe statute of limitations ran out for me, but I confronted him, told him if he ever went into practice or laid a hand on another child I\u2019d set up an unlimited fund dedicated to prosecuting him civilly and criminally on behalf of his victims. Shortly after that, he killed himself.\u201d</p><p>The last was said without inflection, which made the hairs on my nape stand on end. I shivered with a sudden chill that came from inside me.</p><p>He rubbed his hands up and down my arms, trying to warm me, but he didn\u2019t pull me into him. \u201cHugh was married. Had a child. A boy. Just a few years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d I hugged him, understanding. He\u2019d lost a father to suicide, too. \u201cWhat Hugh chose to do isn\u2019t your fault. You\u2019re not responsible for the decisions he made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t I?\u201d he asked, with that ice in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d I held him as tight as I could, willing my love into his tense, rigid body. \u201cAnd the boy ... His father\u2019s death might have prevented him from experiencing what you did. Have you thought of that?\u201d</p><p>His chest lifted and fell roughly. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve thought of it. But he doesn\u2019t know what his father was. He only knows that his dad is gone, by choice, and he\u2019s left behind. He\u2019ll believe his father didn\u2019t care enough about him to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d I pulled his head toward me, urging him to rest against me. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I couldn\u2019t make excuses for Geoffrey Cross and I knew Gideon was thinking of him, as well as the boy he himself had once been. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to stay, Eva,\u201d he whispered, his arms finally coming around me. \u201cAnd you\u2019re holding back. It\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>I rocked gently, cradling him. \u201cI\u2019m being cautious because you\u2019re so important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not fair to ask you to be with me\u201d\u2014his head tilted back\u2014\u201cwhen we can\u2019t even sleep in the same bed, but I\u2019ll love you better than anyone else could. I\u2019ll take care of you and make you happy. I know I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d I brushed his hair back from his temples and wanted to cry when I saw the longing on his face. \u201cI want you to believe I\u2019ll stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot of you.\u201d I sighed, trying to pull the words together in a way that made sense. \u201cI can\u2019t ... I can\u2019t just be an extension of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d His features softened. \u201cI can\u2019t change who I am, and I don\u2019t want to change who you are. I just want us to be who we are\u2014together.\u201d</p><p>I kissed him. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I wanted us to live the same life, too, to be together in every way we could be. But I also believed that neither of us was ready.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d I kissed him again, my lips clinging to his. \u201cYou and me, we\u2019re barely strong enough on our own. We\u2019re getting better all the time, but we\u2019re not there yet. It\u2019s not just about the nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what it\u2019s about, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. I don\u2019t know ... It\u2019s not right for me to live in a place Stanton pays for anymore now that Nathan isn\u2019t a threat. And especially not now that my parents hooked up.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I confirmed. \u201cTotal mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove in with me,\u201d he said, rubbing my back to comfort me.</p><p>\u201cSo ... I skip right over making it on my own? Am I always going to live off someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d He made a frustrated noise. \u201cWould you feel better if we shared the rent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Like I could afford your penthouse, even paying just a third of it. And there\u2019s no way Cary could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll move in here or next door, if you want, and take over the lease. I don\u2019t care where, Eva.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, wanting what he was offering but afraid I\u2019d miss a big pitfall that would hurt us.</p><p>\u201cYou came to me as soon as you got up this morning,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cYou don\u2019t like being away from me, either. Why torture ourselves? Sharing the same space should be the least of our problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to screw this up,\u201d I told him, my fingers brushing over his chest. \u201cI need us to work, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>He caught my hand and pressed it over his heart. \u201cI need us to work, too, angel. And I want mornings like this and nights like last night while we do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one even knows we\u2019re seeing each other. How do we go from being broken up to living together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe start today. You\u2019re taking Cary with you to the video launch. I\u2019ll come up to the both of you with Ireland, say hi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called me,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cand told me to go up to you. She wants us to get back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a smart girl.\u201d He smiled and I felt a little thrill at the thought that he might be opening up to her. \u201cSo one of us will approach the other, make small talk, and I\u2019ll say hi to Cary. You and I won\u2019t have to fake the attraction between us. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll take you out to lunch. Bryant Park Grill would be ideal. We\u2019ll make a show of it.\u201d</p><p>It all sounded wonderful and easy, but ... \u201cIs it safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinding Nathan\u2019s bracelet on a criminal\u2019s corpse opens the door to reasonable doubt. That\u2019s all we need.\u201d</p><p>We looked at each other, sharing the feeling of hope, the sense of excitement and expectation in a future that had seemed so much more uncertain just yesterday.</p><p>He touched my cheek. \u201cYou made a reservation at Tableau One for tonight.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah, I had to use your name to get on the list, but Brett asked me out to dinner and I wanted us to go to a place connected with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIreland and I have a reservation at the same time. We\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p><p>I shifted awkwardly, nervous at the thought, and Gideon thickened inside me. \u201cUh ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he murmured, his focus clearly shifting to more heated thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>Banding his arms around my hips and shoulder blades, Gideon scooped me up and moved, rolling and putting me beneath him. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>I was going to reply, but he kissed me quiet and fucked me senseless.</p><p>I showered and dressed at Gideon\u2019s, then hurried back down the hallway to my apartment for my purse and bag, trying not to look like I was sneaking around. It was easy to get ready at Gideon\u2019s apartment, since he\u2019d stocked the bathroom with all my usual toiletries and cosmetics, and had purchased enough clothes and underwear for me to never have to wear anything from my own closet.</p><p>It was too much, but that was the way he was.</p><p>I was rinsing off the mug I\u2019d used for a quick cup of coffee when Trey came into the kitchen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled sheepishly. Dressed in a pair of Cary\u2019s sweats and his own shirt from last night, he looked right at home. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack atcha.\u201d I put the mug in the dishwasher and faced him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I had fun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I have to get ready for work, but I\u2019m dragging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had those days.\u201d I fixed him a cup and slid it over.</p><p>He took the mug and lifted it in a salute of thanks. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you like Tatiana, too? Is it weird for you, having us both around?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t really know Tatiana, to be honest. She doesn\u2019t hang with Cary and me the way you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>I started heading out and squeezed his shoulder before I passed him. \u201cHave a good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>I checked my phone while taking a cab to work. I almost wished I\u2019d walked, since the cabbie kept the front windows down and was apparently averse to wearing deodorant. The only saving grace was that it was faster than walking.</p> <p>There was a text from Brett sent around six in the morning: On the ground. Can\u2019t wait to c u 2nite!</p><p>I sent him back a smiley face.</p><p>Megumi looked good when I met up with her at work, which made me happy, but Will was looking glum. As I was putting my purse in a drawer, he stopped by my cubicle and rested his crossed arms along the low wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I asked him, looking up at him from my chair.</p><p>\u201cHelp. Need carbs.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I shook my head. \u201cI think it\u2019s sweet that you\u2019re suffering through this diet for your girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t complain,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s lost like five pounds\u2014that I didn\u2019t think she had to lose, mind you\u2014and she looks amazing and has all this energy. But God ... I feel like a slug. My body\u2019s not built for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me out to lunch?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He clasped his hands together like he was praying. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the few women I know who actually enjoys eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the butt to show for it, too,\u201d I said ruefully. \u201cBut sure. I\u2019m game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Eva.\u201d He backed up and bumped into Mark. \u201cOops. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Mark grinned. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>Will headed back to his cubicle and Mark turned his smile to me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the Drysdel team coming in at nine thirty,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>\u201cRight. And I\u2019ve got an idea I\u2019d like to run past strategy before they get here.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my tablet and stood, thinking we\u2019d be running down to the wire. \u201cYou\u2019re living on the edge, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly way to do it. Come on.\u201d</p><p>The day flew by and I rushed full-bore all through it, filled with restless energy. Getting up so early, then eating a plate of pierogi for lunch, didn\u2019t slow me down.</p><p>I wrapped up exactly at five and did a quick change in the bathroom, switching from my skirt and blouse into a more casual jersey dress in pale blue. I slipped on a pair of wedge sandals, swapped out my diamond studs for silver hoops, and turned my ponytail into a messy bun. Then I headed down to the lobby.</p><p>As I moved toward the revolving entrance door, I saw Cary standing outside on the sidewalk talking to Brett. I slowed, giving myself a minute to absorb the sight of my old flame.</p><p>Brett\u2019s short-cropped hair was naturally dark blond, but he\u2019d had the tips dyed platinum and the look was a good one for him, with his tanned skin and irises of a beautiful emerald green. On stage he was usually shirtless, but today he was dressed in black cargo pants and bloodred T-shirt, his arms covered in sleeves of tattoos that writhed over his muscles.</p><p>He turned his head then, looking inside the lobby, and I started walking again, my stomach fluttering a little when he caught sight of me, and his ruggedly handsome face was softened by a smile that revealed a killer dimple.</p><p>Jesus, he was sexy as hell.</p><p>Feeling a little too exposed, I pulled out my sunglasses and slipped them on. Then I took a deep breath as I spun through the revolving doors, my gaze shifting to the Bentley parked just behind Brett\u2019s limo.</p><p>Brett whistled. \u201cDamn, Eva. You\u2019re more gorgeous every time I see you.\u201d</p><p>I shot a strained smile at Cary, my pulse racing madly. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look great, baby girl,\u201d he said, reaching for my hand.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Angus step out of the Bentley. In that moment of distraction, I totally missed Brett reaching for me. A split second after I registered his hands at my waist, I realized he was going to kiss me and barely turned my head in time. His lips touched the corner of my mouth, feeling warm and familiar. I stumbled back, tripping over Cary, who caught me by the shoulders.</p><p>Flushed with embarrassment and disoriented, I looked anywhere but at Brett.</p><p>And found myself looking into the icy blue eyes of Gideon.</p><p>16</p><p>STANDING FROZEN JUST outside the revolving doors of the Crossfire, Gideon stared at me with such intensity I squirmed.</p><p>Sorry, I mouthed, feeling awful, knowing how I would\u2019ve felt if Corinne had gotten her lips on him the other day.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Brett greeted me, too focused on me to pay attention to the dark figure standing with his fists and jaw clenched just a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I could feel Gideon watching me, and it was painful not to go to him. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for the guys, I yanked the limo door open and crawled in. I\u2019d barely gotten my ass on the seat when I pulled the burner phone out of my purse and sent a quick text to Gideon: I love you.</p><p>Brett settled on the bench seat beside me, and then Cary slid in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing your pretty mug everywhere, man,\u201d Brett said, talking to Cary.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Cary shot me a crooked smile. He looked great in distressed jeans and designer T-shirt, with leather cuffs on his wrists that matched his boots.</p><p>\u201cDid the rest of the band fly in with you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYep, they\u2019re all here.\u201d Brett flashed that dimple at me again. \u201cDarrin crashed the minute we got to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how he drums for hours. It\u2019s exhausting just watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re high off the rush of being on stage, energy isn\u2019t a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Erik?\u201d Cary asked with more than casual interest, making me wonder\u2014not for the first time\u2014if he and the band\u2019s bassist had ever hooked up. As far as I knew, Erik was straight, but there had been little signs here and there that made me think he might have experimented a little with my best friend.</p><p>\u201cErik\u2019s dealing with some issues that have come up on the tour,\u201d Brett replied. \u201cAnd Lance hooked up with a girl he met when we were in New York the last time. You\u2019ll be seeing them all in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe life of a rock star,\u201d I teased.</p><p>Brett shrugged and smiled.</p><p>I looked away, regretting my decision to bring Cary along. Because having him there meant I couldn\u2019t say what I needed to say to Brett\u2014that I was in love with someone else and there was no hope for us.</p><p>A relationship with Brett would be entirely different from what I had with Gideon. I\u2019d have had a lot of time on my own while he was on tour. I could do all the things I thought I should do before settling down\u2014living by my own means and spending time unattached with friends and by myself. Kind of the best of both worlds: having a boyfriend but enjoying plenty of individuality.</p><p>But although I was worried about jumping from college into a lifetime commitment, I had no doubts that Gideon was the man I wanted. We were just out of sync with our timing\u2014I thought there was no reason to rush, while he thought there was no reason to wait.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Brett said, looking out the window at the crowd.</p><p>Despite the muggy heat of the day, Times Square was packed as usual. The ruby-red glass stairs in Duffy Square were full of people taking pictures of each other, and pedestrian traffic clogged the overflowing sidewalks. Police officers dotted the corners, keeping a sharp eye out for trouble. Street performers outshouted each other, and the smells emanating from food carts competed with the much less savory smell of the street itself.</p><p>Massive electronic billboards plastered on the sides of buildings fought for attention, including one of Cary with a female model wrapped around him from behind. Cameramen and boom operators loitered around a mobile video screen, which was attached to a traveling platform and positioned in front of the bleacherlike stair seating.</p><p>Brett climbed out of the limo first and was immediately bombarded by the excited screams of avid fans\u2014most were female. He flashed that killer smile and waved, then reached in a hand to help me out. My reception was much less warm, especially after Brett put his arm around my waist. Cary\u2019s appearance, however, started a hum of murmurs. When he slipped on a pair of shades, he elicited his own swell of excited yells and catcalls.</p><p>I was overwhelmed by the sensory input but quickly focused when I spotted Christopher Vidal Jr. talking with the host of an entertainment gossip show. Gideon\u2019s brother was dressed for business in shirt, tie, and navy slacks. His dark auburn hair caught the eye even in the early evening shade cast by the towering buildings surrounding us. He waved when he caught sight of me, which turned the host\u2019s gaze to me as well. I waved back.</p><p>The rest of Six-Ninths stood in front of the bleachers signing autographs, clearly enjoying the attention. I looked at Brett. \u201cGo do your thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He studied me, trying to make sure I was okay with him abandoning me.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I waved him off. \u201cThis is for you. Enjoy it. I\u2019ll be here when it\u2019s time for the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>He bounded off. Cary and I walked over to the tent bearing the Vidal Records logo. Protected from the crowds by private security, it was a tiny oasis in the madness of Times Square. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, baby girl, you\u2019ve got your hands full with him. I forgot how it was with you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas being the operative word,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s different from before,\u201d he went on. \u201cMore ... settled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great for him. Especially with all that\u2019s going on in his life right now.\u201d</p><p>He scoped me out. \u201cAren\u2019t you even the slightest bit interested in seeing if he can still bang you brainless?\u201d</p><p>I shot him a look. \u201cChemistry is chemistry. And I\u2019m sure he\u2019s had plenty of chances to bone up on his already fabulous skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBone up, ha! That\u2019s punny.\u201d He waggled his brows at me. \u201cYou seem solid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, now that would be an illusion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, look who\u2019s here,\u201d he murmured, turning my attention to Gideon, who was approaching with Ireland at his side. \u201cAnd heading straight toward us. If there\u2019s a brawl over you, I\u2019m watching from the bleachers.\u201d</p><p>I shoved at him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>It amazed me that Gideon could look so cool in his suit when it was still so hot. Ireland looked fantastic in a low-rise flared skirt and tummy-baring fitted tank top.</p><p>\u201cEva!\u201d she shouted, running over and leaving her brother behind. She met me with a hug, then pulled back to check me out. \u201cAwesome! He\u2019s got to be kicking himself.\u201d</p><p>I looked around her at Gideon, searching his face for any signs that he was pissed about Brett. Ireland turned and hugged Cary, too, surprising him. In the meantime, Gideon walked straight up to me, grabbed me gently by the upper arms, and kissed both of my cheeks French style.</p><p>\u201cHello, Eva.\u201d His voice was flavored with a soft rasp that had my toes curling. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p> <p>I blinked up at him, not having to fake my astonishment at all. \u201cUh, hi. Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t she look delish?\u201d Ireland asked, making no attempt at subtlety.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s eyes never left my face. \u201cShe always does. I need a minute of your time, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I shot a what-the-fuck look at Cary and let Gideon lead me to a corner of the tent. We\u2019d taken a few steps when I said, \u201cAre you mad? Please don\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cBut not at you or him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-kay.\u201d I had no idea what that meant.</p><p>He stopped and faced me, raking a hand through his gorgeous hair. \u201cThis situation is intolerable. I could stand it when there was no other choice, but now ...\u201d His gaze was fierce on my face. \u201cYou\u2019re mine. I need the world to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told Brett that I\u2019m in love with you. Cary, too. My dad. Megumi. I\u2019ve never lied about how I feel about you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEva!\u201d Christopher came up to me and pulled me into him for a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so glad Brett brought you. You know, I had no idea you two used to be an item.\u201d</p><p>I managed a smile, hyperaware of Gideon\u2019s gaze. \u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that long.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristopher,\u201d Gideon said, by way of greeting.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d Christopher\u2019s smile didn\u2019t waver, but he noticeably cooled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to come. I\u2019ve got this covered.\u201d</p><p>They were half brothers but had so little in common physically. Gideon was taller, bigger, and undeniably dark in both coloring and demeanor. Christopher was a handsome man with a sexy smile, but he had none of Gideon\u2019s sizzling magnetism.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for Eva,\u201d Gideon said smoothly, \u201cnot the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Christopher looked at me. \u201cI thought you and Brett were working things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrett\u2019s a friend,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cEva\u2019s personal life is none of your business,\u201d Gideon said.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be yours, either.\u201d Christopher looked at him with such hostility it made me uncomfortable. \u201cThe fact that \u2018Golden\u2019 is a true story, and that Brett and Eva are here together, is a great marketing angle for Vidal and the band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe song is the end of that story.\u201d</p><p>Christopher frowned and reached into his pocket, pulling out his smartphone. He read the screen, then scowled at his brother. \u201cCall Corinne, will you? She\u2019s going nuts trying to reach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to her an hour ago,\u201d Gideon said.</p><p>\u201cStop giving her mixed signals,\u201d Christopher snapped. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want to talk to her, you shouldn\u2019t have gone over to her place last night.\u201d</p><p>I tensed, my pulse leaping. I looked at Gideon, saw his jaw tighten, and remembered how I\u2019d waited for a reply text from him. He\u2019d been at my place when I got home, but he\u2019d never explained why he hadn\u2019t texted me back. He certainly hadn\u2019t said anything about going to Corinne\u2019s apartment.</p><p>And hadn\u2019t he said he wasn\u2019t taking her calls?</p><p>I backed away with my stomach in knots. I\u2019d felt off all day, and facing the simmering dislike between Gideon and Christopher was too much on top of it. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva,\u201d Gideon said sharply.</p><p>\u201cIt was good seeing you both,\u201d I murmured, playing my scripted part before turning away and heading the few feet over to Cary.</p><p>Gideon caught up with me after only two steps, gripping me by the elbow and whispering in my ear. \u201cShe\u2019s calling my phone and work all the time. I had to talk with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had more important things to talk about.\u201d</p><p>Brett glanced over at us. He was too far away for me to see his expression, but his posture looked tight. People, all of them pushing to get closer, surrounded him and he was focused on me instead.</p><p>Damn it. He\u2019d seen me with Gideon and it was spoiling what should be a wonderful experience for him. As I\u2019d feared, the whole outing was a mess.</p><p>\u201cGideon,\u201d Christopher said tightly from behind us. \u201cI wasn\u2019t finished talking to you.\u201d</p><p>Gideon glanced at him. \u201cI\u2019ll get to you in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll talk to me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk away, Christopher.\u201d Gideon stared at his brother so coldly I shivered despite the heat. \u201cBefore you make a scene that takes all the attention away from Six-Ninths.\u201d</p><p>Christopher seethed for a long minute, then seemed to realize his brother wasn\u2019t kidding. He cursed under his breath and turned, only to be confronted by Ireland.</p><p>\u201cLeave them alone,\u201d she said, with her hands on her hips. \u201cI want them to get back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stay out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d She wrinkled her nose at him. \u201cCome show me around.\u201d</p><p>He paused, his gaze narrowed. Then he sighed and took her by the elbow, leading her away. I realized they were close.</p><p>It made me sad that Gideon didn\u2019t have that kind of bond with them.</p><p>Gideon brought my attention back to him with a brush of fingertips to my cheek, a soft caress that conveyed so much love ... and possession. No one looking at us could mistake the claim. \u201cTell me you know nothing happened with Corinne.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t do anything with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. She\u2019s not acting like herself. I\u2019ve never seen her so ... Damn it. I don\u2019t know. Needy. Irrational.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevastated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Yes.\u201d His face softened. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t like this when she broke our engagement.\u201d</p><p>I felt bad for both of them. Ugly good-byes weren\u2019t fun for anyone. \u201cShe walked away that time. This time, it\u2019s you. It\u2019s always harder being the one left behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to settle her down, but I need you to promise me that she\u2019s not going to get in between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let her. And you\u2019re not going to worry about Brett.\u201d</p><p>It took him a few seconds, but he finally said, \u201cI\u2019ll worry, but I\u2019ll handle it.\u201d</p><p>I could tell it wasn\u2019t an easy concession for him to make.</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cI have to go deal with Christopher. Are we okay?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I said, \u201cI\u2019m good. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as Kline doesn\u2019t kiss you.\u201d The warning was clear in his voice.</p><p>\u201cSame goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he kisses me, he\u2019s getting decked.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou know what I meant.\u201d</p><p>He caught my hand and rubbed his thumb over my ring. \u201cCrossfire.\u201d</p><p>My heart hurt in the best way. \u201cLove you, too, ace.\u201d</p><p>BRETT disengaged from his fans and headed over to the tent, looking grim.</p><p>\u201cHaving fun yet?\u201d I asked him, hoping to keep him feeling positive.</p><p>\u201cHe wants you back,\u201d he said bluntly.</p><p>I didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to give him a second chance, I should get one, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrett\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s tough with me being on the road\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd based in San Diego,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201c\u2014but I can make it out here often enough and you can always meet up with me, see some new places. Plus, the tour ends in November. I can come stay out here for the holidays.\u201d He looked at me with those green eyes of his, and the attraction hummed between us. \u201cYour dad\u2019s still in SoCal, so you\u2019ve got more than one reason to come out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be reason enough. But, Brett ... I don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019m in love with him.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms and looked exactly like the wickedly delicious bad boy he was. \u201cI don\u2019t care. It\u2019s not going to work out for you with him, and I\u2019ll be around, Eva.\u201d</p><p>Staring at him, I realized nothing would convince him but time.</p><p>Brett stepped closer, then reached out to run his hand down my arm. He stood over me, his body curved into mine. I remembered other times we\u2019d stood like this, the moments right before he pressed me back against something and fucked me hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only going to take once,\u201d he murmured in my ear, his voice sinful as always. \u201cOne time inside you and you\u2019ll remember how it is between us.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed past a dry throat. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen, Brett.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved in a slow smile, revealing that decadent dimple. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019re so much hotter in person,\u201d Ireland said, looking over at where the guys were doing their prelaunch interview with the TV show host. \u201cYou, too, Cary.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his teeth dazzlingly white. \u201cWell, thank you, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ...\u201d She looked at me with those blue eyes that were so like Gideon\u2019s. \u201cYou used to date Brett Kline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Honestly, we just used to mess around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love him?\u201d</p> <p>I thought about that for a minute. \u201cI think I was close, maybe. I could have fallen in love with him under different circumstances. He\u2019s a great guy.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I asked. \u201cAre you seeing anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her lips twisted ruefully. \u201cI really like him\u2014a lot\u2014but it\u2019s weird, because he can\u2019t let his parents know he\u2019s dating me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis grandparents lost most of their money to that scheme Gideon\u2019s dad ran.\u201d</p> <p>My gaze went to Cary, whose brows were lifted above the line of his shades.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your fault,\u201d I said, angry on her behalf.</p><p>\u201cRick says his parents think it\u2019s \u2018convenient\u2019 that Gideon is so rich now,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cConvenient? They think it\u2019s convenient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d</p><p>I turned around at the sound of Gideon\u2019s voice, not having realized he\u2019d come up behind me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He just stared at me. I was irritated enough that it took me a minute to note the hint of a smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d I told him, narrowing my gaze in warning. I turned back to Ireland. \u201cTell Rick\u2019s parents to look up the Crossroads Foundation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re done being offended for my sake,\u201d Gideon said, coming up so close behind me that he brushed up against me, \u201cthey\u2019re about five minutes from starting the video.\u201d</p><p>My gaze searched out Brett, who\u2019d rejoined the crowd, and found him waving me over.</p><p>I looked at Cary.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said with a jerk of his chin. \u201cI\u2019ll hang here with Ireland and Cross.\u201d</p><p>I headed over to the band, smiling when I saw how excited they were. \u201cBig moment, guys,\u201d I said to them.</p><p>\u201cAh, well.\u201d Darrin grinned. \u201cThis whole event was set up just to get us on this TV show and Internet simulcast. It was the only way Vidal could get them to give us any coverage. Let\u2019s hope it pays off, because fuckin\u2019 A, it\u2019s hot as hell out here.\u201d</p><p>The host announced the exclusive premiere of the video, and then the screen switched from showing the logo of the show to the start of the video and the first chords of the song began.</p><p>The black screen suddenly lit up, revealing Brett sitting on a stool in front of a mic in a puddle of light, just as he\u2019d been at the concert. He began to sing, his voice deep and rough. Crazy sexy. The effect his voice had on me was powerful and immediate, just as it\u2019d always been.</p><p>The camera slowly backed away from Brett, revealing a dance floor in front of the stage where he sang. There was a crowd dancing, but they were cast in black and white while a lone blonde was strikingly colored.</p><p>I stilled as shock spread through me. The camera was careful to film only her backside and profile, but the girl was undeniably meant to be me. She was my height, with the same hair color and style as mine before I\u2019d recently cut it. She had my curvy butt and hips, and her profile was similar enough to mine to understand immediately who she was meant to be.</p><p>The next three minutes of my life passed in a horrified daze. \u201cGolden\u201d was a sexually charged song and the actress did all the things Brett sang about\u2014dropping to her knees for a Brett lookalike, making out with him in a bar restroom, and straddling his lap in the back of a classic \u201967 Mustang just like the one Brett owned. Those intimate memories were intercut with shots of the real Brett still singing onstage with the rest of the guys in the band.</p><p>The fact that actors were playing us helped me deal with it a little better, but one glance at Gideon\u2019s stony face told me it didn\u2019t matter to him. He was seeing one of the wildest times in my life relived before his eyes and it was very real to him.</p><p>The video ended with a shot of Brett looking soulful and tormented, a single tear sliding down his cheek.</p><p>I pulled away and faced him.</p><p>His smile slowly faded when he got a good look at my expression.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe how personal the video was. I was freaking out that millions of people were going to see it.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d the host said, leaning into the band with mic in hand. \u201cBrett, you really put yourself out there with this. Was it the song that brought you and Eva back together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a roundabout way, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Eva, did you play yourself in the video?\u201d</p><p>I blinked, realizing he was outing me as the Eva on national television. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about \u2018Golden\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I licked my dry lips. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing song by an amazing band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout an amazing love story.\u201d The host smiled into the camera and rambled on, but I tuned him out, my gaze searching for Gideon. I couldn\u2019t spot him anywhere.</p><p>The host talked to the band a bit more and I wandered away, searching. Cary came up to me with Ireland in tow.</p><p>\u201cSome video,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>I looked at him miserably before my gaze slid over to Ireland. \u201cDo you know where your brother is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristopher\u2019s schmoozing. Gideon left.\u201d She winced apologetically. \u201cHe asked Christopher to take me home with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d I dug in my purse for the burner phone and typed out a quick text: I love you. Tell me you\u2019ll c me 2nite.</p><p>I waited for a reply. When it didn\u2019t come after a few minutes, I just held the phone in my hand, willing it to vibrate.</p><p>Brett ambled up to me. \u201cWe\u2019re done here. Wanna bail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I turned to Ireland. \u201cI\u2019m out of town the next two weekends, but let\u2019s get together after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep my schedule open,\u201d she said, hugging me hard.</p><p>Turning to Cary, I caught his hand and squeezed it. \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I haven\u2019t been this entertained in a long time.\u201d He and Brett did some complicated handshake. \u201cGood job, man. I\u2019m stoked for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming. We\u2019ll catch you later.\u201d</p><p>Brett set his hand at the small of my back and we took off.</p><p>17</p><p>GIDEON DIDN\u2019T SHOW up at Tableau One.</p><p>In a way, I was grateful, because I didn\u2019t want Brett thinking I\u2019d planned the interruption. Outside his long-term hopes for our relationship, Brett was someone who\u2019d been important to me in the past and I wanted to be friends with him, if possible.</p><p>But I was preoccupied with imagining what Gideon was thinking and feeling.</p><p>I picked at my dinner, too unsettled to eat. When Arnoldo Ricci stopped by to say hello, looking very dashing and handsome in his white chef coat, I felt bad that so much of his fine food was still on my plate.</p><p>The celebrity chef was a friend of Gideon\u2019s. Gideon was a silent partner in Tableau One, which was the reason I\u2019d chosen the restaurant. If he had any doubts about how the dinner with Brett would go, he\u2019d have people to ask that he trusted.</p><p>Of course, I hoped Gideon would trust me enough to believe me, but I knew our relationship had its issues and our mutual possessiveness was just one of them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Eva,\u201d Arnoldo said with his lovely Italian accent. He pressed a kiss to my cheek, then pulled out one of the empty chairs at our table and sat.</p><p>Arnoldo extended his hand to Brett. \u201cWelcome to Tableau One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArnoldo\u2019s a Six-Ninths fan,\u201d I explained. \u201cHe came to the concert with Gideon and me.\u201d</p><p>Brett\u2019s lips twisted ruefully as the two men shook hands. \u201cNice to meet you. Did you see both shows?\u201d</p><p>He was referring to the brawl he\u2019d had with Gideon. Arnoldo understood. \u201cI did. Eva is very important to Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s important to me, too,\u201d Brett said, grabbing his frosty mug of Nastro Azzurro beer.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Arnoldo smiled. \u201cChe vinca il migliore. May the best man win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d I sat back in my chair. \u201cI\u2019m not a prize. Or I should say: I\u2019m no prize.\u201d</p><p>Arnoldo shot me a look. Obviously he didn\u2019t wholly disagree with me. I didn\u2019t blame him; he knew I\u2019d kissed Brett and had seen the effect it\u2019d had on Gideon.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem with your meal, Eva?\u201d Arnoldo asked. \u201cIf you liked it, your plate would be empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou serve big helpings,\u201d Brett pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAnd Eva is a big eater.\u201d</p><p>Brett looked at me. \u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. Was he catching on to how little we really knew about each other? \u201cOne of my many flaws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d Arnoldo said. \u201cHow did the video show go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it went well.\u201d Brett searched my face as he answered.</p><p>I nodded, not wanting to spoil what was supposed to be a celebratory time for the band. What was done, was done. I couldn\u2019t fault Brett\u2019s intentions, only his execution. \u201cThey are well on the road to megastardom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can say I knew you when.\u201d Arnoldo smiled at Brett. \u201cI bought your first single on iTunes when it was still your only single.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAppreciate the support, man,\u201d Brett said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have made it without our fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have made it if you weren\u2019t so good.\u201d Arnoldo looked at me. \u201cYou will have dessert, won\u2019t you? And more wine.\u201d</p><p>As Arnoldo settled back in his chair, I realized he intended to fill the role of chaperone. When I glanced at Brett, I could tell from his wry smile that he caught that, too.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d Arnoldo began, \u201ctell me how Shawna is doing, Eva.\u201d</p><p>I sighed inwardly. At least Arnoldo was a babysitter who was fun to look at.</p><p>BRETT\u2019S hired driver dropped me off at my apartment a little after ten. I invited Brett up, because I couldn\u2019t see any way to avoid it that wasn\u2019t rude. He took in the exterior of the building with some surprise, as well as the night doorman and the front desk.</p><p>\u201cYou must have a smokin\u2019 job,\u201d he said as we walked toward the elevators.</p><p>The clicking of heels on marble chased after me. \u201cEva!\u201d</p> <p>I cringed at the sound of Deanna\u2019s voice. \u201cReporter alert,\u201d I whispered, before turning around.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d he asked, turning with me.</p><p>\u201cHi, Deanna.\u201d I greeted her with a strained smile.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Her dark eyes raked Brett from head to toe, and then she thrust her hand at him. \u201cBrett Kline, right? Deanna Johnson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pleasure, Deanna,\u201d he said, turning on the charm.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d I asked her as they shook hands.</p> <p>\u201cSorry for interrupting you on your date. I didn\u2019t realize you two were back together until I saw you at the Vidal event earlier.\u201d She smiled at Brett. \u201cI take it there\u2019s no harm done from your altercation with Gideon Cross?\u201d</p><p>Brett\u2019s brows rose. \u201cYou lost me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d heard you and Cross exchanged a few blows in an argument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s got a big imagination.\u201d</p><p>Had Gideon talked to him? Or had media training taught Brett the pitfalls to avoid?</p><p>I hated that Deanna had been nearby earlier, watching me. Or, more accurately, watching Gideon. He was the one she was fixated on. I was just easier to access.</p><p>Her answering smile was brittle. \u201cBad source, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happens,\u201d he said easily.</p> <p>She turned her attention back to me. \u201cI saw Gideon with you today, Eva. My photographer got some great shots of you two. I stopped by to ask you for a statement, but now that I see who you\u2019re with, would you comment on the status of your relationship with Brett?\u201d</p><p>She directed the question at me, but Brett stepped in, grinning and flashing that dazzling dimple. \u201cI think \u2018Golden\u2019 says it all. We\u2019ve got history and friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great quote, thanks.\u201d Deanna eyed me. I eyed her right back. \u201cOkay. I don\u2019t want to hold you up. I appreciate your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I caught Brett\u2019s hand and tugged it. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>I hurried him to the elevators and didn\u2019t relax until the doors closed.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask why a reporter\u2019s so interested in who you\u2019re dating?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him. He was lounging against the handrail, his hands gripping the brass on either side of his hips. The pose was hot and he was undeniably sexy, but my thoughts were with Gideon. I was anxious to be with him and talk to him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an ex of Gideon\u2019s with a grudge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t send up any flags for you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNot like you\u2019re probably thinking.\u201d</p><p>The elevator arrived on my floor and I led the way to my apartment, hating that I had to walk by Gideon\u2019s to get there. Had he felt like this when he\u2019d spent time with Corinne? Weighted with guilt and worry?</p><p>I opened the door and was sorry that Cary wasn\u2019t hanging out on the couch. It didn\u2019t even seem like my roommate was home. The lights were off, which was a strong indicator that he was out. He always left lights on in his wake when he was around.</p><p>Hitting the switch, I turned in time to see Brett\u2019s face when the recessed ceiling fixtures lit up the place. I always felt weird when people first realized I had money.</p><p>He looked at me with a frown. \u201cI\u2019m rethinking my career choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy job doesn\u2019t pay for this. My stepdad does. For now, anyway.\u201d I went to the kitchen and dropped my purse and bag off on a bar stool.</p><p>\u201cYou and Cross hang in the same circles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I too different for you?\u201d</p><p>The question unsettled me, even though it was perfectly valid. \u201cI don\u2019t judge people by their money, Brett. Do you want something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>I gestured toward the couch and we settled there.</p><p>\u201cSo, you didn\u2019t like the video,\u201d he said, laying his arm over the back of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t have to. I saw your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just really ... personal.\u201d</p><p>His green eyes were hot enough to make me flush. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten one thing about you, Eva. The video proves that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because there wasn\u2019t a whole lot for you to remember,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know you, but I bet I\u2019ve seen sides of you Cross never has and never will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true in reverse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he conceded, his fingers tapping silently into the cushion. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to fly out at the butt-crack of dawn tomorrow, but I\u2019ll catch a later flight. Come with me. We\u2019ve got shows in Seattle and San Francisco over the weekend. You can head back Sunday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I have plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe weekend after that we\u2019re in San Diego. Come there.\u201d His fingers slid down my arm. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like old times, with twenty thousand extra people.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. What were the chances that we\u2019d be home at the same time? \u201cI\u2019ve got plans to be in SoCal then. Just me and Cary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll hook up next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet up,\u201d I corrected, standing when he did. \u201cAre you leaving?\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer. \u201cAre you asking me to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrett ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He gave me a rueful smile and my heart raced a little. \u201cWe\u2019ll see each other next weekend.\u201d</p><p>We walked together to the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you for inviting me along today,\u201d I told him, feeling oddly sorry that he was going so soon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t like the video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do like it.\u201d I caught his hand. \u201cI do. You did a great job with it. It\u2019s just weird seeing myself from the outside, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get it.\u201d He cupped my cheek with his other hand and bent in for a kiss.</p><p>I turned my head and he nuzzled me instead, the tip of his nose rubbing up and down my cheek. The light scent of his cologne, mingled with the scent of his skin, teased my senses and brought back heated memories. The feel of his body standing so close to mine was achingly familiar.</p><p>I\u2019d once had a mad crush on him. I had wanted him to feel the same way about me in return and now that he did, it was bittersweet.</p><p>Brett gripped my upper arms and groaned softly, the sound vibrating through me. \u201cI remember how you feel,\u201d he whispered, his voice deep and husky. \u201cOn the inside. I can\u2019t wait to feel it again.\u201d</p><p>I was breathing too fast. \u201cThank you for dinner.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved against my cheek. \u201cCall me. I\u2019ll call you no matter what, but it\u2019d be nice for you to call me sometime. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and had to swallow before speaking. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He was gone a moment later and I was running to my purse for the burner phone. There was no message from Gideon. No missed call or text.</p><p>Grabbing my keys, I left my apartment and hurried to his, but it was dark and lifeless. I knew the moment I entered that he wasn\u2019t there without having to check the artfully colored glass bowl he emptied his pockets into.</p><p>Feeling like something was very off, I headed back to my place. I dropped my keys on the counter and went to my room, heading straight for the bathroom and a shower.</p><p>The unsettled feeling in my stomach wouldn\u2019t go away, even as I washed the stickiness and grime of the hot afternoon down the drain. I scrubbed shampoo into my scalp and thought over the day, growing angrier by the moment because Gideon was off somewhere doing whatever, instead of being home with me working things out.</p><p>And then I sensed him.</p><p>Rinsing soap out of my eyes, I turned and found him yanking off his tie as he stepped into the room. He looked tired and worn, which troubled me more than anger would have.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I greeted him.</p><p>He watched me as he stripped with quick, methodical movements. Magnificently naked, he joined me in the shower, walking right into me and pulling me into a tight embrace.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said again, hugging him back. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you upset about the video?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate the video,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cI should\u2019ve screened the damn thing when I realized the song was about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back and looked down at me. The mist from the shower was slowly dampening his hair. He was infinitely sexier than Brett. And the way he felt about me\u2014and I felt about him in return\u2014was infinitely deeper. \u201cCorinne called right before the video finished. She was ... hysterical. Out of control. It concerned me and I went to see her.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, fighting off a flare of jealousy. I had no right to feel that way, especially after the time I\u2019d spent with Brett. \u201cHow did that go?\u201d</p><p>He urged my head back with gentle fingers. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d As he rinsed the suds from my hair, he said, \u201cI think I figured out what the problem is. She\u2019s been taking antidepressants and they\u2019re not the right prescription for her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was supposed to let the doctor know how they were working out, but she didn\u2019t even realize she\u2019s been acting so bizarre. It took hours of talking to her to get her to see it, and then pinpoint why.\u201d</p><p>I straightened and wiped my eyes, trying to stem my growing irritation over another woman monopolizing my man\u2019s attention. I couldn\u2019t discount her making up a problem just to keep Gideon spending time with her.</p> <p>He swapped places with me, sidestepping under the shower spray. Water coursed down his amazing body, running lovingly over the hard ridges and slabs of muscle.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shrugged grimly. \u201cShe\u2019ll see her doctor tomorrow to discuss getting off the pills or switching to something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you supposed to walk her through that?\u201d I complained.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my responsibility.\u201d His gaze held mine, telling me without words that he understood my fear and worry and anger. Just as he\u2019d always understood me. \u201cI told her as much. Then I called Giroux and told him, too. He needs to come take care of his wife.\u201d</p> <p>He reached for his shampoo, which rested on a glass shelf with the rest of his personal shower items. He\u2019d moved his stuff into my place pretty much the minute I agreed to date him, just as he had stocked his place with duplicates of my everyday items.</p><p>\u201cShe was provoked, though, Eva. Deanna visited her earlier tonight with pictures she took of you and me at the video launch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous,\u201d I muttered. \u201cThat explains why Deanna was here waiting to ambush me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she really?\u201d he purred dangerously, making me pity Deanna\u2014for about half a second. She was digging herself a nice grave.</p><p>\u201cShe probably got shots of you showing up at Corinne\u2019s place and wanted to rile me.\u201d I crossed my arms. \u201cShe\u2019s stalking you.\u201d</p><p>Gideon tipped his head back into the water to rinse, his biceps flexing as he ran his fingers through his hair.</p> <p>He was so flagrantly, sexually, beautifully male.</p><p>I licked my lips, aroused by the sight of him despite my irritation with his exes. I closed the distance between us and squeezed some of his body wash into my palm. Then I ran my hands over his chest.</p><p>Groaning, he looked down at me. \u201cI love your hands on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, since I can\u2019t keep my hands off you.\u201d</p><p>He touched my cheek, his eyes soft. He searched my face, maybe gauging whether I was wearing the fuck-me look or not. I didn\u2019t think I was. I wanted him, that never stopped, but I also wanted to enjoy just being with him. That was hard when he was blowing my mind.</p><p>\u201cI needed this,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems like so much is coming at us, doesn\u2019t it? We can\u2019t catch a break. If it\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s another.\u201d My fingertips traced the hard ridges of his abdomen. Desire hummed between us, and that wonderful sense of being near someone who was precious and necessary. \u201cBut we\u2019re doing okay, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>His lips touched my forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re hanging in pretty good, I\u2019d say. But I can\u2019t wait to take you away tomorrow. Get out of here for a while, away from everyone, and just have you all to myself.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled, delighted by the thought. \u201cI can\u2019t wait, either.\u201d</p><p>I woke when Gideon slipped out of my bed.</p><p>Blinking, I noted that the television was still on, though muted. I\u2019d fallen asleep curled up with him, enjoying our time alone together after all the hours and days we\u2019d been forced to spend apart.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cTo bed.\u201d He touched my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m crashing hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me to stay.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, understanding his fear. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Bending over me, Gideon pressed his lips to mine. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to put your passport in your purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forget. Are you sure I shouldn\u2019t pack something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He kissed me again, his lips clinging to mine.</p><p>Then he was gone.</p><p>I wore a light jersey wrap dress to work on Friday, something that could go from work to a long flight easily. I had no idea how far Gideon was taking me, but knew I\u2019d be comfortable no matter what.</p><p>When I got to work, I found Megumi on the phone, so we waved at each other and I headed straight to my cubicle. Ms. Field stopped by just as I settled into my chair.</p><p>The executive chairman of Waters Field &amp; Leaman looked powerful and confident in a soft gray pantsuit.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Eva,\u201d she said. \u201cHave Mark stop by my office when he gets in.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, admiring her triple-strand black pearl necklace. \u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>When I passed along the request to Mark five minutes later, he shook his head. \u201cBetcha we didn\u2019t get the Adrianna Vineyards account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate those damned cattle-call RFPs. They\u2019re not looking for quality and experience. They just want someone who\u2019s hungry enough to give their services away.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d dropped everything to meet the deadline for the request for proposal, which had been given to Mark to spearhead because he\u2019d done such an amazing job with the Kingsman Vodka account.</p><p>\u201cTheir loss,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI know, but still ... I want to win \u2019em all. Wish me luck that I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a thumbs-up and he headed to Christine Field\u2019s office. My desk phone rang as I was pushing to my feet to grab a cup of coffee from the break room.</p><p>\u201cMark Garrity\u2019s office,\u201d I answered, \u201cEva Tramell speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva, honey.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled at the sound of my mother\u2019s watery voice. \u201cHi, Mom. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you see me? Maybe we could have lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could.\u201d She took a breath that sounded like a sob. \u201cI really need to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d My stomach knotted with concern. I hated hearing my mother so upset. \u201cDo you want me to meet you somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClancy and I will come get you. You take lunch at noon, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll meet you at the curb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She paused. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mom. I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>We hung up and I stared down at the phone.</p><p>How was our family going to move forward from here?</p><p>I sent a quick text to Gideon, letting him know I\u2019d have to take a rain check on lunch. I needed to get my relationship with my mom back on track.</p><p>Knowing I needed more coffee to tackle the day ahead, I set off to fill up.</p><p>I left my desk exactly at noon and headed down to the lobby. As the hours passed, I grew more and more excited about getting away with Gideon. Away from Corinne, and Deanna, and Brett.</p><p>I\u2019d just passed through the security turnstiles when I saw him.</p><p>Jean-Fran?ois Giroux stood at the security desk, looking distinctly European and very attractive. His wavy dark hair was longer than it had been in the pictures I\u2019d seen of him, his face less tan and his mouth harder, framed by a goatee. The pale green of his eyes was even more striking in person, even though they were red with weariness. From the small carry-on at his feet, I suspected he\u2019d come straight to the Crossfire from the airport.</p><p>\u201cMon Dieu. How slow are the elevators in this building?\u201d he asked the security guard in a clipped French accent. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that it should take twenty minutes to come down from the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Cross is on his way,\u201d the guard replied staunchly, remaining in his chair.</p><p>As if he sensed my gaze, Giroux\u2019s head swiveled toward me and his gaze narrowed. He pushed away from the counter, striding toward me. The cut of his suit was tighter than Gideon\u2019s, narrower at the waist and calves. The impression I got of him was too neat and rigid, a man who assumed power by enforcing rules.</p><p>\u201cEva Tramell?\u201d he asked, startling me with his recognition.</p><p>\u201cMr. Giroux.\u201d I offered my hand.</p><p>He took it, then surprised me by leaning in and kissing both of my cheeks. Perfunctory, absentminded kisses, but that wasn\u2019t the point. Even for a Frenchman, it was a familiar gesture from someone who was a total stranger to me.</p><p>When he stepped back, I looked at him with raised brows.</p><p>\u201cWould you have time to speak with me?\u201d he asked, still holding my hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not today.\u201d I tugged away gently. Anonymity was created just by being in a massive space crowded with people rushing to and fro, but with Deanna lurking around, I couldn\u2019t be too careful about who I was seen with. \u201cI have a lunch date and then I\u2019m leaving directly after work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out of town this weekend. Monday would be the earliest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of town. With Cross?\u201d</p><p>My head canted to the side as I examined him, trying to read him. \u201cThat\u2019s really none of your business, but yes.\u201d</p><p>I told the truth so he\u2019d know that Gideon had a woman in his life who wasn\u2019t Corinne.</p><p>\u201cDoes it not bother you,\u201d he said, his tone noticeably cooling, \u201cthat he used my wife to make you jealous and bring you back to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon wants to be friends with Corinne. Friends spend time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blond, but surely you can\u2019t be so na?ve as to believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stressed,\u201d I countered, \u201cbut surely you know you\u2019re being an ass.\u201d</p><p>I registered Gideon\u2019s presence before I felt his hand on my arm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll apologize, Giroux,\u201d he interjected with dangerous softness. \u201cAnd do so sincerely.\u201d</p><p>Giroux shot him a look so filled with anger and loathing, it made me shift restlessly on my feet. \u201cMaking me wait is classless, Cross, even for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the insult were intentional, you\u2019d know it.\u201d Gideon\u2019s mouth thinned into a line as sharp as a blade. \u201cThe apology, Giroux. I\u2019ve never been anything but polite and respectful to Corinne. You will show Eva the same courtesy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To the casual observer, his pose was loose and relaxed, but I felt the fury in him. I sensed it in both men\u2014one hot and one icy cool, the tension building by the moment. The space around us felt like it was closing in, which was insane considering how wide and deep the lobby was, and how high the ceiling soared.</p><p>Afraid they\u2019d come to blows right there, regardless of being in such a populated space, I reached over and caught Gideon\u2019s hand in mine, giving it a light squeeze.</p><p>Giroux\u2019s gaze dropped to our linked hands, then rose to meet my eyes. \u201cPardonnez-moi,\u201d he said, inclining his head slightly to me. \u201cYou are not at fault here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let us hold you up,\u201d Gideon murmured to me, his thumb brushing over my knuckles.</p><p>But I lingered, hating to walk away. \u201cYou should be with your wife,\u201d I said to Giroux.</p><p>\u201cShe should be with me,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>I reminded myself that he hadn\u2019t come after her when she\u2019d left him. He\u2019d been too busy blaming Gideon instead of fixing his marriage.</p><p>\u201cEva,\u201d my mom called, having come inside to find me. She approached on nude Louboutins, her slender body draped in a soft silk halter dress in a matching hue. In the dark marble-lined lobby, she was a bright spot.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you on your way, angel,\u201d Gideon said. \u201cGive me a minute, Giroux.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated before walking away. \u201cGood-bye, Monsieur Giroux.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Tramell,\u201d he said, tearing his gaze away from Gideon. \u201cUntil next time.\u201d</p><p>I left because I didn\u2019t have a choice, but I didn\u2019t like it. Gideon walked me over to intercept my mom, and I looked at him, letting him see the worry on my face.</p><p>His eyes reassured me. I saw the same latent power and uncompromising control that I\u2019d recognized when we first met. He could handle Giroux. He could handle anything.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your lunch,\u201d Gideon said, kissing my mom\u2019s cheek before facing me and giving me a quick, hard kiss on the mouth.</p> <p>I watched him walk away and was unnerved by the intensity with which Giroux\u2019s eyes followed his return.</p><p>My mom\u2019s arm linking with mine brought my attention to her.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said, trying to push my unease away. I waited for her to ask if the guys were going to join us, since she loved nothing more than spending time with rich handsome men, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAre you and Gideon trying to work things out?\u201d she asked instead.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at her before I preceded her through the revolving door. She looked more fragile than ever, her skin pale and her eyes lacking their usual sparkle. I waited until she joined me outside, my senses struggling to adjust to the change wrought by stepping out of the cool, cavernous lobby into the sweltering heat and explosion of noise and activity on the street.</p><p>I smiled at Clancy as he opened the back door to the town car. \u201cHey, Clancy.\u201d</p><p>As my mom slid gracefully into the back of the car, he smiled back. At least I think it was a smile. His mouth twitched a little.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>He gave me a brisk nod in reply. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHanging in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he said, just as I slid into the car beside my mom. He sounded a lot more confident about that than I felt.</p><p>THE first few minutes of lunch were filled with an awkward silence. Sunlight flooded the New American bistro my mom had selected, which only made the unease between us more obvious.</p><p>I waited for my mom to start things off, since she was the one who wanted to talk. I had plenty to say, but first I needed to know what the priority was for her. Was it the trust she\u2019d broken by putting a tracking device in my Rolex? Was it her cheating on Stanton with my dad?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful watch,\u201d she said, looking at my new one.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d My hand covered it, protecting it. The timepiece was priceless to me, and deeply personal. \u201cGideon bought it for me.\u201d</p><p>She looked horrified. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him about the tracker, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tell him everything, Mom. We don\u2019t have any secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t. What about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re solid,\u201d I said confidently. \u201cAnd getting stronger every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She nodded, her short curls swaying gently. \u201cThat\u2019s ... wonderful, Eva. He can take good care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already does, in the way I need him to, which has nothing to do with his money.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s lips tightened at my bitter tone. She didn\u2019t actually frown, something she studiously avoided to protect the flawlessness of her skin. \u201cDon\u2019t be so quick to dismiss money, Eva. You never know when or why you\u2019ll need it.\u201d</p><p>Irritation simmered through me. She\u2019d put money first my whole life, no matter who she hurt\u2014like my father\u2014in the process.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I argued. \u201cI just won\u2019t let it rule my life. And before you blurt out something like, oh it\u2019s easy for me to say that, I can guarantee if Gideon lost every cent he had, I\u2019d still be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too smart to lose it all,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll never have anything happen that will drain you financially.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, exasperated with the topic. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to see eye to eye on this, you know.\u201d</p><p>Her beautifully manicured fingers stroked over the handle of her silverware. \u201cYou\u2019re so angry at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you realize Dad\u2019s in love with you? He\u2019s so in love with you, he can\u2019t move on. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever get married. He\u2019ll never have a steady woman in his life who\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and a tear slid down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare cry,\u201d I ordered, leaning forward. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about you. You\u2019re not the victim here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to feel pain?\u201d she retorted, her voice harder than I\u2019d ever heard it. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to cry over a broken heart? I love your father, too. I would give anything for him to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love him enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything I\u2019ve done is for love. Everything.\u201d She laughed humorlessly. \u201cMy God ... I wonder how you can stand to be with me when you hold such a low opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my mother and you\u2019ve always been on my side. You\u2019re always trying to protect me, even if you go about it the wrong way. I love you and Dad both. He\u2019s a good man who deserves to be happy.\u201d</p><p>She took a shaky sip of water. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you, I\u2019d wish we had never met. We both would\u2019ve been happier that way. There\u2019s nothing I can do about it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be with him. Make him happy. You seem to be the only woman who can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because he\u2019s not rich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her hand went to her throat. \u201cBecause he\u2019s not rich.\u201d</p><p>Brutal honesty. My heart sank. There was a bleak look in her blue eyes I\u2019d never seen before. What drove her to need money so desperately? Would I ever know or understand? \u201cBut you\u2019re rich. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d</p><p>Over the course of three divorces, she\u2019d amassed millions in personal wealth.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her, incredulous.</p><p>She looked away, her three-carat diamond studs catching the light and glittering with a rainbow of colors. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo explain it to me, Mom. Please.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze returned to me. \u201cMaybe someday. When you\u2019re not so upset with me.\u201d</p><p>Sitting back in my chair, I felt a headache building. \u201cFine. I\u2019m upset because I don\u2019t understand, and you won\u2019t explain because I\u2019m upset. We\u2019re getting nowhere fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey.\u201d Her expression was pleading. \u201cWhat happened between your father and me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictor. Why don\u2019t you ever say his name?\u201d</p><p>She flinched. \u201cHow long will you punish me?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to punish you. I just don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>It was crazy that we were sitting in a bright, busy space filled with people and dealing with painful personal crap. I wished she\u2019d had me over to her place instead, the home she shared with Stanton. But I guessed she had wanted the buffer of an audience to keep me from totally losing it.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d I said, feeling tired. \u201cCary and I are going to move out of the apartment, get something on our own.\u201d</p><p>My mom\u2019s shoulders straightened. \u201cWhat? Why? Don\u2019t be reckless, Eva! There\u2019s no need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is, though. Nathan\u2019s gone. And Gideon and I want to spend more time together\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with you moving away?\u201d Her eyes flooded with tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Eva. What more can I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about you, Mom.\u201d I tucked my hair behind my ear, fidgeting because her crying always got to me. \u201cOkay, honestly, it does feel weird living in a place Stanton pays for after what happened between you and Dad, but more than that, Gideon and I want to live together. It just makes sense to start fresh someplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive together?\u201d My mother\u2019s tears dried up. \u201cBefore marriage? Eva, no. That would be a horrible mistake. What about Cary? You brought him out to New York with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019ll stay with me.\u201d I didn\u2019t feel like telling her I hadn\u2019t brought up the Gideon-as-a-roommate idea to Cary yet, but I was confident he\u2019d be okay with it. I would be around more and the rent would be easier to bear when split in thirds. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the three of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t live with a man like Gideon Cross if you\u2019re not married to him.\u201d She leaned forward. \u201cYou have to trust me on this. Wait for the ring.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not in a rush to get married,\u201d I said, even as my thumb rubbed over the back of my ring.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d My mother shook her head. \u201cWhat are you saying? You love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon. I\u2019m too young.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re twenty-four. That\u2019s the perfect age.\u201d Determination straightened my mother\u2019s spine. For once, that didn\u2019t bother me, because it restored some of her spirit. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you ruin this, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her eyes took on a calculating gleam. \u201cTrust me and slow down. I\u2019ll handle this.\u201d</p><p>Crap. That wasn\u2019t at all reassuring when she was on Gideon\u2019s side of the marriage argument and not mine.</p><p>18</p> <p>I WAS STILL thinking about my mom when I left the Crossfire at five o\u2019clock. The Bentley waited at the curb and as I walked up to it, Angus climbed out and smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I smiled back. \u201cHow are you, Angus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He rounded the rear of the car and opened the back door for me.</p><p>I searched his face. How much did he know about Nathan and Gideon? Did he know as much as Clancy? Or even more than that?</p><p>Slipping into the cool backseat, I pulled out my smartphone and called Cary. It went to voice mail, so I left a message. \u201cHey, just reminding you that I\u2019ll be gone this weekend. Would you do me a favor and think about moving into a place we share with Gideon, and we can talk about it when I get back? Someplace new, that we can all afford. Not that he has to worry about that,\u201d I added, imagining Cary\u2019s expression. \u201cOkay. If you need me and you can\u2019t reach me on my cell, send me an e-mail. Love you.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d just hit the end button when the door opened and Gideon joined me. \u201cHi, ace.\u201d</p><p>He caught me by the back of the neck and kissed me, his mouth sealing over mine. His tongue licked into my mouth, tasting me, making my thoughts grind to a halt. I was breathless when he let me go.</p><p>\u201cHi, angel,\u201d he said roughly.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved. \u201cHow was lunch with your mom?\u201d</p><p>I groaned.</p><p>\u201cThat good, huh?\u201d He caught my hand. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It was weird.\u201d</p> <p>Angus got in the driver\u2019s seat and pulled into traffic.</p><p>\u201cWeird?\u201d Gideon prompted. \u201cOr uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d I looked out the tinted window as we slowed due to traffic. The sidewalks were clogged with people, but they were moving briskly. It was the cars that were stuck. \u201cShe\u2019s so focused on money. That\u2019s nothing new, but I\u2019m used to her acting like it\u2019s just common sense to want financial security. Today, she seemed ... sad. Resigned.\u201d</p><p>His thumb stroked soothingly over my knuckles. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s feeling guilty for cheating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe should! But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it. I think it\u2019s something else, but I don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to look into it?\u201d</p><p>I turned my head to meet his gaze. I didn\u2019t answer right away, thinking it over. \u201cI do, yes. But I feel icky about it, too. I researched you, Dr. Lucas, Corinne ... I keep digging for people\u2019s secrets instead of just asking about them outright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ask her,\u201d he said, in that matter-of-fact male way.</p><p>\u201cI did. She said she\u2019d talk about it when I wasn\u2019t upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen,\u201d he scoffed, with warm amusement in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Giroux want? Did you know he was coming by?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHe wants someone to blame for his marriage troubles. I\u2019m convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he stop blaming and start fixing? They need to go into counseling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr get a divorce.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is you,\u201d he purred, releasing my hand to grab me instead and pull me onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cFiend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea. I have diabolical plans for you this weekend.\u201d</p><p>The heated look he raked me with had my thoughts shifting in a much naughtier direction. I was pulling his head down for a kiss when the Bentley turned, and it was suddenly dark. Looking around, I realized we\u2019d pulled into a parking garage. We drove around two levels, pulled into a spot, then immediately pulled out again.</p><p>Along with four other black Bentley SUVs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked, as we headed back toward the exit with two Bentleys in front of us and two behind us.</p><p>\u201cShell game,\u201d he said, nuzzling my throat.</p><p>We pulled back out into traffic, heading in different directions.</p><p>\u201cAre we being followed?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cJust being cautious.\u201d His teeth sank gently into my flesh, making my nipples hard. Supporting my back with one arm, he brushed the side of my breast with his thumb. \u201cThis weekend is ours.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d taken my mouth in a lush, deep kiss when we pulled into another parking garage. We slid into a spot and the door was yanked open. I was trying to figure out what was going on, when Gideon swung his legs to the side and slipped out of the Bentley with me held firmly in his arms, only to immediately step into the back of another car.</p><p>We were on the road again in less than a minute, with the Bentley pulling out into traffic in front of us and heading in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cThis is insane,\u201d I said. \u201cI thought we were leaving the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were soft on my face. \u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>We didn\u2019t have any more stops on the way to the airport. We pulled right onto the tarmac after a brief security check, and I preceded Gideon up the short flight of steps into one of his private jets. The cabin was luxurious yet understated in its elegance, with sofa seating on the right and table and chairs on the left. The flight attendant was a handsome young guy with black dress slacks and vest embroidered with the Cross Industries logo and his name, Eric.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Mr. Cross. Miss Tramell,\u201d Eric greeted us with a smile. \u201cWould you like something to drink as we prepare for takeoff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCranberry and Kingsman for me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThe same,\u201d Gideon replied, shrugging out of his jacket and handing it over to Eric, who waited while Gideon stripped off his vest and tie, too.</p><p>I watched appreciatively, throwing in a whistle for good measure. \u201cI\u2019m liking this trip already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d He shook his head, his eyes laughing.</p><p>A gentleman in a navy suit entered the plane. He greeted Gideon warmly, shook my hand when introduced, then requested our passports. He was gone as quickly as he\u2019d come, and the cabin door was closed. Gideon and I were buckled in at the table with our drinks when the plane started taxiing down the runway.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me where we\u2019re headed?\u201d I asked, lifting my drink in a toast.</p><p>He clinked his crystal tumbler against mine. \u201cDon\u2019t you want it to be a surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on how long it takes to get there. I might go crazy with curiosity before we land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you\u2019ll be too busy to think about it.\u201d His mouth curved. \u201cThis is a mode of transportation, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I glanced back, seeing the little hallway of doors at the back of the plane. One would be a lavatory, one an office, and the other a bedroom. Expectation coursed through me. \u201cHow much time have we got to kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHours,\u201d he purred.</p><p>My toes curled. \u201cOh, ace. The things I\u2019m going to do to you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re forgetting this is my weekend to have you any way I want. That was the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn our trip? That doesn\u2019t seem fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was true then, too.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened and he took a drink. \u201cAs soon as the captain gives the go-ahead to get up, I want you to head into the bedroom and get naked. Then lie on the bed and wait for me.\u201d</p><p>One of my brows arched. \u201cYou love the idea of having me rolling around naked waiting for you to fuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, yes. I recall the reverse being a fantasy of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I took a drink, relishing the way the vodka went down icy and smooth, then heated in my stomach.</p><p>The plane leveled out and the captain made a brief announcement freeing us to move about the cabin.</p><p>Gideon shot me a look that said, Well? Run along now.</p><p>Narrowing my gaze at him, I got up, taking my drink with me. I took my time, provoking him. And making myself more excited. I loved being at his mercy. As much as I loved making him lose his mind over me, I couldn\u2019t deny that his control was a major turn-on. I knew how absolute that control could be, which made it possible for me to trust him completely. I didn\u2019t think there was anything I wouldn\u2019t allow him to do to me.</p><p>Which was a conviction that would be tested sooner rather than later, I realized when I entered the sleeping cabin and saw the red silk-and-suede restraints lying so prettily on the white comforter.</p><p>Turning my head, I looked at Gideon only to find him gone. His empty glass sat on the table, the square cubes of ice glittering like diamonds.</p><p>My heart thudded. I stepped into the room, tossing back the rest of my drink. I couldn\u2019t bear to be restrained during sex, unless it was by Gideon. By his hands or the weight of his muscled body. We\u2019d never gone beyond that. I wasn\u2019t sure I could.</p><p>I set my empty tumbler on the nightstand, my hand shaking slightly. I didn\u2019t know if that was due to fear or excitement.</p><p>I knew Gideon would never hurt me. He worked so hard to make sure I was never afraid. But what if I disappointed him? What if I couldn\u2019t give him what he needed? He\u2019d mentioned bondage before and I knew one of his fantasies was to have me completely restrained and open to him, my body spread and helpless for him to use. I understood that desire, the need to feel total and utter possession. I felt that way toward him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I undressed. My movements were slow and careful, because my pulse was already thrumming too quickly. I was practically panting, the anticipation painfully acute. I hung my clothes on a hanger in the small closet, then climbed gingerly onto the raised bed. I was holding the restraints in my hands, doubting and second-guessing myself, when Gideon walked in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not lying down,\u201d he said gently, closing and locking the door behind him.</p><p>I held up the restraints.</p><p>\u201cCustom made, just for you.\u201d He approached, his nimble fingers already freeing the buttons of his shirt. \u201cCrimson is your color.\u201d</p><p>Gideon undressed as slowly as I had, affording me the opportunity to appreciate every inch of skin he exposed. He knew the rippling of his muscles beneath the rough silk of his tanned flesh would be an aphrodisiac to me.</p><p>\u201cAm I ready for this?\u201d I asked softly.</p><p>His gaze stayed on my face as he removed his pants. When he stood in just his black boxer briefs, his cock a thick bulge in the front, he answered, \u201cNever more than you can take, angel. I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I lay back, setting the cuffs on my belly. He came to me, his face tight with lust. He settled on the bed beside me and lifted my hand to his mouth, kissing my wrist. \u201cYour pulse is racing.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, not knowing what to say.</p><p>He picked up the cuffs, deftly unhooking the strip of crimson silk that held the two suede wrist pieces together. \u201cBeing bound helps you surrender, but it doesn\u2019t have to be literal. It just has to be enough to get you in the right headspace.\u201d</p><p>My stomach quivered as he laid the strap across it. He set one cuff on his thigh and held up the other.</p><p>\u201cGive me your wrist, angel.\u201d</p><p>I extended my hand to him, my breathing quickening as he fastened the suede snugly. The feel of the primitive material against my fluttering pulse was surprisingly arousing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not too tight, is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should feel the constriction enough to be constantly aware of it, but it shouldn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He bound my other wrist similarly, then straightened to admire his handwork. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d he murmured. \u201cReminds me of the red dress you wore the first time I had you. That was it for me, you know. You devastated me. There was no coming back from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d My apprehension left me, chased away by the warmth of his love and desire. I was precious to him. He would never push me further than I could go.</p><p>\u201cReach up and grip the sides of the pillow,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>I did, and the tightening of my wrists made me even more aware of the cuffs. I felt bound. Captured.</p><p>\u201cFeel it?\u201d he asked, and I understood.</p> <p>I loved him so much in that moment it hurt. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you to close your eyes,\u201d he went on, standing and taking off the final bit of clothing he wore. He was heavily aroused, his thick cock bobbing under its own weight, the wide crown shiny with pre-cum. My mouth flooded, hunger pulsing through me. He was so hot for me, so hungry, and yet you\u2019d never know it from his voice or the calm he radiated.</p><p>His perfect restraint made me wet. Gideon was the best of everything for me, a man who wanted me ferociously\u2014which I so urgently needed to feel secure\u2014but with enough self-possession to keep from overwhelming me.</p><p>\u201cI want you to keep your eyes closed if you can,\u201d he continued, his voice low and soothing, \u201cbut if it gets to be too much, open them. But say your safeword first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the satin strap and ran it lightly over my skin. The cool metal of the fastener at one end caught on my nipple, making it pucker. \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear about this, Eva. Your safeword isn\u2019t for me. It\u2019s for you. All you have to say to me is no or stop, but just like wearing the cuffs makes you feel bound, saying your safeword will put your mind in the right place. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, growing more comfortable and eager by the moment.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I followed the command. Almost instantly, I became sharply aware of the pressure at my wrists. The vibration and dull hum of the plane\u2019s engines became more pronounced. My lips parted. My breathing sped up.</p><p>The strap glided over my cleavage to my other breast. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, angel. Perfect. You have no idea what it does to me seeing you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon,\u201d I whispered, desperately in love with him. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>His splayed fingertips touched my throat, and then began a slow slide down my torso. \u201cMy heart\u2019s beating as fast as yours.\u201d</p><p>I arched and shivered beneath his slightly ticklish touch. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so hard it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cSpread your legs.\u201d His fingers slid through my cleft. \u201cYes. You\u2019re slick and hot, angel.\u201d</p><p>My sex clenched hungrily, my entire body responding to his touch.</p><p>\u201cAh, Eva. You\u2019ve got the greediest cunt. I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life keeping it satisfied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should start now.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cActually, we\u2019re starting with your mouth. I need you to suck me off so I can fuck you straight through until we land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I moaned. \u201cPlease tell me it\u2019s not a ten-hour flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have to spank you for that,\u201d he purred.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m a good girl!\u201d</p><p>The mattress dipped as he climbed onto it. I felt him work his way toward me until he knelt beside my shoulder. \u201cBe a good girl now, Eva. Turn toward me and open your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Eager, I obeyed. The silky soft crest of his cock brushed over my lips and I opened wider, absorbing the shock of pleasure I felt at the sound of his tormented groan. His fingers pushed into my hair, his palm cupping the back of my neck. Holding me where he wanted me.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he gasped. \u201cYour mouth is just as greedy.\u201d</p><p>The position I was in, on my back with my hands gripping the pillow, prevented me from taking more than the thick head. I mouthed him, my tongue flickering over the sensitive hole at the tip, thrilled by the joy of focusing on Gideon. Going down on him wasn\u2019t selfless for me. In fact, it was mostly for me that I loved it so much.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he encouraged, rocking his hips to fuck my mouth. \u201cSuck my cock just like that ... so good, angel. You make me come so hard.\u201d</p><p>I breathed him in, feeling my body respond to his scent, instinctively reacting to its mate. With all of my senses saturated with Gideon, I gave myself over to our mutual pleasure.</p><p>I dreamed I was falling, and it jerked me awake.</p><p>My heart raced from the surprise, and then I realized the plane had dropped suddenly. Turbulence. I was fine. And so was Gideon, who\u2019d fallen asleep beside me. That made me smile. I\u2019d almost passed out when he\u2019d finally given me an orgasm after fucking me so thoroughly I was nearly incoherent with the need to come. It was only fair that he\u2019d be a little wiped out, too.</p><p>A quick glance at my watch told me we\u2019d been in the air almost three hours. I guessed we\u2019d napped about twenty minutes, maybe even less than that. I was pretty sure he\u2019d been at me for close to two hours. I could still feel the echo of his thick cock sliding in and out of me, stroking and rubbing all of my sensitive spots.</p><p>I slid carefully out of bed, not wanting to wake him, and was super quiet when closing the pocket door that concealed the en suite lavatory.</p><p>Outfitted with dark wood and chrome fixtures, the lavatory was both masculine and elegant. The toilet had armrests, which made it look like a throne, and a frosted window allowed sunlight into the space. A walk-in shower had a hand wand showerhead that looked very tempting, but I was still wearing the crimson cuffs. So I took care of business, washed my hands, then spotted hand lotion in one of the drawers.</p><p>The fragrance was subtle but wonderful. As I rubbed it on, a wicked idea entered my mind. Grabbing the tube, I took it back to the bedroom with me.</p><p>The sight that greeted me when I reentered made my breath catch.</p><p>Gideon sprawled across the queen-size bed, dwarfing it with his beautiful golden body. One arm was tossed over his head, the other draped across his pecs. He had one leg bent and fallen off to the side, while the other stretched out until his foot hung off the end of the mattress. His cock lay heavily across his lower abs, the crown nearly reaching his navel.</p><p>God, he was so virile. Stunningly so. And powerful, his entire body a study in physical strength and grace.</p><p>And yet I could bring him to his knees. That humbled me.</p><p>He woke when I climbed onto the bed, blinking up at me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I told him, lowering into his outstretched arms. His skin felt like warm silk and I snuggled into him.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d He took my mouth in a sweet, hungry kiss. \u201cI\u2019m not nearly done with you.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath of courage, I set the tube of lotion on his stomach. \u201cI want to be inside you, ace.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down, frowning, then stilled. I was close enough to feel his breathing change. \u201cThat isn\u2019t our deal,\u201d he said carefully.</p><p>\u201cI think we need to revisit and revise. Besides, it\u2019s still Friday, so it\u2019s not quite the weekend yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt turns me on just thinking about it,\u201d I whispered, wrapping my legs around his thigh and rubbing against him, letting him feel that I was wet. The coarse hair sliding against my sensitive sex made me moan, as did the sense of being shameless and naughty. \u201cYou say stop and I will. Just let me try.\u201d</p><p>His teeth ground audibly.</p><p>I kissed him. Pressed my body against him. When Gideon was walking me through something new, he talked me through it. But with him, sometimes talking wasn\u2019t the answer. Sometimes it was best to help him turn his mind off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAngel\u2014\u201d</p><p>I slid over him, straddling him, setting the lotion aside so he wasn\u2019t thinking about it so much. If I took him someplace new, I didn\u2019t want either of us to overthink it. And if it didn\u2019t feel natural, I wouldn\u2019t do it. What we had together was too precious to spoil.</p><p>Running my hands down his chest, I gentled him, let him feel my love for him. How I worshipped him. There was nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for him, except give up.</p><p>His arms came around me, one hand pushing into my hair, the other settling at the small of my back, urging me closer. His mouth was open to me, his tongue licking and tasting. I sank into the kiss, angling my head to get at him.</p><p>His cock hardened between us, thickening against my belly. He arched his hips upward, increasing the pressure between us, and moaned into my mouth.</p><p>I moved across his cheek to his throat, licking the salt from his skin before latching on. I sucked rhythmically, scoring him with my teeth, marking him. With his hand at my nape, he held me close, rough sounds of pleasure vibrating against my lips.</p><p>Pulling back, I looked at the bright red hickey I\u2019d left him with. \u201cMine,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d he vowed roughly, his eyes hooded and hot.</p><p>\u201cEvery inch of you.\u201d I moved lower, finding and teasing the flat disks of his nipples. I licked over the tiny points, then around them, my touch feather light until I suckled him.</p><p>Gideon hissed as my cheeks hollowed on a drawing pull, his hands falling away to grip the comforter on either side of his hips.</p><p>\u201cInside and out,\u201d I said softly, as I turned to his other nipple and lavished similar attention on it.</p><p>As I made my way down his straining body, I felt his tension grow. When my tongue rimmed his navel, he jerked violently.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d I soothed him, rubbing my cheek against his throbbing cock.</p><p>He\u2019d washed up after our earlier round, leaving him smelling clean and delectable. His sac hung heavily between his legs, the satiny flesh bared by his meticulous grooming. I loved that he was as smooth as I was. When he was inside me, the connection was complete in every way, the sensations emphasized by touching skin to skin.</p><p>With my hands on his inner thighs, I urged him to spread open wider, giving me room to settle comfortably. Then I licked along the seam of his taut sac.</p><p>Gideon growled. The untamed, animalistic sound sent a ripple of apprehension through me. Still, I didn\u2019t stop. I couldn\u2019t. I wanted him too much.</p><p>Using only my mouth, I worshipped him, sucking softly and caressing him with my tongue. Then I suspended his testicles on the pads of my thumbs, lifting them to access the sensitive skin beneath. His balls drew up, the skin tightening and pulling close to his body. My tongue reached a little lower, an exploratory foray toward my ultimate goal.</p><p>\u201cEva. Stop.\u201d He panted. \u201cI can\u2019t. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>My mind raced as I continued to touch him, my hand gripping his cock and stroking it. He was still too much inside his own head, too focused on what was to come instead of what was happening now.</p><p>But I knew how to get him to focus on something else.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we do this together, ace?\u201d Shifting, I turned around, straddling him backward.</p><p>His hands grabbed my hips before I was fully balanced, yanking my sex down to his waiting mouth. I cried out in surprise as he latched onto my clit, sucking hungrily. Swollen and sensitive from earlier, I could hardly bear the sudden rush of pleasure. He was wild and ravenous, his passion driven by his frustration and fear.</p> <p>Wrapping my lips around his cock, I gave him back what he was giving to me.</p><p>As I sucked hard on the head of his erection, his groan vibrated against my clit and nearly made me come. He held me to him, his fingers digging into my hips with bruising force.</p><p>I loved it. He was unraveling, and while he was afraid of what that meant, it thrilled me. He didn\u2019t trust himself with me, but I trusted him. It was a level of trust we\u2019d worked hard for, shed tears and blood for, and I valued it more than anything else in my life.</p><p>Fisting his cock, I pumped him, lapping up the surges of pre-cum that spilled from him. I\u2019d just realized he was trembling when he wrenched us to our sides, placing us side by side instead of one on top of the other.</p><p>He ate me hard and fast, his tongue pushing into my sex and driving me mad with furious thrusts. I touched the pucker of his anus with the tip of my finger, my mouth sliding feverishly up and down his thickness. He shuddered and the low sound that escaped him sent goose bumps racing across my sweat-misted skin.</p><p>My hips were working without volition, grinding my slick sex against his working mouth. I was moaning uncontrollably, my core trembling with tiny shivers of delight. He was fucking me so good with his tongue ... driving me insane.</p><p>And then his fingertip was mimicking mine, rubbing against my rear entrance. My free hand searched blindly for the lotion.</p><p>Gideon pushed the tube into my grip, a much-needed sign of consent.</p><p>I\u2019d barely flipped the cap open when his finger pushed inside me. As I arched my back, his cock slipped out of my mouth and I gasped his name, my body absorbing the shock of his unexpected entry. He\u2019d lubed his fingers before passing the tube.</p><p>For a moment, I was overwhelmed by him. He was everywhere\u2014around me, inside me, plastered against me. And he wasn\u2019t gentle. His finger in my rear plunged and retreated, fucking me, his forcefulness still tinged with that hint of anger. I was pushing him where he didn\u2019t want to go and he was punishing me with pleasure that came too quick to manage.</p><p>I was gentler with him. Opening my mouth, I sucked his cock. I let the lotion warm on my fingers before I rubbed it against him. And I waited for him to push out for me, to flower open, before I pushed inside with a single finger.</p><p>The sound that rattled from him then was like nothing I\u2019d ever heard. It was the cry of a wounded animal, but filled with soul-deep pain. He froze against me, breathing hard against my sex, his finger buried deep, his hard body quivering.</p><p>I pulled my mouth off him and crooned, \u201cI\u2019m in you now, baby. You\u2019re doing so good. I\u2019m going to make you feel so good.\u201d</p><p>He gasped when I slid a little deeper, my fingertip gliding over his prostate. \u201cEva!\u201d</p><p>His cock swelled even further, turning red, the thick veins standing out along its length, pre-ejaculate spurting onto his lower belly. He was hard as stone, curving up to a point just past his navel. I\u2019d never seen him so aroused and it made me so hot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d I stroked gently inside him, my tongue licking along his raging hard-on. \u201cI love you so much, Gideon. I love touching you like this ... seeing you this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Christ.\u201d He shook violently. \u201cFuck me, angel. Now,\u201d he bit out, as I rubbed him again. \u201cHard.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed his erection and gave him what he demanded, massaging the spot inside him that made him curse and writhe, his body fighting the bombardment of sensation. His hands left me, his big frame arching away, but I held on with my lips and hands, driving him onward.</p><p>\u201cAh, God,\u201d he sobbed, ripping the comforter in his fists, the tearing sound reverberating through the enclosed space. \u201cStop. Eva. No more. Damn it!\u201d</p><p>I pressed inside the same moment I sucked hard outside and he came with such force, I choked on the heated flood. He spurted across my lips as I pulled away, over his stomach and my breasts, releasing in a gushing torrent that made it hard to believe he\u2019d already come twice in as many hours. I could feel the contractions against my fingertip, the wrenching pulses that propelled the semen from his cock.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until his body stilled that I pulled away, turning around shakily to pull him into my arms. We were a sweaty, sticky mess and I loved that it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Gideon buried his damp face between my breasts and cried.</p><p>19</p><p>GIDEON\u2019S CHOSEN LOCATION was paradise. His pilot took us over the Windward Islands, flying low over the impossibly beautiful blue waters of the tranquil Caribbean into a private airport not far from our ultimate destination, the Crosswinds resort.</p><p>We were both still pretty shell-shocked when the plane landed. Gideon had had the orgasm of his life, after all. We had our passports stamped with our hair still wet, our hands linked tightly together. We hardly spoke, either to each other or to anyone else. I think we were both too raw.</p><p>We slid into a waiting limousine and Gideon poured himself a stiff drink. His face gave nothing away, his guard up and impenetrable. I shook my head when he held up the crystal decanter in silent query.</p><p>He settled on the seat beside me and put his arm around my shoulders.</p><p>I snuggled into him, draping my legs over his lap. \u201cAre we okay?\u201d</p><p>He pressed a hard kiss to my forehead. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He tossed back his drink and set the empty tumbler in a cup holder.</p><p>We didn\u2019t say anything else on the long drive from the airport to the resort. It was dark by the time we arrived, but the open-air lobby was brightly lit. Framed by lush potted plants and decorated in dark woods and colorful ceramic tiles, the front desk welcomed guests with a carefree yet elegant style.</p><p>The hotel manager was waiting on the circular front drive as we rolled to a stop. His appearance was immaculate, his smile wide. He was clearly excited to have Gideon in residence and doubly so that Gideon knew his name\u2014Claude.</p><p>Claude spoke animatedly, as we followed along behind him with our hands linked firmly together. No one could tell from looking at Gideon how intimate and exposed to each other we\u2019d been only an hour or so before. While my hair had dried in a messy mop, his looked as gorgeous and sexy as ever. His suit was perfectly pressed and beautifully worn, while my dress looked a little limp after the long day. My makeup had washed off in the shower, leaving me pale with the remnants of raccoon eyes.</p><p>Yet Gideon\u2019s possessiveness toward me was clear in the way he gripped me, and how he steered me into our suite in front of him with his hand at the small of my back. He made me feel safe and accepted, even though he was in his work persona and I wasn\u2019t at my best, which reflected on him.</p><p>I loved him for that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I just wished he weren\u2019t so quiet. It made me worry. And it totally made me doubt my decision to push him after he\u2019d told me to stop more than once. What the hell did I know about what he needed to get better?</p><p>As the manager continued to talk to Gideon, I moved slowly through the massive living area, with its wide-open terrace and white couches spread across bamboo floors. The master bedroom was equally impressive, with a large bed framed by mosquito netting and another open terrace that led directly to a private swimming pool with an infinity edge that made it look like part of the shimmering ocean just beyond it.</p><p>A warm breeze blew in, kissing my face and sifting through my hair. The rising moon cast a trail over the ocean, and the distant sounds of laughter and reggae made me feel isolated in a way that wasn\u2019t quite pleasant.</p> <p>Nothing was right when Gideon was off.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>I turned to face him and heard the front door shut in the other room. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic.\u201d</p><p>He gave a curt nod. \u201cI ordered dinner in. Tilapia and rice, some fresh fruit and cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are clothes for you in the closet and drawers. You\u2019ll find bikinis, too, but the pool and beach are private, so you don\u2019t need them unless you want them. If there\u2019s anything missing, just let me know and we\u2019ll get it brought in.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, noting the several feet between us. His eyes glittered in the soft light cast by the dimmed cam lighting and bedside table lamps. He was edgy and distant, and I felt tears building in the back of my throat.</p><p>\u201cGideon ...\u201d I held my hand out to him. \u201cDid I make a mistake? Did I break something between us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d He sighed. He came close enough to catch my hand and lift it to his lips. Up close I could see how his gaze darted away, as if he had a hard time looking at me. A sick feeling settled in my gut. \u201cCrossfire.\u201d</p><p>The one word came out so low, I almost thought I\u2019d imagined it. Then he pulled me into his arms and kissed me sweetly.</p><p>\u201cAce.\u201d Pushing onto my tiptoes, I cupped the back of his neck and kissed him back with everything I had.</p> <p>He pulled away too quickly. \u201cLet\u2019s change for dinner before it gets here. I could stand being in less clothes.\u201d</p><p>I stepped back reluctantly, acknowledging that he had to be hot in his suit, but still sensing that something wasn\u2019t right. That feeling worsened when Gideon left the room to change and I realized we wouldn\u2019t be sharing the same bedroom.</p><p>I kicked off my shoes in the walk-in closet that was filled with way too many clothes for a weekend trip. Most were white. Gideon liked me in white. I suspected it was because he thought of me as his angel.</p><p>Did he still think of me that way now? Or was I the devil? A selfish bitch who made him face demons he\u2019d rather forget?</p><p>I changed into a simple cotton slip dress in black, which matched my funereal mood. I felt like something had died between us.</p><p>Gideon and I had stumbled many times before, but I\u2019d never felt this level of withdrawal from him. This discomfort and unease.</p><p>I\u2019d felt it with other guys, when they were getting ready to tell me they didn\u2019t want to see me anymore.</p><p>Dinner arrived and was neatly laid out on the terrace table overlooking the secluded beach. I saw a white tent cabana on the sand and remembered Gideon\u2019s dream of us rolling around on a chaise for two by the water, making love.</p> <p>My heart hurt.</p><p>I gulped two glasses of crisp, fruity white wine and went through the motions of eating, even though I\u2019d lost my appetite. Gideon sat across from me in loose white linen drawstring pants and nothing else, which just made everything worse. He was so handsome, so goddamned sexy it was impossible not to stare at him. But he was miles away from me. A silent, forceful presence that made me want with every fiber of my soul.</p><p>The emotional gulf between us was growing. I couldn\u2019t reach across it.</p><p>I pushed my plate away once I\u2019d cleared it and realized Gideon had hardly eaten at all. He\u2019d just forked his food around and helped me drain the bottle of wine.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I told him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve ... I didn\u2019t ...\u201d I swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Shoving back from the table with a loud screech of the chair legs across the tile, I hurried away from the patio.</p><p>\u201cEva! Wait.\u201d</p><p>My feet hit the warm sand and I ran toward the ocean, pulling my dress off and colliding with water that felt as hot as a bath. It was shallow for several feet, then dropped off suddenly, plunging me in below my head. I bent my knees and sank, grateful to be submerged and hidden as I cried.</p><p>The weightlessness soothed my heavy heart. My hair billowed around me and I felt the soft brush of fish as they darted past the invader in their silent, peaceful world.</p><p>Being yanked back into reality had me sputtering and flailing.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d Gideon growled and took my mouth, kissing me hard and furious as he stalked out of the water and up the beach. He took me to the cabana and dropped me onto the chaise, covering me with his body before I fully caught my breath.</p><p>I was still dizzy when he groaned and said, \u201cMarry me.\u201d</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t why I said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>GIDEON had gone into the water after me with his pants on. The soaked linen clung to my bare legs as he sprawled over me and kissed me as if he were dying of a thirst only I could quench. His hands were in my hair, holding me still. His mouth was frantic, his lips swollen like mine, his tongue greedy and possessive.</p><p>I lay beneath him unmoving. Shocked. My startled brain quickly caught up.</p><p>He\u2019d been agonizing over popping the question, not because he was leaving me.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he bit out, rubbing his cheek against mine. The first tingle of stubble roughened his jaw, the sensation jolting me into a deeper awareness of where we were and what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d My mind stuttered to a halt again.</p><p>\u201cThe word is yes, Eva.\u201d He pushed up and stared down at me fiercely. \u201cReal simple\u2014yes.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard. \u201cWe can\u2019t get married tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can,\u201d he said emphatically, \u201cand we will. I need it, Eva. I need the vows, the legality ... I\u2019m going crazy without them.\u201d</p><p>I felt the world spinning, like I was on one of those fun-house barrel rides that revolve so fast you\u2019re stuck to the wall with centrifugal force when the floor drops away from your feet. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon,\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cYou can say that to me after the flight over?\u201d he snapped. \u201cYou fucking own me, Eva. I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t own you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d I gasped, inexplicably panicked.</p><p>Gideon rolled, pulling me on top of him, his arms banding around me. Possessing me. \u201cYou want this,\u201d he insisted. \u201cYou love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, yes.\u201d I dropped my forehead to his chest. \u201cBut you\u2019re rushing into\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d ask you this on the fly? For God\u2019s sake, Eva, you know me better than that. I\u2019ve been planning this for weeks. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve thought about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon ... we can\u2019t just run off and elope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about our families? Or friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get married again for them. I want that, too.\u201d He brushed the wet hair off my cheek. \u201cI want pictures of us in the newspapers, magazines ... everywhere. But that will take months. I can\u2019t wait that long. This is for us. We don\u2019t have to tell anyone, if you don\u2019t want. We can call it an engagement. It can be our secret.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, not knowing what to say. His urgency was both romantic and terrifying.</p><p>\u201cI asked your dad,\u201d he went on, shocking me all over again. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he was in town. I had an opportunity and I took it.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, that hurt. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him not to. Told him it wasn\u2019t going to happen right away. That I was still working on getting you back. I recorded it, so you can listen to the conversation if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>I blinked down at him. \u201cYou recorded it?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t leaving anything to chance,\u201d he said unapologetically.</p><p>\u201cYou told him it wouldn\u2019t be right away. You lied to him.\u201d</p><p>His smile was razor sharp. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie. It\u2019s been a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. You\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. If so, you\u2019ve made me this way.\u201d He pressed a hard kiss to my cheek. \u201cI can\u2019t live without you, Eva. I can\u2019t even imagine trying. Just the thought makes me insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He frowned. \u201cYou know there\u2019s no one else for either of us. What are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Arguments rushed through my mind. Every reason we should wait, every possible pitfall seemed crystal clear. But nothing came out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving you any options here,\u201d he said decisively, twisting up and standing with me cradled in his arms. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this, Eva. Enjoy your last remaining hours as a single woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGIDEON,\u201d I gasped, my head thrashing as the orgasm poured through me.</p><p>His sweat dripped onto my chest, his hips tireless as he stroked his magnificent penis into me over and over, rolling and thrusting, shallow then deep.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he praised hoarsely, \u201csqueeze my dick just like that. You feel so good, angel. You\u2019re going to make me come again.\u201d</p><p>I panted for breath, boneless and tired from his unrelenting demands. He\u2019d woken me twice before, taking me with skilled precision, imprinting onto my brain and my body that I belonged to him. That I was his and he could do whatever he wanted to me.</p><p>It made me so hot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUmm ...\u201d He purred, sliding his cock deep. \u201cYou\u2019re so creamy with my cum. I love the way you feel when I\u2019ve been at you all night. A lifetime of this, Eva. I\u2019ll never stop.\u201d</p><p>I draped my leg over his hip, holding him in me. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>His wickedly curved mouth brushed over mine.</p> <p>\u201cLove me,\u201d I demanded, my nails digging into his hips as he flexed inside me.</p><p>\u201cI do, angel,\u201d he whispered, his smile widening. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>WHEN I woke, he was gone.</p><p>I stretched in a tangle of sheets that smelled of sex and Gideon and breathed in the salt-tinged breeze drifting through the open patio doors.</p><p>I lay there for a while, thinking over the night and the day before. Then the weeks before, and the few months since I\u2019d met Gideon. Then beyond that. Back to Brett and others I had dated. Back to a time when I\u2019d been so certain I would never find a man who loved me for who I was, with all my emotional scars and baggage and neediness.</p> <p>What else could I say besides yes, now that by some miracle I\u2019d found him?</p><p>Rolling out of bed, I felt a flutter of excitement at the thought of finding Gideon and agreeing to marry him without reservation. I loved the idea of eloping with him, of our first vows spoken in private, with no one watching who harbored doubts or dislike or bad wishes. After all we\u2019d both been through, it made perfect sense for our new beginning to be filled with nothing but love and hope and happiness.</p><p>I should\u2019ve known he\u2019d plan it all perfectly, from the privacy to the exclusive locale. Of course we\u2019d get married on a beach. Beaches held fond memories for both of us, not the least of which was our last time away at the Outer Banks.</p><p>When I saw the breakfast tray on the coffee table in the bedroom\u2019s seating area, I smiled. There was a white silk robe draped over the back of the chair, too.</p><p>Gideon never missed a trick.</p><p>I pulled the robe on and reached to pour myself a cup of coffee, wanting a caffeine boost before I searched for him in the suite and gave him my answer. That was when I saw the prenuptial agreement tucked beneath the covered breakfast plate.</p> <p>My hand froze halfway to the carafe. The agreement was tastefully arranged beneath the single red rose in a slender white vase, with the silverware gleaming from an artfully folded cloth napkin.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I was so surprised and ... crushed. Of course, Gideon would\u2019ve planned everything down to the last detail\u2014starting with the prenup. After all, hadn\u2019t he tried to start our relationship with an agreement?</p><p>All of my giddy happiness left me in a rush. Deflated, I turned away from the tray and headed into the shower instead. I took my time washing up, moving in slow motion. I decided I\u2019d rather say no than read a legal document that put a price on my love. A love that was precious and priceless to me.</p><p>Still, I feared it was too late, that the damage was already done. Just knowing he\u2019d had a prenup drafted changed everything and I couldn\u2019t blame him for that. For God\u2019s sake, he was Gideon Cross. One of the twenty-five richest men in the world. It was inconceivable that he wouldn\u2019t demand a prenuptial agreement. And I wasn\u2019t na?ve. I knew better than to dream of Prince Charming and castles in the sky.</p><p>Showered and clothed in a light sundress, I pulled my hair back in a wet ponytail and went for the coffee. I poured a cup, added cream and sweetener, then slid the prenup free and stepped out to the patio.</p><p>Down on the beach, preparations were under way for the wedding. A flower-covered arch had been placed by the shoreline and braided white ribbon had been draped across the sand to mark an impromptu aisle.</p><p>I chose to sit with my back to the view, because it hurt to look at it.</p><p>I took a sip of coffee, let it soak into me, then took another. I was halfway done with my cup when I gathered enough courage to read the damn legalese. The opening few pages detailed the assets we owned separately prior to marriage. Gideon\u2019s holdings were staggering. When did he find time to sleep? I thought the dollar amount attributed to me was wrong, until I considered how long the principal had been sitting in investments.</p> <p>Stanton had taken my five million and doubled it.</p><p>It struck me then how stupid I was for just sitting on it, instead of investing it where it could help those who needed it. I\u2019d been acting like that blood money didn\u2019t exist when I should\u2019ve been putting it to work. I made a mental note to tackle that project as soon as I got back to New York.</p><p>After that, the reading got interesting.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s first stipulation was that I take the Cross name as my own. I could keep Tramell as an additional middle name, but with no hyphenation as a surname. Eva Cross\u2014it was nonnegotiable. And so very like him. My domineering lover made no apologies for his caveman tendencies.</p><p>His second stipulation was that I accept ten million from him upon the wedding, doubling my personal estate just for saying I do. Every year thereafter, he gave me more. I would receive bonuses for each child we had together, be paid for going to couples therapy with him. I agreed to counseling and mediation in the event of a divorce. I agreed to share a residence with him, bimonthly vacations, date nights ...</p><p>The more I read, the more I understood. The prenup didn\u2019t protect Gideon\u2019s assets at all. He gave them freely, going so far as to stipulate up front that fifty percent of everything he acquired from our marriage onward was irrefutably mine. Unless he cheated. If that happened, it cost him severely.</p><p>The prenup was designed to protect his heart, to bind me and bribe me to stay with him no matter what. He was giving everything he had.</p><p>He joined me on the terrace when I flipped to the last page, strolling out in a pair of partially buttoned jeans and nothing else. I knew his perfectly timed arrival wasn\u2019t coincidental. He\u2019d been watching me from somewhere, gauging my reaction.</p><p>I brushed the tears from my cheeks with studied nonchalance. \u201cGood morning, ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, angel.\u201d He bent and pressed a kiss to my cheek before taking the chair at the end of the table to my left.</p><p>A member of the staff came out with breakfast and coffee, arranging the place settings quickly and efficiently before disappearing as swiftly as he\u2019d appeared.</p><p>I looked at Gideon, at the way the tropical breeze adored him and played with that sexy mane of hair. Sitting there as he was, so virile and casual, he wasn\u2019t at all the cut-and-dried presentation of dollar signs I\u2019d seen in the prenup.</p><p>Allowing the pages to flip back to the first page, I set my hand on top of it and said, \u201cNothing in this document can keep me married to you.\u201d</p><p>He took a quick, deep breath. \u201cThen we\u2019ll revisit and revise. Name your terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your money. I want this,\u201d I gestured at him. \u201cEspecially this.\u201d I leaned forward and placed my hand over his heart. \u201cYou\u2019re the only thing that can hold me, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this, Eva.\u201d He caught my hand and held it pressed flat to his chest. \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck up. And you\u2019ll want to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d I argued. \u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed you running into the ocean last night and sinking like a damn stone!\u201d Leaning forward, he held my gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t argue the prenup on principle. If there are no deal breakers for you in it, live with it. For me.\u201d</p><p>I sat back. \u201cYou and I have a long way to go,\u201d I said softly. \u201cA document can\u2019t force us to believe in each other. I\u2019m talking about trust, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well\u2014\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t trust myself not to fuck this up, and you don\u2019t trust that you\u2019ve got what I need. We trust each other just fine. We can work on the rest together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I watched his eyes light up and knew I was making the right decision, even if I was still partially convinced that it was a decision we were making too soon. \u201cI do have one revision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just did. The name issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonnegotiable,\u201d he said flatly, with an empathic swipe of his hand for good measure.</p><p>I arched a brow. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fucking Neanderthal. I want to take my dad\u2019s name, too. He\u2019s wanted that and it\u2019s bothered him my whole life. This is my chance to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Eva Lauren Reyes Cross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva Lauren Tramell Reyes Cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a mouthful, angel,\u201d he drawled, \u201cbut do what makes you happy. That\u2019s all I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I want is you,\u201d I told him, leaning forward to offer him my mouth for a kiss.</p><p>His lips touched mine. \u201cLet\u2019s make it official.\u201d</p><p>I married Gideon Geoffrey Cross barefoot on a Caribbean beach with the hotel manager and Angus McLeod as witnesses. I hadn\u2019t realized Angus was there, but I was pleased that he was.</p><p>It was a quick, beautifully simple ceremony. I could tell from the beaming smiles of the reverend and Claude that they were honored to officiate over Gideon\u2019s nuptials.</p><p>I wore the prettiest dress I\u2019d found in the closet. Strapless and ruched from breasts to hips, with petals of organza floating down to my feet, it was a sweet yet sexy romantic gown. My hair was up in an elegantly messy knot with a red rose tucked into it. The hotel provided a bouquet of white-ribboned jasmine.</p><p>Gideon wore graphite gray slacks and an untucked white dress shirt. He went barefoot, too. I cried when he repeated his vows, his voice strong and sure, even while his eyes betrayed a heated yearning.</p><p>He loved me so much.</p><p>The entire ceremony was intimate and deeply personal. Perfect.</p><p>I missed my mom and dad and Cary. I missed Ireland and Stanton and Clancy. But when Gideon bent to seal our marriage with a kiss, he whispered, \u201cWe\u2019ll do this again. As many times as you want.\u201d</p><p>I loved him so much.</p><p>Angus stepped up to kiss me on both cheeks. \u201cIt does me good to see you both so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Angus. You\u2019ve taken good care of him for a long time.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his eyes glistening as he turned to Gideon. He said something so heavily accented by his Scottish heritage, I couldn\u2019t be sure it was any form of English at all. Whatever it was, it made Gideon\u2019s eyes shine, too. How much of a surrogate father had Angus been to Gideon over the years? I would always be grateful to him for giving Gideon support and affection when he desperately needed it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We cut a small cake and toasted with champagne on the terrace of our suite. We signed the register the reverend offered and were given our certificate of marriage to sign as well. Gideon\u2019s fingers brushed over it reverently.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you needed?\u201d I teased him. \u201cThis piece of paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you, Mrs. Cross.\u201d He pulled me close. \u201cI wanted this.\u201d</p> <p>Angus took both the certificate and prenup with him when he made himself scarce. Both had been duly notarized by the hotel manager and would end up wherever Gideon kept such things.</p><p>As for Gideon and me, we ended up in the cabana, tangled naked with each other. We sipped chilled champagne, touched each other playfully and greedily, and kissed lazily as the day crawled by.</p><p>That was perfect, too.</p><p>\u201cSo, how are we handling this when we get back?\u201d I asked him, as we ate a candlelit dinner in the dining room of our suite. \u201cThe whole we-ran-off-and-got-hitched explanation.\u201d</p><p>Gideon shrugged and licked melted butter off his thumb. \u201cHowever you want.\u201d</p> <p>I pulled the meat out of a crab leg and considered the options. \u201cI want to tell Cary for sure. And I think my dad will be okay with it. I kind of talked around it when I called him earlier and he told me you\u2019d asked him, so he\u2019s prepared. I don\u2019t think Stanton will care much either way, no offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about my mom, though. Things are already rough between us. She\u2019ll be totally stoked that we\u2019re married\u201d\u2014I paused a minute, absorbing that for the millionth time\u2014\u201cbut I don\u2019t want her to think that I left her out because I\u2019m mad at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just tell her and everyone else we\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p><p>I dunked the crabmeat into drawn butter, thinking I wanted to get very used to seeing Gideon shirtless and sated and relaxed. \u201cShe\u2019ll have a conniption if we live together before the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then she\u2019ll have to plan fast,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife, Eva. I don\u2019t care if anyone else knows it or not, I know it. And I want to come home to you, have coffee in the morning with you, zip up the back of your dresses, and unzip them at night.\u201d</p> <p>Watching him snap a crab leg with his hands, I asked, \u201cWill you wear a wedding band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>That made me smile. He paused and stared at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I prompted, when he didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cDo I have butter splashed on my face?\u201d</p><p>He sat back with a deep exhalation. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. I love looking at you.\u201d</p><p>I felt my face heat. \u201cYou\u2019re not so bad yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s starting to go away,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>My smile faded. \u201cWhat? What\u2019s going away?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe ... worry. It feels safe, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d He sipped his wine. \u201cSettled. It\u2019s a good feeling. I like it. A lot.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t had as much time to get used to the idea of being married, but as I sat back and really thought about it, I had to agree. He was mine. No one could doubt it now. \u201cI like it, too.\u201d</p><p>He lifted my hand to his lips. The ring he\u2019d given me caught the candlelight and glimmered with multihued fire. It was a tastefully large Asscher-cut diamond in a vintage setting. I loved the timeless sophistication of it, but more so because it was the ring his father had married his mother with.</p><p>Even though Gideon was deeply wounded by his parents\u2019 betrayals, their time together as a family of three was the last true happiness he remembered before meeting me.</p><p>And he swore he wasn\u2019t romantic.</p><p>He caught me admiring the ring. \u201cYou like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d I looked at him. \u201cIt\u2019s one of a kind. I was thinking we could do something unusual with our home, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He squeezed my hand and resumed eating.</p><p>\u201cI understand the need to sleep apart, but I don\u2019t like having doors and walls between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either, but your safety comes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a master suite with two bedrooms connected by a bathroom with no doors. Just archways or passageways. So technically, we\u2019re still in the same open space.\u201d</p><p>He considered that a minute, then nodded. \u201cDraw it up and we\u2019ll bring in a designer to make it happen. We\u2019ll continue staying on the Upper West Side for now while we have the penthouse refinished. Cary can take a look at the adjoining one-bedroom apartment and make any changes he wants at the same time.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my bare foot along the back of his calf as a thank-you. The sounds of music drifted in on the evening wind, reminding me that we weren\u2019t alone on a deserted island.</p><p>Was Angus having a good time somewhere? Or was he stuck standing outside the door to our suite?</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Angus?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAround.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Ra\u00fal here, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s in New York working out how Nathan\u2019s bracelet ended up where it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I suddenly lost my appetite. Picking up my napkin, I wiped my fingers. \u201cShould I be worried?\u201d</p><p>It was a rhetorical question, since I\u2019d never stopped worrying. The mystery of who was responsible for sending the police in another direction was always there, niggling at the back of my mind.</p><p>\u201cSomeone handed me a get-out-of-jail-free card,\u201d he said evenly, licking his lower lip. \u201cI expected that was going to cost me something, but no one\u2019s approached me yet. So, I\u2019ll approach them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll find them,\u201d he murmured darkly. \u201cThen we\u2019ll know why.\u201d</p><p>Beneath the table, I wrapped my legs around his and held on.</p><p>WE danced on the beach by the light of the moon. The lush humidity was sensuous at night, and we reveled in it. Gideon shared my bed that night, even though I could tell how difficult it was for him to take the risk. I couldn\u2019t imagine sleeping alone on my wedding night and trusted that his prescription combined with the previous night\u2019s lack of sleep would help him sleep deeply. It did.</p><p>Sunday, he gave me the choice of going to a fabulous waterfall or taking the resort\u2019s catamaran out to sea or rafting down a jungle river. I smiled and told him next time, and then I had my wicked way with him.</p><p>We lazed around all day, skinny-dipping in the private pool and napping when the mood struck us. It was after midnight when we left, and I was sorry to go. The weekend had been far too short.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lifetime of weekends,\u201d he murmured as we drove back to the airport, reading my mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m selfish with you. I want you all to myself.\u201d</p><p>When we boarded the jet, the clothes we\u2019d had at our disposal at the resort came with us. It made me smile, thinking of how little we\u2019d worn over the two days.</p><p>I took the cosmetic case into the bedroom so I could brush my teeth before sleeping the duration of the flight home. That was when I saw the patent leather and brass luggage tag attached to it, engraved with Eva Cross.</p><p>Gideon slipped into the lavatory behind me and kissed my shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s crash, angel. We need some sleep before work.\u201d</p><p>Pointing at the luggage tag, I said, \u201cWas my saying yes really that much of a foregone conclusion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was prepared to hold you hostage until you did.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t doubt him. \u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re married.\u201d He smacked me on the ass. \u201cNow hurry up, Mrs. Cross.\u201d</p><p>I hurried and slipped into the bed beside him. He immediately spooned behind me, tucking me close.</p><p>\u201cSweet dreams, baby,\u201d I whispered, wrapping my arms over his around my middle.</p><p>His mouth curved against my neck. \u201cMy dreams already came true.\u201d</p><p>20</p><p>IT WAS WEIRD going to work on Monday morning and having no one realize my life was profoundly different. Who knew how much saying a few words and slipping on a ring of metal could change a person\u2019s perception of themselves?</p><p>I wasn\u2019t just Eva, the New York newbie trying to make it on her own in the big city with her best friend. I was a mogul\u2019s wife. I had a whole new set of responsibilities and expectations. Just thinking about it intimidated me.</p><p>Megumi stood as she buzzed me through the security doors at Waters Field &amp; Leaman. She was dressed with unusual sedateness in a black sleeveless dress with an asymmetrical hemline and bright fuchsia heels. \u201cWow. You\u2019ve got an amazing tan! I\u2019m so jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. How\u2019d your weekend go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame old, same old. Michael stopped calling.\u201d Her nose wrinkled. \u201cI miss the harassment. Made me feel wanted.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at her. \u201cYou\u2019re nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. So tell me where you went. And did you go with the rock star or Cross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d Although I was tempted to reveal everything. The only thing that held me back was that I hadn\u2019t told Cary yet and he needed to come first.</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Her dark eyes narrowed. \u201cAre you seriously not going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will.\u201d I winked. \u201cJust not right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where you work, you know,\u201d she called after me as I headed down the hallway to my cubicle.</p><p>When I reached my desk, I got ready to type a quick text to Cary and discovered that he\u2019d sent me a few over the weekend that hadn\u2019t come through until later. They certainly hadn\u2019t been there when I\u2019d placed my usual Saturday call to my dad.</p><p>Wanna have lunch? I texted.</p><p>When I didn\u2019t get a reply right away, I silenced my phone and set it in my top drawer.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you spend the weekend?\u201d Mark asked me as he came in to work. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a great tan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I lazed it up in the Caribbean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019ve been scoping out the islands for possible honeymoon spots. Would you recommend it for that, wherever you stayed?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laughed, happier than I\u2019d been in long time.

I\u2019ll add the spot to the list of possibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have honeymoon scouting duty?\u201d I stood so we could grab coffee together before we started the day.</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d Mark\u2019s mouth quirked on one side. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the wedding stuff to Steven, since he\u2019s been planning for so long. But the honeymoon is mine.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so happy, and I knew just how he felt. His good mood made the start of my day even better.</p><p>THE smooth sailing ended when Cary called my desk phone shortly after ten o\u2019clock.</p><p>\u201cMark Garrity\u2019s office,\u201d I answered. \u201cEva Tramell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014needs an ass-kicking,\u201d Cary finished. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I was this mad at you.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned, my stomach tightening. \u201cCary, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about important shit on the phone, Eva, unlike some people I know. I\u2019ll meet you for lunch. And just so you\u2019re aware, I turned down a go-see this afternoon to set you straight, because that\u2019s what friends do,\u201d he said angrily. \u201cThey make time in their schedule to talk about things that matter. They don\u2019t leave cutesy voice-mail messages and think that handles it!\u201d</p><p>The line went dead. I sat there, shocked and a bit scared.</p><p>Everything in my life ground to a screeching halt. Cary was my anchor. When things weren\u2019t right with us, I scattered real quick. And I knew it was the same for him. When we were out of touch, he started fucking up.</p><p>I dug out my cell phone and called him back.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he snapped. But it was a good sign that he\u2019d answered.</p> <p>\u201cIf I screwed up,\u201d I said quickly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry and I\u2019ll fix it. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He made a rough sound. \u201cYou fucking piss me off, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m good at pissing people off, if you haven\u2019t noticed, but I hate when I do it to you.\u201d I sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s going to drive me nuts, Cary, until we can work it out. I need us solid, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t acted like it matters lately,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI\u2019m an afterthought and that fucking hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always thinking about you. If I haven\u2019t shown it, that\u2019s my bad.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Cary. Even when I\u2019m messing up.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled into the receiver. \u201cGet back to work and don\u2019t stress about this. We\u2019ll deal with it at lunch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you at noon.\u201d</p><p>I hung up and tried to concentrate, but it was hard. It was one thing having Cary angry with me; it was totally another to know I\u2019d hurt him. I was one of the very few people in his life he trusted not to let him down.</p><p>AT eleven thirty, I received a small pile of interoffice envelopes. I was thrilled when one of them revealed a note from Gideon.</p><p>MY GORGEOUS, SEXY WIFE,</p><p>I NEVER STOP THINKING ABOUT YOU.</p><p>YOURS,</p><p>X</p><p>My feet tapped out a little happy dance beneath my desk. My skewed day righted itself a little.</p><p>I wrote him back.</p><p>Dark and Dangerous,</p><p>I\u2019m madly in love with you.</p><p>Your ball and chain,</p><p>Mrs. X</p><p>I tucked it in an envelope and dropped it in my out-box.</p><p>I was drafting a reply to the artist working on a gift card campaign when my desk phone rang. I answered with my usual greeting and heard a reply in a familiar French accent.</p><p>\u201cEva, it\u2019s Jean-Fran?ois Giroux.\u201d</p><p>Sitting back in my chair, I said, \u201cBonjour, Monsieur Giroux.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is best for us to meet today?\u201d</p><p>What the hell did he want from me? I supposed if I wanted to know, I\u2019d have to follow through. \u201cFive o\u2019clock? There\u2019s a wine bar not too far from the Crossfire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be fine.\u201d</p><p>I gave him directions and he hung up, leaving me feeling somewhat whiplashed by the call. I swiveled in my chair, thinking. Gideon and I were trying to move forward with our lives, but people and issues from our pasts were still trying to hold us back. Would the announcement of our marriage, or even an engagement, change that?</p><p>God, I hoped so. But was anything ever that easy?</p><p>Glancing at the clock, I refocused on work and returned to writing my e-mail.</p><p>I was down in the lobby by five after noon, but Cary hadn\u2019t arrived yet. As I waited for him, my nerves started getting to me. I\u2019d gone over my brief conversation with Cary again and again and knew he was right. I had convinced myself he\u2019d be okay with having Gideon join our living arrangements because I couldn\u2019t imagine facing the alternative\u2014having to choose between my best friend and my boyfriend.</p><p>And now there was no choice. I was married. Ecstatically so.</p><p>Still, I found myself grateful that I\u2019d tucked my wedding ring into the zippered pocket of my purse. If Cary felt a growing distance between us, finding out I\u2019d gotten hitched over the weekend wouldn\u2019t help.</p><p>My stomach twisted. The secrets between us were mounting. I couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>I jerked out of my thoughts at the sound of my best friend\u2019s voice. He was striding toward me wearing loose-fitting cargo shorts and a V-neck T-shirt. He kept his shades on, and with his hands shoved in his pockets, he seemed distant and cool. Heads turned as he walked by and he didn\u2019t notice, his attention on me.</p><p>My feet moved. I was hurrying toward him before I thought of it, then ran straight into him so hard, his breath left him with a grunt. I hugged him, my cheek pressed to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d I said, meaning it with all my heart, even though he wouldn\u2019t know exactly why.</p><p>He muttered something under his breath and hugged me. \u201cPain in the ass sometimes, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>Pulling back, I looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He linked his fingers with mine and led me out of the Crossfire. We went to the place with the great tacos that we\u2019d gone to the last time he had met me for lunch. They also had great slushy virgin margaritas, which were perfect on a steamy summer day.</p><p>After waiting in line about ten minutes, I ordered only two tacos, since I hadn\u2019t hit the gym in way too long. Cary ordered six. We snagged a table just as its former occupants cleared away, and Cary inhaled a taco before I\u2019d barely taken the wrapper off my straw.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the voice mail,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it.\u201d He swiped a napkin across lips that turned sane women into giggling girls when he smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole situation, Eva. You leave me a message telling me to think about sharing a place with Cross, after you tell your mom that it\u2019s a done deal and before you fall off the face of the earth for the weekend. I guess however I feel about it means jack shit to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want a roommate when you\u2019re living with a boyfriend anyway?\u201d he asked, clearly getting warmed up. \u201cAnd why would you think I\u2019d want to be a third wheel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCary\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any fucking handouts, Eva.\u201d His emerald eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019ve got places I can crash, other people I can room with. Don\u2019t do me any favors.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightened. I wasn\u2019t ready to let Cary go yet. Someday in the future, we\u2019d be heading our separate ways, maybe only seeing each other on special occasions. But that time wasn\u2019t now. It couldn\u2019t be. Just thinking about it screwed with my head.</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019m doing it for you?\u201d I shot back. \u201cMaybe I just can\u2019t bear the thought of not having you nearby.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and ripped a bite out of his taco. Chewing angrily, he swallowed his food down with a long draw on his straw. \u201cWhat am I, your three-year chip marking your recovery? Your celebratory token for Eva Anonymous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d I leaned forward. \u201cYou\u2019re mad, I get it. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m sorry. I love you and I love having you in my life, but I\u2019m not going to sit here and get kicked because I fucked up.\u201d</p><p>I pushed away from the table and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll catch you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Cross getting married?\u201d</p><p>Pausing, I looked down at him. \u201cHe asked. I said yes.\u201d</p><p>Cary nodded, as if that were no surprise, and took another bite. I grabbed my purse from where it hung on the back of my chair.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of living alone with him?\u201d he asked around his chewing.</p><p>Of course he\u2019d think that. \u201cNo. He\u2019ll be sleeping in his own bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he been sleeping in a separate room the last few weekends you\u2019ve been shacking up with him?\u201d</p><p>I stared. Did he know for a fact that Gideon was the \u201cloverman\u201d I\u2019d been spending time with? Or was he just fishing? I decided I didn\u2019t care. I was tired of lying to him. \u201cMostly, yes.\u201d</p><p>He set his taco down. \u201cFinally, some truth out of you. I was beginning to think you\u2019d forgotten how to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he gestured at my vacant chair. \u201cSit your ass back down, baby girl. We\u2019re not done talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being a jerk.\u201d</p><p>His smile faded and his gaze hardened. \u201cBeing lied to for weeks makes me cranky. Sit down.\u201d</p><p>I sat and glared at him. \u201cThere? Happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat. I\u2019ve got shit to say.\u201d</p><p>Exhaling my frustration, I slung my purse over the chair again and faced him with my brows raised.</p><p>\u201cIf you think,\u201d he began, \u201cthat being sober and working steadily broke my bullshit meter, now you know better. I knew you were nailing Cross again from the moment you started back up.\u201d</p><p>Biting into my taco, I shot him a skeptical look.</p><p>\u201cEva honey, don\u2019t you think that if there were another man in New York who could bang it out all night like Cross, I would\u2019ve found him by now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I coughed and nearly spit out my food.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s lucky enough to find two guys like that in a row,\u201d he drawled. \u201cNot even you. You should\u2019ve had a dry spell or at least a couple of really bad lays first.\u201d</p><p>I threw my wadded-up straw wrapper at him, which he dodged with a laugh.</p> <p>Then he sobered. \u201cDid you think I would judge you for getting back together with him after he jacked up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that, Cary. Things were ... a mess. There was a lot of pressure. Still is, with that reporter stalking Gideon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStalking him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally. I just didn\u2019t want ...\u201d You exposed. Vulnerable. Open to accusation as an accomplice after the fact. \u201cI just had to let it play out,\u201d I finished lamely.</p><p>He let that sink in, then nodded. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re going to marry him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I took a drink, needing to loosen the lump in my throat. \u201cBut you\u2019re the only one who knows that besides us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally, a secret you let me in on.\u201d His lips pursed for a few seconds. \u201cAnd you still want me to live with you.\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward again, holding out my hand for his. \u201cI know you can do something else, go somewhere else. But I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not ready to be without you yet, married or not.\u201d</p><p>He gripped my hand so tightly, my bones pressed together. \u201cEva\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said quickly. He was far too serious all of a sudden. I didn\u2019t want him to cut me off before I put everything out there. \u201cGideon\u2019s penthouse has an adjacent one-bedroom apartment he doesn\u2019t use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA one-bedroom apartment. On Fifth Avenue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Great, right? All yours. Your own space and entrance and view of Central Park. But still connected to me. The best of both worlds.\u201d I rushed on, hoping to say something he\u2019d latch on to. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay on the Upper West Side for a bit, while I make changes to the penthouse. Gideon says we can have whatever changes you want made to your apartment done at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apartment.\u201d He stared at me, which made me even more nervous. A man and a woman tried to squeeze between our table and the back of an occupied chair that was pushed too far out into the walkway, but I ignored them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about a handout,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking that I\u2019d like to put that money I\u2019ve been sitting on to work. Create a foundation or something to decide how to use it in support of causes and charities we believe in. I need your help. And I\u2019ll pay you for it. Not just for your input, but for your face. I want you to be the foundation\u2019s first spokesperson.\u201d</p><p>Cary\u2019s grip on my hand slackened.</p><p>Alarmed, I tightened mine. \u201cCary?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders sagged. \u201cTatiana\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I felt the blood drain from my face. The little restaurant was hopping, and the shouting of orders behind the counter and the clatter of trays and utensils made it hard to hear, but I\u2019d caught the two words that fell out of Cary\u2019s mouth as if he\u2019d shouted them at me. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d He pulled his hand away and scooped back the bangs that draped over one eye. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t want a kid. That part\u2019s cool. But ... fuck. Not now, you know? And not with her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow the hell did she get pregnant?\u201d Cary was religious about protecting himself, knowing damn well he lived a high-risk lifestyle.</p><p>\u201cWell, I shoved my dick in her and pushed it around\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I bit out. \u201cYou\u2019re careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, putting a sock on it isn\u2019t guaranteed protection,\u201d he said wearily, \u201cand Tat doesn\u2019t take the pill because she says it makes her break out and eat too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d My eyes stung. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cNo, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not. She\u2019s six weeks along, so it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>I had to ask. \u201cIs she going to keep it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She\u2019s thinking it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCary ...\u201d I couldn\u2019t hold back the tear that slid down my cheek. My heart was aching for him. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d He slumped back in his chair. \u201cIt\u2019s her decision.\u201d</p><p>His powerlessness had to be killing him. After his mother had given birth to him, unwanted, she\u2019d used abortion as birth control. I knew that haunted him. He\u2019d told me so. \u201cAnd if she decides to go through with the pregnancy? You\u2019ll have a paternity test done, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Eva.\u201d He looked at me with reddened eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought that far ahead yet. What the hell am I supposed to say to Trey? Things are just starting to smooth out between us and I\u2019ve got to hit him with this? He\u2019s going to dump me. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, I straightened in my chair. I couldn\u2019t let Cary and Trey fall apart. Now that Gideon and I were good, it was time to fix all the other areas of my life I\u2019d been neglecting. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it a step at a time. Figure things out as we go. We\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you, too. We\u2019ll stick together and work it out.\u201d I managed a smile. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere and neither are you. Except to San Diego this weekend,\u201d I amended hastily, reminding myself to talk to Gideon about that.</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Cary sat forward again. \u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t give to shoot hoops at Dr. Travis\u2019s right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I didn\u2019t play basketball, but I knew I could use a one-on-one with Dr. Travis myself.</p><p>What would he say when he learned how far off the rails we\u2019d slid in the few months we\u2019d been in New York? We had spun some big dreams the last time we\u2019d all sat down together. Cary had wanted to star in a Super Bowl ad and I\u2019d wanted to be the one behind the scenes of that ad. Now he was facing the possibility of a baby and I was married to the most complicated man I had ever met.</p><p>\u201cDr. Trav\u2019s gonna flip,\u201d Cary muttered, reading my mind.</p><p>For some reason, that made us both laugh \u2019til we cried.</p><p>WHEN I got back to my desk, I found another small pile of interoffice envelopes. Catching my lower lip between my teeth, I searched each one until I found the one I was hoping for.</p><p>I CAN THINK OF MANY USES FOR THAT CHAIN,</p><p>MRS. X.</p><p>YOU WILL ENJOY THEM ALL IMMENSELY.</p><p>YOURS,</p><p>X</p><p>Some of the dark clouds from lunch floated away.</p><p>AFTER Cary\u2019s mind-blowing revelation, meeting Giroux after work barely registered on my what-else-could-possibly-go-wrong-next scale.</p><p>He was already at the wine bar when I arrived. Dressed in perfectly pressed khakis and white dress shirt rolled up at the sleeves and open at the throat, he looked good. Casual. But that didn\u2019t make him seem more relaxed. The man was strung tight as a bow, vibrating with tension and whatever else was eating at him.</p><p>\u201cEva,\u201d he greeted me. With that overt friendliness I hadn\u2019t liked the first time, he kissed me on both cheeks again. \u201cEnchant\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too blond for you today, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He gave me a smile that didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cI deserved that.\u201d</p><p>I joined him at his table by the window and we were served shortly after.</p><p>The place had the look of an establishment that had been around a long time. Tin tiles covered the ceiling, while the aged hardwood floors and intricately carved bar suggested the place had been a pub at some point in its history. It had been modernized with chrome fixtures and a wine rack behind the bar that could have been an abstract sculpture.</p><p>Giroux openly studied me as the server poured our wine. I had no idea what he was looking for, but he was definitely searching for something.</p><p>As I took a sip of a lovely shiraz, he settled comfortably in his chair and swirled his wine around in his glass. \u201cYou\u2019ve met my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have, yes. She\u2019s very beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is.\u201d His gaze dropped to his wine. \u201cWhat else did you think of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter what I think?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me again. \u201cDo you see her as a rival? Or a threat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither.\u201d I took another drink and noticed a black Bentley SUV easing into a tight spot at the curb just outside the window I sat beside. Angus was behind the wheel and apparently uncaring of the No PARKING sign he was camping out in front of.</p><p>\u201cYou are that certain of Cross?\u201d</p><p>My attention returned to Giroux. \u201cYes. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t wish you would pack up your wife and take her back to France with you.\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirked on one side in a grim smile. \u201cYou are in love with Cross, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>That made me smile. \u201cIf you think you can figure out what Corinne sees in him by what I see in him, forget it. He and I, we\u2019re ... different with each other than we are with other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw that. With him.\u201d Giroux took a drink, savoring it before swallowing.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, but I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re sitting here. What do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always so direct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI get impatient with being confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will be direct as well.\u201d He reached out and caught my left hand. \u201cYou have a tan line from a ring. A sizable one, it appears. An engagement ring, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>I looked at my hand and saw he was right. There was a square-sized spot on my ring finger that was a few shades lighter than the rest of my skin. Unlike my mother, who was pale, I\u2019d inherited my father\u2019s warm skin tone and I tanned easily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very perceptive. But I would appreciate you keeping your speculations to yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled and for the first time, it was genuine. \u201cPerhaps I will get my wife back after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you could, if you tried.\u201d I sat up, deciding it was time to leave. \u201cYou know what your wife told me once? She said you\u2019re indifferent. Instead of waiting for her to come back, you should just take her back. I think that\u2019s what she wants.\u201d</p><p>He stood when I did, standing over me. \u201cShe has chased Cross. I do not think a woman who chases will find a man chasing her attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d I pulled a twenty out of my pocket and set it on the table, despite his scowl at the sight of it. \u201cShe said yes when you asked her to marry you, didn\u2019t she? Whatever you did before, do it again. Good-bye, Jean-Fran?ois.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak, but I was already halfway out the door.</p><p>ANGUS was waiting beside the Bentley when I exited the wine bar.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go home, Mrs. Cross?\u201d he asked, as I slipped into the back.</p><p>His greeting made me grin. Combined with my recent conversation with Giroux, it sparked an idea. \u201cActually, I\u2019d like to make a stop, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>I gave him directions, then sat back and relished the building anticipation.</p><p>IT was half past six when I was ready to call it a day, but when I asked Angus where Gideon was, I learned he was still in his office.</p><p>\u201cWill you take me to him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Returning to the Crossfire after hours was weird. Although there were still people moving through the lobby, it had a different feel from the daytime. When I reached the top floor, I found the glass security doors to Cross Industries propped open and a cleaning crew at work emptying trash cans, wiping down the glass, and vacuuming.</p><p>I headed directly to Gideon\u2019s office, noting the number of empty desks, which included that of Scott, his assistant. Gideon stood behind his, an earpiece in his ear, and his jacket hung on the coat rack in the corner. His hands were on his hips and he was talking, his lips moving rapidly and his face a mask of concentration.</p><p>The wall across from him was covered in flat screens streaming news from around the world. To the right of that was a bar with jeweled decanters on lighted glass shelves that were the only spot of color in the office\u2019s cool palette of black, white, and gray. Three distinct seating areas offered comfortable spaces for less formal meetings, while Gideon\u2019s black desk was a miracle of modern technology, serving as the conduit for all the electronics in the room.</p><p>Surrounded by his expensive toys, my husband looked nothing short of edible. The beautifully tailored lines of his vest and pants showed off the perfection of his body, and the sight of him at his command center, wielding the power that had built his empire, did crazy things to my heart. The floor-to-ceiling windows that surrounded him on two sides allowed the view of the city to make an imposing backdrop, yet the vista didn\u2019t diminish him in any way.</p><p>Gideon was master of all he surveyed, and it showed.</p><p>Reaching into my purse, I unzipped the small pocket and drew out the rings inside it, slipping mine on. Then I stepped closer to the glass wall and double doors that separated him from everyone else.</p><p>His head swiveled toward me and his gaze heated at the sight of me. He hit a button on his desk, and the double doors swung open automatically. A moment later, the glass turned opaque, ensuring that no one lingering in the office would be able to see us.</p><p>I went in.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d he said, to whomever he was talking to. \u201cGet it done and report back to me.\u201d</p> <p>As he pulled off his earpiece and dropped it on his desk, his gaze never left me. \u201cYou\u2019re a welcome surprise, angel. Tell me about your meeting with Giroux.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>His mouth tilted up on one side and he shot me a look that said, Really? You\u2019re going to ask?</p><p>\u201cAre you here for a while?\u201d I queried.</p><p>\u201cI have a conference call with the Japanese division in half an hour, then I\u2019m done. We\u2019ll go to dinner afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get something to take home and eat with Cary. He\u2019s having a baby.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cCome again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he might be having a baby.\u201d I sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s messed up over it and I want to be there for him. Plus, he should get used to having you around again.\u201d</p><p>He raked me with an assessing glance. \u201cYou\u2019re messed up over it, too. Come here.\u201d He rounded the desk and opened his arms. \u201cLet me hold you.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my purse on the floor, kicked off my heels, and walked right into him. His arms came around me, and his lips, so firm and warm, pressed against my forehead.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he murmured. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>His embrace tightened.</p><p>Leaning back, I looked up into his gorgeous face. His eyes were so blue, seemingly even more so with the touch of sun he\u2019d gotten during our trip away. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>I backed up, catching his left hand before it dropped away from me. Holding it, I slid the ring I\u2019d just bought him onto his finger, twisting it to fit over his last knuckle. He was still the entire time. When I released his hand so he could get a better look, it didn\u2019t move at all from where it\u2019d been when I was holding it, as if he\u2019d frozen in place.</p><p>Canting my head, I admired the ring on him, thinking it had just the effect I was looking for. But when a moment passed without a word from him, I looked up and saw him staring at his hand as if he\u2019d never seen it before.</p><p>My heart sank. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared on a deep breath and he turned over his hand to look at the backside, which was the same. The design I\u2019d chosen wrapped continuously around.</p><p>The platinum wedding band was very much like the ring he wore on his right hand. It had the same beveled grooves cut into the precious metal, which gave it a similar industrial, masculine look. But the wedding band was garnished with rubies, making it impossible to miss. The bloodred hue stood out against his tanned skin and dark suits, a conspicuous sign of my possession.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always too much,\u201d he said hoarsely. And then he was on me, his hands cupping my head and his lips on mine, kissing me fiercely.</p><p>I grabbed his wrists, but he moved too quickly, lifting me up by the waist so my feet left the floor, and then carrying me to the same couch where he\u2019d first laid his body over mine so many weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d I gasped.</p><p>He sat me down with my butt on the edge of the sofa. \u201cThis won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t kidding. Reaching beneath my skirt, he slid my panties down my legs, then spread them wide and lowered his head.</p><p>There in his office, where I\u2019d just admired his power and commanding presence, Gideon Cross knelt between my thighs and ate me with ruthless skill. His tongue fluttered over my clit until I writhed with the need to come, but it was the sight of him\u2014in his suit, in his office, servicing me so thoroughly\u2014that brought me to climax with a cry of his name.</p><p>I was shivering with pleasure while he licked inside me, the sensitive tissues trembling around the shallow plunges of his wickedly knowledgeable tongue. When he opened his fly and freed his erection, I was desperate for him, my body arching toward him in a shameless silent plea.</p><p>Gideon took the heavy length of his cock in hand and stroked the thick crest through my cleft, coating himself in the slickness of my orgasm. The fact that we were both still dressed except for what we needed to get out of the way made it all the hotter.</p><p>\u201cI want you to submit,\u201d he said darkly. \u201cBend over and spread wide. I\u2019m going to fuck you deep.\u201d</p><p>A whimper escaped me at the thought and I scrambled to obey. Aware of how tall he was, I moved to the side of the couch and folded over the armrest, reaching behind me to pull up my skirt.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. With a powerful thrust of his hips, he was inside me, stretching me. \u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>Gasping, I clawed at the sofa cushions. He was thick and hard and so, so deep. With my stomach pressed over the curve of the couch arm, I swore I could feel him pressing outward from the inside.</p><p>Folding over me, he wrapped his arms around me and sank his teeth into the side of my neck. The primitive claiming made my sex clench around him, caressing him.</p><p>He growled and ran his lips over me, lightly abrading me with the hint of evening stubble on his jaw. \u201cYou feel so good,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI love fucking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me your hands.\u201d</p><p>Unsure of what he wanted, I slid my arms closer to my body and he circled my wrists with his fingers, pulling my hands gently around to the small of my back.</p><p>Then he was fucking me. Pounding into my sex with relentless drives, using my arms to pull me back to meet the thrusts of his hips. His heavy sac smacked against my clitoris, the rhythmic slaps spurring me toward another orgasm. He grunted on every plunge, mirroring my cries.</p><p>His race to orgasm was wildly exciting, as was his complete control of my body. I could only lie there and take it, take his lust and hunger, servicing him as he had me. The friction of his thrusts was delicious, a steady rubbing and pulling that made me crazed with desire.</p><p>I wished I could see him; see his eyes when they lost their focus and pleasure took him, his face a grimace of agonized ecstasy. I loved that I could affect him so fiercely, that my body felt so good to him, that sex with me shattered his defenses.</p><p>He shuddered and cursed. His cock lengthened, thickening as his balls tightened and drew up. \u201cEva ... Christ. I love you.\u201d</p><p>I felt the lash of his semen inside me, pumping hot and thick. I bit my lip to stem my cry. I was so hot for him, so close.</p><p>Releasing my wrists, he wrapped me up, the fingers of one hand sliding into my cleft and rubbing my swollen clit. I came while he was still pumping, my sex milking his spurting cock as he emptied himself inside me. His lips were on my cheek, his breath gusting hot and moist across my skin, low rumbles spilling from his chest as he came hard and long. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We were both panting as our orgasms eased, leaning heavily on each other.</p><p>Swallowing hard, I spoke breathlessly. \u201cI guess you like the ring.\u201d His rough laugh filled me with joy.</p><p>FIVE minutes later, I lay wilted and sated on the couch, unable to move. Gideon sat at his desk looking pristine and perfect, radiating the health and vitality of a well-fucked male.</p> <p>He went through the teleconference without a hitch in his stride, speaking mostly English, but opening and closing with conversational Japanese, his voice deep and smooth. His gaze slid over me now and again, his mouth curving in a ghost of a smile laced with undeniable masculine triumph.</p><p>I supposed he was entitled to it, considering I had so many postorgasmic endorphins floating through my system I felt almost drunk.</p><p>Gideon finished his call and stood, shrugging out of his jacket again. The gleam in his eyes told me why.</p><p>Mustering the energy to raise my brows, I asked, \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we are. But not yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you should cut back on those vitamins, ace.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched as he freed the buttons of his vest. \u201cI\u2019ve spent too many days fantasizing about fucking you on that couch. We haven\u2019t covered even half of those fantasies yet.\u201d</p><p>I stretched, deliberately enticing him. \u201cCan we still be naughty now that we\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>From the spark that lit his amazing eyes, I could guess his views on that.</p><p>By the time we left the Crossfire at nearly nine o\u2019clock, Gideon had answered the question definitively.</p><p>21</p> <p>GIDEON AND I were sitting on the floor of my living room eating pizza in our sweats when Cary came in a little after ten o\u2019clock. Tatiana was with him. I reached across Gideon for a packet of Parmesan cheese and whispered, \u201cBaby mama.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cShe\u2019s trouble. Poor guy.\u201d</p><p>That was my thought exactly as the tall blonde walked in and wrinkled her nose rudely at our pizza. Then she caught sight of Gideon and flashed a come-hither smile.</p><p>I took a deep breath and told myself to let it go.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cary,\u201d Gideon greeted my best friend before tossing his arm over my shoulder and burying his face in my neck.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cary said. \u201cWhat are you guys watching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnd of Watch,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt\u2019s really good. You two want to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Cary caught Tatiana\u2019s hand and led her toward the couch.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t have the grace to hide her disapproval of the idea.</p><p>They sat on the couch and settled into a comfortable tangle that was obviously familiar for them. Gideon pushed the pizza box their way. \u201cHelp yourselves, if you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>Cary snagged a slice, while Tatiana complained about him jostling her. I was bummed that she couldn\u2019t be more comfortable hanging out. If she was going to have Cary\u2019s baby, she was going to be in my life, and I hated the thought of that relationship being awkward.</p><p>In the end, they didn\u2019t stay in the living room long. She insisted that the handheld camera shots in the movie made her queasy, and Cary took her back to his room. A short while later, I thought I heard her laughing, making me think her biggest problem was the need to keep Cary all to herself. I could understand that insecurity. I was intimately familiar with it myself.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Gideon murmured, urging me to lean into his chest. \u201cWe\u2019ll work it out with them. Give it some time.\u201d</p><p>I caught his left hand hanging over my shoulder and toyed with his ring.</p><p>He pressed his lips to my temple and we finished watching the movie.</p><p>ALTHOUGH Gideon slept in his apartment next door, he came over early enough to zip me into a sheath dress and fix me some coffee. I\u2019d just finished putting on some pearl earrings and was stepping into the hallway when Tatiana appeared heading from the direction of the kitchen with two water bottles in her hands.</p><p>She was buck naked.</p><p>My temper almost boiled over, but I kept my tone calm. The pregnancy certainly didn\u2019t show, but knowing about it was reason enough to skip the shouting match. \u201cExcuse me. You need to have clothes on if you\u2019re going to walk around my apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just your apartment,\u201d she shot back, tossing her tawny mane over her shoulder as she moved to pass me.</p><p>I thrust my arm across the hallway, blocking her way. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to play games with me, Tatiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll lose.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me for a long minute. \u201cHe\u2019ll pick me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it came to that, he\u2019d resent you and you\u2019d lose anyway.\u201d I dropped my arm. \u201cThink about that.\u201d</p><p>Cary\u2019s door opened behind me. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing, Tat?\u201d</p><p>Turning my head, I saw my best friend filling his doorway wearing only his boxers. \u201cGiving you a good excuse to buy her a nice robe, Cary.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened and he waved me off, opening his door wider in a silent order for Tatiana to get her bare ass back in there.</p><p>I resumed my trek to the kitchen, my teeth grinding together. My mood worsened when I found Gideon in the kitchen, leaning back into the counter and leisurely drinking his coffee. He wore a black suit and pale gray tie and looked unbearably handsome.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy the show?\u201d I asked tightly. I hated that he\u2019d seen another woman naked. And not just any woman, but a model with the lean, willowy body type he\u2019d been known to prefer.</p><p>He lifted one shoulder in a careless shrug. \u201cNot especially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like \u2019em tall and skinny.\u201d I reached for the cup of coffee waiting for me on the counter beside him.</p><p>Gideon set his left hand over mine. The rubies on his wedding band sparkled in the bright kitchen lights. \u201cLast I checked, the wife I can\u2019t resist was petite and voluptuous. Spectacularly so.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, trying to push past my jealousy. \u201cDo you know why I chose your ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed is our color,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cRed dresses in limos. Red fuck-me heels at garden parties. A red rose in your hair when you married me.\u201d</p><p>That he understood soothed me. I turned into him, pressing my body to his.</p><p>\u201cUmm,\u201d he purred, hugging me close. \u201cYou\u2019re a soft, delicious little handful, angel.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, my anger melting into exasperation.</p><p>He nuzzled his nose against my cheek. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d Tilting my head back, I offered my mouth and let him kiss my bad mood away.</p><p>The feel of his lips on mine never stopped making my toes curl. I was slightly dazed when he pulled back and murmured, \u201cI have my appointment with Dr. Petersen tonight. I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m finished and we\u2019ll see what we want to do about dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at my blissfully nonchalant reply. \u201cI can set up an appointment for us to see him Thursday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it for next Thursday, please,\u201d I said, sobering. \u201cI hate to miss any more therapy, but Mom wants me and Cary to go to a charity gala this Thursday. She bought me a dress and everything. I\u2019m afraid if I don\u2019t go, she\u2019ll take it the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Gideon in a tuxedo was an aphrodisiac to me. Of course, Gideon in anything or nothing turned me on, too. But in a tux ... Dear God, he was sizzling.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s as good a time as any to be seen out together again. And to announce our engagement.\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips. \u201cCan I take advantage of you in the limo?\u201d</p><p>His eyes laughed at me. \u201cBy all means, angel mine.\u201d</p><p>WHEN I got to work, Megumi wasn\u2019t at her desk so I didn\u2019t get to see how she was faring. It kind of gave me an excuse to call Martin, though, and see if things with him and Lacey had panned out after our wild night at Primal.</p><p>I pulled out my smartphone to program a reminder and saw that my mom had left a voice mail the night before. I listened to it on the way to my desk. She wanted to see if I wanted hair and makeup done before the dinner on Thursday, suggesting that she come over with a beauty crew and we could get dolled up together.</p><p>When I reached my desk, I texted her back, letting her know I loved the idea, but time would be tight, since I wouldn\u2019t be getting off work until five.</p><p>I was settling in for the day when Will stopped by.</p><p>\u201cGot plans for lunch?\u201d he asked, looking cute in a plaid shirt only he could pull off so well and a solid navy tie.</p><p>\u201cNot another carb feast, please. My butt can\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He grinned. \u201cNatalie\u2019s past the brutal phase of her diet, so it\u2019s getting better. I was thinking a soup and salad bar.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m game for that. Want to see if Megumi wants to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Is she sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. I only heard about it because I was the one who had to call the temp agency for someone to cover for her.\u201d</p><p>I sat back with a frown. \u201cI\u2019ll give her a call on my break and see how she\u2019s feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her I said hi.\u201d He drummed a beat on the top of my cubicle wall and headed off.</p><p>THE rest of the day passed in a blur. I left a message for Megumi on my break, then tried to reach her again after work as Clancy drove me to Brooklyn for my Krav Maga class. \u201cHave Lacey call me back if you\u2019re feeling too sick,\u201d I said in my voice mail message. \u201cI just want to know you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>I killed the call, then sat back and appreciated the grandeur of the Brooklyn Bridge. Going through the massive stone arches soaring over the East River always felt like traveling to a different world. Below, the waterway was dotted with commuter ferries and a lone sailboat heading out into the busy New York harbor.</p><p>We reached the long off-ramp in less than a minute and I turned my attention back to my phone.</p><p>I called Martin.</p><p>\u201cEva,\u201d he answered cheerfully, clearly recognizing my number from his contact list. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear from you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHanging in there. We should get together sometime.\u201d I smiled at a cop who was artfully directing traffic at the hugely complicated intersection on the Brooklyn side. She kept things moving with a whistle between her teeth and fluid hand gestures that had serious sass to them. \u201cWe could grab a drink after work or double-date for dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like that. Are you seeing someone in particular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon and I are working things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon Cross? Well, if anyone can hook him, it\u2019d be you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and wished I had my ring on. I didn\u2019t wear it around during the day the way Gideon wore his. He didn\u2019t care who knew he was taken or by whom, but I still had everyone in my life to tell. \u201cThanks for the vote of confidence. What about you? You seeing anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLacey and I are dabbling. I like her. She\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. I\u2019m glad to hear it. Listen, if you talk to her today, can you ask her to let me know how Megumi\u2019s doing? She\u2019s out sick and I just want to make sure she\u2019s all right and doesn\u2019t need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d The receiver filled with a sudden rush of noise, the unmistakable sound of him stepping outside. \u201cLacey\u2019s out of town, but she\u2019s supposed to give me a call tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I appreciate it. You\u2019re on the move, so I\u2019ll let you go. Let\u2019s plan on getting together next week and we\u2019ll work out the details in the next couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. I\u2019m glad you called.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>We hung up and because I felt like reaching out, I sent a text to Shawna and another to Brett. Just quick hellos with smiley faces.</p> <p>When I looked up, I caught Clancy looking at me in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Mom?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said, in his usual no-nonsense way.</p><p>I nodded and looked out the window, catching sight of a gleaming steel bus stop shelter displaying Cary\u2019s billboard. \u201cFamily is so hard sometimes, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have any brothers or sisters, Clancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of each.\u201d</p><p>What were they like? Were they tough as nails and deadly like Clancy? Or was he the black sheep? \u201cAre you close, if you don\u2019t mind my asking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re tight. My sister lives out of state, so I don\u2019t see her much, but we talk on the phone once a week at least. My brother\u2019s in New York, so we catch up more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d I tried to picture a relaxed Clancy tossing back beers with someone who resembled him, but couldn\u2019t pull it off. \u201cDoes he work security, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d His mouth did that little lip twitch, almost-smile thing. \u201cHe\u2019s with the FBI for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your sister in law enforcement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the Marines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is.\u201d</p><p>I studied him and his military crew cut. \u201cYou were in the service, too, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d He didn\u2019t volunteer any more than that.</p><p>When I opened my mouth to pry further, we turned a corner and I realized we\u2019d reached the former warehouse where Parker had his studio.</p><p>I grabbed my gym bag and got out before Clancy could open the door for me. \u201cSee you in an hour!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock \u2019em out, Eva,\u201d he said, watching me until I got inside.</p><p>The door had barely closed behind me when I saw a familiar brunette I would\u2019ve rather not seen again. Ever. She stood to the side, just off the training mats, with her arms crossed. She was dressed in black workout pants with a bright blue stripe down the sides that matched her fitted long-sleeve shirt. Her brown curly hair was scraped back into an unforgiving ponytail.</p><p>She turned. Cool blue eyes raked me from head to toe.</p><p>Facing the inevitable, I took a deep breath and approached her. \u201cDetective Graves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d She gave me a curt nod. \u201cGreat tan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross take you away for the weekend?\u201d</p><p>Not exactly a casual question. My back went up. \u201cI had some time off.\u201d</p><p>Her thin mouth quirked on one side. \u201cStill cautious. Good. What does your dad think of Cross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe my dad trusts my judgment.\u201d</p><p>Graves nodded. \u201cI\u2019d keep thinking about Nathan Barker\u2019s bracelet if I were you. But then, loose ends make me twitchy.\u201d</p><p>A shiver of unease ran down my back. The whole thing made me twitchy, but who could I talk to about it? No one but Gideon, and I knew him too well to doubt that he was doing everything in his considerable power to solve that mystery.</p><p>\u201cI need a sparring partner,\u201d the detective said suddenly. \u201cYou\u2019re up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, what?\u201d I blinked at her. \u201cIs that ... ? Can we ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe case has gone cold, Eva.\u201d She stalked onto the mat and began to stretch. \u201cHurry up. I don\u2019t have all night.\u201d</p><p>GRAVES kicked my ass. For such a rail-thin, wiry woman, she packed some strength. She was focused, precise, and ruthless. I actually learned a lot from her over the hour and a half we sparred, most especially never to let down my guard. She was lightning quick and swift to exploit any advantage.</p><p>When I stumbled into my apartment a little after eight, I headed straight to the bathtub. I soaked in vanilla-scented water, surrounded by candles, and hoped Gideon would show up before I pruned.</p><p>He ended up coming in just as I was wrapping a towel around me, his damp hair and jeans telling me he\u2019d showered after a visit with his trainer.</p><p>\u201cHi, ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, wife.\u201d He came up to me, tugged open my towel, and lowered his head to my breast.</p><p>My breath left me when he sucked a nipple into his mouth, drawing rhythmically until it hardened.</p><p>Straightening, he admired his handiwork. \u201cGod, you\u2019re sexy.\u201d</p><p>I lifted onto my tiptoes and kissed his chin. \u201cHow\u2019d things go tonight?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me with a wry curve to his lips. \u201cDr. Petersen congratulated us, then went on about how important couples therapy would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks we got married too soon.\u201d</p><p>Gideon laughed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even want us having sex, Eva.\u201d</p><p>Wrinkling my nose, I resecured my towel and grabbed a comb for my wet hair.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d he said, taking the comb and leading me to the wide lip of the tub. He urged me to sit.</p><p>As he combed my hair, I told him about seeing Detective Graves at my Krav Maga class.</p><p>\u201cMy lawyers tell me the case has been shelved,\u201d Gideon said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>There was no inflection in his voice, which told me it mattered to him more than he\u2019d tell me. I knew that somewhere, deep down inside him, Nathan\u2019s murder was haunting him. Because I was haunted by what Gideon had done for me and we were two halves of the same soul.</p><p>That was why Gideon had wanted us to get married so badly. I was his safe place. I was the one person who knew every dark, tormented secret he had, and I loved him desperately anyway. And he needed love more than anyone I\u2019d ever met.</p><p>There was a vibration against my shoulder and I teased, \u201cIs that a new toy in your pocket, ace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve turned the damn thing off,\u201d he muttered, digging his phone out. He looked at the screen, then answered with a clipped, \u201cCross.\u201d</p><p>I heard a woman\u2019s agitated voice coming through the receiver, but I couldn\u2019t make out the words.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d After hearing the answer, he asked, \u201cWhere? Yes. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and raked a hand through his hair.</p><p>I stood. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorinne\u2019s in the hospital. My mother says it\u2019s bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get dressed. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Gideon looked at me. Goose bumps swept across my skin. I\u2019d never seen him look so ... shattered.</p><p>\u201cPills,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cShe swallowed a bottle of pills.\u201d</p><p>WE took the DB9. While we waited for the attendant to bring the car to us, Gideon called Ra\u00fal, telling him to meet us at the hospital to take over the Aston Martin when we arrived.</p><p>When Gideon slid behind the wheel, he drove with tight focus; every turn of the wheel and press of the accelerator was skilled and precise. Enclosed in the small space with him, I knew he\u2019d shut down. Emotionally, he was unreachable. When I placed my hand on his knee to offer comfort and support, he didn\u2019t even twitch. I wasn\u2019t sure he even felt it.</p><p>Ra\u00fal was waiting for us when we pulled up to the emergency room. He opened the door for me, then rounded the hood and took the driver\u2019s seat after Gideon got out. The gleaming car was moved out of the drop-off driveway before we walked through the automatic doors.</p><p>I took Gideon\u2019s hand, but I wasn\u2019t sure he felt that, either. His attention was riveted on his mother, who stood when we entered the private waiting area we\u2019d been directed to. Elizabeth Vidal barely glanced at me, going straight to her son and hugging him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hug her back. But he also didn\u2019t pull away. His grip on my hand tightened.</p><p>Mrs. Vidal didn\u2019t even acknowledge me. Instead, she turned her back to me and gestured at the couple seated together nearby. They were clearly Corinne\u2019s parents. They\u2019d been talking to Elizabeth when Gideon and I came in, which seemed odd to me since Jean-Fran?ois Giroux was standing alone by the window, looking as much like an outsider as Elizabeth was making me feel.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s hold on my hand slackened as his mother pulled him toward Corinne\u2019s family. Feeling awkward standing in the doorway alone, I went to Jean-Fran?ois.</p><p>I greeted him softly. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me with dead eyes, his face seeming to have aged a decade since we\u2019d met at the wine bar the day before. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMrs. Vidal called Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she did.\u201d He looked over to the seating area. \u201cOne would think he was her husband and not I.\u201d</p><p>I followed his gaze. Gideon was crouched in front of Corinne\u2019s parents, holding her mother\u2019s hand. A sick feeling of dread spread through me, making me cold.</p> <p>\u201cShe would rather be dead than live without him,\u201d he said tonelessly.</p><p>I looked back at him. Suddenly, I understood. \u201cYou told her, didn\u2019t you? About our engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd look how well she took the news.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. I took a shaky step toward the wall, needing the support. How could she not know what a suicide attempt would do to Gideon? She couldn\u2019t be that blind. Or had his reaction, his guilt, been her aim all along? It made me sick to think of anyone being that manipulative, but there was no denying the result. Gideon was back at her side. At least for now.</p><p>A doctor entered the room, a kind-looking woman with cropped silvery blond hair and faded blue eyes. \u201cMr. Giroux?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOui.\u201d Jean-Fran?ois stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Steinberg. I\u2019m treating your wife. Could we speak privately for a moment?\u201d</p><p>Corinne\u2019s father stood. \u201cWe\u2019re her family.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Steinberg smiled gently. \u201cI understand. However, it\u2019s Corinne\u2019s husband I need to speak with. I can tell you that Corinne will be fine after a few days\u2019 rest.\u201d</p><p>She and Giroux stepped out of the room, which effectively cut off the sound of their voices, but they were still visible through a glass wall. Giroux towered over the much shorter doctor, but whatever she said to him had him crumbling visibly. The tension in the waiting room ratcheted up to an unbearable degree. Gideon stood beside his mother, his attention snared by the heartrending scene unfolding before us.</p><p>Dr. Steinberg reached out and placed a hand on Jean-Fran?ois\u2019s arm, still speaking. After a moment, she stopped and left him. He just stood there, staring at the floor, his shoulders slumped as if a great weight pressed down on them.</p> <p>I was about to go to him, when Gideon moved first. The moment he stepped outside the waiting room, Giroux lunged at him.</p><p>The thud as the two men collided was teeth-rattling in its violence. The room shook as Gideon slammed into the thick glass wall.</p><p>Someone shouted in surprise, then yelled for security.</p><p>Gideon threw Giroux off and blocked a punch. Then he ducked, avoiding a blow to the face. Jean-Fran?ois bellowed something, his face contorted with fury and pain.</p><p>Corinne\u2019s father rushed out at the same moment security arrived with stun guns drawn and aimed. Gideon shoved Jean-Fran?ois off again, defending himself without once throwing a punch of his own. His face was stony, his eyes cold and nearly as lifeless as Giroux\u2019s.</p><p>Giroux shouted at Gideon. With the door left open by Corinne\u2019s father, I caught part of what was said. The word enfant needed no translation. Everything inside me went deathly still, all sound lost to the buzzing in my ears.</p><p>Everyone rushed out of the room as both Gideon and Giroux were flex-cuffed and hustled toward a service elevator by the guards. I blinked when Angus appeared in the doorway, certain I was imagining him.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Cross,\u201d he said softly, approaching me carefully with his cap in his hands.</p> <p>I could only imagine how I looked. I was stuck on the word baby and what that could possibly mean. After all, Corinne had been in New York as long as I\u2019d known Gideon ... but her husband hadn\u2019t been.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to take you home.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s Gideon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe texted me and asked me to come get you.\u201d</p><p>My confusion turned into a sharp pain. \u201cBut he needs me.\u201d</p><p>Angus took a deep breath, his eyes filled with something that looked like pity. \u201cCome with me, Eva. It\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me here,\u201d I said flatly, latching on to the one thing I was beginning to comprehend.</p><p>\u201cHe wants you home and comfortable.\u201d</p><p>My feet felt rooted to the floor. \u201cIs that what the text said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being kind.\u201d I started to walk, running on autopilot.</p><p>I passed one of the orderlies picking up the mess made when Giroux had been shoved into a cart of supplies. The way he avoided looking at me seemed to confirm the harsh reality.</p><p>I\u2019d been set aside.</p><p>22</p><p>GIDEON DIDN\u2019T COME home that night. When I checked his apartment on my way out to work, I found the beds neatly made.</p><p>Wherever he\u2019d spent the night, it hadn\u2019t been near me. After the revelation of Corinne\u2019s pregnancy, I was stunned that I\u2019d been left on my own with no explanation. I felt like this huge bomb had exploded in front of me and I was left standing in the rumble, alone and confused.</p><p>Angus and the Bentley were waiting for me downstairs when I stepped outside. Irritation simmered. Every time Gideon pulled away from me, he sent Angus in as a surrogate.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve married you, Angus,\u201d I muttered, as I slid into the backseat. \u201cYou\u2019re always there for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon makes sure of it,\u201d he said, before shutting the door.</p><p>Always loyal, I thought bitterly.</p><p>When I got to work and learned that Megumi was still out sick, I was equally concerned about her and relieved for me. It wasn\u2019t like her to miss work\u2014she was always at her desk early\u2014so the repeated absences told me something was really wrong with her. But not having her there meant she couldn\u2019t catch my mood and ask questions I didn\u2019t want to answer. Couldn\u2019t answer, actually. I had no idea where my husband was, what he was doing or feeling.</p><p>And I was angry and hurt about it. The one thing I wasn\u2019t was scared. Gideon was right about marriage fostering a settled feeling. I had a grip on him he\u2019d have to work to break. He couldn\u2019t just disappear or ignore me forever. No matter what, he would have to deal with me at some point. The only question was: When?</p><p>Focusing on work, I willed the hours to rush by. When I got off at five, I still hadn\u2019t heard from Gideon and I hadn\u2019t reached out to him, either. As far as I was concerned, he needed to bridge the gap he\u2019d created between us.</p><p>I headed to my Krav Maga class after work, where Parker worked one-on-one with me for an hour.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on fire tonight,\u201d he said, when I threw him to the mat for the sixth or seventh time.</p><p>I didn\u2019t tell him I was imagining Gideon in his place.</p><p>When I got home, I found Cary and Trey hanging out in the living room. They were eating torpedo sandwiches and watching a comedy show.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got plenty,\u201d Trey said, pushing half of his sandwich toward me. \u201cThere\u2019s beer in the fridge, too.\u201d</p><p>He was a great guy, with an awesome personality to match. And he loved my best friend. I looked at Cary and for a second, he let me see his confusion and pain. Then he hid it behind his bright, gorgeous smile. He patted the cushion next to him. \u201cCome sit, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I agreed, partly because I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of being alone in my room with my thoughts driving me crazy. \u201cJust let me take a shower first.\u201d</p><p>Once I was freshly scrubbed and cozy in worn sweats, I joined the two men on the couch. I brooded over getting a \u201cnot found\u201d error when I tried to track Gideon\u2019s smartphone with the instructions he\u2019d given me.</p><p>I ended up sleeping in the living room, preferring the couch to a bed that might smell like my missing husband.</p><p>I woke up to the smell of him anyway, and the feel of his arms around me as he lifted me. Weary, I rested my head against Gideon\u2019s chest and listened to the sound of his heart beating strong and sure. He carried me to my bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cCalifornia.\u201d</p><p>I jolted. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the morning, Eva,\u201d he said sternly, putting me to bed and pressed a rough kiss to my forehead.</p><p>I caught his wrist as he straightened. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t slept in damn near two days.\u201d There was an edge to his voice that set off alarms.</p><p>Pushing onto my elbows, I tried to see his face in the semidarkness, but it was too hard and I was still trying to shrug off sleep. I could tell he was wearing jeans and a long-sleeved shirt, and that was about it. \u201cSo? Got a bed right here.\u201d</p><p>He heaved out an exasperated, weary breath. \u201cLie down. I\u2019ll get my prescription.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he\u2019d been gone too long that I remembered he kept a bottle of his pills in my bathroom. He\u2019d left for no other reason than to leave. I shoved the blankets off me and stumbled out of the room, making my way through my darkened living room to find my keys. I went to Gideon\u2019s apartment and let myself in, nearly tripping over a suitcase left carelessly by the door.</p><p>He must have taken just enough time to drop it off before coming to me. And yet he hadn\u2019t intended to spend the night in my bed. Why had he come? Just to see me sleep? To check up on me?</p><p>Fuck. Would I ever understand him?</p><p>I searched for him and found him sprawled facedown on the master bed, his head on my pillow and his clothes still on. His boots lay a few feet apart from each other at the end of the bed, as if he\u2019d kicked them off in a rush, and his smartphone and wallet were tossed on the nightstand.</p><p>The phone was irresistible.</p><p>I picked it up, typed in angel as the password, and scrolled through it without shame. If he caught me doing it, I wouldn\u2019t care. If he wasn\u2019t going to give me answers, I had every right to search for them myself.</p><p>The last thing I expected to find were so many pictures of me in his photo album. There were dozens: some of us together taken by paparazzi, others that he\u2019d taken with his phone when I was unaware. Candid shots that afforded me the opportunity to see myself through his eyes.</p><p>I stopped worrying. He loved me. Adored me. No man could take the pictures he did of me otherwise, with messy hair and no makeup, doing nothing more interesting than reading something or standing in front of an open refrigerator contemplating what I wanted. Pictures of me sleeping and eating and frowning in concentration ... Boring, commonplace things. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His phone log showed mostly calls placed between him and Angus, Ra\u00fal, or Scott. There were voice mails from Corinne I refused to torture myself by listening to, but I could see he hadn\u2019t answered her or called her in a while. There were calls between him and business associates\u2014a couple with Arnoldo, and several with his attorneys.</p><p>And three calls exchanged between him and Deanna Johnson.</p><p>My gaze narrowed. Those ranged from several minutes long to a quarter of an hour.</p> <p>I checked his text messages and found the one he\u2019d sent to Angus when we were at the hospital.</p><p>I need her out of here.</p><p>Sinking into the armchair in the corner of the room, I stared at the message. Need, not want. For some reason, the word choice changed my perception of what happened. I still didn\u2019t get it completely, but I didn\u2019t feel quite so ... pushed aside.</p><p>There were also texts between him and Ireland, which made me happy. I didn\u2019t read them but could see that the last one had come in on Monday.</p><p>Returning the phone to its former spot, I watched the man I loved sink into the deep sleep of exhaustion. Sprawled as he was, dressed as he was, he looked his age. He carried so much responsibility and he made it look so effortless ... so innately artless, that it was easy to forget he was as vulnerable to being overworked and stressed out as anyone.</p> <p>It was my job as his wife to help him deal with it. But that was impossible for me to do if he shut me out. In saving me worry, he took more onto himself.</p><p>We\u2019d be talking about that as soon as he caught some sleep.</p><p>I woke with a crick in my neck and the lingering sense that something was wrong. Moving gingerly so as not to pull something, I unfolded from my curled-up position in the armchair and noted that the dawn was well on its way. Pinkish-orange light was visible through the windows, and a quick glance at the bedside clock told me it was creeping into morning.</p><p>Gideon groaned and I stilled, dread sliding through me at the sound. It was a terrible noise, the sound of a creature wounded in both body and soul. A chill swept over me as he moaned again, everything in me reacting violently to his torment.</p><p>Rushing to the bed, I climbed on it, kneeling as I pushed at his shoulder. \u201cGideon. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>He flinched away from me, curling around my pillow and squeezing it. His body jerked as a sob escaped him.</p> <p>I spooned behind him, wrapping one arm around his waist. \u201cShh, baby,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve got you. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>I rocked him as he cried in his sleep, my tears wetting his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWAKE up, angel mine,\u201d Gideon murmured, his lips brushing over my jaw. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>I stretched, feeling lingering aches from the last two nights of hard training and the few hours I\u2019d spent sleeping in the armchair before moving to the bed and joining him.</p><p>My T-shirt was pushed up, exposing my breasts to his avid, hungry mouth. A hand pushed beneath the waistband of my sweats and then my panties, finding my cleft and expertly coaxing me to a swift arousal.</p><p>\u201cGideon ...\u201d I could feel the need in his touch, the desire that was far more than skin deep.</p><p>He took my mouth, hushing me with a kiss. My hips arched as his fingers pushed into me, fucking me gently. Eager to answer his silent demand for more, I pushed at my sweats, kicking restlessly until I got them off.</p><p>I reached for the button fly of his jeans, yanking it open and shoving the denim and cotton boxer briefs out of the way.</p> <p>\u201cPut me inside you,\u201d he whispered against my lips.</p><p>I circled his thick erection with my fingers, positioning him and then lifting to take the first inch of him inside me.</p><p>Burying his face in my neck, he thrust, sinking into me, moaning with pleasure as I closed tight around him. \u201cChrist, Eva. I need you so much.\u201d</p><p>My arms and legs caged him, holding him tight.</p><p>Time and everything else in the world ceased to matter. Gideon renewed all the promises he\u2019d made to me on the sands of a Caribbean beach, and I tried to heal him, hoping to give him the strength he needed to face another day.</p><p>I was putting on my makeup when Gideon joined me in the bathroom, setting a steaming mug of creamy sweet coffee on the marble counter next to me. He wore nothing but pajama pants, so I guessed he wasn\u2019t going into the office or at least not right away.</p><p>Eyeing him in the mirror, I searched for signs that he remembered his dreams. I\u2019d never seen him so deeply troubled, as if his heart were breaking.</p><p>\u201cEva,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cwe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on board with that.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back against the counter, he held his mug in both hands. He stared down into his coffee for a long minute before asking, \u201cDid you make a sex tape with Brett Kline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I faced him, my hand tightening on the handle of my makeup brush. \u201cNo. Fuck no. Why would you ask me that?\u201d</p><p>He held my gaze. \u201cWhen I came back from the hospital the other night, Deanna caught up with me in the lobby. After the situation with Corinne, I knew brushing her off was the wrong approach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You were right. So I took her to the bar up the street, bought her a glass of wine, and apologized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took her out for wine,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cNo, I took her out to tell her I\u2019m sorry for how I treated her. I bought her the wine so we had a reason to be sitting in the damn bar,\u201d he said irritably. \u201cI figured you\u2019d prefer a public place over bringing her up to the apartment, which would have been more convenient and private.\u201d</p><p>He was right, and I appreciated his thinking of how I\u2019d react and making accommodations for it. But I was still annoyed that Deanna had snagged a pseudo date with him.</p><p>Gideon must have known what I was feeling because his lips tilted up on one side. \u201cSo possessive, angel. You\u2019re lucky I like it so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. What does Deanna have to do with a sex tape? Did she tell you there was one? It\u2019s a lie. She\u2019s lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not. My apology smoothed things over enough for her to throw me a bone. She told me about the tape and that an auction for it was imminent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, she\u2019s full of shit,\u201d I argued.</p><p>\u201cYou know a guy named Sam Yimara?\u201d</p><p>Everything stopped. Anxiety pooled in the pit of my stomach. \u201cYes, he was the band\u2019s wannabe videographer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He took a sip of his coffee, his eyes hard as they looked at me over the rim of his mug. \u201cHe apparently set up remote cameras at some of the band\u2019s shows to gather backstage material. He claims to have re-created the \u2018Golden\u2019 video with actual explicit footage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I covered my mouth, feeling sick.</p><p>It was bad enough thinking about strangers watching Brett and me fucking, but it was a million times worse imagining Gideon seeing it. I could still picture the look on his face when he\u2019d watched the music video, and that had been terrible. He and I would never be the same if he viewed the real deal. I knew I\u2019d never be able to scrub images of him and another woman out of my mind. And over time, they\u2019d eat at me like acid.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you went to California,\u201d I whispered, horrified.</p><p>\u201cDeanna gave me what information she had, and I secured a temporary injunction barring Yimara from licensing or selling the video.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t get a clue about what he was thinking or feeling from his body language. He was closed tight and restrained, rigidly in control. While I felt like I was coming apart at the seams. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop it from getting out,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe have a temporary seal on the court proceedings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat video hits one of those file-sharing sites and it\u2019ll spread like the plague.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, the ends of his inky hair brushing over his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve got an IT team dedicated to nothing but looking twenty-four-seven for that file on the Internet, but Yimara won\u2019t make any money giving the footage away. It\u2019s only worth something as an exclusive. He\u2019s not going to fuck that up before he exhausts all other options\u2014including selling it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeanna will tell. It\u2019s her job to expose secrets, not keep them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offered her a forty-eight-hour exclusive on our wedding photos, if she keeps a lid on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she was okay with that?\u201d I asked skeptically. \u201cThat woman\u2019s hot for you. She can\u2019t have been happy about you being off the market. Permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a point at which it becomes clear there\u2019s no hope,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI think I managed to make that point. Trust me, she was happy enough with the money to be made on the wedding exclusive.\u201d</p><p>I moved to the toilet, dropped the lid down, and sat. The reality of what he\u2019d told me sank in. \u201cI\u2019m sick over this, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>He set his coffee down next to mine and came to crouch in front of me. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>I did as he ordered, but it was hard.</p><p>\u201cI will never let anyone hurt you,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you understand? I will take care of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I breathed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with this. And with everything else you have going on\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gideon caught my hands. \u201cSomeone violated your privacy, Eva. Don\u2019t apologize for that. As for dealing with this ... that\u2019s my right. My honor. You\u2019ll always come first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like I came first at the hospital,\u201d I argued, needing to get the resentment out before it festered. And needing him to explain why he was always pushing me away when he was trying to protect me. \u201cEverything went to hell and you shoved me at Angus when I wanted to be there for you. You took off to another state and didn\u2019t call ... didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t sleep. It took every minute I had and too many favors to count to get that injunction done in the time I had to work with. You have to trust me, Eva. Even if you don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m doing, trust that I\u2019m always thinking of you and doing what\u2019s best for you. For us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked away, hating that answer. \u201cCorinne\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled harshly. \u201cShe was, yes. Four months along.\u201d</p><p>One word chilled me. \u201cWas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe miscarried as the doctors were treating the overdose. I\u2019m choosing to believe she didn\u2019t know about the baby.\u201d</p><p>I searched his face and tried to hide the pitiful relief on my own. \u201cFour months? The baby was Giroux\u2019s, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would hope so,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cHe seems to think it was his, and that I\u2019m responsible for her losing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s head dropped to my lap, his cheek resting on my thigh. \u201cShe had to be clueless. She couldn\u2019t risk a baby over something so stupid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you blame yourself for this, Gideon,\u201d I told him sternly.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around my waist. \u201cChrist. Am I cursed?\u201d</p><p>I hated Corinne so much in that moment I felt violent. She\u2019d known Gideon\u2019s father had committed suicide. If she knew Gideon at all, she would know how much her attempt would devastate him.</p><p>\u201cYou are not responsible for this.\u201d I ran my fingers through his hair, offering comfort. \u201cDo you hear me? Only Corinne is responsible for what happened. She\u2019ll have to live with what she\u2019s done, not you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d He hugged me, his breath warm through the silk of my robe.</p><p>A quarter hour after Gideon left me in the bathroom to take a call from Ra\u00fal, I was still standing at the vanity, staring into the sink.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be late for work,\u201d he said gently, joining me and hugging me from behind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about just calling in.\u201d I never did that, but I was tired and feeling worn out. I couldn\u2019t imagine pulling it together enough to give my job the focus it deserved.</p><p>\u201cYou could, but it won\u2019t look good when you\u2019re photographed at the gala tonight.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him in the mirror. \u201cWe\u2019re not going!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon, if that footage of me and Brett gets out, you don\u2019t want your name linked to mine.\u201d</p><p>His body went stiff, and then he turned me around to face him. \u201cSay that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. The Cross name has been through enough, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAngel, I\u2019m as close as I\u2019ve ever been to taking you across my knee. Luckily for you, I don\u2019t play rough when I\u2019m mad.\u201d</p><p>His gruff teasing didn\u2019t distract me from the fact that he was determined to protect the girl I\u2019d been, the girl I was ashamed of. He was willing to stand between me and scandal, shielding me as best he could and taking the hit alongside me, if it came to that.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think it was possible to love him more than I did, but he kept proving me wrong.</p><p>He cupped my face in his hands. \u201cWhatever we face, we face together. And you\u2019ll do it with my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how proud I am for you to have it.\u201d He brushed his mouth across my brow. \u201cHow much it means to me that you\u2019ve taken it and made it yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gideon.\u201d I pushed onto my tiptoes and surged into him. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>I was a half hour late to work and found a temp at Megumi\u2019s desk. I smiled and said hi, but worry ate at me. I popped my head into Mark\u2019s office and apologized profusely for being late. Then I called Megumi\u2019s cell when I got to my cubicle, but she didn\u2019t answer. I headed over to Will\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cGot a question for you,\u201d I said, when I reached him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope I have the answer,\u201d he shot back, swiveling in his chair to look up at me through his stylish glasses.</p><p>\u201cWho does Megumi call to say she\u2019s sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe reports to Daphne for everything. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just worried. She hasn\u2019t called me back. I\u2019m wondering if I pissed her off somehow.\u201d I shifted on my feet. \u201cI hate not knowing or being able to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for what it\u2019s worth, Daphne said she sounds horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks. But thanks.\u201d</p><p>I headed back to my cubicle. Mark gestured me into his office as I walked by.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re hanging the six-story banner for Tungsten scarves today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWant to go check it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d As scattered as I was feeling, getting out in the muggy August heat was preferable to sitting at my cool desk. \u201cThat\u2019d be awesome!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his jacket off the back of his chair. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>WHEN I got home shortly after five o\u2019clock, I found my living room taken over by a team of white-coated beauty technicians. Cary and Trey were kicked back on the couch with green goop on their faces and towels under their heads to protect the white upholstery. My mother was chatting away while her hair was styled in a sexy cap of waves and curls.</p><p>I took a quick shower, then joined them. In an hour, they managed to take me from bedraggled to glamorous, affording me the time to think about everything I\u2019d ruthlessly suppressed all day\u2014the video, Corinne, Giroux, Deanna, and Brett.</p><p>Someone was going to have to tell Brett. That someone was me.</p><p>When the beautician came toward me with a lip brush, I held up my hand. \u201cRed, please.\u201d</p><p>She paused a minute, her head canting as she examined me. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>I was holding my breath through a finishing blast of hair spray when my smartphone vibrated in the pocket of my robe. Seeing Gideon\u2019s name on the screen, I answered. \u201cHi, ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat color are you wearing?\u201d he asked, without a hello.</p><p>\u201cSilver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d His voice took on a warm purr that made my toes flex. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you in it. And out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be waiting,\u201d I admonished. \u201cYou\u2019d better have your fine ass over here in about ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed. \u201cHurry up or we won\u2019t have any limo time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm ... I\u2019ll be there in five.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and I held my phone for a minute, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d my mom asked, coming up beside me.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up. \u201cHe\u2019s escorting you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Eva.\u201d She hugged me. \u201cI\u2019m so glad.\u201d</p><p>With my arms around her, I figured it was as good a time as any to start spreading the engagement news. I knew Gideon wasn\u2019t going to wait long before insisting on sharing our marriage with the world.</p><p>I said quietly, \u201cHe asked Dad for permission to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d When she pulled back, she was smiling. \u201cHe talked to Richard, too, which I think is such a nice touch, don\u2019t you? I\u2019ve already started planning. I was thinking June, at the Pierre, of course. We\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest December, at the latest.\u201d</p><p>My mother gasped, her eyes widening. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. There\u2019s no way to pull off a wedding in that amount of time. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cTell Gideon you\u2019re thinking of June next year. See what he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have to wait until he actually proposes first!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I kissed her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m going to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>23</p><p>I WAS IN my room, sliding the strapless gown up over my matching bustier, when Gideon came in. I literally stopped breathing, my gaze drinking in his reflection in my cheval mirror. Standing behind me in a tuxedo tailored just for him, with a lovely gray tie that matched my dress so well, he was dazzling. I\u2019d never seen him look so gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I breathed, entranced. \u201cYou are so getting laid tonight.\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirked. \u201cDoes that mean I can skip zipping you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean we can skip going to this thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance, angel. I\u2019m showing off my wife tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows I\u2019m your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it.\u201d He came up behind me and secured my zipper. \u201cAnd soon\u2014really soon\u2014the world will know it.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back into him, admiring our joint reflection. We took great pictures together.</p><p>Which made me think of other pictures ...</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d I said, \u201cthat you\u2019ll never watch the video.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t answer me, I turned to look at him directly. When I saw the closed-off look on his face, I started freaking out. \u201cGideon. Did you watch it already?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cA minute or two. Nothing explicit. Just enough to prove validity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. Promise me you won\u2019t watch it.\u201d My voice rose and grew sharp as panic spread through me. \u201cPromise me!\u201d</p><p>His hands encircled my wrists and squeezed hard enough to make my breath catch. I stared at him, wide-eyed, confused by the sudden aggression.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>The oddest rush of warmth spread outward from where he touched me. My heart beat faster, but also steadier. I stared at our hands, my attention catching on his ruby ring. Red. Like the cuffs he\u2019d bought for me. I felt similarly captured and bound now. And it soothed me in a way I didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>But Gideon obviously did.</p><p>That was why I\u2019d been afraid to marry him so quickly, I realized. He was taking me on a journey that had an unknown destination and I had agreed to follow him blindfolded. It wasn\u2019t about where we\u2019d end up as a couple, because that was never in question. We were obsessed, dependent on each other in the unrelenting way of addicts. Where I would end up, who I\u2019d be at the end, was what I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s transformation had been almost violent, happening in a moment of sharp clarity when he\u2019d comprehended that he wouldn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014live without me. My change was more gradual, so painstakingly measured that I\u2019d believed I wouldn\u2019t have to change at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was wrong.</p><p>Swallowing past the lump in my throat, I spoke more steadily. \u201cGideon, listen. Whatever\u2019s on that video, it\u2019s nothing compared to what you and I have. The only memories I want in your head are ones we make. What we\u2019ve got together ... that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s real. The only thing that matters. So please ... promise me.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly, then nodded. \u201cAll right. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>I breathed out a sigh of relief. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Lifting my hands to his mouth, he kissed them. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Eva.\u201d</p><p>BY silent, mutual agreement, we refrained from mussing each other up in the limo before our first public appearance as a married couple. I was nervous, and while an orgasm or two would help alleviate that, looking less than perfect would only make it worse. And people would notice. Not only was my silver gown eye-catching, with its brilliant sheen and short train, but my arm-candy husband was an impossible-to-miss accessory.</p><p>Attention would be on us, and Gideon seemed determined to keep it that way. He helped me out of the limo when we arrived at Fifth Avenue and Central Park South, taking a moment to slide his lips across my temple. \u201cThat dress is going to look amazing on my bedroom floor.\u201d</p><p>I laughed at the cheesy line, which I knew he\u2019d intended, and camera flashes went off in a storm of blinding light. Once he turned away from me, all warmth left his face, the beautiful planes settling into a closed expression that gave nothing away. He set his hand at the small of my back and led me across the red carpet and into Cipriani\u2019s.</p> <p>Once inside, he found a spot he approved of and we stayed there for an hour as business associates and acquaintances circled around us. He wanted me at his side and he wanted to be at mine as well, something he proved a short while later when we were headed to the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cIntroduce me,\u201d he said simply and I followed his gaze to where Christine Field and Walter Leaman, of Waters Field &amp; Leaman, were laughing along with the group of people they were standing with. Christine looked restrained and elegant in a black beaded dress that covered her from throat to wrists to ankles except for the plunging back, and Walter, who was a large man, looked successful and confident in a nicely cut tuxedo and bow tie.</p><p>\u201cThey know who you are,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cDo they know who I am to you?\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose a little, knowing my world was going to change drastically once my single-girl self was subsumed by my identity as Eva Cross. \u201cCome on, ace.\u201d</p><p>We headed over there, weaving through round tables covered in white linens and decorated with candelabras wrapped in floral garlands that lent a wonderful fragrance to the room.</p> <p>My bosses spotted Gideon first, of course. I don\u2019t think they even recognized me until Gideon quite obviously deferred to me by letting me speak first.</p><p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d I said, shaking Christine\u2019s and Walter\u2019s hands. \u201cI know you\u2019re both familiar with Gideon Cross, my ...\u201d</p><p>I paused, my brain grinding to a halt.</p><p>\u201cFianc\u00e9,\u201d Gideon finished, shaking hands.</p><p>Congratulations were exchanged; smiles got bigger, eyes brighter.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re losing you, does it?\u201d Christine asked, diamond drop earrings glinting in the soft light of the chandeliers.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>That earned me a sharp pinch on my butt from Gideon.</p> <p>We were going to have to deal with the work issue at some point, but I figured I could hold him off at least until our next wedding.</p><p>We talked a bit about the Kingsman Vodka campaign, which was mostly a way to emphasize what a good job Waters Field &amp; Leaman had done so the agency could hook more Cross Industries business. Gideon knew the game, of course, and played it well. He was polite, charming, and clearly not a man who could be easily influenced.</p><p>After that, we ran out of things to talk about. Gideon made our excuses.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s dance,\u201d he murmured in my ear. \u201cI want to hold you.\u201d</p><p>We moved onto the dance floor, where Cary was drawing attention with a stunning redhead. Flashes of a pale, shapely leg could be seen through the risqu\u00e9 slit in her emerald green dress. He moved her into a spin, then a dip. Undeniably suave.</p><p>Trey hadn\u2019t been able to come because of an evening class, and I was sorry about that. I was sorry, too, that I was glad Cary hadn\u2019t brought Tatiana instead. Thinking that way made me feel bitchy, and I seriously disliked catty bitches.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head at Gideon\u2019s command and found his eyes on me. \u201cHi, ace.\u201d</p><p>With his hand at my back and my hand in his, we swept casually around the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cCrossfire,\u201d he whispered, his gaze hot on my face.</p><p>I touched his cheek with my fingertips. \u201cWe\u2019re learning from our mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels good.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his eyes so blue and his hair so damn sexy I wanted to run my fingers through it right then and there. He pulled me closer. \u201cNot as good as you feel.\u201d</p><p>We stayed on the dance floor through two songs. Then the music ended when the bandleader turned to the mic and made an announcement: Dinner was about to be served. Seated at our table were my mother and Richard, Cary, a plastic surgeon and his wife, and a guy who said he\u2019d just wrapped up shooting the pilot episode to a new television show he hoped would be picked up for a full-season run.</p><p>The meal was some sort of Asian fusion and I ate everything, because it was good and the portions weren\u2019t that big. Gideon had his hand on my thigh beneath the table, his thumb rubbing lightly in small circles that made me squirm.</p><p>He leaned over. \u201cSit still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d I whispered back.</p><p>\u201cKeep wiggling and I\u2019ll put my fingers inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cTry me and see.\u201d</p><p>Because I wouldn\u2019t put it past him, I sat still, even though it killed me.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Cary said abruptly, pushing back from the table.</p><p>I watched him walk away and caught his gaze lingering on a nearby table. When the redhead in green followed him out of the room a few moments later, I wasn\u2019t too surprised, but I was very disappointed. I knew the situation with Tatiana was stressing him out and I knew mindless sex was Cary\u2019s cure-all, but it also fucked with his self-esteem and led to more problems than it fixed.</p><p>It was good that we were only a couple days away from seeing Dr. Travis.</p><p>Leaning into Gideon, I whispered, \u201cCary and I are going to San Diego this weekend.\u201d</p><p>His head swiveled toward me. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me this now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, between your exes and my ex, my parents, Cary, and everything else, it keeps slipping my mind! I figured I\u2019d better tell you before I forgot again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel ...\u201d He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d I pushed to my feet. I needed to remind him that Brett had a tour stop in San Diego at the same time, but I had to catch Cary first.</p><p>He looked at me quizzically as he stood.</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d I told him, adding very quietly, \u201cGot some cockblocking to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva\u2014\u201d</p><p>I heard the warning in his tone and ignored it, lifting my skirt and hurrying after Cary. I\u2019d just made it past the ballroom entrance, when I ran into a familiar face.</p><p>\u201cMagdalene,\u201d I said in surprise, stopping. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGage was wrapped up in a project, so we ran a little late. Missed dinner entirely, but at least I got my hands on one of those chocolate mousse things they served for dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKick-ass,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d Magdalene smiled.</p><p>I thought to myself that she looked really good. Softer, sweeter. Still stunning and sultry in a one-shouldered red lace dress, her dark hair framing a delicate face and crimson lips. Getting away from Christopher Vidal had done her a lot of good. And having a new man in her life surely helped. I remembered her mentioning a guy named Gage when she\u2019d visited me at work a couple weeks before.</p><p>\u201cI saw you with Gideon,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I noticed your ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve come over and said hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was eating that dessert.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cA girl\u2019s got to have her priorities.\u201d</p><p>Magdalene reached out and touched my arm briefly. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, Eva. Happy for Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. You should stop by our table and tell him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Catch you later.\u201d</p><p>She walked off and I stared after her for a minute, still wary but thinking she might not be so bad after all.</p><p>The one negative about running into Magdalene was losing Cary. By the time I resumed chasing after him, he\u2019d already ducked out of sight somewhere.</p><p>I headed back to Gideon, mentally preparing the ass-chewing I was going to give Cary. Elizabeth Vidal halted me in my tracks.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said, when I nearly bumped into her.</p><p>She grabbed me by the elbow and pulled me over to a dark corner. Then she caught my hand and looked at my gorgeous Asscher diamond. \u201cThat\u2019s my ring.\u201d</p><p>I tugged free. \u201cIt was your ring. It\u2019s mine now. Your son gave it to me around the time he asked me to marry him.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me with those blue eyes that were so like her son\u2019s. So like Ireland\u2019s. She was a beautiful woman, glamorous and elegant. As much a head-turner as my mother, really, but she had Gideon\u2019s iciness.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you take him away from me,\u201d she bit out between brilliantly white teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it all wrong.\u201d I crossed my arms. \u201cI want to get you two together, so we can put everything out in the open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re filling his head with lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. Seriously? The next time he tells you what happened\u2014and I\u2019ll make sure he does\u2014you\u2019re going to believe him. And you\u2019re going to apologize, and find some fucking way to make it easier for him to bear. Because I want him healed and healthy and whole.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elizabeth stared at me, clearly fuming. She obviously wasn\u2019t on board with that plan.</p><p>\u201cAre we done?\u201d I asked, disgusted with her deliberate blindness.</p><p>\u201cNot even close,\u201d she hissed, leaning into me. \u201cI know about you and that lead singer. I\u2019m on to you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. Had Christopher talked to her? What would he have said? Knowing what he\u2019d done to Magdalene, I believed him capable of pretty much anything. \u201cUnbelievable. You believe the lies and ignore the truth.\u201d</p><p>I started walking away but stopped. \u201cWhat I think is really interesting is that after I confronted you last time, you didn\u2019t ask Gideon about what happened. \u2018Hey, son, your crazy girlfriend told me this crazy story.\u2019 I can\u2019t figure out why you didn\u2019t ask him. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to explain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t think you would.\u201d</p><p>I left her behind before she opened her mouth again and ruined my night.</p><p>Unfortunately, when I started heading toward my table, I saw Deanna Johnson sitting in my seat, talking to Gideon.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d I muttered, my gaze narrowing at the way the reporter kept putting her hand on his forearm as she talked. Cary was off doing what he shouldn\u2019t be doing; my mom and Stanton were on the dance floor. And Deanna had slid in like a snake.</p><p>Whatever Gideon thought, it was obvious to me that her interest in him was as hot as ever. And while he offered no encouragement aside from listening to whatever she was saying, just the fact that he was giving her attention was watering that weed.</p><p>\u201cShe must be great in bed. He fucks her a lot.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened and turned toward the woman talking to me. It was Cary\u2019s redhead, who had the flushed, bright-eyed look of a woman who\u2019d just had a very nice orgasm. Still, she was older than I\u2019d first thought from a distance.</p><p>\u201cYou should watch out for him,\u201d she said, looking at Gideon. \u201cHe uses women. I\u2019ve seen it happen. More than it should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all say that.\u201d Her sympathetic smile rubbed me the wrong way. \u201cI know of two women who\u2019ve experienced severe depression over him. Certainly, they won\u2019t be the last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t listen to gossip,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>She walked away with an irritatingly serene smile, reaching up to pat her hair as she skirted tables on the way to her own.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she was halfway across the room that I placed her face.</p><p>\u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>I hurried back to Gideon. He stood when I reached him.</p><p>\u201cI need you real quick,\u201d I said briskly, before shooting a look at the brunette in my chair. \u201cDeanna, always a pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>She ignored the dig. \u201cHi, Eva. I was just leaving\u2014\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019d already tuned her out. I caught Gideon\u2019s hand and tugged. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, hang on.\u201d He said something to Deanna, but I didn\u2019t catch it, pulling him along instead. \u201cChrist, Eva. What the hell is the rush?\u201d</p><p>I stopped by the wall and looked out over the room, searching for green and red. Seemed to me he would have noticed his former lover\u2014unless she\u2019d been deliberately avoiding him. Of course she looked so different without her former pixie haircut, and I hadn\u2019t seen her white-haired husband, which would have made it easier to identify her sooner. \u201cDo you know if Anne Lucas is here?\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened on mine. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmerald green dress, long red hair. Seen that woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was dancing with Cary earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, getting aggravated. \u201cJesus, Gideon. It was hard to miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me for having eyes only for my wife,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>I squeezed his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just need to know if it was her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain why. Did she come up to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she did. Shoveled some shit my way, then wandered off. I think Cary sneaked off with her, too. You know, for a quickie.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s face turned hard. He turned his attention to the room, sweeping it from one side to the other, with a slow searching glance. \u201cI don\u2019t see her. Or anyone like you described.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Anne a therapist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsychiatrist.\u201d</p><p>A sense of foreboding made me restless. \u201cCan we go now?\u201d</p><p>He studied me. \u201cTell me what she said to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I haven\u2019t heard before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s reassuring,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYes, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We went back to our table for my clutch and to say good-bye to everyone.</p><p>\u201cCan I hitch a ride with you?\u201d Cary asked, after I hugged my mom good-bye.</p><p>Gideon nodded. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>ANGUS shut the door of the limo.</p><p>Cary, Gideon, and I settled back into the bench seats, and just a couple of minutes later we pulled away from Cipriani\u2019s and into traffic.</p><p>My best friend shot me a look. \u201cDon\u2019t start.\u201d</p><p>He hated when I laid into him about his behavior, and I didn\u2019t blame him. I wasn\u2019t his mother. But I was someone who loved him and wanted good things for him. I knew how self-destructive he could be when left unchecked.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t my biggest concern at that moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat was her name?\u201d I asked, praying he knew so I could identify the redhead once and for all.</p><p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d My hands flexed restlessly around my clutch. \u201cDo you know it or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask,\u201d he retorted. \u201cDrop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch the tone, Cary,\u201d Gideon admonished quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a problem, fine. Don\u2019t take it out on Eva for giving a shit about you.\u201d</p><p>Cary\u2019s jaw tightened and he looked out the window.</p><p>I sat back and Gideon drew me into the curve of his shoulder, his hand running up and down my bare arm.</p><p>No one said another word on the ride home.</p><p>WHEN we reached my apartment, Gideon headed into the kitchen to grab a bottle of water and ended up on the phone, his gaze meeting mine across the breakfast bar and the several feet separating us.</p><p>Cary stalked off to his bedroom, then turned abruptly at the hallway and came back to hug me. Hard.</p><p>With his face in the curve of my shoulder, he whispered, \u201cSorry, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>I hugged him back. \u201cYou deserve better than the way you treat yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do her,\u201d he said quietly, pulling back to look at me. \u201cI was going to. I thought I wanted to. But when it came down to it, it hit me that I have a kid coming. A kid, Eva. And I don\u2019t want him\u2014or her\u2014growing up thinking of me the way I do my mom. I gotta get my shit straight.\u201d</p><p>I hugged him again. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d He pulled back, looking sheepish. \u201cI still rubbed her off, since I\u2019d taken it that far, but my dick stayed tucked in my pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTMI, Cary,\u201d I said. \u201cTotally TMI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still heading out to San Diego tomorrow?\u201d His hopeful look twisted my heart.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>His grin was tinged with relief. \u201cGood. I\u2019ve got us flying out at eight thirty.\u201d</p><p>Gideon rejoined us just then, and the look he gave me told me we weren\u2019t done talking about my going away for the weekend. But when Cary headed down the hallway to his room, I grabbed Gideon and kissed him hard, delaying that conversation. As I\u2019d hoped, he didn\u2019t hesitate to pull me in and take over, his mouth eating at mine with lush, deep licks.</p><p>Moaning, I let him sweep me away. The world could go crazy by itself for a night. Tomorrow was soon enough to face it and everything we had to deal with.</p><p>I grabbed him by the tie. \u201cTonight, you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours every night,\u201d he said in that warm, raspy voice that stirred the hottest fantasies.</p><p>\u201cStart now.\u201d I walked backward, pulling him toward my room. \u201cAnd don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t. Not \u2019til morning. </p> </body></html>"]
