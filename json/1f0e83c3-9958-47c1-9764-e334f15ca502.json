He had steel for bones and molten iron for blood. He rarely slept. He battled death vampires at night, sending to perdition any who crossed his sword. But during the day, when most of the pretty-boys were asleep, Antony bled his wrists on his altar and hunted rogue vampires on Mortal Earth, searching for the woman he\u2019d lost.</p><p>Those hunts also ended in death. Not his.</p><p>He stood on the rim of the Grand Canyon, Mortal Earth, looking down, tracking a death vampire flying in the shadows. Even though he was far from the touristy areas, he still cloaked his presence with a heavy concentration of mist, a preternatural creation designed to confuse the average human mind. Most mortals simply couldn\u2019t see him, and right now he didn\u2019t want to be seen.</p> <p>Antony stared into the abyss. The profound silence across the canyon formed a strange juxtaposition to the visual feast. The Grand Canyon was all for the eyes, not for the ears. But he hadn\u2019t come to admire the view or embrace the quiet.</p><p>His predatory gaze followed the death vampire flying below, legs straight back, glossy black wings glinting in the early-morning sunshine. He\u2019d been hunting this particular bastard for weeks now. All clues had led here. This pretty-boy had known both Eldon Crace and Rith Do\u2019onwa, two sons of bitches who had harmed women belonging to the Warriors of the Blood. Both vampires deserved death. Crace had already gotten what he deserved, and within the depths of Medichi\u2019s mind Rith Do\u2019onwa, the fiend who had kidnapped his woman, was a death waiting to happen, nothing more.</p><p>Three months ago, Medichi had served as Parisa Lovejoy\u2019s Guardian of Ascension. She\u2019d entered his world as an anomaly, a mortal-with-wings, a woman of extraordinary preternatural power in need of protection from the enemy. No one, except the first ascender, had mounted wings on Mortal Earth. But Parisa had. She\u2019d also arrived with the ability to voyeur, a power that allowed her to focus on an individual or a place and see what was happening in real time, even in an entirely separate location, or a different dimension.</p><p>So much power, and beauty, and a strong analytical mind.</p><p>But all these immense gifts and abilities paled in comparison with the call of the breh-hedden, the myth of vampire mate-bonding, that had proved as real as the air he breathed. She was his breh, his mate, the one destiny had selected for him, the one he craved.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t asked for a mate. He hadn\u2019t wanted one and he sure as hell didn\u2019t deserve one, but she\u2019d come, he\u2019d served as her guardian, and she\u2019d been abducted on his watch.</p><p>So here he was, a wrecked shell of a warrior, struggling to find his way back to her.</p><p>When Rith had abducted Parisa, he\u2019d not only blocked his trace\u2014which indicated an enormous amount of power\u2014but also deceived Medichi with a hologram of Parisa that lasted for at least half a minute. Medichi didn\u2019t know anyone, not even any of his warrior brothers, the powerful Warriors of the Blood, who could create a hologram. So, yeah, Rith had power, which made him a clever, dangerous opponent.</p><p>But the death vampire working the airstreams of the Grand Canyon had known Rith. He had answers, and Medichi meant to have them. Right now. This morning.</p><p>His heart pumped hard in his chest.</p><p>The death vampire flew close to the canyon walls as though trying to hide in the shadows. Medichi smiled the hard smile that tended to work his jaw at the same time. Did the death vamp actually think to hide in a place this size?</p> <p>Medichi bound his hair not in the ritual cadroen as he was supposed to, but with a narrow leather strap over his forehead, tied at the back of his head so that his long warrior hair flowed free. He was uncivilized now, a wild beast hunting for what was his by right, for what had been taken from him.</p><p>He had his wings at close-mount, tight to his body; any breeze would send him off the canyon\u2019s edge otherwise. But now it was time to take care of business. With the practice of thirteen centuries, he spread his wings to full-mount, adjusting with infinitesimal shifts to balance the air currents, then launched into the empty airspace over the canyon.</p><p>A rush of pure adrenaline shot through his heart then sent dizzying endorphins into his head. There was nothing like flight, nothing like falling off a cliff and knowing that spreading his wings to their farthest span would catch, hold, then carry him where he wanted to go.</p><p>With a slight adjustment, the barest drawing back of his wings, his body shifted at an angle that meant down, and down he started to fly. Down and down, into the varying degrees of cool shadow and warm light as the canyon walls jutted and receded.</p><p>He was close now, his quarry an eighth of a mile away, less, less, a hundred yards now.</p><p>The bastard looked up. Shit. Maybe Medichi\u2019s shadow had crossed him.</p><p>Panic seized the pretty-boy\u2019s eyes and he banked left, then drew his wings into close-mount. He threw his arms forward as though diving, his body now aimed in the direction of the Colorado River.</p><p>Medichi didn\u2019t hesitate. He folded his wings close to his body and, instead of flying in long pulls through the air, became a missile and headed with fierce intent after his prey.</p> <p>The bastard was good and he was old, which meant he had power, speed, and lots of fucking skill.</p><p>But then so did Medichi. He had never mounted his wings during battle, but he flew, a lot. He practiced, a lot. And now he smiled, his jaw twitching.</p><p>The mile-deep canyon walls sped past him, the striated layers of rock blending into an orange-beige fusion as he jetted toward the blue-and-white ribbon below. Closer.</p><p>He could almost touch the bastard\u2019s foot.</p><p>Closer.</p><p>If he could wrap a hand around his ankle.</p><p>Closer.</p><p>The waters rose up and up.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>The death vamp leveled off just three feet above the water but Medichi took a huge risk, kept his missile shape for a split second longer, and just as the death vamp started to plow air Medichi caught his ankle and jerked him down, straight into the frothy rapids of the river below. At the same time, with the steel of his bones, the molten iron of his blood, and a swift mental command, he snagged his levitation ability and threw his wings into parachute mount, cupped at the top, to keep from plunging into the frigid water.</p><p>The death vamp wasn\u2019t so lucky. His wings went under, and he surfaced screaming because the water had trashed them. The mesh superstructure that held the feathers in place was fairly fragile, and the smallest injury hurt like a bitch. This tumbling in wild waters would be a form of torture. As the current dragged him in a heap, tossing him over and over, the death vamp screamed each time his head breached the water. He landed back-first against an enormous rock. Medichi heard the crack as well as another shriek.</p><p>Medichi flew after him. When the pretty-boy would have slid into the heavy currents that swirled at the base of the rock, the warrior grabbed him by his long, dark hair and hauled him out of the water. He threw him facedown on the rock. How many mortals had this motherfucker drunk to death? How many ascenders? Death vamps didn\u2019t differentiate when it came to dying blood. Any human, ascended or not, would do.</p><p>Medichi wafted his wings slowly to keep his balance against the air currents that streamed through the canyon.</p><p>God, the bastard\u2019s wings were a mess. The vamp shook hard, maybe from the icy water but probably from shock and a mountain of pain.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Rith?\u201d he asked. Time to keep the questions simple.</p><p>The death vampire shifted slightly to cast one dark, beautiful eye up at Medichi. Calling death vampires \u201cpretty-boys\u201d was more than accurate. He was exquisite, chiseled features shaped by the effects of dying blood, porcelain skin with a faint bluish cast, enhanced no doubt by the freezing water. Medichi felt the pull of attraction, an allure that created a swelling of ease within his chest. Fuck. Even shaking with pain and approaching death, the bastard was trying to enthrall him.</p><p>Medichi punched back with a shot of mental power that acted like a blow, pushing the death vamp\u2019s face into the rock. \u201cEven at this hour,\u201d he shouted, \u201cwhen you face death, you\u2019d try to enthrall me?\u201d</p><p>A smile curved the side of the pretty-boy\u2019s mouth. Blood dribbled from his lips onto the wet black rock beneath his face. \u201cFuck you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Rith?\u201d</p><p>The death vampire just smiled. Yeah, questions would be futile, but he always gave them a chance because what he intended to do next would hurt like hell.</p><p>He retracted his wings then dropped to his knees beside the death vamp. A bone jutted from the bastard\u2019s thigh, shiny and white. Blood ran in a rivulet down his ruptured skin, but the water, still shedding from the nearest feathers of his broken wings, kept washing it away.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to just tell me?\u201d Medichi asked. One last chance.</p><p>The same reply returned, this time a much stronger \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Medichi said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it the hard way.\u201d He put his hand on the vamp\u2019s forehead.</p><p>The struggle began as the pretty-boy\u2019s mind bucked against Medichi\u2019s touch as though trying to cast him out of his head. He put up a good fight, too, but more than just Medichi\u2019s body had grown tougher over the forced separation from Parisa. He\u2019d been working his mental powers as well, trying to find his woman telepathically. In doing so, he\u2019d gotten stronger.</p><p>He shoved hard, and the vampire\u2019s mind gave way. The death vamp screamed but Medichi ignored him and began the real hunt.</p><p>He cast aside memories like batting at flies until Rith\u2019s strange face emerged, the Asian cast to his features, the broad forehead and wide nose. He focused on those memories and gained a portrait of the man as a powerful servant of Commander Greaves\u2014but then what else would he be? Greaves was the acknowledged enemy of all that Medichi held dear on Second Earth, in this beautiful dimensional world. Darian Greaves had ambitions to rule both Second Earth and Mortal Earth and was creating a powerful army of death vamps to back up his efforts. Rith was a favored servant.</p><p>Within the death vampire\u2019s mind, he saw Rith\u2019s lairs, sometimes in great caverns, sometimes in tents, sometimes in suburban homes, but all in separate geographic locales. He kept picking through them, trying to feel the presence of his woman. All the while the death vamp screamed at the invasion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Medichi came across the memory of one of Rith\u2019s properties that was shrouded in a mental shield. What the fuck was that? This death vampire didn\u2019t have enough power to create a deep mental shield like this, which meant that Rith had done it himself.</p><p>He tried punching through the shroud but couldn\u2019t and then the preternatural sensation stole over him, of simply knowing. He knew. He could feel that this was where Rith held Parisa captive, cloaked even from Central\u2019s advanced high-tech grid system, which could locate anything on two earths.</p><p>Parisa.</p> <p>Parisa.</p><p>Sweet Jesus. He felt light-headed. He struggled to breathe.</p><p>At last. He\u2019d found a connection to her at last. He focused on breathing for a moment. He had to get command of himself if he had any hope of extracting the information he needed.</p><p>When he was calmer and while he was still inside the pretty-boy\u2019s mind, he moved around the shrouded entity as though walking a mental circle. The death vampire sobbed now, but Medichi didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass. He\u2019d witnessed too many of the bastard\u2019s memories, those that involved securing dying blood, and the women he\u2019d killed to get to it\u2014always women because they were easily subdued physically.</p><p>So, yeah, let the bastard feel some pain. Let him feel a lot of pain because it wouldn\u2019t be even a fraction of the devastation he\u2019d created in the women he\u2019d killed and the families left behind to deal with all those losses.</p> <p>He focused once more on the shrouded dwelling and from deep within the death vampire\u2019s mind a location at last came forth: Burma, Second Earth.</p><p>Medichi couldn\u2019t quite grasp the sensation that plowed through him, but it popped a firework in his mind until glitter rained in his head. Relief flowed, pure exhilarating relief. After three long horrible months of hunting, he had just limited his search to a single country, located on only one of two dimensional earths.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>His entire body sagged and his throat tightened. He had a chance now of finding her, his woman.</p><p>Parisa on Second Earth and in Burma.</p><p>Even so, given Rith\u2019s level of preternatural power it would take a few days to find the lair that held her captive. With Rith\u2019s ability to create shields, no doubt the dwelling in which Parisa was kept was under some crazy-ass mist. The grid would have to search for an anomaly, something nonspecific and unidentifiable\u2014in other words, something vague that didn\u2019t belong.</p> <p>But what were a few more days after searching for three long months and finding nothing? Yeah, he could wait for the grid to uncover an anomaly.</p><p>He closed his eyes. He took a long, long moment to offer thanks to the Creator, lifting his face to the heavens, his heart almost floating in a chest that had been constricted from the moment when the hologram of Parisa had disintegrated in front of his eyes.</p><p>He felt the pretty-boy\u2019s life fading. He withdrew from his mind. The death vamp vomited blood, a lot of it.</p><p>Medichi sat down beside the creature that had once been a proper vampire youth. He put his hand on his shoulder, and kept it there. His touch calmed the shaking.</p><p>Medichi lowered his head to his knees. He despised what the death vamp had done, but he\u2019d also seen that as a young ascender, a Twoling born on Second Earth, he\u2019d tried dying blood on a dare, offered not from a body but from a goblet at a party. He\u2019d been promised no ill effects, just pleasure. Well, pleasure he\u2019d gotten, but he\u2019d also gotten about three centuries of addiction, killing, despair, and no way back from a stupid teenage mistake. He hated all this shit, the treachery of Greaves and his forces, the resulting mortal victims. Still Medichi remained close to the vampire, as much a victim as those he\u2019d killed, until he felt the final breath.</p><p>Stillness overcame the broken body. Medichi looked up. How far away the rim of the canyon seemed. The rush of water was loud in his ears and dominated his impression of the space. Above, complete silence. Below, all this rushing noise.</p><p>With his hand still on the death vampire, he repeated the words that had been his ritual for centuries. He was a man of faith if not a believer in structured religion, so in certain situations, like this one, he did what he thought was right, even necessary.</p><p>He looked at the now empty shell beside him and spoke against the hurtling water: \u201cMay the Great Spirit help you atone for these your terrible sins. May you be forgiven and may you find peace in the arms of the Creator. Amen.\u201d</p> <p>He released a heavy sigh.</p><p>So much death in their ascended dimension when it wasn\u2019t necessary. Vampires were essentially immortal, or had the potential to live forever. But the addictive nature of dying blood, which seduced every death vampire who partook, made it necessary to kill mortals and ascenders alike for more.</p><p>In turn, Commander Greaves, bent on the domination of two worlds, used dying blood as one of his weapons. He not only encouraged the creation of death vampires, but built armies made up of them. There were even rumors that he provided the blood not just to his armies but to those High Administrators around the globe that he\u2019d persuaded to join his faction.</p><p>Medichi had no qualms about being the sword of justice.</p><p>He left forgiveness to God.</p><p>Still sitting, he pulled his phone from the pocket of his black leather battle kilt and held it to his ear. He thumbed it. The phone was the size of a credit card and was a direct line to Central. For all other calls, he had a BlackBerry.</p><p>\u201cHey, Warrior Medichi,\u201d Carla said. \u201cDid you get him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got him.\u201d</p><p>He heard a whoop and a shout and then Medichi smiled. Thank God for the women at Central. They were chosen for their calm tempers and positive outlooks even in the face of nightly death. They also did cleanup through a sophisticated inter-dimensional process that was more technology than preternatural power.</p><p>\u201cHas Jeannie gone home for the day?\u201d Carla and Jeannie overlapped their schedules. Carla had the day shift, while her best friend, Jeannie, had the night shift. The women were gold and served seven days and nights a week, just like the Warriors of the Blood.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Carla said. \u201cI kicked her out an hour ago. She has a brunch this morning with a Militia Warrior.\u201d</p><p>He bristled. As a Warrior of the Blood, his protective instincts were always in overdrive, even where Jeannie and Carla were concerned. The Militia Warriors, though less powerful than the elite Warriors of the Blood, were still strong hombres and carried a shitload of testosterone in their own right. \u201cIs he treating her good?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d better if he wants to stay alive,\u201d Carla responded, but she was chuckling. \u201cHey, don\u2019t worry. Not only can Jeannie handle herself after so many centuries as a vampire, but our Militia boys aren\u2019t stupid. They know the Warriors of the Blood would be all over their asses if either of us got hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d he cried, but more softly he added, \u201cYou still dating your man?\u201d</p><p>She giggled then sighed.</p><p>\u201cI take that as a yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d she cooed. \u201cAlmost as pretty as you.\u201d</p><p>Medichi found himself smiling all over again even though he was exhausted and had a torn-up and really dead pretty-boy beside him. Yeah, this was his life, finding small measures of comfort while sitting next to a corpse.</p><p>\u201cI need a little cleanup action,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI see him. What a mess. Oh, God, look at those wings.\u201d In recent months, satellite imaging had enhanced the grid\u2019s capacity as well. Medichi wondered if Carla could see the scars laced down his back, although right now his hair hung almost to his waist. Well, if she\u2019d seen his scars anytime in the last three months, she hadn\u2019t said anything. One more reason to love her. \u201cClose your peepers.\u201d</p><p>Medichi let his eyelids fall. Damn, he was tired, because it felt good to shut down like this, on a wet rock in the middle of the Colorado River. \u201cReady,\u201d he murmured into his phone.</p><p>He saw the flash of light behind his lids. He felt the air move beside him. He opened his eyes. The death vamp was gone as well as any traces of blood, bone, or other feathered debris. \u201cClean as a whistle as usual, Carla. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve been after this death vamp for weeks. Please tell me you have some news for me? Anything I can use to find our girl?\u201d</p><p>Our girl. That\u2019s why he loved the Central staff. They made everything feel like a team effort; no matter what you went through, you had backup.</p><p>Relief flowed through him again, like a cool breeze on a hot day. \u201cActually, I have the best news.\u201d He explained getting inside the pretty-boy\u2019s head and finding the shrouded dwelling.</p><p>Carla squealed several times in the telling. He could hear her tapping on her keyboard. \u201cI\u2019m reconfiguring the grid to Burma, Second Earth, even as we speak. If I find so much as a flyspeck out of place I\u2019ll call you. Just remember that this will probably take two or three days. Jesus, this country is so frigging big. Did you know it\u2019s the size of Texas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what you can do,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIf we were looking for a power signature, it would be different, but we\u2019ve already searched both worlds and didn\u2019t find one, so expect some near-misses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. Trust me. I know the drill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do but oh, how I want this to go fast and it just can\u2019t but holy shit\u2014\u201d Carla rarely used profanity. \u201cBurma, Second Earth. This is fantastic news. Have a limoncello on me. Now head home, Warrior, and for the Creator\u2019s sake, get some sleep. You\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>Aw, hell. Carla was such a sweetheart. \u201cCan\u2019t. Not yet. I\u2019m heading over to the Cave. Some of the brothers might still be there having their morning bullshit session, and I\u2019ll want to talk to Thorne. I\u2019ll let him know about the shift in grid coordinates.\u201d Thorne was in charge of the Warriors of the Blood, including all communications with Central. But once the warriors had checked in from a night of battling, searching for Parisa took priority.</p><p>Medichi wasn\u2019t alone in his despair. All the warriors had been wrecked by a disappearance on their watch. If it could happen to Medichi, it could happen to any of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carla\u2019s voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll let us know about ... well, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now give me a second to reconfigure the grid.\u201d The tapping started.</p> <p>He sighed as his heart pulled into a hard knot.</p><p>Every twenty-four hours he had contact with Parisa, and everyone knew it. What they didn\u2019t know was the personal way in which it happened. And like hell would he ever reveal that truth, because it was like having phone sex without the phone. Once a day, and always in the morning after he\u2019d battled all night, he\u2019d go home, shower up, and sit on the side of his bed. That\u2019s when he\u2019d hear Parisa\u2019s voice in his head, only once, Antony. A sweet telepathic whisper that fired his heart and kept hope alive.</p><p>That was the only form of communication he had with her. She wasn\u2019t even ascended, so not all of her powers were developed. And for whatever reason, even though she was a mortal with wings, she couldn\u2019t communicate with her mind, at least not yet.</p><p>Despite this critical lack, she had another preternatural power that was considered a Third Earth or third dimension ability\u2014that voyeur\u2019s window she could open. If she was indeed in Burma, she was halfway around the globe when she sent her single telepathic communication. It would be night to his day.</p><p>If that were true, then she had enormous telepathic capacity. She just hadn\u2019t learned how to use it yet.</p> <p>Whatever.</p><p>It still meant that in half an hour or so, he would go home, get ready for bed, and discover whether his woman was still alive.</p><p>His heart tightened a little more. He both dreaded and longed for the experience because honest to God he didn\u2019t know what he would do if he didn\u2019t hear her say his name today within the depths of his mind. If he thought for even a minute that she might be dead, he\u2019d go mad.</p><p>Carla\u2019s voice came back on the line. \u201cThe grid\u2019s on Burma, Warrior, and you\u2019re in my prayers.\u201d</p><p>His eyes burned. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said, but his voice sounded hoarse. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p> <p>He thumbed his phone and with a thought, folded to his villa to change out of his kilt and weapons harness. He still hadn\u2019t revealed his scars to his brothers. Only Marcus knew that his back was covered in a basket weave of silver scar tissue, and he\u2019d promised his silence. There was no way he was going to the Cave to meet with the brothers while wearing only a kilt and a weapons harness. The latter, though broad enough in the front to support two daggers, had only a heavy narrow strip of black leather running down his spine.</p><p>Shit. He knew the time had come to reveal this hard truth about what had happened to him and to his family thirteen centuries ago, just before his ascension. But he dreaded speaking about the why of his scars. Dreaded letting anyone get that close to him.</p><p>Well, he wasn\u2019t ready to talk just yet.</p><p>He changed into his usual: a black tee, black cargoes, and steel-toed boots. He thought the thought and headed to the Cave.</p><p>Parisa Lovejoy had run out of time.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know the how or why of it, but something in Rith Do\u2019onwa\u2019s demeanor toward her had darkened. When she was around him now, shivers chased down her neck and shoulders.</p><p>She stood outside on the lawn, barefoot, a few feet away from the enormous tamarind tree in Rith\u2019s large side yard. She stared up at the double dome of mist and as usual, was amazed.</p><p>She could see both layers. The exterior dome was the usual fine crochet-like composite, but the interior swirled in beautiful colors of aquamarine, sea green, blue, and gray ... magnificent. The mist kept the master\u2019s home invisible to Central\u2019s electronic surveillance grid. She had learned at least that much in the three months she\u2019d been held captive: The Warriors of the Blood couldn\u2019t find her because Rith had concealed her location under not one but two powerful domes of mist.</p> <p>Two exquisite domes that meant she couldn\u2019t count on a rescue.</p><p>Yesterday, Rith had treated her with his usual indifference, but when she had awakened this morning and met him over the breakfast table, displeasure, perhaps even hatred, had rolled from him, a living writhing thing. And just like that she knew she had run out of time. Whatever mantle of grace had kept her safe in his home these past three months had just been obliterated.</p><p>She had to escape. She just didn\u2019t know how to get the job done.</p><p>She had struggled with the question all day. Now night had fallen and she had a decision to make. Should she take flight and bust through the double dome of mist that protected the property, or should she take her chances and stay put? She knew that the nature of mist would allow her to easily reach the sky beyond, but her flight skills were untested. It was one thing to practice in the gentle environment of the garden protected by the mist, but another to be in the open air where unpredictable wind shears could turn her upside down.</p><p>She truly didn\u2019t know what to do\u2014but just in case inspiration struck at the last moment, she had begged for one last flight before bed.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected Rith to allow it. He kept a very strict schedule for her throughout any given day. To her surprise, however, he\u2019d agreed to her request. Given his attitude toward her, she\u2019d found his acquiescence suspect.</p><p>As she stared up into the inner domes, swirling with a pattern of blue-green mist, her heart hammered in her chest. Should she take her chances and fly through both domes, right here, right now?</p><p>Even as the thought entered her mind, she felt tendrils reaching toward her, whispering for her to do it, to go, to leave, to break through.</p><p>She looked around. Was she hearing Antony at long last? Had he found her? Was he encouraging her to leave? Did he wait for her beyond the mist?</p><p>She trembled. She wanted to leave. Oh, how she wanted to leave. More than anything in the world, she longed to see Warrior Medichi.</p><p>Again, the whispers drifted over her: Go, leave, run away, now.</p><p>Antony, she sent from her mind. Nothing returned to her.</p><p>Was it possible he had found a way to reach her telepathically?</p><p>She wore a long halter gown of beautiful amethyst silk, the same color as her eyes. From the beginning, Rith had kept her in beautiful clothes. But in this case, the halter meant that her back was bare and she could mount her wings. She knew that if she took to the skies she might get her legs tangled up in the skirting, but she believed Rith had wanted her hampered. Rith always had a reason for every action. He was the most careful man, or rather vampire, she had ever known.</p><p>She stepped farther away from the enormous tamarind tree, away from Rith, away from his three Burmese slaves who had come to watch the show. The women loved to watch her fly. As far as she knew, none of them had wings\u2014yet they\u2019d been ascended for centuries. She found the absence of wings very strange for second dimension vampires, unless of course Rith had found a way to prevent them from gaining normal flight capability.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>Rith was a monster, a quiet, dedicated, harmless-looking monster. He had ways of hurting her, and probably his slaves, that left no marks: His torture skills involved the piercing of the mind with his superior mental power. If she escaped his home tonight and he caught her, at the very least he would fill her mind with the equivalent of whirling knives. At the most, he would find an excuse to take her life.</p><p>So what was she to do? Take her chances and attempt to escape the mist or remain and risk staying one more night in the power of a man who now radiated a desire to kill her?</p><p>Her arms trembled as she prepared to mount her wings. She closed her eyes and drew in a deep breath, forcing herself to relax, an exercise that required a full minute of firm concentration.</p><p>She took a final deep cleansing breath, leaned forward slightly with her hands on her waist, then released her wings. She couldn\u2019t hold back the moan of pleasure. Her nipples drew into hard beads. For whatever reason, mounting her wings had always been for her an experience akin to sexual release.</p><p>The feathers flew in perfect balance through the small weeping apertures in her back and at the exact same moment joined with the mesh superstructure that also emerged and held the incomprehensible mass together. She would never understand how her body produced the glory that was her wings, but then how could she open the windows of her preternatural voyeurism and see what others were doing? How could the ascended vampire dematerialize? How did Rith create the extraordinary mist that appeared in visible domes over his home? Power then more power.</p><p>These were the mysteries of her world, her new world, the world of ascension.</p><p>She moved in a slow circle, wafting her wings up and down, practicing the combined movements of her back, her arms, and her wings. She was new to flight, having flown for the first time three months ago, though she\u2019d had her wings over a year before that. Her friend Havily Morgan, an ascended vampire, had been teaching her to fly before the abduction. In one early session, Parisa had almost gotten herself killed by launching into the air without enough training, but Havily had pulled on her feet and brought her out of a deadly forward roll.</p><p>Because she was alone here in her garden prison, all her practice had been done with great care. She feared falling and breaking her wings more than anything. She didn\u2019t heal at lightning speed like normal vampires did, which was part of the reason she feared attempting an unsupported escape. One huge gust of wind would probably throw her into an uncontrolled spin or roll; she could easily fall to the ground. In her mortal state, she didn\u2019t want to think what that would feel like. She could end up paralyzed or even dead.</p><p>Yeah, this really wasn\u2019t a simple decision.</p><p>She looked up into the swirling dome and drew her wings back. She launched into the air, brought her wings forward, caught air, and began to fly. A collective gasp came from the three women on the porch. She flapped her wings and smiled. She understood their delight. She had seen Havily fly. It was a sight to behold.</p><p>She had seen all the Warriors of the Blood in flight at one time or another, all except Antony, of course. She knew the reason why he didn\u2019t mount his wings. She had voyeured him for over a year, so she had seen the secret he kept hidden from those closest to him. What she didn\u2019t know was the why of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Antony.</p><p>Now she was here, struggling to find a way to escape. The truth was, even if she did escape she still didn\u2019t know which path she would choose: to stay on Mortal Earth or ascend.</p><p>She tilted her wings slightly to the left and began a turn. She had to keep her movements small or she would start a rolling maneuver from which she would have a hard time recovering. Maybe impossible.</p> <p>Her heart pounded as she approached the upper reaches. She flew in an arc and raised her arm straight over her head, carefully controlling the shape of her right wing as she dragged her fingers through the blue-green mist. A wonderful ripple of power flowed up her arm. The women below applauded since the dome reacted to these movements by swirling in enormous patterns to reconfigure over and over again, an oversized kaleidoscope.</p><p>Parisa dove toward the ground. Yes, her skills had improved. The women gasped again but at the last moment, she fluffed her wings into parachute position, brought her feet up, and floated to earth. She touched her toes to the grass, bent her knees, drew her wings close to her body, then once more launched upward.</p><p>The whispering grew louder from deep within her mind. Yes, leave now. Make your escape.</p><p>Antony? she sent, hoping. Was her guardian warrior communicating with her? The whispers were so faint, she couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>Antony?</p> <p>But nothing returned.</p><p>She drew close to the top of the tamarind tree and once more assumed the parachute position. This time she stared down at Rith. He had moved to the edge of the porch, his fists clenched at his sides, his eyes dark and glittering as he stared up at her. She wafted her wings slowly to maintain altitude.</p><p>She met his gaze.</p><p>Fly through the mist. Hurry. Escape now!</p><p>Then she knew and her heart plummeted. She wasn\u2019t hearing Antony\u2019s whispers at all. Rith was in her mind. These were his words, his commands, and he had but one purpose\u2014he wanted her to make a run for it. If she did, she knew she would die.</p><p>She understood now that though Rith wanted her dead, he couldn\u2019t kill her outright. He must be under orders to keep her alive, which meant he\u2019d have to make her death look like an accident. His master, Commander Greaves, was the one truly in charge of her. Rith was just her keeper.</p> <p>What better way to create an accident than to hurt her high in the air, beyond the mist, and send her into a deadly spin?</p><p>Yet what exactly had changed for Rith that he now wished for her death?</p><p>Her heart sank farther, a rock dropping into a pond. She turned slowly and wafted her wings, gliding down to the lawn below. She didn\u2019t look at him or the women. Once she felt the grass beneath her feet, she closed her eyes and retracted her wings.</p><p>She ignored Rith as she made her way onto the porch then into the house. The female servants followed her.</p><p>Time for bed.</p><p>She showered and slid on a soft white cotton nightgown trimmed with lavender lace. Yes, everything of the finest quality had been provided for her since the first day of her captivity.</p><p>The women put her to bed because that was one of their duties, even though she was perfectly capable of pulling back the patchwork silk coverlet and sliding between the sheets all by herself. Ridiculous. But Rith insisted that they tuck her in, like a child, every night, which was of course more about control than kindness. Shortly after her arrival, she\u2019d become aware that the women were as much captives as she was. To her knowledge, they never left the house, and they were forced to sleep on mats in the hall outside Parisa\u2019s bedroom. It sickened her.</p><p>Once she was alone in her bed and she could hear the women rustling on their mats, she glanced at the clock on her bedside table. The hour was too early for her to voyeur Warrior Medichi. He would not come to her for at least half an hour, perhaps more.</p> <p>Over the course of three months, he had developed a routine of hunting down rogue death vampires on Mortal Earth\u2014but not until after dawn. He did this searching for information about Rith and following leads to places she might be held captive. But he couldn\u2019t engage in these solo hunts until after a night of battling death vampires at one of the Mortal Earth Borderlands.</p><p>Her guardian warrior was utterly exhausted. The only contact she had with him occurred when he\u2019d completed his final runs to Mortal Earth in pursuit of whatever leads he\u2019d garnered the previous afternoon. He rarely slept, just a four-or five-hour block that crossed the noon hour. The afternoons prior to his night\u2019s usual work were spent pursuing rumors of rogue vampire lairs on Mortal Earth.</p><p>She turned on her side and stared at the slim brass Buddha on the table near the door to her private bathroom. She sighed heavily. She opened her voyeur\u2019s window, then thought of Antony. When she saw that he was in conference with Warrior Thorne, she closed the window quickly. She had set certain rules for herself in order to preserve her sanity. She didn\u2019t voyeur anyone but Antony, and only when she could be with him in the privacy of his bedroom.</p><p>So she waited. Every fifteen minutes, she opened her window again, until she saw him at last showered, naked, and sitting on the side of his bed, waiting for her.</p><p>Antony had been her Guardian of Ascension, assigned to protect her during her rite of ascension to Second Earth. Not everyone who began a rite of ascension needed a guardian, but she had been a mortal-with-wings, something that had apparently happened only once before on Mortal Earth.</p><p>Though she had been voyeuring him the entire year preceding her rite and knew what he looked like, meeting him for the first time had been an extraordinary experience. She had been standing in the kitchen of his villa, chatting with Havily. He had appeared in the doorway, like a god, dripping wet from the shower, his muscled chest on display, and only a black towel around his hips.</p><p>The towel had been completely inadequate to disguise that he\u2019d been in a full state of arousal. His scent, a beautiful, musky, sage fragrance, had already been heavy in the house, but at that moment clouds of sage had billowed toward her. As always, the scent had teased every tender place of her body to a ripeness she\u2019d never experienced before. Through her voyeurs, she had been completely attracted to him, but standing in the same room her attraction had turned into an inferno of pure sexual need and desire.</p><p>Then he had done the unthinkable: He\u2019d dropped the towel. Her gaze had wasted no time in sliding down his chest, down and down, until her eyes found what she needed. She remembered putting her fingers to her neck and stroking her vein. In her voyeurs she had seen him take women into the booths at the Blood and Bite, the club the Warriors used for R&amp;R. She\u2019d been just voyeur enough to stay and watch as well, which meant she\u2019d seen him take blood.</p><p>She had wanted nothing more, standing there in that kitchen, than to take Antony somewhere private and give him what he needed.</p><p>Havily, bless her, had rescued the situation. Marcus, too, since he\u2019d arrived and punched Antony in the jaw with a solid right hook. Parisa had wanted to go to him, but Havily had taken her outside until she could calm down and think things through.</p><p>She\u2019d done a lot of thinking over the next few days, while death vampires were after her. She\u2019d also seen the war up close, and it had frightened her. The whole experience, however, had led her to believe that despite her insane attraction to Antony, despite the tender feelings he aroused in her, she didn\u2019t want to complete her ascension. She wanted to return to her Mortal Earth world, to her cloistered job as a librarian, to her solitary life, to peace and serenity.</p><p>She knew Antony would be sad, even angry that she\u2019d decided against ascension, but her choice was made. She\u2019d just been about to tell him when Rith intervened and changed everything.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help the tears that leaked from her eyes, slid over the bridge of her nose, joined with more tears, and splashed into the hair on the side of her head. At least she would be with him again soon, but she couldn\u2019t even share with him that when it was morning for him it was evening for her. Surely he could have found her by now if he\u2019d had that one scrap of information.</p><p>And right now, she wished more than anything that she could tell him of her present danger, ask for his advice, his help, anything.</p><p>Oh, God, would she even be alive by morning?</p><p>But no matter how hard she tried to create a telepathic link with Antony, she simply couldn\u2019t. Only at the point of release, when she would touch herself and experience an orgasm, could she whisper his name in her mind and know that he heard.</p><p>She had tried countless ways to talk to Antony short of standing on her head. She had attempted to scream his name inside her head, scream it aloud and in her head at the same time, whisper his name, cry out his name when she was having an orgasm all by herself. Nothing worked. Only in this one special moment, when they connected through her voyeur\u2019s window, could he hear her, and then only once. Everything else had failed.</p><p>She hated that she was so weak in this way. She hated that she was a prisoner. She hated that she still knew so little about ascended life and her powers. The only thing she had accomplished in three months was improving her flight.</p><p>Be wise and do not judge what creates love for others, since shoes often travel to unsuspecting feet.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Rith was not an original thinker. He never had been. For that reason he relied on the future streams to guide him, all those beautiful ribbons of light that prophesied forthcoming events.</p><p>He reclined on the dark blue velvet chaise-longue in his small private room adjacent to his office. He clasped his hands loosely over his stomach. He stared at the mahogany ceiling. His facial muscles felt strange and lax, almost burdened, and his throat was tight.</p><p>He\u2019d just emerged from the future streams and was devastated all over again. The same prophecy from last night had returned even stronger just moments ago, while the shower had been running and Parisa had been going through her nightly ritual.</p><p>Parisa Lovejoy was to share a bond with Commander Greaves.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be true. It just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Parisa\u2019s unspecified yet critical role in the war against the Commander had already been foretold numerous times. Rith had recommended her death to his master over and over, but for whatever incomprehensible reason, Greaves tended to play fast and loose with Seers\u2019 prophecies. He couldn\u2019t be entirely faulted for this, since the prophecies didn\u2019t always come to pass. And Greaves preferred to work every angle of a prophecy before acting, and often succeeded in his rather daring ventures. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But where the mortal-with-wings was concerned, the Seers\u2019 predictions had been constant, and increasing in intensity in recent days. Rith had developed a sense of near-panic where Parisa was concerned. He was, himself, a man of power, perhaps more than the Commander realized, and of late he had developed a real knowing about just how dangerous Parisa was both to himself and to the Commander. He had several times urged Greaves in the proper direction, to get rid of the woman, but the Commander would not be moved.</p><p>However, even with all Rith\u2019s knowing, even with the numerous prophecies and their intensity, what had finally pushed Rith over the edge was this latest future stream about a bond-forging event. A sense of deep despair and of jealousy now devoured Rith whole. He could forgive the predictions about Parisa\u2019s danger to the Coming Order\u2014but not that she would become so intimately connected to his master.</p><p>He could not imagine, even on a prophetic level, how Greaves could allow this travesty when even he, Rith Do\u2019onwa, the master\u2019s most favored servant, did not have such a bond.</p> <p>Earlier, when Parisa had asked to fly one last time before nightfall, he saw an opportunity to kill her himself. If she left his artfully crafted domes of mist, he could follow after her and cause a most unfortunate but very fatal accident.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t left. She had floated above the tamarind tree and somehow read his mind. So now she was safe and secure in her bed and he had no means of taking her life.</p><p>Were all his centuries of service to be thus rewarded?</p><p>He knew only one thing: He must prevent this bond.</p><p>He loved Greaves as no one could love him. Greaves was his master; he would lay down his life for him. He wanted a bond, a link with the Commander. He deserved such a bond. Why should Parisa be allowed to forge one?</p> <p>It was obscene.</p><p>Rith took deep breaths. He had to focus. He must find a way to counteract the event.</p><p>As he breathed, his mind settled. After a few minutes, his fierce jealousy abated.</p><p>He focused on the ribbons of light. Whenever a change in destiny was imminent, ribbons would glow. As he mentally reviewed all the critical people involved in the Coming Order, on both sides of the equation, he found a burnished bronze ribbon that grew so brilliant with light, even though his eyes were closed he felt the light burned through his eyelids.</p><p>He mentally picked up the ribbon, which belonged to Warrior Medichi. He slid his mind along the future streams and came to an image that caused his heart to seize, in part because of the nature of the vision but also due to its location. He saw the warrior trapped in a dark space, one made of oversized terra-cotta bricks. He knew this particular Second Earth temple in Bengal Two. He had built it himself, modeled on Mortal Earth structures, but with a very convenient basement designed just for his purposes.</p><p>He smiled now. Even though he wanted the mortal-with-wings dead, the sure knowledge that one day very soon he would have within his power a Warrior of the Blood changed everything. If the Creator was good and shined his favor upon Rith, he would fulfill this prophecy. Perhaps then his standing with Greaves would increase to include a forged bond as well.</p> <p>Was Parisa still alive?</p><p>Medichi sat on the side of his bed, sleep-deprived and on edge. He was in the master suite of his villa, a retreat that had become a prison because the woman meant for him was missing ... gone ... taken. But in a few minutes, he would know if she still lived: She would come to him as she always did at this hour.</p><p>He\u2019d been to the Cave, arriving later than usual, so that only Thorne remained. Thorne had been slumped on a stool in front of the bar, a bottle of Ketel One at the ready, his fingers sliding up and down a full tumbler, his gaze fixed on nothing in particular. Medichi had told him of the death vampire at the Grand Canyon and what he\u2019d learned in the pretty-boy\u2019s mind.</p><p>The news had brought a little life into Thorne\u2019s red-rimmed hazel eyes. He\u2019d even smiled and clapped Medichi on the shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her and don\u2019t worry, Carla will keep me up to speed. Jeannie, as well, when she comes on later today.\u201d</p><p>Medichi had nodded.</p><p>Thorne had nodded.</p><p>Medichi had headed home and now here he was, sitting on the side of his bed, ready to complete his morning ritual, ready to hear Parisa\u2019s voice in his head once again, ready to be assured that she was still alive.</p><p>Oh, God, please let her be alive.</p> <p>He\u2019d just showered and his long hair dripped at the ends, forming rivulets that tracked down his abdomen and down his back. He loosed the black towel from around his waist and laid it in a heavy loop across his knees.</p><p>At least he had privacy. The first time this had happened was three days after Parisa\u2019s abduction. Both Havily and Marcus still lived in his villa. They were his closest friends, his strongest support, but that day Hav had brought tangerines home from the market without thinking what it would do to him, without remembering that for Medichi, Parisa smelled of tangerines, her special scent meant only for him. For Parisa, Medichi smelled of sage.</p><p>Havily should have known better. For her, Marcus\u2019s special scent was like earthy grasses and fennel combined.</p><p>But Havily hadn\u2019t remembered, and Medichi had been left aroused as hell with nowhere to go. Naturally, he\u2019d complained of not feeling well and had retired to his suite of rooms at the south end of the villa.</p><p>The tangerines had acted as an aphrodisiac. He hadn\u2019t wanted to pleasure himself but that was the curse of his situation: Because of the breh-hedden, the scent of tangerines meant Parisa, and Parisa meant pure hot-blooded sex.</p><p>Damn the breh-hedden. He\u2019d been struck down the moment he\u2019d smelled Parisa\u2019s lovely pheromone-riddled tangerine scent.</p><p>The breh-hedden was a terrible mate-bonding ritual that occurred only between preternaturally powerful women and Warriors of the Blood. Before Warrior Kerrick had found his breh in Alison Wells, all the warriors had thought the ritual a myth. Then Marcus had bonded with Havily in exactly the same way. No more myth. Just hard agonizing reality.</p><p>So, yeah, the breh-hedden was alive and well among the Warriors of the Blood.</p><p>God, how he loved the smell of tangerines.</p><p>So it was that Medichi had pleasured himself. And for whatever reasons, at that same moment Parisa had found him with her voyeur\u2019s window. But only when he\u2019d released, his fist pumping hard, had he heard her beautiful voice in his head, a soft, melodic Antony. Several times before the abduction, he thought he\u2019d heard her voice in his head, the emergence of her telepathic ability. So when he heard the sound again, he knew he had not been mistaken: He had heard her voice, and she was alive.</p><p>He\u2019d rejoiced. He\u2019d cried out. He\u2019d wept because that\u2019s when he\u2019d felt her presence, very faint but very real and he knew she was still alive. He\u2019d spoken to her for an hour afterward, even though she still couldn\u2019t communicate mind-to-mind with him. He\u2019d talked and talked about all that they were doing to try to find her, he encouraged her to stay alive, he promised her he\u2019d never stop looking for her. He\u2019d only stopped talking when he felt her drift away and finally end the communication.</p><p>From that moment until now, he\u2019d repeated the ritual with her every morning after hunting down rogue death vampires. He would return to the villa, shower, and ready himself to meet his woman.</p><p>Right now, with the towel looped over his lap, only one question was in his mind: Would he hear her voice, feel her presence today? Was his woman still alive?</p><p>Jesus, his fingers trembled around the small silver bowl he held in his hands. In it, nine small Satsuma tangerines were piled one atop another, tempting him with the forbidden as though he stared at the apple from the Garden of Eden.</p><p>Time to get on with his morning ritual. He\u2019d never been one to limit himself to the use of his fist. If he needed a fuck, he went out and got one. He\u2019d worn out a lot of velvet in the booths at the Blood and Bite getting the release he needed. Mortal women flocked to the vampire club every night and kept the warriors of Second Earth satisfied\u2014both the Militia Warriors and the Warriors of the Blood. The club had been designed just for that purpose and even sanctioned by Madame Endelle, the Supreme High Administrator of all Second Earth. But from the moment he\u2019d met Parisa, the club had lost all appeal.</p><p>He set the bowl on his nightstand. Holding one tangerine in his hand, he plunged his thumb hard into the center, breaking the loose skin apart. He pulled the skin back. Juice flowed. He kept peeling until the wedges were exposed. He thrust his thumb into the middle once more, breaking up the wedges. More juice.</p><p>He shuddered. The smell penetrated his brain, and his eyes rolled back in his head. Yes, he was hard. What else would he be? From the moment he had first caught Parisa\u2019s scent, the one thing he could count on was a fierce demanding erection when she was near.</p><p>The hairs on the nape of his neck rose and relief poured through him.</p><p>Now he felt her. Yes. He closed his eyes. He could tell she was near, just a strange rippling vibration along his back, now across his shoulders, now over his neck. She was here.</p><p>The terrible tension inside his chest, the frightful worry that she was dead, eased. For the first time in twenty-four hours he could breathe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said aloud. \u201cI\u2019m ready for you.\u201d</p><p>He put his mouth to the tangerine, suckled the juice, and groaned.</p><p>Parisa\u2019s heart ached, a low throb deep in her chest, a pain that had become so familiar it was now a comfort.</p><p>She still lay on her side on her large four-poster bed, the window of her preternatural voyeurism open.</p><p>She could see Antony now. Like a good director, she could move her window to any position she desired. Tonight, thirteen-plus hours ahead of him, she panned her vision so that she could face him, as though she were standing right in front of him.</p><p>She drew a ragged breath as though her throat had shriveled. Yes, he was handsome\u2014strong cheekbones and a sharp angled jaw\u2014but to her he would always be beautiful. His hair was black, thick, straight, and long, almost to his waist now. He\u2019d showered and his hair was damp, even dripping in spots. He took long, steaming showers after a night of battle. Many times she arrived early enough to watch him in the shower. He was lean and muscular, all warrior. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yes, so beautiful.</p><p>She moved closer, until she was a few inches from his face. She watched his tongue nestle within the tangerine, making small sucking noises. She knew that he was imagining his tongue inside her body. He\u2019d told her that as well. Desire was too small a word for what she felt for this man, this warrior. She would be the tangerine for him and he could devour her.</p><p>Tears rolled down her cheeks as her need for him grew, her thighs trembling. She had to keep her voice quiet or the servants would descend on her.</p> <p>She leaned in and kissed the air an inch or two away from him. He groaned, as though feeling how close she was. She watched his hand glide lower, sliding down his chest. She pulled the window back to watch. His abs were rippling, taut, rolling hard mounds she wanted to touch, to lick, to savor. His forefinger touched the narrow erotic line of hair that led down. Lower. Lower.</p><p>In her mind she spoke to him. Yes, touch yourself for me. I\u2019m here. I want you to know pleasure. Antony, hear me.</p><p>His groans thickened the air. With one hand he held the tangerine to his mouth, his tongue working feverishly. With his other hand he held himself in a firm grip, pumping now. His hips moved, jerking forward.</p><p>She panted and the core of her spasmed. She rolled onto her stomach and slid her hand between her legs. She pushed, pulled, pressed. Her hips bucked off the mattress as she watched him. His groans were loud in her ears. She could tell he was close. He opened his mouth, and the groan turned to a shout as he came.</p><p>She came with him, the core of her body rippling and tugging, streaking pleasure up through her tender flesh. She imagined him inside her and the sensation intensified. She withheld the gasps and moans that wanted to erupt for fear the servants would hear. Antony. Antony, sped along the telepathic highway.</p> <p>All movement on his bed ceased, as it always did just at this moment. \u201cI hear you,\u201d he said aloud to the room. \u201cYou said, Antony, Antony. Twice tonight. I feel you near me, Parisa. I know you\u2019re here and I know you\u2019re alive. Thank God.\u201d</p><p>Antony, she cried out with her mind. More tears slipped down her cheeks. She shifted back onto her side, still looking at him. I\u2019m here, she sent. I\u2019m here. If only her telepathy would improve. At least he\u2019d heard his name twice. That was something. Not much, but something.</p><p>\u201cParisa, I have a piece of information about you, but getting some usable results from the grid might take a few days. I found a rogue death vampire in northern Arizona, Mortal Earth, this morning. He knew Rith. He was connected with the underbelly of Mortal Earth rogue life and he knew of you. I searched his memories and discovered that you\u2019re in Burma on Second Earth. Carla\u2019s already moved Central\u2019s grid in place. We know your signature doesn\u2019t show up, so we\u2019re hunting for an anomaly, anything that seems out of the ordinary. I swear I\u2019d dematerialize to Burma and start hunting for you myself, but the damn place is as big as Texas.\u201d</p><p>She heard his frustration but her mind whirled with the new possibility that Central could locate her in a day or two, maybe three. Oh ... God ... yes!</p><p>\u201cIf only you could communicate better telepathically. Can you try? Please try. I heard my name twice tonight. That has to mean something.\u201d</p><p>Her own frustration rose until she was kneeling in bed, beating her fists against her pillows. Had she tried? Only a thousand times. Of course I\u2019ve tried, she sent.</p> <p>\u201cYou can do this. I know you can. If I can feel your presence like this, I know you can talk to me.\u201d He flopped back on the bed and shifted his hips to bring his legs straight out in front of him. His cock lay half thickened on his groin. He was very big and so damn beautiful. She watched tears fill his eyes, spill over, then run down the sides of his face and into his long warrior hair. She moved in close and pretended to touch his hair, run her fingers through it.</p><p>\u201cThe minute we find an anomaly, I will come for you. We\u2019ll all come for you. All the brothers.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m near Mandalay, she sent, but she knew it was useless. She had tried a hundred different ways to communicate, but all he\u2019d ever been able to hear was his name at the moment of her release.</p><p>She had tried different locations as well, moving from room to room while she called his name, changing the time of day, the time of night, beneath the tamarind tree, away from the tree, shouting the words in her head, then calling them softly. Nothing had worked. When she opened her voyeur\u2019s window, that strange preternatural gift she possessed, she could find him anywhere. She just couldn\u2019t communicate her thoughts to him.</p><p>He slid his hands behind his head, his gaze fixed somewhere on the ceiling. \u201cI love that you\u2019re here with me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd I can feel you near.\u201d</p><p>Good. I\u2019m here.</p><p>\u201cDo I disgust you? Please understand, it\u2019s the only time I can hear your voice. I wouldn\u2019t do this otherwise.\u201d</p><p>You could never disgust me. I know you, Antony. I\u2019ve listened to your warrior brothers as well. They speak of you with such respect and they turn to you for advice, for approval. I love your kindness and that you\u2019ve never stopped searching for me.</p> <p>It was almost a conversation.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>\u201cLast night before my tour at the New River Borderland, Jeannie and I spent hours scoping South African Territory for your sign.\u201d He smiled faintly. \u201cNow we know you\u2019re in Burma. It\u2019s hard to stay here\u2014I want to fold right now to Burma. But what good would that do? I\u2019ll wait here, but I don\u2019t have to like it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I told you this but yesterday afternoon, Jean-Pierre and I hit a rogue vampire lair in Mortal Earth Sweden. That\u2019s when we learned about this rogue in fucking Sedona, Mortal Earth. Remember how Thorne has a house in Sedona?\u201d He sighed. \u201cI love talking to you and feeling you close.\u201d</p><p>Me too, she sent.</p><p>\u201cI chased that bastard north all the way to the Grand Canyon. That motherfucker had one set of wings on him\u2014pardon my French or as Jean-Pierre says, my Italian. He\u2019s so funny. He\u2019s been with me every afternoon, hunting beside me. He\u2019s as wrecked as I am. No warrior ever had a better brother. I owe him everything. Do you believe me that I haven\u2019t stopped looking? That I never will?\u201d</p><p>I believe you.</p><p>He sat up suddenly. \u201cYou must do one thing, Parisa. Promise me this, that you\u2019ll stay alive for me. Please ... stay alive.\u201d</p><p>I will try.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t just try, either.\u201d Yep, almost a conversation. \u201cDo whatever you have to do to stay alive, no matter how horrible your current situation. Know this: I will come for you.\u201d</p><p>She moved in close once more, toward his lips. She tilted slightly and pretended to kiss him. He gasped. \u201cWhat did you just do?\u201d</p><p>She moved in again, and kissed him.</p><p>He put his fingers to his lips. \u201cDid you just kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered aloud into her room.</p><p>\u201cParisa. Do it again.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward once more. He stayed very still. She drew back. His eyes opened. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything. If you tried again, I couldn\u2019t feel it.\u201d He flopped back on the bed once more and threw an arm over his forehead. \u201cOh, God, how I miss you. I ache for you.\u201d</p><p>She panned back and looked at the full length of him again. He had a faint dusting of black hair over his pecs angling to his stomach. She loved the distinct line of hair that traveled his lower abdomen, showing the way. His hair was curled over his groin, a healthy animal. His cock was still half erect\u2014it always was so long as she was near, even after he\u2019d come. The same fine black hair covered his legs. She loved the way he looked, so masculine. She had always liked hair on a man. She wanted to sift her fingers through all of it, from his toes, up his legs, around the base of his cock, up that sexy line, over his chest, his arms ... but mostly she wanted her hands in his long warrior hair.</p><p>Long hair meant something to the Warriors of the Blood. In a ritual that went back several millennia, the warriors faced battle by binding their hair in the ritual clasp called the cadroen, symbolizing strength of will and purpose.</p><p>Yes, Antony had told her many things during this time he shared with her. Though he couldn\u2019t hear her, he knew she was listening so he talked.</p><p>Antony\u2019s voice continued softly. \u201cDid I tell you that the first time I used my wings after my ascension, I fell flat on my back? I couldn\u2019t breathe for a good minute, and the pain was almost unbearable. I\u2019d crushed some of the feathers. Three healers worked for hours to put me back together. When the wings are broken like that, you can\u2019t retract them. Remember that when you fly. Be careful.\u201d</p><p>She got very close and rubbed her fingers over his lips. I almost did the same thing. Do you remember? I\u2019d ended up in a forward roll the first time I flew and Havily tugged on my feet and saved me. Later, she told me privately that you\u2019d been watching us. She often shared things even though he couldn\u2019t hear her.</p><p>Havily Morgan had been a good friend to her and had saved her life more than once during the short time she\u2019d known her. She missed Havily. She missed all of them.</p><p>\u201cRemember how you almost crashed that first day flying with Havily? Did you know I was watching you? When you almost fell, I dropped a plate of pasta. I was afraid for you but Havily kept you safe.\u201d</p><p>Oh, why couldn\u2019t he hear her? She pressed a fingers to her lips.</p><p>\u201cI will always be grateful that Havily took care of you that day and taught you so much about flying. I wish I could have been the one but...\u201d</p><p>You never mount your wings in front of anyone.</p><p>\u201c... I never mount my wings except in private. I just can\u2019t. They\u2019d see my back. Marcus knows the truth but I trust him to be discreet.\u201d His chest rose and fell in a heavy sigh. \u201cWhen I ascended and understood how quickly I could heal in my new vampire state, I thought my back would change, but it didn\u2019t. I\u2019m ... scarred, Parisa. Forever.\u201d</p><p>Parisa could tell by the way he whispered the words that whatever had scarred his back had wounded him more deeply in his mind, maybe even in his soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve seen your scars, Antony. Don\u2019t you realize that? How could I be so close to you all these months and not have seen your scars?</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou\u2019ve already seen them, haven\u2019t you? Of course you have. Shit.\u201d He sounded so ashamed.</p><p>She wanted to comfort him, to tell him it didn\u2019t matter, but she couldn\u2019t. All she could do was keep wiping away her tears.</p><p>She was drawn back, deep into her memories of Antony. He had comforted her once, held her while she wept. Three months ago, at the Ambassadors Reception, a bomb had been used in place of fireworks and set the skies afire. Marcus, one of Antony\u2019s best friends, had been severely burned and a death vampire had abducted Havily. Antony had begged Parisa to make use of her voyeur window. The thought of it had been overwhelming to her; she feared what she might find. But Antony had held her and supported her. He\u2019d gotten her through, and as a team they\u2019d brought Havily home.</p> <p>He was still getting her through by being with her every night like this, talking to her, making love with her in this odd but beautiful way.</p><p>Her mind began to drift in and out now. It was past ten o\u2019clock in Burma and Rith roused his household early, at precisely five in the morning. He kept a strict schedule for his servants. Her fatigue was intensified because she was so sad and because, after three months, she wasn\u2019t very hopeful. Rith was a clever vampire. If he even suspected his home was in danger, he\u2019d remove her before anyone had a chance to get to her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting sleepy, aren\u2019t you? I can always tell. It\u2019s as though your presence starts pulsing in waves, going away from me, coming back. Please don\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>He always said that.</p><p>\u201cIf you go, I\u2019ll have to wonder for another twenty-four hours if you\u2019re still alive.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ll be here for you, Antony. I\u2019ll be here. She released a sigh. Sleep claimed her.</p><p>Beloved, take the glass to your lips,</p><p>I will hold your hand</p><p>Drink and be eased.</p><p>Beloved, let the wine of your creation,</p><p>From the vineyards of your soul,</p> <p>Give you peace.</p><p>\u2014Collected Poems, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Medichi felt Parisa depart\u2014or probably fall asleep. It was close to ten o\u2019clock at night for her.</p><p>He rolled onto his side. At some point, the remnants of the tangerine had fallen from his hand and now lay facedown on the bottom sheet. The hunger he knew for Parisa crawled through his belly. Wasn\u2019t this just like the breh-hedden, creating all kinds of irrational behavior. Like sucking tangerines and talking out loud to a woman he couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>But he felt her. Oh, yes, he felt her presence in ripples of power.</p><p>He left his bed and took a second quick shower to clean up. He put fresh clothes on, jeans and a black tee. Havily would be getting ready for work right about now. She and Marcus still inhabited the same room they\u2019d taken over three months ago. Marcus had returned from self-exile on Mortal Earth at that time\u2014but not just to rejoin the Warriors of the Blood. Madame Endelle had appointed him High Administrator of Southwest Desert Two and given him a boatload of authority. He\u2019d been making some kick-ass changes in how Endelle\u2019s administration dealt with her Territory High Administrators around the globe.</p><p>Darian Greaves, self-styled the Commander, had been in the process of turning High Administrators for the past fifteen years at the rate of several a year, each one aligning with his faction against Madame Endelle. If he could turn enough of them, Endelle and her warriors would lose this godawful war once and for all.</p> <p>Marcus had put a stop to that. Not one High Administrator had quit in the past several months. Yeah, that was called progress.</p><p>As for Havily, she\u2019d taken up darkening work part of the night alongside Endelle. Now, there was a shit-job if ever one had been created. In addition, Havily still made a Starbucks run to Mortal Earth for the Warriors of the Blood every morning. She\u2019d meet up with most of them at dawn, bringing hot coffee and pastries and her warm smile. Jean-Pierre called her soeurette, which was French for \u201clittle sister.\u201d That\u2019s what Havily was to all of the Warriors of the Blood, a beloved younger sister.</p><p>Hell, he needed a drink. He left his bedroom suite and headed in the direction of the kitchen. He\u2019d never been much of a drinker, but that had changed in the last several weeks. He\u2019d developed a real taste for limoncello.</p><p>He crossed the long central hall of his villa, the front lawn to his right. After passing two sets of guest suites to his left, he traversed the large formal living room from which the back lawn was visible as a wide expanse. He\u2019d built his beautiful home over two centuries ago.</p><p>He loved the place. But he\u2019d give it all up, plus his entire fucking fortune, to have Parisa back safe and sound.</p><p>He crossed the foyer, then the smaller sitting room next to the dining room. The door to the kitchen was offset to the left so that the kitchen wasn\u2019t visible from either the foyer or any of the main south rooms.</p><p>He made a beeline across the kitchen to the fridge, opened the door, and grabbed the gallon jug of homemade limoncello. He took a glass off the folded linen on the soapstone counter. He always kept a glass handy.</p><p>Making his own limoncello had become part of his routine as well, one of the things that kept him sane. The recipe was simple: sugar, vodka, lemon zest and a lot of waiting.</p><p>He made a new batch every week so he\u2019d never run out. The batches kept getting bigger. Lately, he\u2019d needed more. A lot more. Shit. With this latest news, like hell he\u2019d be able to sleep without being just a little drunk.</p><p>He took the jug to the dining table, but instead of sitting in a chair he moved to the far side closest to the adjacent sitting room, pulled two chairs at angles away from the table, hopped up, and planted his ass on the solid mahogany. He put a foot each on the angled chairs.</p><p>He started to drink.</p><p>He held the now cold glass in his hand. This was the other part of his routine. For a long time he couldn\u2019t understand why Kerrick liked his Maker\u2019s and Thorne guzzled Ketel One. Now he got it. Ordinarily, he preferred a fine Cabernet Sauvignon and his own label suited him just fine, but from the third week of Parisa\u2019s abduction, when it became clear she wouldn\u2019t be headed home anytime soon, he\u2019d needed something a little stronger.</p><p>He brought the glass to his lips and took a sip. His tongue jerked with pleasure. While the tart lemon put sparks in his mouth, the drink began that long oh-so-necessary slide into sleep that only one-hundred-proof could bring.</p><p>It was the waiting that was killing him.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Though he\u2019d finally gotten a serious lead, he still had to wait.</p><p>After his third glass, the numbing began ... but so did the memories. He saw a woman, pregnant with his child, running through their olive grove in ancient Italy. She was laughing, holding her belly. She was five months\u2019 pregnant, showing nicely. He would walk through the Tuscan village, head high, his arm behind her back pulling her gown tight at the waist so that everyone could see what he had put in her, what he cherished. She would rail at him, shoving her fingers in his face and complaining about what a brute he was, how vulgar, how uncivilized. Then she would strut, thrusting her stomach forward as well. Ah, they were both proud. Married five months and five months with child.</p><p>Maria.</p><p>He smiled. Then another memory surfaced, the one that brought a searing pain to his heart, as though it were new and not thirteen centuries old.</p><p>He had died the night that tribesmen from the north had entered his farmhouse, bound him, and whipped his back into a thousand stripes while they raped his beloved wife, killed her, and stole the life of his son. His son. His only son.</p><p>That he knew his child was a boy was one of the first inklings he\u2019d had that he possessed preternatural power. The strong sense of knowing had been on him from the moment of conception. Maria telling him a few weeks later that she was pregnant had been both a confirmation and a warning that his life was about to change.</p><p>The enemy had left Medichi to die, having thrust a sword deep into his stomach. He\u2019d been bleeding out on the floor. But the sight of his wife calling softly to him, reaching out to him with the scarlet of her blood spreading over the white linen of her nightgown, had given birth to his ascended powers.</p><p>The human part of him died that night and the vampire was born. At first he didn\u2019t know what was happening to him. He ascended to Second Earth, appearing first at the Borderland outside of Rome and answering his call to ascension with a hand-blast. Thorne had come to him, majestically floating out of the air in a leather kilt and heavy battle sandals.</p><p>Thorne had been Medichi\u2019s Guardian of Ascension. He\u2019d shared his suffering, eased his pain, shown him what he could do, made him a warrior that very night as together they battled death vampires. Greaves, even back then, had tried hard to make him dead. The bastard had failed.</p><p>After his ascension ceremony, Medichi asked permission of no one, but hunted down every one of his wife and son\u2019s murderers. He knew every face and watched with pleasure as each suffered, bled, and died. Vengeance had been born in him that night, war-like justice he\u2019d meted out every night since, battling a new kind of enemy ... death vampires.</p><p>The clatter of heels on the hardwood of his villa floors brought him back to the present.</p><p>Havily. Shit. He should have already disappeared into his bedroom and taken his limoncello with him. He tensed. He didn\u2019t want her to see him like this. He had a sudden impulse to hide the glass and the gallon jar. Then he relaxed. Who was he kidding? Both Havily and Marcus knew what he was doing. You can\u2019t hide that many lemons, that many bottles of vodka. He shifted on the table and dragged one of the chairs with his foot to bring it closer.</p><p>Marcus\u2019s breh appeared in the doorway and his heart thudded. At one time he\u2019d had a little crush on Havily. Maybe all the warriors had\u2014certainly Luken.</p><p>She looked lovely in her usual Ralph Lauren skirt and silk blouse. Her layered red hair floated around her shoulders. She wore leopard-print heels. His heart swelled with affection. \u201cMorning, Hav. You\u2019re running a little late.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He watched a blush rise on her porcelain cheeks. She was very fair; a little embarrassment went a long way. \u201cWell, you know, Marcus was with you boys last night and since he doesn\u2019t report to the office until the afternoon, he likes me to sleep in with him.\u201d Her blush deepened.</p><p>Medichi looked down. Black hairs darted at weird angles on his feet, especially on his big toes. He nodded but didn\u2019t meet her gaze. \u201cYou\u2019ve been good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been good for me.\u201d Her voice was soft, low, compassionate.</p> <p>Shit. He threw back the rest of the limoncello, almost choking. He huffed a sigh, shoved both chairs back with his feet, and slid off the table to stand in front of her. Suddenly he remembered he had some news. He told her about the death vamp\u2019s revelations, about Parisa and Burma.</p><p>\u201cCan it be true? Will she be coming home soon?\u201d Tears rushed to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d he said. Damn, his throat was tight.</p><p>He opened his arms wide. Havily walked into them then slid her arms around his back and squeezed hard. He felt her chest jump a few times. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, petting her back and trying not to mess up her hair. Havily was so damn stylish. \u201cYou\u2019re going to ruin your makeup if you keep crying.\u201d</p><p>Her chest jerked again, but he was sure it was a laugh this time. She didn\u2019t, however, release him.</p> <p>His throat twisted into a knot. \u201cHave I thanked you and Marcus for staying on at the villa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly every other day.\u201d</p><p>His turn to laugh.</p><p>After a few more seconds, she finally drew back and dabbed carefully beneath her eyes with the backs of her fingers. She glanced at the empty glass. \u201cStill can\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without help.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. No judgment, thank God. She frowned, looked at the floor, wrapped her arms around her stomach.</p> <p>His heart sank again. He felt the question in the air between them. He settled a hand on her shoulder, and she looked up at him. \u201cYes, I felt her again and I heard her call my name. So yes, she\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p><p>She released another heavy sigh. \u201cThank God. If only she could say more to you than just your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all she ever could, you know, even three months ago. Her telepathic abilities just haven\u2019t emerged yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd now, I\u2019m actually feeling sleepy.\u201d</p><p>With the heavy jug in one hand, his glass in the other, he returned to the fridge. He heard the familiar click of her heels as she followed behind. \u201cHow\u2019s the house coming?\u201d he called from over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMarcus had another big fight with the contractor. Imagine that.\u201d Marcus ran a tight ship and his contractor didn\u2019t. Medichi felt an I\u2019m-firing-his-ass coming soon.</p><p>Marcus and Havily were building a home at the foot of South Mountain. They wanted to be near Endelle\u2019s administrative offices, not far from Sky Harbor Airport on Mortal Earth. They were also building in the Pacific Northwest, but that was a getaway property and had nothing to do with their stay at his villa.</p> <p>He put the limoncello away then washed out his glass. Yeah, time to get some sleep.</p><p>Havily stood on the other side of the dark soapstone island. \u201cIf you need anything, Antony\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Just ask.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and her light green eyes sparkled. \u201cYou know where I\u2019ll be.\u201d Besides working with Endelle in the darkening, she also worked at administrative headquarters on special projects. It turned out that for all Havily\u2019s warmth of spirit, she had a temper to rival Endelle\u2019s; some of their fights had gotten so loud and so profane, they\u2019d become legendary. But Havily really wasn\u2019t complaining. She\u2019d never looked happier and somehow in all those blistering fights with the Supreme High Administrator of Second Earth, Havily had made peace with her new job and her new life.</p><p>She nodded, lifted her arm, and vanished.</p><p>Now that she was gone, Medichi planted his hands on the front of the sink and let his shoulders and head slump. Havily meant well. Christ, they all meant well, but the constant support and concern were fire on his nerves and he was getting sick of having to front.</p><p>Moving to the center cupboard, he grabbed a new glass, sixteen ounces this time. He drew the jug of limoncello from the fridge and poured it to the rim. How many was that? Three, four, five? It had to be bad if he\u2019d started losing track.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>He replaced the jug, drank off the top inch, then headed back to his bedroom.</p><p>For the past three months he\u2019d slept maybe three, four hours at a stretch. He kept waking up to nightmares\u2014seeing Parisa but not being able to reach her; seeing her stretched out at his feet, dying, and being unable to save her.</p><p>As he lay in bed now reviewing how he might rescue her, he realized he\u2019d reached the end of one of his ropes\u2014he could no longer remain earthbound when he fought. He\u2019d been going solo and battling death vampires in the air for months on his morning searches, but he still hadn\u2019t let any of the warriors see him mount his wings, or see the scars on his back. Only Marcus.</p><p>So, yeah, shit. After thirteen centuries he was going to have to reveal the truth to his brother warriors. And it would be tonight.</p><p>At midnight, Geneva time, Darian Greaves was in his penthouse, sitting up in bed, his HP on his lap as he read emails from Rith. With ambitions to take over two worlds, he kept his plans simple: He built armies of death vampires, and he turned High Administrators by appealing to their greed. When his army was big enough and when he \u201cowned\u201d a majority of Territories around the globe, he\u2019d simply push Madame Endelle out of her office and get on with things.</p><p>Endelle, though quite powerful in her own right, had very little ambition and hardly sufficient executive prowess to stand against his persistence and dedication. Her values were too simple and her organizational skills too limited to be a real threat.</p><p>The light from a wall-mounted swing-arm lamp positioned above his lap cast a lovely half-moon glow on the shoulder of his most recent ladylove. When the bed was well occupied, he liked doing a little work between sessions.</p><p>He rubbed the soft shoulder. The marks he\u2019d given her had already started to heal. The claw of his left hand was useful for so many things. He\u2019d genetically altered his hand to create terror, but the applications during sex were just delightful. He loved how an idea made manifest could surprise him in terms of usefulness and innovation.</p><p>The woman whimpered when he dug a nail into the deepest wound. But he smelled her answering arousal. She enjoyed a little pain. He enjoyed delivering it. They were an excellent match.</p><p>He\u2019d known for a long time that he wanted this particular woman in his bed and by his side. He just hadn\u2019t known exactly how she would come to him without creating problems in his Coming Order\u2014she had belonged to one of his most loyal High Administrators. But this much he knew: All things come to him who waits. And so she had come to him because her husband had died ... by the hand of a Warrior of the Blood ... one of the few times he actually felt beholden to that group of hateful do-gooders.</p><p>He also believed that when life delivers lemons, you must make lemonade. In his experience of well over two thousand years, he\u2019d made that particular philosophy his own. Yes, he was a positive thinker. Very evolved. He smiled to himself.</p><p>He\u2019d been thinking positive thoughts about this woman for several decades. But how did he know that the day he\u2019d turned High Administrator Eldon Crace into a death vampire by giving him dying blood, the idiot would fail to make use of his special symptom-diminishing antidote? The result had been somewhat unexpected: Crace had become a full-fledged monster with more power than was good for him, and Warrior Luken had killed him in his forge. That had been a black day.</p><p>Talk about lemons.</p><p>Greaves had sealed the forge permanently after disposing of Crace\u2019s body. That any of the Warriors of the Blood had found the means to fold directly into any part of his compound had enraged Greaves. If Crace hadn\u2019t already been dead, he would have killed him himself. Greaves had seen the security tapes of the event. He\u2019d witnessed ascender Havily Morgan manacled to the wall and drained of blood, and he\u2019d watched Warrior Marcus fold into the forge and attack Crace. He hadn\u2019t been surprised that Crace had dominated Warrior Marcus\u2014the latter had just recovered from third-degree burns over most of his body. But how stupid could Crace have been not to have foreseen the arrival of another warrior?</p><p>Still, the violation of his compound by Warriors of the Blood had a silver lining that was truly magnificent: From the moment of Crace\u2019s death, there had been no impediment to his taking the man\u2019s widow into his bed. The exquisite Julianna now lay facedown beside him, the tips of her extremely long nails stroking the tender portion of his naked anatomy between his hip and the top of his thigh. As much as he was able, God help him, he loved her. She was avaricious, power-hungry, thought nothing of torturing anyone opposed to her schemes, and enjoyed both a dominant and submissive role in bed. In other words, she was his soul mate.</p><p>Right now, they had an equal number of wounds.</p><p>She stroked the lump on his groin just over the vein she\u2019d tapped earlier.</p><p>He scrolled through the numerous Seers Fortress reports attached as documents to various emails. He found the usual: The Warriors of the Blood were gaining power through the ritual bonding of the breh-hedden; Warrior Marcus and his breh, Havily, were preventing High Administrators from defecting to Greaves\u2019s camp; Alison Wells, who was also Warrior Kerrick\u2019s breh and Endelle\u2019s personal assistant, was still slated to do some as-yet-unspecified glorious deed for Second Earth. How annoying.</p><p>The emails were sorted in order of importance by Rith Do\u2019onwa, his most trusted and most submissive minion. As much as he could, he trusted Rith. The vampire had abducted Parisa\u2014a feat of no small power\u2014and had been keeping her concealed from Madame Endelle\u2019s forces all this time. The only fly in the ointment at present was that although Parisa had disappeared from the future streams for most of three months, she\u2019d recently resurfaced as a threat to his Coming Order. She was a terrible conundrum. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His instinct was to kill her. Still, if he disposed of her outright, even through one of his minions whom he could later blame, her relationship to Warrior Medichi would invite Armageddon. The death of any of the women connected so closely to the Warriors of the Blood would ignite a frenzy of hunting and slaughtering. Greaves did not want to be caught in that sort of maelstrom if he could help it. The warriors would draw and quarter him at the very least for taking her life. As a man intent on ruling the world, he had learned to tread the waters of subvert-and-conquer very lightly.</p><p>His strategy with the Warriors of the Blood had been very simple over the centuries. He wanted to keep them exhausted but not overrun, not until he was ready to take over Second Earth. He didn\u2019t yet own COPASS and until he\u2019d turned a majority of the members of that lawmaking committee, he wouldn\u2019t have enough pieces in place for the coup he was planning. But he was getting closer every day.</p><p>He shifted slightly against the pillows and felt the pull of dried blood against one of the wounds on his back. He rubbed back and forth; the ensuing rip of his skin sent a small slice of lightning into his groin. Delightful.</p> <p>An email arrived all in caps.</p><p>Rith never wrote in caps.</p><p>THE CAPTIVE WILL ESCAPE. It was a message out of the Mumbai Seers Fortress, which had one of the highest accuracy rates of all the fortresses.</p><p>Lowercase followed. Your orders, master?</p><p>Greaves smiled. He adored Rith\u2019s manners. So many today had forgotten the proper use of titles of respect. Master was simply his favorite.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it, darling?\u201d Julianna murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re very tense.\u201d Her nails scraped along his hip, then his thigh, then the space between. She put terrible pressure on the lump. He hissed his approval. She giggled.</p><p>\u201cParisa is prophesied to escape. Rith wants to know what he should do. I believe he wants to kill her but I can\u2019t allow it. He could tighten security, of course. Maybe we should move her. Yes, I\u2019m thinking we should move her.\u201d He hit REPLY and a new email opened up, the cursor pulsing at him. He started typing his orders with a bit of difficulty; the fingers of his left hand were permanently misshapen, albeit very slightly, from decades of shifting from claw to hand.</p><p>Julianna caught his wrist lightly. \u201cMy love,\u201d she said, leaning up on her elbows. His breath caught. The woman was exquisite. She had dark brown hair now hanging in masses around her shoulders, rumpled from lovemaking. Her eyes were an exquisite blue, like icy water, but it was the shape that pleased him so much, angled upward as they were from the corners, cat\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhy not let the winged mortal escape\u2014after you forge a mind-link with her?\u201d She smiled, that little devious Scarlett O\u2019Hara smile of hers, the one that always warmed his heart.</p><p>\u201cAn intriguing notion. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how worried you\u2019ve been that the Warriors of the Blood might take the abduction personally, and act against you before you\u2019re ready. Why not make use of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I could use her as a sort of spy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t keep her, and you certainly can\u2019t slit her throat.\u201d She dug a nail deep between hip and thigh and drew blood. He hissed at the pain, but the resulting flow of endorphins made him wonderfully dizzy. He really did love this woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think on it,\u201d he murmured. He then sent an email to Rith to do nothing until he\u2019d pondered the matter.</p><p>He set his HP aside and opened his left palm. He focused on the fingers and savored the burn as skin broke and disappeared, as bones expanded, as the claw took shape.</p><p>Julianna rolled on her back, the sheet catching just at hip level until she looked like a mermaid. Her cuts really did heal too fast.</p><p>She spread her arms wide, getting ready for him once more. Her breasts were large and perfect and unenhanced. They drifted to each side of her rib cage, the nipples already peaked. She smiled and sighed. \u201cHurt me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>So he did.</p><p>At seven that evening, just after sunset, Medichi entered the Blood and Bite and froze. It was the smell that got to him first, full of lust, sex, and blood, everything he couldn\u2019t have, everything he\u2019d been denied for the past three months because Parisa was gone.</p><p>The red velvet booths off to the right were covered in varying degrees of mist, and would confuse the minds of all the mortal women present as well as most of the Militia Warriors. But his powers were advanced enough that he could see, hear, and smell everything. He used to enjoy the voyeurism. Now it was torture.</p> <p>He knew what went on in the booths. He\u2019d made use of them nearly every night from the time the owner, Sam Finch, had opened the joint too many decades ago to remember. The Warriors of the Blood always started out their night here, sharing drinks and bullshit, taking a beauty or two into one of the booths, getting a bit of respite before the death vamps started busting through the Borderlands.</p><p>He took a deep breath and ignored the onslaught of sensation as he turned in the direction of the bar. Now that he was here, he had another mission to accomplish, something he should have done a long time ago. Shit, was he really going to do this? After thirteen centuries, was he really going to tell the truth about why he never mounted his wings?</p><p>Jean-Pierre thumped his shoulder from behind. \u201cAll\u00f4, Medichi. This is such good news about Burma. Have you heard from Central yet?\u201d</p><p>Medichi turned to face the Frenchman. He still had a faint accent; he\u2019d only been ascended a couple of centuries. Give him a few more decades, and his English would be perfect. \u201cNo. I spoke to Carla a couple of times this afternoon, but nothing yet. Jeannie\u2019s on deck right now. She\u2019s working with Colonel Seriffe. The grid over at Militia Warrior Headquarters isn\u2019t quite as powerful as Central\u2019s but it\u2019ll do in a pinch.\u201d Once night fell and the pretty-boys came out, Jeannie had to use Central\u2019s grid to track death vampire movements and keep Thorne apprised. Seriffe\u2019s less powerful grid would be searching Burma the rest of the night.</p><p>He had spent the day in and out of sleep, waiting without much expectation for Carla to call with news of Parisa. He had known from the first that the hunt would take days, not hours, but he had still been hoping for a miracle. When nothing came of the day\u2019s grid search and it was time to dress for battle, his nerves were shredded. Frankly, he needed the release of wielding his sword and battling an enemy he could actually get at. All this waiting was for shit.</p><p>Jean-Pierre clamped his shoulder, shook his head back and forth. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerci, Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui. Oui.\u201d The Frenchman nodded several times then finally just threw his arms around Medichi.</p><p>Jean-Pierre, at six-five, was the same height as Marcus. He had long wavy brown hair, on the light side. His hair tended to escape the cadroen and frame his face in loose curls, which the women loved. His eyes were greenish gray, the color of the ocean. He was probably the leanest of the warriors, but fucking strong. Women were known to swoon over the bastard, especially when he whispered soft French into willing ears.</p><p>The cadroens he used were strips of varying pastel brocade, hand-sewn to his specifications with combs, tied in a bow, an affectation he\u2019d adopted at the French court and refused to give up. He had been an acquaintance\u2014though not a lover\u2014of Marie Antoinette. During those years, he had developed a serious and dangerous love for the political discussion of the day. In an act that had terrorized an enormous crowd, he\u2019d dematerialized off the guillotine in 1793.</p><p>Non, he had not known of this power. Oui, he had made his way, just as Medichi had all those centuries earlier, to the European Borderland outside Rome, to begin his ascension process.</p><p>Of all the warriors, Jean-Pierre had been Medichi\u2019s biggest support during the last three months. When the music turned off, Medichi told him of tracking the death vamp to the Grand Canyon, Mortal Earth.</p><p>But when he finished the story, he added, \u201cOne more thing, mon ami. I\u2019m telling everyone tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre frowned. \u201cAbout your wings? Why you will not fly with any of us?\u201d</p><p>Medichi nodded.</p><p>\u201cMon dieu, but I am glad of it. Will you fly in battle from this night on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s the idea, especially since we could get a call any time now from Central. When we head to Burma, I\u2019ll want to be ready to mount my wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBon.\u201d He nodded several times.</p><p>Medichi turned around, took a deep breath, lowered his chin, and charted a course for the bar. Despite the six-deep bank of Militia Warriors, his height parted the crowd as if he had a ten-foot iron prow before him.</p><p>The brothers were there in full battle gear, Marcus included. Their uniform was meant for the hot desert temps: leather kilts, weapons harnesses with a leather strap down the back that allowed for wing release, heavy sandals, black shin guards, and silver-studded leather wrist guards. Thorne sat in his usual location at the top of the bar, with a hand on Luken\u2019s back. He ran the hand low to the waist, inspecting. \u201cJesus,\u201d Thorne muttered. \u201cNot a single damn scar from those burns. A-fucking-mazing.\u201d</p><p>Luken grinned. Three months ago he\u2019d been caught by an incendiary bomb while out fighting at the Superstitions. His wings had been burned off, but fortunately they\u2019d regenerated and he\u2019d been on flight duty ever since, like the rest of the brothers. Now the last of his scarring had apparently faded.</p><p>He headed toward the second duo, Kerrick and Marcus. The latter only fought two nights a week; the rest of the time he served as High Administrator of Southwest Desert Two. He\u2019d taken a huge load off Endelle. Funny how that still hadn\u2019t improved her temper.</p><p>The two men had been enemies for the past two hundred years, but all that had been resolved. Now they were inseparable.</p><p>Marcus sat with his full attention fixed on Kerrick. Yeah, the two shared something in common\u2014they\u2019d both bonded with their brehs.</p><p>Marcus frowned at Kerrick. \u201cWhat the hell did you do to your forehead?\u201d</p><p>Kerrick rubbed above his right eyebrow and grimaced. \u201cWhat, this?\u201d Color crept up his neck. \u201cAlison threw a shoe at me. She\u2019s not exactly been herself lately.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marcus leaned back and laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s very pregnant these days. Whadya do? Tell her she looked fat, you dumbfuck? I\u2019da thrown a shoe as well.\u201d</p><p>Kerrick sighed. \u201cI know better than that. She was wincing and I asked if she was all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Marcus frowned. \u201cMaybe it was your tone. Sometimes they get mad because of tone.\u201d</p> <p>Kerrick just sighed again and rubbed the bump.</p><p>In other circumstances, Medichi could have appreciated the exchange\u2014he\u2019d been married once. But the sight of both men, happily bonded, their brehs safe, made his stomach loop into a very complicated figure-eight.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the right. There was Santiago, holding up a cocktail napkin to Zacharius. On it was a sketch of a dagger.</p><p>\u201cLonger,\u201d Zach said. \u201cI still think it should be longer.\u201d</p><p>Santiago chortled. \u201cThat is what all the women say.\u201d</p> <p>Zach rolled his eyes. \u201cYou are so full of shit.\u201d</p><p>Medichi actually smiled at the joke. He couldn\u2019t even remember the last time that had happened, but then again he\u2019d gotten good news today. He moved in and clapped each one on the shoulder. \u201cHow we doin\u2019?\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t wait for an answer but jerked his chin at Sam. \u201cLimoncello,\u201d he called out.</p><p>Sam nodded once, flung a clean white towel over his shoulder, gave a snap of his suspenders, and bent over to open the small fridge behind the counter.</p><p>Both warriors, still seated, looked up at Medichi.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Zach cried, \u201cThorne told us your news. This is fucking great.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s all it took. The warriors rose off the bar stools, one huge-ass swarm of lethal warrior bodies, palms and fists pummeling him.</p> <p>For some goddamn reason Medichi\u2019s eyes burned.</p><p>Marcus pushed his hair back. It had grown longer in the past three months, down to his shoulders now but still not long enough for the cadroen. \u201cSo, we sit tight until the grid at Central finds something we can investigate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, we\u2019re using Seriffe\u2019s grid, the one at Militia headquarters. Jeannie\u2019s watching for blue-bastards, as usual.\u201d</p><p>Marcus sighed. Heavily. He shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019re getting our asses kicked,\u201d he muttered. As an administrator, he always had his eye on the larger problem: how to gain the upper hand over Greaves.</p><p>Medichi glanced past his friend and took the cold glass of limoncello that Sam held up. He drew the glass close, squeezed his eyes shut, and took a long drink.</p><p>His heart was thumping hard. The time had come to do what he should have done centuries ago.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, he looked straight at Thorne and said, \u201cI need to see all of you at the Cave before we head out to the Borderlands tonight.\u201d His gaze skated to Marcus, willing him to understand what he intended to do. It didn\u2019t take Marcus more than a couple of seconds. He nodded and a faint smile touched his lips.</p><p>Thorne scowled at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p> <p>Medichi shifted his gaze back to him.</p><p>Thorne was one ruined warrior. In addition to the reddish, bloodshot look, he had dark circles beneath his eyes. It was like looking in a mirror, except Thorne had looked this way for decades now. And what the hell was his excuse except that his sister was stuck in the Creator\u2019s convent in Prescott Two and had been for over a century?</p><p>Of course, Thorne\u2019s avowed celibacy didn\u2019t help matters.</p><p>To be fair, Thorne was Endelle\u2019s second-in-command. That had to be one huge assfucking day and night. For all her power and her dedication to Second Society, Endelle was one volcano of a bitch, ready to spew on command. But she was the only thing holding their world together when Commander Darian Greaves was so close to tearing it apart.</p><p>As Thorne scowled up at him, Medichi knew he\u2019d have to tell him something right now if he wanted him to agree to a meeting before the night\u2019s battling began. Thorne didn\u2019t like a disruption in his schedule.</p><p>Medichi drew a deep breath. \u201cI need to show you my wings.\u201d</p><p>To reveal what has been hidden,</p><p>To offer to the light what has been long held in the dark,</p><p>These are the true acts of heroism.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>\u201cYou need to show us your wings?\u201d Thorne repeated. His hazel eyes looked blank. \u201cWhat do you mean? Now? Tonight?\u201d</p><p>The warriors, almost as a unit, froze and stared at Medichi.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Right now. At the Cave.\u201d He willed Thorne to say yes, to direct the warriors to the rec room.</p><p>\u201cShit\u201d came out like a soft whistle from between Thorne\u2019s teeth. He glanced around. \u201cWell, fuck. To the Cave, laddies.\u201d</p><p>Medichi didn\u2019t wait. He lifted his arm and folded. He touched down on the chipped black tile of the floor, then moved to stand near the pool table, his hands on his hips. He took deep breaths. Was he really going to do this?</p><p>Yeah. The time had come. The moment Central found anything in Burma, he\u2019d fold to the location and do whatever it took to get to Parisa, including mounting his wings in front of God and all creation. So yeah, he needed to get this over with.</p><p>He felt the air move several times as seven big warrior bodies filled up the Cave. It was dark inside, a real hole in the wall in downtown Metro Phoenix Two.</p><p>Ratty brown leather couches, more like barges, lined two walls. A TV came on via motion detector whenever a warrior entered the space. It was turned to CNN\u2014Marcus\u2019s request. He liked to keep on top of happenings on Mortal Earth.</p><p>The pool table had been recently replaced but already had a huge gouge out of one corner. The pocket was missing and had been replaced by a duct-taped black trash bag.</p><p>Medichi took the plunge. \u201cI\u2019m going to show you first, then you\u2019ll understand a few things.\u201d He stripped off his black tee. Damn, was he really going to do this? Parisa\u2019s arrival had changed everything. Every damn thing.</p><p>He met Marcus\u2019s gaze. Marcus dipped his chin once, his expression solemn, even hard. Marcus had seen the scars on his back the same day Medichi had met Parisa.</p><p>Medichi turned slowly until his back was to the men. He heard the soft, strained gasps. With his right hand he swept his long hair forward over his shoulder so that what he\u2019d kept secret was a secret no longer.</p><p>He felt sick in his gut. He was showing them just how he\u2019d failed his wife the night she\u2019d died. His scars didn\u2019t represent what he\u2019d suffered. His suffering had been nothing. No, the horrific silver stripes represented Maria\u2019s death.</p><p>For the first few seconds, a variety of profanities flowed, even Jean-Pierre\u2019s Merde. He gave them a good long minute to look.</p><p>It was Kerrick who spoke first. \u201cWe always wondered. What the fuck happened? Who did this to you?\u201d</p><p>He turned back to face them, but his gaze found the floor and couldn\u2019t seem to move anywhere else. Guilt held him fast. He told the story in as few words as possible. A northern tribe descending on the countryside. Rapists. Murderers. He spoke of the whip, the laughter, the drunkenness, and finally his wife and unborn child. He talked of the sudden emergence of power that saved his life, but arrived too late to save his wife\u2019s.</p><p>When he was done, his brothers shifted through the room like rivulets of water seeking a place to drain. All except Thorne. He sat down on the floor and put his head in his hands.</p><p>For several minutes, no one said a word. They didn\u2019t look at him, either. Each expression was lost, haunted. Who among them hadn\u2019t suffered some tragedy or terrible loss or physical pain because of the nature of life or because of the war?</p><p>Finally, Santiago approached. He was too beautiful for words, this brother, with his thick, wavy black hair, dark eyes, and skin the color of a deep tan. He put his hand on Medichi\u2019s shoulder. He met his gaze straight-on. \u201cI have felt your pain, mi hermano, but I have a scar that\u2019s worse than anything you have shown us tonight.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Well, if that didn\u2019t make him feel worse.</p><p>The brother lifted his chin. \u201cDo you remember a year ago that woman with the hair the color of a brilliant sunset and her eyes the precise shade of a violent sea?\u201d</p><p>Medichi frowned. Sort of. He had a sudden fear that the woman had harmed Santiago permanently in the jewels. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Santiago pounded his chest with his fist. His eyes looked wild, maddened. \u201cShe cut up my heart and bled me until I should have died. I tell you, the scar is deep, hermano, deep. I should have died that night.\u201d</p><p>Zacharius moved in close. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? I don\u2019t remember a woman ever sticking you with a blade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about a weapon?\u201d Santiago cried. \u201cI begged her and begged her to go into the booths with me at the Blood and Bite. But she refused. I still bear the scar. What are Medichi\u2019s wounds when a woman has rejected such an invitation?\u201d He swept a dramatic hand over his groin. \u201cI ask you.\u201d</p><p>Everyone groaned, but Medichi laughed. Tears started to his eyes, but he laughed. \u201cYou are so full of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he cried, his hands flung out in front of him. Then he slung his arm around Medichi\u2019s shoulders and hugged him. He even kissed him on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your wife and son,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cGracias, amigo.\u201d</p><p>Medichi laughed again. There were times when the brotherhood functioned just as it should and Santiago\u2019s absurdity had done what nothing else could have. The tension in the room thinned as the laughter flowed. Luken put Santiago in a headlock and slapped the top of his head a few times.</p><p>Thorne drew close and with his lips pressed tight together asked, \u201cDid the scars affect your wings? I know you can fly. Are they damaged somehow? You don\u2019t owe us anything, Medichi. What you\u2019ve shared tonight honors us.\u201d</p><p>Medichi met his gaze. The concern in Thorne\u2019s eyes almost undid him again. He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that. My wings are fine. But it\u2019s time I started flying in battle. I\u2019ve put it off way too long. When Jeannie calls with word about Parisa, I\u2019ll be in the air if I have to. I\u2019m not holding back any longer. However, there is something I want you to know, and you\u2019ll understand better if I just show you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d Thorne said. \u201cLet\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>He turned his back to his brothers once more and focused. A few seconds later the apertures down his back wept and his wings began to release. The sensation was pure heaven, but as before, a few gasps and another stream of profanity hit the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Zach cried. \u201cYou\u2019ve got royle wings, just like Parisa. What the goddamn fuck?\u201d</p> <p>At eleven o\u2019clock in the morning, Parisa sat in the garden waiting for Commander Greaves to visit her. He had never done so before. She sat on the teak bench beneath the tamarind tree, her nerves on fire and her heart beating a dull thud. Rith had sent her out here to wait an hour ahead of time, which didn\u2019t help her growing distress. What did he want with her, and why had he waited all this time to see her?</p><p>Rith\u2019s dark demeanor hadn\u2019t changed. He still watched her with a cruel light in his eye as though waiting for her to make a mistake so that he\u2019d have an excuse to harm her.</p><p>She smoothed her hands over the cream silk dress she wore. For Greaves\u2019s visit, Rith had made sure she was well groomed, and that included her finest dress. Her makeup was flawless: The Burmese women loved to give her cat-eyes with heavy black eyeliner to bring out the amethyst color. Her dark brown hair had been sculpted into several loops down the back of her head. Talk about a gilded cage.</p><p>But whatever Rith was, Greaves was so much worse. In her opinion, he personified hypocrisy. He spoke and dressed like an aristocrat, but if even half the stories about him were true, he created death vampires of all those who served him. He might have the manners of a gentleman, but he had the soul of Lucifer and intended nothing but pain and suffering to the two worlds he meant to conquer.</p><p>A loud crash sounded from the direction of the house, like china shattering on the planked wooden floor. Parisa turned toward the porch of the large British Colonial. She saw movement just beyond the open doorway but couldn\u2019t make out what was happening. Figures grappled back and forth in the shadows. Grunting followed, and Rith cried out.</p> <p>She rose from the teak bench as an unfamiliar woman appeared in the doorway. She wore loose light blue flannel pajama bottoms and a navy tank top. Her wavy chestnut hair hung to the sides of a beautiful face. She had large light blue eyes, almost silver in appearance, but wild looking. She was Caucasian, something Parisa had not seen in three months.</p><p>Parisa couldn\u2019t breathe. The woman caught sight of her and shifted in her direction. Parisa backed up until her legs hit the teak bench.</p><p>The woman raced toward her and knocked her into the bench. She fell on her, grabbing her shoulders. \u201cHelp me,\u201d she pleaded in English. \u201cYou have to help me. Get me out of here. Please, please.\u201d</p><p>When Parisa realized she wasn\u2019t being attacked, she held on to the woman\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re being held against your will?\u201d It couldn\u2019t really be a surprise that another woman might be trapped in the same house, but Parisa hadn\u2019t seen or heard anyone else on the premises before. Where had she come from?</p><p>A shift of shadow near the porch drew Parisa\u2019s eye. Rith appeared in the doorway. She had never seen him look so angry, his chin low, his lips curved down. He pressed a cloth to his forehead, then looked at it. He tossed the cloth aside and moved swiftly in their direction, hips low, knees bent, hands splayed like claws.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t help you,\u201d Parisa said. \u201cI\u2019m a captive as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The woman looked at Parisa\u2019s hair, her cream silk gown. \u201cBut you look so lovely. I thought this was your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, no.\u201d Parisa looked down at their joined arms. A tremor went through, a soft vibration, a knowing. She knew without understanding why that her future was connected to this woman. She stared into the silver-blue eyes. \u201cI feel as though I know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d The woman looked at their joined arms as well. \u201cWhat is that vibration?\u201d</p><p>Rith was almost on them. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Parisa asked.</p><p>\u201cFiona. Fiona Gaines. Of Boston from a long time ago. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParisa.\u201d</p><p>Fiona\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cToday would have been my daughter\u2019s birthday. I ... I can\u2019t take being here anymore. Help me, Parisa. Please\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rith\u2019s strong pale hands caught Fiona\u2019s arms and pulled her away, a solid, heavy jerk. Because Parisa was unwilling to release the woman, she grabbed for her waist and fell forward onto Fiona, causing all three to tumble onto the lawn.</p> <p>\u201cLet go of her,\u201d Rith shouted.</p><p>Parisa refused. She wanted to help this woman, this fellow captive. Rith jerked and rolled in the direction of the house where the lawn slanted. Fiona rolled with him, which meant that Parisa\u2019s arms were quickly twisted as she got caught in the tumbling. She had no choice. She released Fiona. She cried out at the pain, not just of having her skin stretched and bruised but because of the separation from the unknown woman.</p><p>She sat up and watched the struggle. She rose to her feet ready to do battle as well but Rith caught her movement and lifted a hand in her direction. The gesture was way too familiar. Parisa had made use of her own palms earlier in her captivity and had been punished for it. There was nothing she could do, though. The next moment the hand-blast caught her in the chest. She flew backward into the bench once more and struck her head. Hard.</p><p>She slid to the ground on her side. Stars danced over her eyes. She blinked. More stars.</p><p>From the odd angle, she could still watch the struggle play out as Rith slapped Fiona several times until the woman fell limp into his arms. Vampires had a lot of physical power, even average-looking vampires like Rith.</p><p>He tossed her over his shoulder and carted her back into the house. Once she disappeared inside, Parisa had the strangest sensation that her life had just changed forever.</p><p>She sat up slowly to lean against the teak bench. Her head throbbed. Who was the woman? Why was Rith holding her captive\u2014and were there other women hidden away somewhere inside the house?</p><p>She felt a vibration in the air and rose to her feet, an abrupt movement that caused her head to swim.</p><p>Greaves materialized in front of her. His brows rose as he looked her up and down. A frown appeared between his thick arched black brows.</p><p>She reached up and felt through her hair. Some of the elegant loops had come loose and now hung in an awkward mass down her back. She glanced at her gown and saw the grass stains where her knees must have slid over the ground. There was blood on the fabric as well, but she had no idea whether it was from her or Rith or Fiona.</p><p>Rith came running from the house. \u201cMy most humble apologies, master. We had an unfortunate accident just a moment ago. I will make the woman ready for you.\u201d</p><p>Greaves turned slightly toward him and inclined his head. \u201cYes, please do.\u201d</p><p>Rith swept to Parisa\u2019s side, hooked her beneath her arm, and dragged her on running feet from the garden. \u201cHow dare you involve yourself in that way?\u201d he hissed, over and over.</p><p>A few minutes later, with her coiffure restored by two trembling Burmese servants, Parisa returned to the garden as ordered. She wore a new gown, a light green silk dress, tight at the waist and long at mid-calf, very conservative.</p><p>Reentering the garden, she saw Greaves from behind. He sat in a large teak chair, elbows planted on the wide arms. From her vantage, since the teacup was missing from the saucer, she presumed he was drinking his tea.</p><p>His bald head reflected the dancing shadows of the lacy tamarind leaves overhead. She rounded the table upon which the tea service sat and took up her place again on the teak bench.</p><p>He wore a charcoal-gray suit that bore a faint and oh-so-elegant pinstripe. His tie was lavender silk; a black onyx ring graced his right pinkie. He was handsome, though completely bald, and had the most innocent expression in his large, round brown eyes, a look akin to child-like wonder.</p><p>Whatever else this monster was, his appearance was tailored, crisp, clean. Yes, a very tidy monster. His sole imperfection was his left hand, which he held curled inward as though slightly crippled.</p><p>The elegant monster smiled, showing even white teeth.</p><p>Parisa sat with her hands held in a loose clasp over the fine green silk. Her fingers trembled but then why wouldn\u2019t they since her mind kept flashing on images of Fiona. Where was Rith keeping the woman?</p><p>She kept her expression calm, however, and measured her blinks. Only her elevated heart rate would give away the state of her emotions. Somehow she knew Greaves could detect each beat, track the rise in tempo, and even now smiled at her fear.</p><p>He had never paid her a visit before, so she couldn\u2019t imagine his reason for coming today. This couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>He sipped the traditional local black tea enhanced with condensed milk. Parisa didn\u2019t care for the tea or much of the food. Her appetite still lagged despite the luxury of her captivity. She knew now why zoo animals often seemed so lethargic: Without her freedom, her spirit had shriveled.</p><p>\u201cThere is no need to fear me, Parisa.\u201d The monster\u2019s voice had a soothing quality, a gentle bubbling stream, a delight.</p><p>\u201cI suppose not. I\u2019ve been here three months and I\u2019ve received excellent care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt of that. Rith is one of my best servants. He always follows my orders to the letter\u2014and where you are concerned, your care is of the upmost importance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why have you brought me here, to Burma, Commander Greaves? I hope you\u2019ve come to tell me your purpose. Better yet, to release me.\u201d Where was this boldness coming from?</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI must say you smell of heaven.\u201d</p><p>She repressed a sigh. Was that the only answer he would give her? You smell of heaven? \u201cI am bathed daily in fragrant oils.\u201d She knew enough to give a good report. Rith would hurt her otherwise. Given her misdemeanor earlier, she thought it likely a punishment already waited for her. Great.</p><p>Greaves nodded.</p><p>He settled the white teacup on its companion saucer, rising from his chair. Her heart rate took another step up, a quick fluttering that descended into heavy bass thumps. She lowered her gaze to the grass at her feet. She began counting blades. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sat down beside her. He put a hand on her nape, a very controlling gesture. Rith must have pinned her hair in loops to give him access. For a moment, she wondered if he meant to take her blood.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d Greaves whispered. His left hand brushed over her left arm.</p><p>She tried not to breathe through her nose because, for all of Greaves\u2019s finery, he smelled strange. It was lemon furniture polish\u2014or at least that was the closest she could come to approximating his scent. It wasn\u2019t entirely unpleasant, just odd.</p> <p>She drew a shallow breath and tried to relax. Unfortunately, she felt his mind against hers. She could sense his desire to penetrate her head in what she had heard described as deep-mind engagement. But with each breath, she slammed her shields in place, one mental steel wall sliding down over another, working hard to keep him out.</p><p>He groaned. Your shields are magnificent.</p><p>She closed her eyes.</p><p>Let me in, he whispered through her brain. Please, lovely Parisa. Let me in, or I shall have to hurt you.</p><p>But she held fast.</p> <p>The pain began as she felt him hammering against her shields, the sound like a sledgehammer striking against an enormous brass bell. Her teeth ached.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want this.</p><p>More pain. More pounding. Oh, God, slicing now.</p><p>Tears flowed. She couldn\u2019t have held them back if she\u2019d wanted to. In some distant part of her mind she knew she was screaming.</p><p>Release your shields.</p><p>No. She might have to endure a captivity she didn\u2019t understand, she might have to do as she was told and follow Rith\u2019s schedule, she might have to fear that at any moment she could be killed. But by God she would keep her mind sacrosanct.</p> <p>I need to be inside your head.</p><p>He eased his efforts, but it was only a respite.</p><p>Parisa sobbed at the sudden release from pain. Did he enjoy her suffering? She turned to look at him, his hand still a weight on the back of her neck. He dipped down toward her very suddenly and his lips were on hers, a soft, cool, dry touch.</p><p>Her thoughts slid strangely to Antony ... and it happened. As though the mere thought of him was enough, her shields fell away, a kind of quick shimmering of leaves. She rose to her feet even though she couldn\u2019t quite see. She ran forward but collided with something hard. She fell ... then ... nothing.</p><p>Darian Greaves was absolutely fascinated with the woman lying at his feet. She was a mortal-with-wings. Incredible. He had read of her powers and now understood that she had the ability to voyeur, which was also astounding. To his knowledge only Endelle had the ability to make use of preternatural voyeurism.</p><p>But what intrigued him the most was that this woman was evidently the breh of Warrior Medichi. The mythical breh-hedden seemed to be happening to the Warriors of the Blood at light speed. It reeked of Upper Dimension involvement. Yes, at the very least the arrival of so many preternaturally powerful women, all in the space of a few short months and intended for the most powerful men on Second Earth, smelled of Third Earth involvement, perhaps even higher.</p><p>If he\u2019d been suspicious of Endelle, he would have said he was the victim of her diabolical plotting, but She Who Would Live did not possess a complicated mind. He smiled. No, Madame Endelle had a warrior\u2019s mind. She would have performed much better at the head of an army than as Supreme High Administrator of Second Earth. Her inadequacies and failings had been a blessing to his ongoing efforts at world domination: candy from a baby. And if truth be known, up until Alison\u2019s ascension seven months ago\u2014dear pregnant Alison\u2014he\u2019d been rather bored.</p><p>\u201cRith,\u201d he called out.</p> <p>\u201cYes, master.\u201d Rith\u2019s voice was elegant, serene.</p><p>\u201cI would like more tea, please.\u201d Somewhere in Parisa\u2019s stumblings the table had been overturned and the saucer broken.</p><p>Pity. The white Ironware was quite old.</p><p>\u201cShall I remove her?\u201d</p><p>Parisa lay between his chair and the bench. A light rain had begun to fall, and he created a shield over his head and her body.</p><p>\u201cNo, that won\u2019t be necessary. I am not quite finished with her.\u201d He rounded her prone body to sit back down, stretching out his arms on the wide armrests. Parisa\u2019s back was to him. The green silk dress clung to her curves. She had a very small waist; the dip below her ribs looked like it would fit one of his feet.</p><p>He understood the real danger Parisa was to him even though she was oblivious and would be for a long time. The real danger was the silent warrior behind her. If it weren\u2019t for Medichi, Greaves would have killed her outright. But to do so now would put all his plans at risk.</p><p>Yes, Greaves felt the hand of a master in the sudden eruption of the breh-hedden among the Warriors of the Blood, a master not of Second Earth, but of an Upper Dimension, though he couldn\u2019t prove it. Like everyone else on Second, he had thought the mate-bonding ritual a thing out of ascension mythology, something written in fables to charm the feminine heart and to make men strong and lusty with their women.</p><p>But here it was, at his feet, real and dangerous. He felt the danger as a writhing fierce wind all around him. He still didn\u2019t know how to combat it, but today he\u2019d made progress. He\u2019d forged a voyeur\u2019s link with Parisa. Anytime she opened that link, he would be able to see and hear everything she saw and heard.</p><p>He smelled Rith before he came into view. The Oriental had an unusual body odor, like rust that somehow lived in the air and could be tasted on the tongue. Rith took a lot of Chinese herbs. Maybe some of them leaked through his pores.</p><p>Two of the females were with him. Greaves didn\u2019t like these women, but he couldn\u2019t say why. Rith had them completely under control, but there was a meanness to them he disapproved of. They were the kind of women who, if they caught mice in a trap, would cut their feet off before killing them. He disapproved of such traits in women. He liked their general submissiveness, but there was nothing gentle in any of them. He felt certain each would have made an excellent assassin.</p><p>The woman with the narrowest gaze righted the table then spread a fresh white linen over the top. The second woman set a tray down, a very pretty silver tray that held a Wedgwood set, an homage to the time of British rule in Burma on Mortal Earth over a hundred years ago.</p><p>He smiled as Rith prepared the sweet Burmese tea. Some traditions ought to be maintained just to remind everyone of the nature and necessity of dominance.</p><p>He dismissed Rith and his servants. Holding the cup and saucer in his hands, he sipped the aromatic sweetened tea, letting the creamy texture and bitter flavor roll around on his tongue.</p><p>He smiled. Yes, dominance was his favorite thing.</p><p>Savoring that dominance was another.</p><p>Okay, so he was a mere vampire and couldn\u2019t resist the temptation, but with Parisa unconscious, who would ever know?</p><p>He folded off his right shoe, sending it to rest next to the leg of his chair. He took a deep breath then settled his foot, encased in Bresciani, on that lovely deep curve of Parisa\u2019s waist. A sense of peace flowed within his chest. He left his foot in that position until he\u2019d finished the last of the tea.</p><p>He had one small conundrum to resolve at this point. Given his suspicions of Upper Dimension involvement on behalf of Madame Endelle, should he strike now and attempt a takeover of Second Earth? Or should he wait?</p><p>He sipped his tea.</p><p>Problems, problems.</p><p>The next thing Parisa knew, she was on the grass, her cheek cool against the carefully cut blades. She faced the bench and the tree. Slowly, she rolled over onto her other side, trying to make sense of where she was and what had happened to her. She felt very dizzy.</p><p>Her view was obstructed by the legs of the small side table. Beyond it, she saw Rith\u2019s house. Pilings beneath the structure made the house seem to float on a lake\u2014except that there was no water, only a strange-looking flat-headed cat that Rith called his fire cat. The animal stared at her. He was feral and alert. His fur was a beautiful gold and rust, maybe like fire. He had slightly webbed feet and preferred eating frogs to birds.</p><p>Why was she on her side on the grass?</p><p>Oh, yes. She sighed. She managed a small smile. Antony had kissed her. But how was that possible? Had she fallen asleep in the garden again? Had she been dreaming?</p><p>She rolled onto her back. She stared up through the feathery leaves of the tamarind tree. She wanted to go home. Why couldn\u2019t she go home?</p><p>She sat up. She felt certain she should remember something but couldn\u2019t. She rose to her feet and turned to look at the teak bench. She had been sitting there. She was sure of that. But how had she gotten several feet away? The chair set out for Commander Greaves was in position, as well as the side table meant to hold a tea service. She wondered when Greaves would arrive. She shuddered. He was a monster. He had the manners of a prince but he was a monster.</p><p>Or had he been here already?</p><p>She shuddered again. A vague memory arose\u2014flashes of him sipping his tea then sitting beside her. So, yes, he had come and gone.</p><p>For no reason at all, her head began to hurt.</p><p>From the slatted blinds within his house, Rith stared at the woman now risen from her prone position on the lawn. He had hoped she would die, but he\u2019d had no such good fortune.</p><p>The woman lived.</p><p>And Greaves had accomplished what he\u2019d set out to accomplish\u2014he\u2019d forged a mind-link with her. He\u2019d also told Rith that he was to allow the woman to leave.</p><p>Rith found it hard to blink. He had received more prophecies that the woman would escape, but as always he believed the Seers existed to help him shape the future, not simply to predict it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know the method yet, but he knew this woman would be dead long before she had a chance to leave his home.</p><p>Death is but a journey.</p><p>Yet to return from the brink of the grave</p><p>Is a powerful call to service, to life, to love.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Medichi\u2019s phone buzzed. He was at the north end of the White Tanks. Jeannie had just done cleanup on five, five, fucking death vampires\u2014and the night was young.</p><p>He slid his slim warrior phone from the pocket of his battle kilt. Tonight he was mounting his wings and learning to battle while in the air. It was only nine thirty, and this last squadron had about done him in. He\u2019d flown for centuries, but not while battling, and right now muscles burned that he didn\u2019t even know he had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He thumbed his phone. \u201cHey, Jeannie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEndelle patching through.\u201d The line went dead. Jeannie didn\u2019t even greet him, which meant the scorpion queen was in a mood.</p><p>\u201cMedichi,\u201d Endelle snapped. \u201cGet your fucking ass over to my office pronto.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m alone at the White Tanks Borderland, Mortal Earth, and I can feel the air cooling down. You know what that means.

He might not have been thinking clearly, though, because in some part of his fatigued, stressed mind he realized he might have just hung up on the ruler of Second Earth.</p><p>Shiiiit.</p><p>But he had another problem right now. The air grew arctic, a sure sign a few pretty-boys were on the way, floating down through the dimensional Trough like Mary-fucking-Poppins.</p> <p>His phone buzzed again. He ignored it. He wasn\u2019t leaving the Borderland until Santiago arrived, and he sure as hell wasn\u2019t letting Santiago arrive with death vampires already on the ground.</p><p>He held his sword at the ready but didn\u2019t mount his wings. He kept his gaze fixed on the night sky overhead. Hooray for preternatural night vision. And there they were, dim shapes at first, clearer as each second passed.</p><p>The air moved next to him. He turned, ready for a different kind of attack if necessary, but Santiago materialized, his eyes glittering, his sword held in exactly the same position as Medichi\u2019s, body crouched.</p><p>Medichi nodded.</p><p>Santiago smiled then looked up. \u201cI am feeling a slight chill in the air. What about you, hermano?\u201d</p><p>Medichi turned back to the sky. There were only four riding down the Trough. \u201cYou got this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that an insult, amigo?\u201d</p><p>Medichi laughed. \u201cFuck off.\u201d He lifted his arm and dematerialized, but not without catching sight of Santiago\u2019s middle finger as he vanished.</p><p>He arrived in the middle of Endelle\u2019s office to face a screaming woman.</p><p>\u201cYou hung up on me! You hung up on me! You hung up on me?\u201d</p><p>She combined the last phrase with telepathy and split-resonance and it fucking hurt. He almost dropped to his knees. Holy shit. He felt like his brain was about to explode and only barely kept his balance.</p><p>He saw stars, then something passed in front of him, creating streams of air. He stepped back automatically, getting out of the way, until he bumped against the wall by the door. Shit, Endelle was in one wild state. She was in full-mount, her wings shifted color constantly like a kaleidoscope gone awry, and she left a trail of fireworks behind her in red, all in red, as she raced from one wall to the next. She wore some kind of dress made up of what must have been hundreds of peacock feathers trimmed around the \u201ceye.\u201d What with the fireworks, the wind, and all the \u201ceyes,\u201d she looked like a one-woman spectacle event.</p><p>Sure, he\u2019d hung up on her, but she couldn\u2019t be that pissed about a hang-up. Maybe he needed to explain. \u201cI wasn\u2019t about to leave Santiago with four death vampires on the ground while he was still in dematerialization mode. He could have been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s upset about the hang-up, Warrior Medichi.\u201d</p> <p>At these words, Endelle slowed her movements and actually stopped in front of her desk. She glared in the direction of the west wall.</p><p>Only then did Medichi realize he wasn\u2019t the only man in the room, if you could call what was there a man. His gaze followed Endelle\u2019s to the never-used fireplace on the west wall.</p><p>Owen Stannett.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>High Administrator of the Superstition Mountain Seers Fortress, manipulator of COPASS, law unto himself, lying bastard, enemy to Endelle.</p><p>Owen. Fucking. Stannett.</p><p>He had all but robbed Endelle of Seer prophecies, which provided critical foreknowledge of the war. The Superstition Fortress was the most powerful in the word, probably because of its proximity to the five major dimensional access points on Second Earth. Every continent had at least one access point, but the North American continent had five, in the desert Southwest, all close to the Metro Phoenix area. A lot of power was focused in this part of the world.</p><p>Stannett was one of the main reasons Endelle and her administration were so fucking hamstrung in the fight against Greaves. The bastard had wined and dined COPASS to the point that he\u2019d gotten several critical laws passed, one of which meant that Endelle could not cross the threshold of the Seers Fortress except by express invitation from its High Administrator. So guess who never got invited?</p><p>That Stannett had then constricted the flow of information came as no surprise, but every attempt to get the law repealed had failed. The committee insisted there needed to be a clear separation between the sanctity of Seer devotion and the activities of the State.</p><p>Naturally, naturally, Greaves had built his own powerful network throughout the world by securing the most talented Seers from those Territories aligned with him and settling them into the Fortresses at Mumbai, Johannesburg, and Bogot\u00e1.</p><p>Therein lay the difference between a dictatorship and a democracy. Greaves could do whatever the hell he wanted, but Endelle was bound not just by the laws of the land, but also by the ingrained rights of the local High Administrators to manage their Territories as each saw fit. Autonomy was a critical factor in creating a thriving world, both economically and politically. Every Seers Fortress had an allegiance first to its High Administrator and to the local needs of the people. Endelle could request information, but the High Administrators could respond in whatever way they felt was best for their people. So global Seer information for Endelle was much less reliable. Without her Superstition Fortress prophecies, she was up shit creek without a fucking paddle.</p><p>To say Medichi loathed Stannett was to say the sun was warm. Loathed was too small a word because in the beautiful way power plays trickled down and down and down, mortals and ascenders died every day as a result of the war, of the heinous depredations of Greaves\u2019s ever-increasing death vampire army, and of the lack of information Endelle needed to counter the enemy\u2019s Seer-based moves.</p><p>The question of the hour remained: What the hell was Owen Stannett doing in Endelle\u2019s office?</p><p>He was dressed in heavily embroidered white leather, complete with fringe, like a Las Vegas lounge entertainer. He had styled his dark brown hair with a lot of mousse into a lovely wave that rode the entire right side of his head. He met Medichi\u2019s gaze, unsmiling.</p><p>The next moment a shimmering in the air brought Medichi whirling in the direction of the latest arrival. He crouched, brought his sword to the ready, and waited.</p><p>Thorne.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>Medichi could breathe again, but he said, \u201cLook who\u2019s showed up, after how many decades of playing hide-the-Seer in the Superstitions.\u201d</p><p>Thorne dipped his chin to Medichi but shifted all his attention to the man by the fireplace. \u201cStannett.\u201d He offered a nod that was polite and challenging at the same time.</p><p>Stannett had the balls to make a slight bow, as though he were at the court of Queen fucking Victoria. \u201cWarrior Thorne\u201d eased from between the snake\u2019s smooth lips.</p><p>Medichi addressed Stannett and expressed his deepest convictions: \u201cWhat the hell do you want, you motherfucking sonofabitch?\u201d</p><p>Stannett spread his hands wide. \u201cI come in peace this evening, Warrior Medichi. I need you to believe that.\u201d</p><p>He looked and sounded so sincere. Medichi hated that smug bastard\u2019s face. The night was young and had already been full of death vampires and battle and this asshole had the nerve to say he came in peace? Did he not comprehend his role in the fucking war? Or what his actions had cost the world?</p><p>Medichi\u2019s heavy arms jerked and twitched. He was just short enough on sleep and patience that he didn\u2019t exactly have the ability to suppress the impulse. He launched at Stannett ready to tear apart all that fine leather and anything else he could get at, preferably the vampire\u2019s slimy heart.</p><p>He didn\u2019t get far. Though Owen backed up against the fireplace, and actually looked frightened, Thorne had moved with preternatural speed and now stood between Medichi and his quarry, blocking him, protecting Stannett.</p><p>Medichi was powerful, one of the most physically powerful men on Second Earth. Even Thorne couldn\u2019t match him muscle for muscle. But then Thorne didn\u2019t need to. He had one hand on Medichi\u2019s chest and was pushing him backward, not by might, but by wave after wave of modified hand-blast energy. Jesus H. Christ, Medichi couldn\u2019t imagine the level of power required to control a hand-blast like this. It didn\u2019t exactly hurt, but the pulses shoved him backward one step at a time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping,\u201d Thorne said. \u201cYou\u2019re. Not. Helping.\u201d He repeated it until Medichi calmed the hell down.</p><p>Medichi was breathing hard, one breath after another. He saw red as he glared at Owen.</p><p>Thorne got into Medichi\u2019s face. \u201cYou calm now, buddy? If I take my hand away, you gonna stand right there and be good for me? Look at me.\u201d</p><p>Medichi finally shifted his gaze away from Owen and blinked at Thorne. \u201cSure,\u201d he said.</p><p>Thorne wasn\u2019t buying. \u201cYou want to try that again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you let me at him, I can make him talk,\u201d Medichi said quietly. Every muscle in his body was jumping.</p><p>\u201cStannett will fold out of here before you can touch him, you know that.\u201d He sounded so reasonable. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t be able to follow him to the fortress. He can block a trace just like Rith. Would you use your head? Just for one little minute?\u201d</p><p>Medichi wasn\u2019t insulted\u2014not when Thorne was right. From the second he\u2019d realized he\u2019d been staring at a time-delayed hologram of Parisa, that Rith had abducted his woman essentially right from under his nose, Medichi had lost a good portion of his rational mind. He was more beast than man, the darkest parts of his ascended vampire nature in the fore.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t he be? Parisa had been gone from him for three months and guilt was like a gut-eating worm in his soul. Sure, Jeannie might get a fix on her at any time now, but it didn\u2019t change what had happened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thorne cupped the back of his neck and held his gaze in a hard stare. \u201cStannett has critical information about the war straight from his most powerful Seer. All right? If you pull another stunt like this one, I\u2019ll have to take you out of here, but the bottom line is that Stannett requested your presence.\u201d</p><p>Medichi frowned. \u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. So, how about you pull it together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Warrior Medichi,\u201d Stannett said. \u201cI have news that concerns you as well as the woman, the mortal-with-wings.\u201d</p><p>Medichi grew very still as these words settled into his brain. All the previous jumping and twitching melted away along with his urge to pound his fist into Stannett\u2019s pretty face.</p><p>\u201cWe good now?\u201d Thorne asked. He commanded the Warriors of the Blood for a reason. He was damn powerful. Then Thorne smiled, a little off to the side of his mouth. \u201cYeah, I want to kill him, too, but we can\u2019t do it just yet. Not if he knows anything that will help us keep Greaves from taking over Second Earth.\u201d</p><p>Something inside Medichi finally let go. His next breath came from way down deep, and his shoulders settled down. Shit, they\u2019d been tightened into a pair of bowling balls.</p><p>He glanced at the High Administrator of the Superstition Seers Fortress. \u201cSorry, Stannett. Lost my head.\u201d</p> <p>Endelle decided to enter the conversation. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell Medichi what you told me.\u201d</p><p>Stannett drew in a deep breath. \u201cOne of my Seers witnessed something in the future streams about the mortal-with-wings, the woman Parisa Lovejoy, the one with the amethyst eyes. Is this the one you are missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Medichi barked at the same time as Endelle.</p><p>\u201cFor three months now, Stannett,\u201d Endelle said. \u201cYou\u2019d know that if you didn\u2019t spend all your time in that Seers Fortress of yours with your balls in one hand and your dick in the other.\u201d</p><p>Stannett\u2019s left brow rose and he appeared to swallow, bile maybe, or maybe his rage. Endelle could be hard to take.</p><p>\u201cMaybe this was a mistake,\u201d he said, his right arm rising in the air, the universal signal that he intended to dematerialize.</p> <p>\u201cNow, now, Stannett, come off your high horse,\u201d Endelle said. \u201cWe\u2019re here and we\u2019re listening. But what I really want to know is why you\u2019ve broken your silence after all these years. That\u2019s not like you, which means there\u2019s something else going on, something you may or may not want to tell us. In fact, I think it chaps your hide to even be standing here in my office.\u201d</p><p>A dozen thoughts streamed over his face, quiet messages of frustration, anger, maybe a sense of being torn. Finally, he smiled, that oily false smile of his. He lowered his arm then waved the hand as though the visit were casual. \u201cWe need to be better friends than this, Endelle. I\u2019ve always thought so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to be friends with a python.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, Stannett laughed. Medichi had the impression that Endelle could hurl a thousand insults at him and it wouldn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d made up his mind about something.</p><p>He settled an elbow on the mantel of the fireplace, which drew his leather jacket open. Medichi scowled. He wore a red leather vest cut low to reveal a lot of black curly chest hair. He was a strange man, affected, weird. Just looking at him made Medichi uneasy.</p><p>\u201cSpit it out, Owen,\u201d Endelle said.</p><p>\u201cVery well. I shall speak plainly. The future streams have revealed an impending battle, a very big battle.\u201d</p><p>A wind suddenly flew around the room and struck Medichi in the back before moving on. What the hell? His gaze landed on Endelle. Her arms were held aloft and power streamed from her but in no particular direction, just a wind that flowed around the room. It hit him again. Damn. So much power. Yeah, she was a little upset.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean, a big battle.\u201d Endelle scowled and punched at the air with two fists. \u201cLike army-to-army?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I mean, except\u2014\u201d He broke off. He looked serious.</p><p>The flow of wind hit Medichi again.</p><p>Endelle\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cExcept what, Stannett? Would you spit it out, for Christ\u2019s sake. We\u2019re not children here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prophecy is all tied up with the mortal-with-wings and the possibility of her death. Apparently if she dies you lose big-time, and Greaves gains everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what fucking way can this woman, a mortal, not even ascended, be critical to the outcome of a war?\u201d Endelle\u2019s thick black hair was writhing around her shoulders. Medichi had seen her temper a dozen different times, but he\u2019d never seen her hair display her rage before. That was considered a Third Earth ability.</p><p>Stannett looked grim, his mouth a tight line. \u201cThe future streams rarely reveal the why of anything. You know that, Endelle. What I can tell you is that more than one of my Seers has recently predicted a major battle, as well as the failure of your administration, if the woman dies.\u201d</p><p>Medichi couldn\u2019t let this go. \u201cAnd what kind of accuracy rate does the Superstition Fortress have anyway, you motherless piece of shit? And why should we believe anything you have to say. You haven\u2019t helped us in years. Why now? Why would you give a good goddamn fuck now?\u201d He couldn\u2019t bear the thought of his woman dead while the man stood there like he was reading an article on how to make headcheese.</p><p>Endelle turned to face Medichi. She shook her head at him and mouthed a couple of curse words then sent him another blast of wind, this one with grit attached. He breathed the wrong way and drew some of that grit into his lungs. He bent over and hacked like he\u2019d swallowed half a dozen fur balls. Okay, he got the point: He wasn\u2019t helping.</p><p>\u201cMy warrior makes a lot of sense, Stannett. Accuracy is always a problem with Seers, the future being as unpredictable as earthquakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy prime Seer has a ninety-three percent accuracy rate.\u201d</p><p>Silence hit the room. Endelle froze like she was a figure at a wax museum. She wasn\u2019t even breathing.</p><p>Holy shit. Medichi looked at Stannett from his hinged position. He coughed again.</p><p>Time resumed. Endelle\u2019s eyes bulged. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is with this one.\u201d His gaze skated to Thorne, held for the space of two long seconds, then shifted back to Endelle. What the hell did he mean by staring at Thorne?</p><p>Endelle took a step toward Stannett. \u201cTell me this, Owen. Why haven\u2019t you come forward before this? I know you\u2019re an ambitious man, but did it ever occur to you that I might be a better ally than no ally at all?\u201d</p><p>For all Stannett\u2019s frivolous clothes, hair, and even his affected manners, his face suddenly looked made of steel and his gray eyes glinted. \u201cI will never be beholden to anyone, Endelle. That\u2019s how I got this gig. Lots of politicking, bending over at the waist for centuries, taking it deep so that one day I could stand here and say, today, it pleases me to let you have this choice bit of information but that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to get from me.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cFine, Liberace, unless you have any more \u2018choice bits\u2019 to share, I guess we\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>Medichi ran his gaze over Stannett. All that embroidered white leather and fringe. Jesus H. Christ. Had the man no pride?</p><p>Medichi had hated Stannett from the first time he\u2019d laid eyes on him nine centuries ago, when the bastard had ascended. In very monk-like fashion, he\u2019d worn black robes and a solemn demeanor\u2014except he\u2019d styled and pomaded his hair, even back then.</p><p>Stannett licked his lips.</p><p>\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake, just say it,\u201d Endelle cried.</p><p>His gaze shifted to Medichi. \u201cJust save the woman, at all costs. And ... well, make sure she uses her wings to good effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean her royle wings,\u201d Endelle stated.</p><p>Everyone knew about Parisa\u2019s royle wings, and now they knew that Medichi\u2019s were the same. They both had wings that promised in some mystical way to bring peace to the land.</p><p>Stannett nodded. \u201cYes. Precisely.\u201d He lifted his arm and before any of them could press for more information, he was gone.</p><p>Medichi didn\u2019t wait. He closed his eyes and felt the man\u2019s trace, the line of power that followed after him. He focused on the stream of red and black, Stannett\u2019s unique signature, and dematerialized in pursuit.</p><p>But he hit some kind of metaphysical wall and woke up in Endelle\u2019s office on his back staring up at Thorne and Endelle. Shit, how long had he been out? \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Endelle made a disgusted wet sound in her throat and turned away from him.</p><p>Thorne offered him a hand. \u201cWhat made you think you could trace after Stannett? He\u2019s almost as powerful as Greaves.\u201d</p><p>Medichi took the proffered hand. He saw stars as he gained his feet. He took deep breaths. Oh, shit. The future streams had predicted not just Parisa\u2019s death but dire consequences for Second Earth if she died. He had to find her, but what more could he do? It was all up to either Central\u2019s grid, or right now the grid at Militia HQ. Would they find her in time?</p><p>Endelle stared out the window that overlooked the east desert, which stretched for miles. The Superstition Seers Fortress lay some sixty miles in the same direction, to the place also known as Thunder God Mountain. \u201cWhat a poser,\u201d she muttered. \u201cAlthough, I did like some of that embroidery, especially the yellow flowers.\u201d</p><p>As Medichi recovered from his ill-advised pursuit, his mind settled into a loop: Battle coming, must find Parisa, battle, Parisa. \u201cI have to find Parisa,\u201d he said. Had he spoken the words aloud?</p><p>Thorne clapped his hand on Medichi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the grid burning juice at Militia HQ. Hang tough. We\u2019ll find her. We\u2019ll bring her home.\u201d</p><p>Medichi met Thorne\u2019s red-rimmed eyes and saw reflected what Medichi felt, panic laced with despair. Shit, what more could they do to find her? What if Parisa was killed before he could get to her?</p><p>Thorne squeezed. \u201cThe best thing you can do is get back to the White Tanks. Burma\u2019s too big a place for any of us to hunt mile by mile for a shielded anomaly. Head over to the Borderland and take care of business. This is what we can do right now. This is what we can control. Okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Fighting would be best. He\u2019d go mad if he had to sit around for hours with nothing to do but wait for some inexplicable blip.</p><p>\u201cOne more thing, keep a lid on this Seer information for now, until Endelle and I and maybe Colonel Seriffe can work out a strategy, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want the brothers knowing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Thorne scowled. \u201cGot it?\u201d</p><p>Medichi didn\u2019t exactly agree with the decision but yeah, right now his job was focused more on the keep-Parisa-safe part of the model rather than oh-God-Armageddon-is-coming.</p><p>Okay. One fucking problem at a time. Right now that meant he needed to work to keep death vampires from reaching Mortal Earth.</p><p>He folded back to the White Tanks.</p><p>The hour was nine at night in Burma, which meant seven thirty in the morning in Phoenix. Almost time for Antony.</p> <p>Parisa had been opening her voyeur\u2019s window every fifteen minutes, but she focused her efforts on just his bedroom. If she voyeured Antony himself, she was afraid she\u2019d find him battling death vampires\u2014and she really didn\u2019t want those images in her head. She\u2019d made the mistake only once during the early part of her captivity. Once had been enough.</p><p>The Burmese slaves were outside her room. Every once in a while she\u2019d hear a cough or a shifting on a mat.</p><p>She pushed the covers back and rubbed her arms. Her nerves had taken on a life of their own and seemed to climb up her arms, then back down, then up and down. She had been on edge all day, ever since Greaves\u2019s visit. Something wasn\u2019t right, and Rith still followed her with cold eyes. She shuddered thinking about it.</p><p>Her thoughts once more turned to Fiona, as they often had throughout the day. Fiona had begged for her help\u2014but what could Parisa do when she was just as much a prisoner in Rith\u2019s home as Fiona was?</p><p>She rubbed her arms again trying to soothe her fiery nerves.</p><p>Yeah, what could she do?</p> <p>Fiona rarely fought the bindings, but tonight she couldn\u2019t help it. She didn\u2019t care how many times the female assistant, the one with the cruel black eyes, slapped her and hit her. She didn\u2019t want to give her blood one more time. She didn\u2019t want to die again. She didn\u2019t want to come back from the dead again.</p><p>She fought until she felt a sharp prick deep into the muscle of her upper arm. She turned to her left and watched the young male assistant depress the plunger on a syringe. She blinked up at him. He was the one new to the job, the one who perspired into his surgical mask. She\u2019d heard him vomiting more than once. Good.</p><p>Except ... she heard their words now as from a great distance, and though she tried to swing her arms away from their grappling hands, she couldn\u2019t. She felt her arms strapped down hard to the table. She heard the evil woman laugh like a monster, chortling deep and long. She felt the prick on the inside of her right elbow, then the left side.</p><p>They would drain her from the right, then start refilling her from the left. Her eyes closed. She felt so sleepy. Maybe this was a good thing, a good way to die. She even smiled.</p><p>The next thing she knew she stood in a strange place and it was night, although there seemed to be light coming from somewhere. She looked around. She didn\u2019t know where she was. She wore the usual, a tank top and pajama bottoms, nothing else, not even shoes, never shoes. How could a slave escape without shoes?</p><p>A man sat on a bench, a rather smallish man with gray hair. He cooed low in his throat and tossed sunflower seeds to a group of birds clustered around his feet. Pigeons. Black ones, white ones, brown ones, and every mix between. She wrinkled her nose. She\u2019d never cared for pigeons. They nested in every crook and corner of every city in the world.</p><p>\u201cYou must go back, Fiona.\u201d</p><p>The man spoke. He lifted his eyes to her. They were ancient eyes, not lined exactly but surely he had seen a lot of life, much more than her 125 years.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going home this time,\u201d she said. How surprised she was by the strength in her voice, the determination. \u201cToday is my daughter\u2019s birthday. She would have been one hundred and seven. Yes, I know. She was mortal and would be long since buried in the earth, but don\u2019t you see\u201d\u2014she felt herself smile\u2014\u201cthere is nothing for me here. And I\u2019m tired, so very tired. Yes, I want to go home.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head. His lips were compressed and grim. \u201cWe each have a job to do, Fiona. Yours is to live, and I can promise you that something extraordinary awaits you if you\u2019ll but try.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fell to the pigeons. She shook her head. \u201cDo you know what I\u2019ve endured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because I\u2019ve never had to suffer as you\u2019re suffering. I\u2019ve had my own trials, of course. Every human, ascended or otherwise, has trials to endure, some worse than others. But I beseech you to hold on just a little longer. You must live. Think of the young pregnant woman who came in three days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will lose her baby,\u201d Fiona said. Her voice sounded flat. \u201cThe baby never survives the mother\u2019s first death and resurrection.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI understand that\u2019s how it must be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why should I return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a chance she and the baby will survive if you return.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve lost the will to go back.\u201d She felt a tremor flow through her, a deep ache in the center of her chest. She pressed a fist between her breasts. She could hardly breathe. \u201cIt\u2019s begun. They\u2019re using the defibrillator now.\u201d</p><p>The man rose to his feet. He wasn\u2019t very tall, maybe five foot seven to her five-ten. She tried to take a step back but couldn\u2019t move. She glanced down and laughed. She didn\u2019t have any feet. She must be just in spirit form right now. How strange. Maybe she was having one of those near-death experiences.</p><p>Another tremor slammed through her. She cried out. She was in pain now. Terrible pain.</p><p>The man moved quickly and stood beside her. He held her arm and looked deeply into her eyes. \u201cI am begging you with all my heart to go back, Fiona, to live just one more time. Please. It is imperative. You must live. You must try. Do it for the young pregnant woman. She and the others will not survive without your presence. You know what you mean to them. You know how many you kept alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they all died anyway throughout the years. I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s lived this long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stop the death and resurrection process, Fiona, but only if you live. Live, Fiona. Live.\u201d His words seemed fainter, his presence less distinct.</p><p>She took a deep breath and another. A third tremor seized her. The pain felt infinite. She doubled over. She recalled the young woman\u2019s eyes, the latest of Rith\u2019s acquisitions, her fear, her hand pressed to her swollen belly. Could she save her?</p><p>Will you try? She couldn\u2019t see the man anymore, or the pigeons. She could only hear his voice, and even then it was as though he\u2019d spoken inside her head.</p><p>Fiona\u2019s stubbornness sank into the well of her usual guilt. She had to try. She could do nothing less.</p><p>When the fourth shock pummeled her heart, she began to claw her way back from death.</p><p>When the walls have fallen down,</p><p>Open your voice and let your cries be heard.</p><p>Heaven will answer the faint of heart.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Parisa sat up in bed. Something was wrong, so very wrong.</p><p>Help me.</p><p>Fiona. She could hear her. The woman was in trouble somewhere in this horrible house.</p><p>Parisa couldn\u2019t leave her room or the women would wake. They would tell Rith, and he would hurt her. She rarely traveled voyeuristically through the rooms, searching, but she did so now. She had to find Fiona.</p><p>She opened her voyeur\u2019s window and traveled into the hall. The women were lined up in a row on the floor, all asleep, each head aimed in the direction of her doorway. Better to hear her if she awoke.</p><p>She moved her window past them until she came to Rith\u2019s office. She paused outside the doorway to listen. She heard a soft rasping sound. She moved her window into place and saw Rith in the corner, his back to the doorway. His right elbow was moving rhythmically, his head bowed, his body tense. At first she thought sex, but then he lifted something into the air that glinted in the lamplight of the room.</p><p>A blade. He\u2019d been sharpening a blade. He tested the chiseled edge with his thumb and smiled.</p><p>She backed her window out of the room and realized she was breathing hard, her heart pounding in her chest. Was he coming for her? She had no way of knowing except that her instincts were screaming.</p><p>Whatever. Right now she needed to find Fiona.</p><p>She moved past the doorway to the end of the hall. She hadn\u2019t been beyond this doorway in life and for some reason, she couldn\u2019t move past doors like this. She couldn\u2019t explore a place she had never been.</p><p>So she focused instead on Fiona. Having seen her, having been with her in the garden, there was a good possibility she\u2019d be able to find Fiona through the special window.</p><p>She closed her eyes and concentrated. She relaxed her mind and focused on the beautiful woman with the chestnut hair and silver-blue eyes.</p><p>The window opened again, but in a completely unknown space. She seemed to be at the far end of a long stone hallway lit by three large overhead round globes. Parisa moved slowly down the hall and panned left and right. Women of all nationalities were held in the cells, all curled in the fetal position, all asleep. There were six in all, but a seventh bed was empty.</p><p>The space expanded to include a large glass-enclosed area, maybe fourteen feet by fourteen, large enough to hold a table upon which a woman was strapped down, several carts of what looked like medical equipment flanking the stone wall, and a man and a woman both in medical scrubs standing nearby.</p><p>Her heart pounded again as she brought her window closer and closer to the room. She became focused on the woman on the table, whose hair was a lovely flowing chestnut. Fiona ... who stared up at the ceiling, her eyes glassy, her skin terribly white. She looked ... dead.</p><p>No, no, no.</p><p>Beside the bed were bags of ... blood. Fiona\u2019s blood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A faint alarm went off. The technician standing to the right of the bed, a man, held the familiar paddles of a defibrillator. Another sweep of the room and Parisa saw that a bag of blood was now flowing into Fiona\u2019s arm, apparently to replenish what had been taken from her. The technician to the left of the bed capped off the drained blood. They were quiet as they worked.</p><p>Two more technicians, also wearing scrubs, arrived by an adjoining hallway. They loaded up Fiona\u2019s blood into two separate large Igloo containers. Within a minute they were gone.</p><p>Talk about an efficient process.</p> <p>She panned back to Fiona. The remaining two technicians, a man and a woman, performed basic CPR and occasionally jolted Fiona\u2019s bared white chest with the defibrillator. There was such an air of boredom surrounding the woman that for her it must have been the same-old, same-old. The man was sweating. Not so indifferent.</p><p>The woman took a loaded syringe and stuck the needle into a connector to the IV. She waited, glanced at the man with the paddles. She nodded once. Fiona got hit again, hard, her body bouncing on the table.</p><p>She had to be dead. Her lips were blue.</p><p>Then her chest rose and fell. Parisa could hear a groan. Fiona\u2019s eyes rolled in her head.</p><p>The woman still looked bored. The man put the paddles back onto the machine.</p> <p>The woman struck Fiona a few times across the cheek and yelled at her.</p><p>Fiona\u2019s eyes opened, rolled a little more. The woman held a cup to her mouth, the contents of which were red. Fiona tried to fight it and the liquid, very thick, rolled down her chin and onto her bare breasts.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Fiona whispered. \u201cPlease, no.\u201d</p><p>The woman slapped her a few more times. The man grabbed her arms and pinned her. They forced her mouth open and succeeded pouring the liquid ... had to be blood ... down her throat. Fiona coughed and sputtered. They released her.</p><p>But the blood was magical. Color returned in a swift wave over Fiona\u2019s body, and within seconds she was the picture of health. A few seconds more and she writhed on the bed and moaned. The woman laughed at her but released the restraints.</p><p>Fiona pressed her arm deep between her thighs and turned on her side as she worked her arm back and forth. A few seconds more and she cried out. What had they given her?</p> <p>Oh. God.</p><p>If Parisa understood what had happened, Fiona had just orgasmed, hard. What kind of blood was that?</p><p>A few minutes later, the techs gathered up all the medical equipment, turned the lights out, and left her on the table. Parisa drew close to the woman and looked down into her face. The soft light from the hallway lamps revealed dull eyes and no tears.</p><p>Parisa waited with Fiona. To leave seemed cruel. She couldn\u2019t converse with her, reach her, or comfort her, but she understood her despair so she stayed.</p><p>\u201cI can feel someone there,\u201d Fiona whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t know how, but I can.\u201d</p><p>Parisa jumped, and her window flickered. She brought it quickly back in focus.</p><p>\u201cI must have startled you. I\u2019m not sure who you are or why you\u2019re watching me, perhaps you\u2019re the woman in the garden. Your name is Parisa, right? I felt your power when we clasped arms. If this is you, please help me. My name is Fiona Gaines and I was taken from Boston in 1902. I was one of the first that Rith experimented on. I\u2019m a D and R slave: death and resurrection. Although, Rith usually calls us blood donors. So clever. Please find me and take me out of here. I\u2019m begging you. Please.\u201d Her eyes closed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this again. Please.\u201d She released a heavy sigh. Not long after, she fell asleep.</p><p>Parisa waited for a few minutes then explored the space a little more. Opposite the large glass-enclosed room was a staircase that probably led up to Rith\u2019s home. She was sure of it when the door at the top of the stairs opened and Rith appeared. He looked down into the room. He waited for a moment, then, apparently satisfied with what he saw, he closed the door.</p> <p>Parisa in turn closed her preternatural window. Fully back in her room, she stared at the wall opposite her bed. The familiar statue of Buddha greeted her. She had come to love the gentle, peaceful expression on the man\u2019s face. Rith had told her that the statue was from Mandalay and very old, over a hundred years now, and made of brass. This Buddha was lean, peaceful, intelligent looking. She always felt calmer when she looked at him.</p><p>What would Buddha do?</p><p>The thought made her laugh. Still, inherent in the absurd question was something she needed to know.</p><p>Yes, what would Buddha do?</p><p>If Buddha had just witnessed what Parisa had seen through her voyeur\u2019s window, what would he do?</p><p>The next question made perfect sense: What would Parisa do?</p><p>She kept staring at the statue and thinking of Fiona. She could draw only one conclusion about what she had just witnessed, and the thoughts that now ripped through her mind made her sick. She put a hand to her mouth and took a few deep breaths.</p><p>Rith had somehow perfected the process of killing these women\u2014in order to harvest dying blood\u2014then bringing them back to life to do it all over again. She did the math. One hundred and twenty-five years. Fiona had given dying blood for 125 years. She\u2019d been kept prisoner, in this house, for over a century, held captive by Rith.</p><p>Parisa tried to conceive of an incarceration that long. She had only been held prisoner for three months, and already she saw the signs of her captivity: her lack of appetite, a hateful sense of powerlessness, and a steady diminishing of her will.</p><p>That Fiona, after 125 years, had attempted an escape meant something.</p><p>Parisa\u2019s heart rate rose. New thoughts began to flow through her mind\u2014of her royle wings, of her preternatural voyeurism, of her emerging powers. Yes, Rith was powerful, but so was she. So it was possible that her sense of helplessness in this situation was an illusion. No one held a knife to her throat, just the threat of one.</p><p>Still, if she started down this road, she needed to admit one thing to herself, here and now: She could die. She had felt Rith\u2019s inexplicable rage toward her. She could sense his desire to harm her, and given his belief that slavery was a perfect fit for the female mind and soul, there was no reason to believe he wouldn\u2019t kill her. If only for defying him.</p><p>The world began to look different to her. Even the mahogany floor gleamed a little brighter, and the moon pouring through the slatted blinds laid brilliant stripes on the wall.</p><p>She put her hand between her breasts. She could feel her heart beating out a strong cadence, tougher than before, more purposeful, more hopeful, resolved.</p><p>Something had happened to her while watching Fiona\u2019s terrible ordeal, some internal change she had not planned\u2014but oh, how she welcomed what she felt. Above all, if she could help Fiona, then she would do whatever she had to do ... tonight.</p><p>She pushed back the tightly secured top sheet then slid her legs over the edge of the bed until she could feel the cool polished wood beneath her bare feet. She looked down and wiggled her toes. Then she flexed her back muscles. Time to fly.</p><p>Somewhere among all the events of the day, change had come to Parisa. From this moment forward, her life would be different, whether she lived as an ascended vampire or as a winged mortal.</p><p>But where she lived no longer seemed important.</p><p>On the other hand, what she did seemed like everything.</p><p>She listened for the sounds of the servants. The women were quiet on their mats, hopefully asleep. One of them was snoring, a good sign.</p><p>She stood up, slid her nightgown off her shoulders, and let it fall to the floor. For what she was about to do, she needed her back unencumbered. And yes, for what she was about to do, she would be perfectly naked since she couldn\u2019t risk moving around the room or opening armoire doors to find a haltered dress to wear. Any of those noises would awaken the servants, which would be a disaster. She understood their loyalty quite well. If they even discovered she was out of bed, she\u2019d be in for it.</p><p>She kept very still as she cleared her mind and began to focus. She opened her voyeur\u2019s window, thought one powerful thought about Antony, and found him at the Cave with the battle-weary Warriors of the Blood. A quick pan around the room told her they were all there, all except Marcus, who probably had the night off. Jean-Pierre sat next to Antony on an enormous brown leather couch against the back wall.</p><p>Antony was staring at the floor, and he looked really mad.</p><p>Jean-Pierre said, \u201cSo we are waiting now to hear from Jeannie for news from Burma.\u201d Jeannie\u2019s name sounded soft and beautiful on Jean-Pierre\u2019s French tongue.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Antony flicked the hilt of the knife on his chest. He\u2019d been battling, she could see that, but to her surprise he wore a kilt and a weapons harness, which meant he\u2019d revealed his scarred-up back to his warrior brothers. Wow. What on earth had shifted in the past few hours to have wrought such a huge change in the warrior?</p><p>But the question was, could she communicate with him telepathically? After months of trying and failing, could she do it now?</p><p>She smiled. Yes, things had changed within her.</p><p>Antony, she sent, hard and forceful.</p><p>She watched him sit up. Parisa? he returned. He scowled and looked around.</p><p>I\u2019m here. Outside Mandalay. I\u2019m flying through Rith\u2019s double dome of mist and you\u2019d better be here. Now repeat what I just said. Say it to Jean-Pierre who\u2019s sitting next to you.</p><p>He turned to Jean-Pierre. \u201cI\u2019ve just heard from Parisa.\u201d He tapped his head. \u201cShe\u2019s flying through two domes of mist, she\u2019s near Mandalay, and I\u2019d better get my ass over there.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre\u2019s eyes went wide.</p><p>Telepathically, Antony sent, When are you doing this?</p><p>In about two minutes.</p><p>Shit. I\u2019m coming.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s rumble,\u201d he said aloud, jumping to his feet.</p><p>Medichi looked at his warrior brothers. They\u2019d battled all night and everyone was exhausted. Havily had come and gone with some coffee and pastries so they\u2019d tanked up, but still. Were they up for this?</p><p>\u201cParisa\u2019s escaping ... now. She just told me, in my head.\u201d</p><p>All movement ceased. Bodies rose slowly off stools and leather couches.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Zacharius cried. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMandalay, Burma. Second Earth. Shit. What do I do?\u201d But as soon as the words left his mouth, he whipped his card-like warrior phone from his pocket and thumbed Central.</p><p>\u201cCentral,\u201d Jeannie\u2019s voice came on the line. \u201cHow can I serve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeannie, I\u2019ve just heard from Parisa. She\u2019s in Mandalay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d He heard tapping. \u201cI\u2019m moving the grid as we speak. There we go. There we go. Give me a minute, probably less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry, Jeannie. We\u2019re in trouble.\u201d</p><p>He focused on Parisa and sent, You\u2019ve got to narrow this down for us if you can. Which side of the city?</p><p>Just past the outskirts at the southern end.</p><p>\u201cSouthern end,\u201d he said into the phone. To Parisa, he sent, Are you on Second Earth? He wanted to be sure.</p> <p>Yes. But Antony, there\u2019s something you must know. Rith keeps other women here, as blood slaves. I saw how he did it. He causes their deaths while he harvests their blood, then he brings them back to life. One of the women, Fiona, was abducted from Boston. She\u2019s been here since 1886. Can you get her out as well? All of them?</p><p>Oh, God. Blood slaves. So they existed. Now it all started making sense, how Greaves was able to turn so many High Administrators as well as members of COPASS. He must be using these women to provide dying blood. There had been rumors for years. Now there was proof.</p><p>But as much as he wanted to, he couldn\u2019t make these unknown women his priority. He knew nothing about Rith\u2019s security setup, or the layout of the building, nothing. And right now, Parisa was his primary concern.</p><p>I\u2019ll talk it over with Thorne. But we\u2019re going to take this one step at a time. Let\u2019s get you out of there first.</p><p>Right. Right.</p><p>God, had it really happened? And how had Parisa been able to speak into his head? What had changed? What had happened to make the impossible possible? But then who cared? I\u2019m on my way.</p> <p>To Jeannie, he said, \u201cListen, Parisa spoke of being beneath two domes of mist. I know her signature doesn\u2019t show up on the international grid, but Rith\u2019s might. He\u2019s a powerful SOB. Maybe that will show up on the grid as something unusual. Do you have Mandalay in front of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Scanning the southern sector now. Come on. Come on.\u201d</p><p>To his brothers, he said, \u201cAnd which of you is coming with?\u201d</p><p>As one, they drew into a half circle around him, Jean-Pierre beside him. Words weren\u2019t necessary. His chest took their joint support and loyalty as a heavy-fisted blow. Shit, his eyes burned. He glanced at Thorne. No one could go anywhere without his permission.</p><p>All the warriors turned toward him. Thorne\u2019s mouth was a thin grim line, but he nodded and said, \u201cWe all go.\u201d</p><p>Medichi lifted his chin. \u201cWe\u2019ll materialize nearby and I can\u2019t tell you what to expect. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll face death vampires or what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, yeah!\u201d Luken cried. \u201cBring \u2019em on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeannie,\u201d he pleaded into the phone.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve found it. It\u2019s enormous\u2014it\u2019s like the time Kerrick went to that medical complex and a huge part of the parking lot was held in some kind of misted disguise. I thought only Greaves had this kind of power. No wonder Rith was able to take her. And did you say a double dome of mist? Holy crap.\u201d</p><p>Medichi ignored this speech, one of the longest he\u2019d ever heard Jeannie make. He addressed the only important element. \u201cYou\u2019ve got seven to fold.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at them all, overwhelmed by the support the brotherhood gave him. Jean-Pierre nodded. Luken put a fist against his chest. Zacharius and Santiago, almost as one, took their daggers from their weapons harnesses and held them aloft. Kerrick smiled, that knowing look that only a warrior caught in the breh-hedden could possibly offer, a look full of sympathy and hope. Thorne\u2019s jaw worked. \u201cLet\u2019s go get your woman.\u201d</p><p>Jeannie gave a cry. \u201cI\u2019ve got the coordinates. But there\u2019s one powerful signature there. Has to be Rith. You boys ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, yes, Jeannie.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re on our way, Parisa.</p><p>I\u2019m outta here, she sent.</p><p>Medichi took a deep breath. \u201cFold us now, Jeannie.\u201d</p><p>The vibration began.</p><p>Parisa slipped past the three servants outside her room, moving on tiptoes until she was outside on the back lawn of the garden. A gentle rain descended through the air, which meant beyond the domes a real storm could be pounding the land. Oh, shit. Then again, she didn\u2019t really care. The time had come. Rith had it in for her and Fiona needed someone to get her out of her blood-slavery prison.</p><p>Her heart beat like a jackhammer, and serious vibrations rocked her chest. She panted and almost couldn\u2019t catch her breath. It occurred to her that if she didn\u2019t calm down she\u2019d never be able to mount her wings\u2014and up was the only way out of this prison.</p><p>She\u2019d been testing the interior dome of mist for weeks now, rippling her hand as she flew. There was nothing about it that felt impenetrable. She just hoped the second dome was as forgiving.</p><p>From what she had experienced with mist, however, its purpose wasn\u2019t so much physical as a mind-bending disguise.</p><p>Besides, even if she struck a brick wall traveling at top flying speed, she just didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d made her decision. She was leaving her captivity now.</p><p>She closed her eyes and focused on the apertures of her back. She blocked everything else out. She felt the weeping begin, the release of fluid that would allow the feathers and superstructure to emerge. She smiled.</p><p>She voyeured Medichi and her heart leaped. He stood on the bank of a rice paddy, the Warriors of the Blood flanking him on either side. A storm raged and as lightning flashed, lighting up the night sky, he suddenly looked like a god, so tall, muscular, his expression fierce.</p><p>Antony? she sent in that new forceful way.</p><p>Parisa, are you ready? We\u2019re here, all the brothers. We\u2019re waiting for you. I can see the dome of mist. Are you safe?</p><p>Yes. I\u2019ll be flying straight out the top, but you\u2019d better come get me. I\u2019m not wearing anything.</p><p>She closed the window and shut her mind down.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Parisa?\u201d Rith\u2019s voice spoke calmly from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the nude? This is repulsive behavior. Besides, it\u2019s raining. Put some clothes on first.\u201d His English really was perfect.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. She enjoyed speaking the lie. She closed her eyes and willed her wings to come with a single thought.</p><p>Out they flew straight from her back, into full-mount in an easy motion she had never known before. Hells, yeah! She had changed.</p><p>She launched and flew straight for the top. She heard growling behind her, and a quick glance showed her that Rith had stripped off his shirt and was even now mounting his wings.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>She smashed through the interior dome of mist. Rain struck her face and dragged at her wings, but she beat them frantically. As she headed toward the second dome, she kept feeling a hand grabbing for her feet.</p><p>She plowed through the second barrier and the storm hit her full in the face. Rain and wind caught her wings, sending her spinning. She worked to remember what Havily had taught her. She stretched one wing out, brought in the other and leveled, but the wind caught her again and sent her into a second spin. At the same time, the rain pounded her.</p><p>Once she righted herself, she saw Rith heading straight for her.</p><p>She began to tumble again back toward the dome of mist. But before she had gotten far, she saw that it wasn\u2019t Rith at all, but Medichi who flew toward her, his wings huge, rain beating on him, his face more determined than she\u2019d ever seen him. She concentrated and pulled one wing in briefly then fluffed them both. The tumbling stopped and she righted herself even though she pitched back and forth in the wind. She shivered.</p><p>The next moment Medichi was next to her and took hold of her hand. He became a tremendous anchor. Even though she pitched about wildly, she knew he would hold her steady.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything. He just started pulling her into the wind very gently, then down slowly toward the earth.</p><p>\u201cBring your wings into close-mount if you can,\u201d he shouted above the noise of the storm. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Yes, keep doing that.\u201d She struggled to bring her wings in and not flip over or start to roll to one side or the other. She was soaked head-to-toe, feather-to-feather.</p><p>She kept her gaze fixed on him, nothing else. He was so powerful and manipulated his wings with centuries of experience as though each sudden shift of wind, each onslaught of rain were but a bump. The adjustments he made were brisk, small, and kept him floating in the air without the smallest sign of distress.</p><p>She, on the other hand, felt like she was in a washing machine on the agitation cycle.</p><p>Lightning flashed through the sky above. She gasped and almost lost her equilibrium again\u2014but this time for a different reason. Antony\u2019s cream-colored wings were streaked through with reds and oranges, blues and greens, as though lit on fire. The colors moved, flying from feather to feather in a pattern of ever-changing flames. Strands of his hair had come loose from the ritual cadroen and flew about his face. He looked like Zeus half standing and half floating in the air, his hand extended to her.</p><p>The closer she drew her wings to her body, the more she started to lose altitude, but he held her aloft. \u201cNow the rest of the way and I\u2019ll catch you.\u201d</p><p>She had to trust him but she gave a cry as she drew her wings in to close-mount position and started to fall. Then he caught her very gently around the full circumference of her wings, shifting to cradle her in his arms. His concentration was fierce as he battled the monsoon. He headed toward the earth, diving closer and closer to the ground, toward the rest of the Warriors of the Blood, all in black leather kilts and harnesses.</p><p>Closer. Closer. When his feet touched the ground, she closed her eyes and sighed. Tears dribbled from her rain-soaked face.</p><p>She watched as Medichi brought his wings into his back, awkwardly at times because of the weather. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her nakedness was covered by her wings as he set her on the ground. \u201cYou have to draw your wings in before we can fold out of here.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at all the warriors. \u201cI ... I\u2019m not wearing anything.\u201d Then she laughed. Who cared? She was outside the prison she had endured for three months, and she was still alive. Antony was holding her in his arms. What else mattered?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She nodded and smiled. Rain ran down his face. She touched his cheek just to make sure he was real. He turned into her hand and kissed the tips of her fingers. She felt him sigh.</p><p>When he set her on her feet and she begun unfurling her wings, he lowered himself to his knees, still facing her, and put his arms around her in order to shield her chest and support her against the wind and rain. In the glow of each bolt of lightning, the scars of his back were visible, a sheet of silvery lines and ridges.</p><p>She put her hands on his back, splaying her fingers. She closed her eyes and with the wind whipping her wings around began what turned out to be a painfully slow process of bringing her wings into her back.</p><p>The warriors didn\u2019t pay attention to her. They moved to form a protective circle all around her, facing outward, swords drawn in case the enemy attacked.</p><p>At long last, her wings finally retracted. But as the powerful ripples that formed her wings from nothing began to settle into her muscles, Rith appeared at the top of the dome, his wings barely moving. He retreated into the mist when he saw Antony and the other warriors.</p> <p>\u201cDo I take the bastard?\u201d Santiago cried.</p><p>Thorne grunted. \u201cNo. We\u2019re here to get Parisa home safe. That\u2019s all that matters right now.\u201d</p><p>As Medichi rose and encircled her in his arms, lightning set his face aglow. A long roll of thunder powered over the land.</p><p>She looked up into his face as he petted her cheek.</p><p>Jean-Pierre shouted into his phone. \u201cWe have her, Jeannie. Bring us home. To the front lawn of Medichi\u2019s villa.\u201d</p><p>Parisa closed her eyes.</p> <p>The villa. She had dreamed of Antony\u2019s home for weeks.</p><p>The vibration began, followed by the long, swift glide through nether-space.</p><p>The moment Medichi felt the front patio of his villa beneath his heavy battle sandals, he didn\u2019t wait to speak with any of the warriors materializing around him. His woman was completely nude, soaked, and shivering.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s daytime here,\u201d she murmured through chattering teeth.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He moved to the entrance, shoved the massive door aside, and once in the foyer slammed it shut behind him. He took long brisk steps as he carried her down the hall to his bedroom.</p><p>He took her straight to the shower, fearing she was cold. He flipped on the row of lights above the broad mirror but turned the dimmer down low. With her still clutched in his arms, he shifted her to one arm with her feet dangling off the floor. She didn\u2019t protest.</p> <p>He turned the water on and set all eight heads to flowing. Only then did he dare set her on her feet, draw her face away from his chest, and look at her.</p><p>She tilted her head back. \u201cAntony,\u201d she whispered. She was soaked and trembling. \u201cWe have to go back for them.\u201d</p><p>He smiled because it wasn\u2019t what he expected her to say. He expected her to rail against her captivity, maybe even to thank him for showing up. Instead, she was concerned about the fate of other women.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThorne and I discussed it while we waited for you outside the domes. Jeannie\u2019s doing a satellite feed to see if Rith brought any death vampires in. If not, the warriors are headed back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good. Good.\u201d Her teeth chattered.</p><p>She needed to get warm. Maybe it was shock, or maybe she was just chilled. Maybe both. Didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>He still had on his leather battle flight gear. He thought about folding it off, but he didn\u2019t want to scare her by having a suddenly naked man in the shower with her.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the temp?\u201d he asked as she held out her hand to the water.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Only then did he turn her so that her back could feel the spray. She nodded and put her hands palms-up behind her. She wiggled her fingers. \u201cOh, that feels good.\u201d She took a step into the spray.</p><p>He smiled and stepped away ... about three inches. He knew she needed space, probably wanted space, but he couldn\u2019t seem to make himself move. He just stood there, his back and kilt getting hit by the spray.</p><p>She just looked at him, her amethyst eyes dark in the low-lit room. She moved back another inch and tilted her head so that the water flowed down her hair. She closed her eyes. She looked ... dreamy.</p><p>He made a big mistake but couldn\u2019t seem to help himself. He took a long journey down her neck, down her chest, and came to a full stop at her breasts. He had forgotten just how, well, stacked she was. And his eyes bulged.</p><p>Her breasts were drawn into tight peaks. Kissable peaks. Suckable peaks.</p><p>Oh, shit. In his urgency to make her safe, to get her the hell out of Burma, he\u2019d forgotten about this part of the arrangement, the mind-numbing need he had to possess her body.</p><p>His gaze fell farther and his lips tingled as he watched rivulets of water circle, run into, then fall away from the most beautiful navel in the world. A shallow lake formed at the base of her belly button; he wanted his tongue right there, sucking the water into his mouth.</p><p>His gaze wandered a little more, down and down, landing on the nest of her hair and staying there.</p><p>Only then did he realize the steamy room had filled with a delicate tangerine scent. Only then did he remember what his presence did to her. Only then did he nearly double over in agony as a sudden fierce erection fought with his kilt and the snug briefs he wore under it.</p><p>Jesus H. Christ.</p><p>First love,</p><p>Oh, the thrill</p><p>But savor what may not last.</p><p>Yes, savor.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Parisa was right where she wanted to be, more than any place in the entire world ... in two worlds.</p><p>She smiled and let the warm water heat up her chilled skin. She took a deep breath and there it was, the one thing she could not experience when she voyeured Antony: his sage scent. The strong masculine smell pierced her brain and sent shivers over her entire body.</p><p>Her knees buckled and she would have fallen but he was suddenly there and caught her. He still wore his black leather kilt and battle sandals in the shower, but her hands landed on his bare chest. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Sort of. He was pressed up against her. She could feel him, all of him. His erection was a hard line up past her belly button. His height and long legs put her at a disadvantage unless she wore heels, stilettos maybe. She\u2019d always felt gangly at five-eleven but his height made her feel petite. \u201cMy knees sort of gave out.\u201d She couldn\u2019t tell him why because suddenly her cheeks were on fire.</p><p>He had been her fantasy for well over a year now, from the moment she had first voyeured him. She had thought of him as belonging to her, even all those times she\u2019d watched him take women into the red velvet booths at that naughty club, the Blood and Bite. She understood the needs of a man and she felt his need right now.</p><p>The only question was, what was she going to do about it?</p><p>Three months ago, she had been prepared to leave him behind\u2014the world of ascension had been too brutal for her. She had intended to refuse ascension and return to her quiet, solitary library life.</p><p>But three months in captivity, added to her discovery of what Fiona Gaines had endured since the late 1800s, had shifted something inside her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go back to Mortal Earth, not now, not ever. It wasn\u2019t so much that she believed she belonged on Second Earth; rather, she had a job to do, and she could only do it if she chose this world here and now. Maybe choosing ascension would mean an eternity with Antony, maybe it wouldn\u2019t. But right now she wasn\u2019t choosing Antony, she was choosing a sense of duty and purpose.</p><p>But how did this man, this fantasy of maleness, fit into her change of heart? She just didn\u2019t know. The thought of being with him in a real sense, not a fantasy, frightened her\u2014and not because he was powerful. What frightened her was how vulnerable she felt when she was with him, as though the real power he had over her was that he could hold her heart in his hand and crush it, something she had not allowed from anyone since her fianc\u00e9 had walked out on her. She had kept her heart close and safe in the same way she\u2019d kept her friends at a distance.</p><p>She had learned from an early age to live a life of independence.</p><p>But now she was here, in Antony\u2019s shower, with his arms wrapped around her holding her up. From the moment she had first seen him, she\u2019d wanted to kiss him, to press her lips to his beautiful mouth, to see what it would be like to be connected in that very simple way to this powerful warrior.</p><p>He looked down at her now, his arms tense behind her back, his nostrils flaring, but he seemed frozen. Perhaps he sensed her reticence, or maybe he was just being considerate after all she\u2019d been through.</p><p>So she moved. She slid her arm up and around his neck, his thick, muscled warrior neck. His hair was trapped in the cadroen. She leaned up on tiptoes. She drew very close to his face. He searched her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful\u201d came as a soft murmur, a gentle waterfall from his lips.</p><p>She pressed her mouth to his, just so, not hard, not gentle, a first meeting, an invitation, a decision.</p><p>He trembled. She felt it all down his body, in every place he was connected to her.</p><p>He moaned and his body moved serpent-like, a fluid motion of sensation. His arms traveled around her even more, gathering her close. She drifted her mouth from side to side, and his lips parted. She kept drifting until she took his breath into her body and all that sage traveled into her lungs.</p><p>His scent rose inside up and up, then penetrated her brain. She weaved on her feet.</p><p>One of his arms left her back, and he shut off the water. \u201cWill you come to my bed?\u201d</p><p>The decision was already made. She couldn\u2019t deny the man who had saved her life, who had saved her sanity during a period of incarceration, who smelled of heaven and earth blended into one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded.</p><p>He backed out of the shower, still holding her close. Was he afraid she would vanish from his arms? But then why wouldn\u2019t he be? She had done that already when Rith took her from his villa. He had told her of his fears. He had told her during those wicked moments of self-pleasure when he knew she was close but couldn\u2019t hear her.</p><p>Antony, she sent now.</p> <p>He grabbed a towel and wrapped it around her, never losing eye contact or physical connection. I hear you.</p><p>Can you hear all my words now? Can you hear every thought I send? Tell me in a way that I can understand.</p><p>He smiled, and the tenderness in his eyes and in the curve of his lips made something deep within her chest begin to burn with life. \u201cI can hear every thought you send, Parisa.\u201d</p><p>She sent, Every damn fucking horrible thought? She dared him to hear her and to repeat her words.</p><p>The curve became a smile, a grin, a promise of the future. \u201cYes. Every damn fucking horrible thought. But Parisa, what happened? How did you suddenly find your telepathic voice? It seemed like a miracle. But how?\u201d</p> <p>She threw her arms around his neck and held him close. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it, not yet. Oh, Antony, you came for me. You came for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d The towel fell to the floor as he enveloped her in his powerful arms and pulled her against him.</p><p>She almost couldn\u2019t breathe, but she didn\u2019t care. She had been breathing and alone for the past three months. Let him suffocate her with his nearness, with his embrace, with his musky sage scent.</p><p>She turned her face into him. Leaning up on tiptoes, she licked his skin right below his ear. He tasted like something she should eat. She bit and nibbled and he held her tight. He lifted her off her feet and waggled her legs in the air. He turned her in a circle.</p><p>\u201cThere is something I must know,\u201d he said. He set her down and looked into her eyes. All the sudden joy had left his face.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, understanding the question before he spoke the words. \u201cHe did not touch me. No one touched me. I am unharmed in that way.\u201d Because she saw the doubt in his eyes, she added, \u201cRith did not violate me, nor did any of his people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were never harmed,\u201d he stated.</p><p>He stared into her eyes. She knew she could withhold nothing from him. That would be an unforgivable cruelty in her opinion.</p><p>\u201cTell me what your eyes are saying,\u201d he said. \u201cSpeak the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRith disciplined me into obedience. He invaded my mind when I displeased him. It hurt. Badly. I learned very quickly to do as I was told and to follow the schedule. Rith was very big on schedules.\u201d</p><p>His jaw worked until it became a tremor. He began to shake until he had to release her. His hands formed fists and he lifted his head and released a cry to the ceiling. He cried out again and again. The cries became howls until the mirror shattered and fell straight down onto the black marble sink.</p><p>Only then, as the glass fell, did the anguish seem to expel from his body.</p><p>She moved toward him. His eyes were glazed, sunken, his cheeks gaunt. He needed time to heal as much as she did.</p><p>She put her hands on his chest. She rubbed his skin and let her fingers drift over the fine black hair between his pecs, something she had wanted to do for so long. She bent her head and began to kiss the round, fierce strength of his muscles. She licked and kissed and stroked. She lowered her cheek and rubbed her face against his chest. His hands rested lightly on her shoulders.</p> <p>His body grew stiff and unyielding. \u201cI failed you,\u201d he said. His voice had a dead quality. He had retreated someplace very dark.</p><p>She dipped lower and ran her tongue over his nipple. Then she bit him. Hard.</p><p>He pulled back and cried out. A heavy scowl rode his face, pulling down. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, you think you need to be punished for not being all-powerful. So I punished you.\u201d</p><p>A half laugh broke from his throat, but he shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it was like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know what it was like for me. I survived without going mad because I could turn to you day or night and see you, voyeur you. And every night when I went to bed, we\u2019d make love even though we couldn\u2019t touch. I\u2019m alive, my mind is functioning, because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been lax that day ... I allowed you to wander too far away from me. I had my back to you while I talked to Thorne. I was foolish. If it had been anyone other than Rith, you could have been raped, or worse.\u201d</p><p>His eyes grew distant once more. Instinctively, she knew that he wasn\u2019t just thinking about her and his failure to keep her safe on his property. But wherever he had gone pissed her off. She had no intention of letting his memories affect this moment, or her gratitude, or her desire.</p><p>She stepped back from him. Using both hands, she cupped her breasts and rubbed her thumbs in slow circles over her nipples.</p><p>He blinked and frowned. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m doing. But you didn\u2019t get to watch me. I was the voyeur. I saw your long fingers work your cock but you couldn\u2019t see me. I want you to watch this time. I want you to see what I did to myself. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d</p><p>He drew in a long deep breath. His gaze fell to her breasts and her thumbs. A heavy wave of sage rolled over her; she had to step back to keep her balance. She smiled.</p><p>\u201cTangerine,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI know that\u2019s what you smell, Antony, when I\u2019m near. You suck the tangerines, because that\u2019s what I would taste like in your mouth, that\u2019s why you plunge your tongue inside while you come. Tell me I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He blinked several times. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. We should talk, figure everything else out. This ... this can\u2019t be wise.\u201d</p><p>She moved one of her hands slowly down her belly and used a finger to rim her belly button. \u201cI want your tongue here.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. Good.</p><p>She moved her hand lower, descending, now sifting her fingers through her dark triangle of hair. She spread her legs and another groan flowed from him.</p><p>He tracked the movement, breathing hard. The smell of sage was so thick in the air that she could taste it on her tongue.</p><p>She leaned forward just a little, slid her finger lower, and dipped it into the core of her body. \u201cThis is what I did, Antony. I pretended this was you, sometimes your cock, sometimes your finger, sometimes your mouth.\u201d She closed her eyes and moaned.</p><p>When she heard a growl, she opened her eyes, but he hadn\u2019t moved. She spread her legs a little more and kept working her finger in and out. She was enjoying the sensation\u2014but what turned her on more was the look that slowly reworked his face. His eyes darkened. His nostrils flared as he sucked in air hard. His fangs emerged.</p><p>Oh, God, his fangs. Her neck throbbed with need in direct response to the muscles of her core. She licked her lips.</p><p>Pleasure now flowed through her and intensified. She was so wet. \u201cAntony,\u201d she whispered. Her gaze skated over his broad shoulders, the sculpted muscles of his pecs, his abs, the lines leading to his groin, the heavy strength of his thighs. She was breathing so hard just looking at him. But when a growl filled the space between them, an orgasm swept over her with such force that she staggered as she cried out.</p><p>He moved to her in a blur, caught her, dragged her against him. He kissed her hard, thrusting his tongue deep into her mouth. His hips drew back and she watched the kilt and briefs disappear, folded somewhere. He was suddenly naked. Just what she wanted.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look anywhere but at the size of his cock, at the veins thick and doing what they did best. She still couldn\u2019t breathe. He picked her up. With a wave of his hand, all the glass shards drifted to the far corner of the sink, a sound like rain. He drew a towel from the rack by the shower and set it down. He planted her bottom on the towel then pushed her legs apart and moved his hips between.</p><p>She settled her hands on his shoulders. Her mind had turned to mush. \u201cDo it, Antony,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI need you.\u201d Damn, she felt ready to cry for no reason, but she had wanted this for such a long time.</p><p>He held his cock in his hand and breathed hard, his chest expanding with each breath. Her hips rocked. She reached down and touched him. He groaned and flinched.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He was holding back. She thought she understood why but she didn\u2019t care. Right now, he belonged to her. She didn\u2019t care what happened afterward.</p><p>She scooted to the edge of the counter, using his shoulder to keep her balance. Sliding her legs around his hips, she rocked her pelvis forward, took his cock in her hand, and guided him to her opening. She made little grunts between pants and cries. \u201cDo it,\u201d she cried.</p><p>He shuddered and began to press into her. He moaned as inch by inch he made his way into her body. He was so damn big and she hadn\u2019t been used in a long time but it was wonderful.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you but ... aw, hell.\u201d He grabbed her buttocks with one hand and shoved into her ... hard.</p><p>She cried out. Maybe it hurt a little; she couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else would I be?\u201d</p><p>His mouth landed on her neck, and he began to suck at her skin. She started maneuvering his lips. She knew what she wanted, where she wanted his mouth. She bent her neck sideways, and when his lips landed over her vein she cried out.</p><p>His hips surged forward then pulled back. Her body shed fluid. He glided, stroked, pushed and pulled. Heaven.</p><p>His tongue rasped over her vein now, long smooth glides. \u201cIs this what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes.\u201d She panted, she moaned, she thrust her hips into his as he surged forward. \u201cTake my vein.\u201d The words were a hushed command from between dry lips. \u201cOh, God. Please, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParisa\u201d tumbled from his mouth. \u201cI want to stop, but I can\u2019t. I feel I should give you time, but I can\u2019t. God help me.\u201d Her neck was wet as he struck. The flash of pain went straight to her core and tightened her as pleasure followed and began to build. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her cries now filled the steamy bathroom. His hips thrust as he began to draw her blood into his mouth. He groaned low and deep in his throat, a rumbling sound that could have been a growl, the sound of a beast taking what was his.</p><p>The smell of him rose and thickened in her nostrils. The orgasm rolled down on her hard and she screamed and cried out. He continued to pump, fast now, grunting. His body moved in a slow wave as he released her vein, his shoulders arching back as his hips moved forward. He shouted as he released into her, his cock thrusting and solid.</p><p>Another orgasm caught her, her core tightening around him again. It sent a shudder through his body and he groaned again as he bent forward and captured her in his arms. He drew her against him, thrusting over and over until sated.</p> <p>She leaned her head on his shoulder, stroking his back, the scars a soft ripple beneath the pads of her fingers. She touched her neck with her hand where his fangs had entered her. \u201cThere\u2019s so little blood,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhen the fangs retreat, they leave a chemical that seals the wound. Did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She drew back and met his gaze. She ran a finger over his lips, the one that had been inside her. He sucked the finger into his mouth and licked in a swirl of sensation. You even taste of tangerine, he sent.</p><p>Oh, Antony. That was ... amazing. You\u2019re ... amazing.</p><p>He released her finger with a sudden pop then smiled. He pushed her damp hair away from her face. \u201cWhat am I going to do with you?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled back, but her heart ached. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She was suddenly filled with the knowledge that difficult things separated them. Though he could enter her and please her, though he could release into her, life had delivered terrible blows through the years, through the centuries. How were they to bridge the divide?</p><p>He was still connected, a large heavy presence in the center of her body. He felt so good. Her legs were still wrapped around his hips possessively, locked at the ankles. She didn\u2019t want to release him. She feared letting him go. Once the connection was broken, where would they be really?</p><p>She knew the past haunted him and that Rith\u2019s ability to steal her right off Antony\u2019s property when he was just a dozen yards away had undermined his confidence. Even so, she knew, she knew, that wasn\u2019t the whole story.</p><p>And her story? Oh, God. She didn\u2019t want to feel like this.</p><p>She leaned forward and once more rested her head on his shoulder. Her eyes burned. She stroked the cadroen, the warrior clasp that bound his hair, then let her fingers drift again to his scarred back. What had happened to mar the perfection of his skin? Had he deserved to be cut and whipped? Of course not. His character was fixed. He was a man of honor. No way he had done anything to earn all those lashes.</p><p>But where could any of this go?</p> <p>She thought Antony should know how uncertain she felt, yet she didn\u2019t want to say it aloud. So instead she unlocked her ankles, drew back, and gave a slight push on his shoulders. He looked at her and frowned slightly. He withdrew his heavy shaft from the core of her, and she barely withheld a gasp. How cold she felt suddenly. And empty. And alone.</p><p>But wasn\u2019t that always the way for her?</p><p>He smiled, albeit crookedly, and lifted her off the counter. He carried her back into the shower, flipped the lever, and started up all eight heads once more. \u201cLet\u2019s get you cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. Damn, he was tall. And muscular. And gorgeous. His expression was so tender, so understanding that her eyes burned all over again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean we have to get married or anything.\u201d</p><p>Great. Just great. He was going to keep being a nice guy. Great.</p><p>Medichi was so screwed. One hundred percent fucked ... up.</p><p>As he poured shampoo into his hands and began to lather up his palms, as Parisa turned her back and he settled his hands into her hair, his heart swelled to about the size of Rhode Island. Jesus, why did he feel so much for this woman?</p> <p>It was the damn breh-hedden, working his body like a mad scientist who knew every button that needed to be pushed in order to set his libido on fire. The shampoo usually had an edgy smell but he really couldn\u2019t tell because all his nose, sinuses, and brain registered was the delicious scent of tangerines. She was a bowl of fruit he wanted to devour.</p><p>He worked his fingers into her scalp and she moaned, her body going liquid again. He tried to keep his distance because his cock was responding to her scent and he was already hard again. Shit, if she saw him like this after he had just filled her full to overflowing, she\u2019d probably land a fist against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cAntony, what are you thinking about? I can\u2019t smell the shampoo anymore, just all this sage you keep shedding like a spice factory.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWell, you\u2019d better get used to it. Let\u2019s get you rinsed off. Close your eyes.\u201d He guided her into the stream nearest her and worked her hair to get all the bubbles out.</p><p>She turned into him, and her gaze fell to his erection. Part of him felt an urge to cover himself for her sake, but the other part was proud of what he was. His hips rolled in her direction. \u201cI would apologize, but...\u201d</p><p>She looked up into his face and her lips parted. Her eyes flared. Whatever this was, it worked both ways. He had expected Parisa to be shy with him: Her general demeanor was restrained. Apparently, he\u2019d been mistaken.</p><p>She gave a squeak and a cry as she flung herself at him. Before he could protest, or think, or do anything else, he had her up against the shower wall, plunging into her, and she was raking her fingernails over his shoulders and writhing.</p><p>He didn\u2019t last long but it didn\u2019t seem to matter since she was screaming at the ceiling as he came.</p><p>Afterward, he took her to bed. She slept cuddled against his side, his arm around her. He wasn\u2019t ready for sleep. The master bedroom was huge, with a den on one side; the other overlooked the back lawn. The shutters were open slightly so that he could see beds blooming with purple lantana and a vine covered with lavender flowers. Yellow verbena punctuated the beds. The occasional hibiscus added its stature.</p><p>The landscape maintenance company would be on his property all day tomorrow with several crews. Rith had made his way onto the property months ago with the cleaning crew, which had allowed him to abduct Parisa right from under his nose. Maybe he should take Parisa somewhere else until the gardeners were gone. Yet his property was vast, including an olive grove, several acres of vineyard, and a formal Italian garden with many hidden alcoves. How could he be sure the crew all left? He needed better security, someone to monitor the comings and goings of the service workers and winery personnel. He\u2019d been so busy trying to get Parisa back that he hadn\u2019t thought all that much about what would be required to keep her safe once she got here.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t trust anyone or anything, and Rith would sure as hell make an attempt to get Parisa back.</p><p>When she moved against him and an unhappy sound left her lips, he glanced at her. Her eyes were still closed, and he wondered if she was reacting in her sleep to his sudden tension. He took a deep breath and forced himself to relax. His gaze rested on her and his heart in turn swelled then constricted. What kind of miracle had happened that had made her extraction possible? How had she suddenly been able to communicate with him, at such a distance, telepathically? How had she even stayed alive?</p><p>He released a heavy sigh, weighted with three months of tortured searching. She was here. She was safe. She was home. Tears touched his eyes.</p><p>He resisted the impulse to draw her closer, to hold her tighter still, to see if he could press her into his skin so that he would never part from her again. She felt so right against him ... but how did she feel about being here?</p><p>Earlier she had pushed him away and he had felt her distance, her profound withdrawal from him. She hadn\u2019t said a word and he hadn\u2019t asked, but he\u2019d understood her without needing to ask the question: It was too soon to be this close, this intimate.</p><p>He was in trouble in more ways than one, and he suspected she was as well.</p><p>His warrior phone buzzed. He slid the card off the marble surface of the nightstand where it always rested, rubbed the front, and murmured, \u201cMedichi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorne wants to patch in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Carla.\u201d He spoke as low as he could, but Parisa stirred beside him. She lifted up on an elbow, and he ran a hand over her damp hair. \u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThorne.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou there, Medichi?\u201d Thorne barked.</p><p>\u201cGive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went back. Thought you should know, the whole place was cleared out. But shit, all that equipment was still lit up like they\u2019d just drained someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Parisa said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rumors were right. That place was a death and resurrection facility. We found bags of blood, tubing, defibrillators, a modern-day torture chamber.\u201d</p><p>Medichi closed his eyes. Something inside his chest gave way. \u201cWas there any kind of data? A computer? Anything?\u201d His voice sounded almost as gravelly as Thorne\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNot a damn thing. There wasn\u2019t even a trace. There were vehicles parked out back. A van or two. We suspect Rith drove off with his slaves, then probably folded the whole lot to another secure location. Tell me you\u2019re not surprised the place was empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Rith is one clever motherfucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Medichi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for going back.\u201d</p><p>He heard a faint rumbling that might have been a you\u2019re welcome, but he couldn\u2019t be sure. The line went dead. Thorne wasn\u2019t exactly a talkative man.</p><p>He pressed the card-like phone to his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Parisa asked.</p><p>He looked down at her and hugged her. \u201cThe warriors went back to Mandalay but everyone was gone. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He felt her sigh, but for a long moment she didn\u2019t say anything. Finally, he asked, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see Endelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, but he felt uneasy. \u201cTomorrow. Maybe give you some time to settle in?\u201d Of all the things Parisa might want right now, so soon after leaving Burma, he hadn\u2019t expected a request to see the Supreme High Administrator of Second Earth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her fingers playing with his chest hairs in the center of his sternum. \u201cNo, I really think I want to see her today, right away. There are some things I need to get settled.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cOkay. If that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded several times, but he could feel that he was frowning. He wanted to argue with her but how could he?</p><p>He released a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll set it up.\u201d</p><p>He called Central and had Carla patch him through to Her Supremeness. She agreed to see Parisa in an hour but barked, \u201cMake sure she has some clothes on this time.\u201d Her laughter rang in his head as he swiped the phone. Endelle shared Parisa\u2019s preternatural voyeuristic talent; either she\u2019d witnessed Parisa\u2019s rescue or Thorne had shared the details with her when he reported in. Either way, Endelle had the worst sense of humor, not to mention timing.</p><p>Parisa rose. \u201cAll set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. One hour.\u201d She reached a half-sitting position on her knees, which unfortunately put her quite magnificent breasts at eye level. His body responded with one giant leap.</p> <p>Her eyes widened. \u201cAll that sage,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He licked his lips. He reached for her but she rolled off the bed, landing on her feet. She jerked the black top sheet to her, wrapped herself up good and tight, then waggled a finger at him. \u201cI want to. I do. But we don\u2019t have time. I need to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>He nodded in rapid-fire motion. \u201cOf course.\u201d But the sheet she\u2019d taken had left him completely uncovered and he now stood at full-mast. So he folded his hands behind his head and smiled \u201cSorry. Can\u2019t really help this.\u201d</p><p>She covered her eyes and started walking mummy-fashion in the direction of the doors. \u201cAre my clothes still in the other bedroom? All my toiletries?\u201d The last week she\u2019d been in his house, Havily had taken her shopping. There was practically a full wardrobe in the guest room waiting for her.</p><p>He wished he\u2019d had the foresight to move everything to his room, but all his thoughts had been focused on bringing her home. \u201cYes, everything\u2019s as you left it.\u201d He sat up and drew the comforter over his lap. \u201cI\u2019m decent now,\u201d he said, but he was smiling. Was decent the right word when all he could think about was what the hell he was supposed to do with a raging hard-on?</p><p>She lowered her hand and looked back at him. She gasped.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ... you look so beautiful like that, with your hair over your shoulders. Antony, you\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d Her gaze drifted down his chest, and he flexed his pecs for her. This time she moaned softly.</p><p>When he growled low in his throat and started to throw the cover back, she gave a little yip then scurried out of his bedroom. He flopped back onto the bed. So this was how it was going to be. All she had to do was compliment him, give him a look or two, and he was ready to grab her and throw her on her back.</p><p>Jesus H. Christ.</p><p>The greatest reward</p><p>Comes to the heart capable of love.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 8</p> <p>Jean-Pierre returned from Burma to the Cave in Metro Phoenix Two with the rest of the brothers. He said good-bye to one warrior after another. When only Kerrick remained, he yawned and said he was headed to his home in Sedona for the remainder of the day to sleep. That was a lie.</p><p>He did fold the distance to the front yard of his home and stood for a moment beneath the fragrant Arizona sycamores, but not for long. He wasn\u2019t sure exactly what had gotten into him, but he felt a pressing need to return to Rith\u2019s home, if only for a few minutes more.</p><p>He folded back to the tamarind tree in Burma, drawing his sword into his hand from his Sedona weapons locker. The double dome of mist still covered the property. He turned in a slow circle, making sure that he was alone.</p><p>He stretched his preternatural hearing but except for the sound of frogs, nothing came back to him. He made his way into the house, again listening carefully and watching every shadow in case a death vampire, or Rith himself, might choose to return to what they all now knew to be a death and resurrection facility.</p><p>As he crossed the living room, the mahogany floor creaked beneath his feet.</p><p>He checked every room, one by one, hunting for the smell that had stuck to him when he\u2019d come back with the rest of the Warriors of the Blood. It was the scent like a bakery or a French patisserie, like fresh-baked buttery bread or perhaps croissants.</p><p>But all he smelled here was garlic and turmeric.</p><p>He sighed as he made his way down the hall. He reached a second shorter hall that led to the basement stairs. He opened the door to the stairwell and once more listened for the sounds of the enemy.</p><p>He heard nothing.</p><p>Crouching, he descended, one quiet foot after another. He sniffed the air and, oui, as before, he could smell the bakery aroma.</p><p>At the bottom of the stairs, he looked right, then left, then right again. No one was there.</p><p>He lifted his nose into the air, closed his eyes, and just breathed. He took several long slow inhales through his nose, scenting the air like an animal. He felt un peu dizzy.</p><p>The largest room was opposite the stairs and still held several pieces of medical equipment: a cart with wheels, two stands for hanging bags of blood or fluids, even the hated defibrillator.</p><p>Mon dieu, the horror of what these women endured. Medichi had told the warriors that one of them, Fiona, had been taken from Boston in the late nineteenth century. He put a fist to his chest. How had she survived such trauma to her heart all these terrible decades? He did not understand the spirit of such a woman, how she had lived only to be killed and brought back to life over and over.</p><p>A shimmering in the air appeared not far from him. Shit. He should not have come. He held his sword in a firm grip as he shifted to face his new enemy\u2014but it was only Thorne.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d Thorne cried. He scowled at Jean-Pierre. \u201cAnd I sure as hell don\u2019t remember you asking for permission to come back here. Now you have two questions to answer.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre had nothing to tell him. \u201cI am not certain why I came,\u201d he said. \u201cI was distressed and felt compelled to return. Perhaps we missed something.\u201d</p><p>Thorne looked around and shook his head. \u201cI had the same damn feeling. Endelle wanted me to come back and have one more look, but goddammit, Jean-Pierre, you should have checked with me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have let me come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Thorne barked. He barked a lot these days.</p><p>Jean-Pierre merely smiled and shrugged.</p><p>Thorne did as well. It was so much like their chef, their boss, their leader. He had a quick temper, but his rage disappeared as fast as lightning.</p><p>\u201cWell, now that you\u2019re here we can have a look around together.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre took his time. He went into every cell, and with each successive room his spirit grew heavier. His anger grew and grew. He raged that such horrible things had been done to innocent women.</p><p>When he reached the last cell, the aroma of bread\u2014no, more like croissants\u2014permeated the room, but he did not know why. There was a vent above, but that was true of all the cells. Had someone baked something recently? If so, then why did not every room smell like this one?</p><p>All that he knew was he wanted to linger, to stay close to the aroma.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Thorne asked.</p><p>Jean-Pierre turned and looked at him. Thorne stood in the doorway, his hands on his hips. He scowled as always, his hazel eyes red and so very sad. He carried a terrible load. Jean-Pierre had no intention of adding to his concerns. \u201cRien,\u201d he responded. \u201cI have found nothing.\u201d</p><p>And that was the truth. Nothing except an aroma of croissants that made no sense in this dungeon of terrors.</p><p>Parisa had just slid into a clean bra and underwear when a knock sounded on the door, but it sounded faint, not like Medichi. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHavily. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>Something inside Parisa\u2019s chest warmed up, as if someone had just turned up the heat beneath a pot. \u201cJust a minute.\u201d She searched for and found a black silk robe in her closet. She shrugged into it as she crossed the room. Opening the door, she smiled.</p><p>Cradled in one arm, Havily carried a huge vase full of at least two dozen white roses. \u201cYou\u2019re home,\u201d she cried. She opened her free arm.</p><p>Parisa burst into tears and fell into that welcoming embrace. Havily held her close and sniffed as well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll spoil your beautiful makeup.\u201d Havily always looked like she\u2019d stepped out of the pages of Vogue. She wore Ralph Lauren, and her red layered hair floated around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, girlfriend. I\u2019ve had no one to fly with.\u201d She sighed as she released Parisa. Moving into the room, she expanded on her theme. \u201cAlison doesn\u2019t have her wings yet and besides that she\u2019s really pregnant now and feeling it. But even if she did have her wings, Kerrick would throw a hissy-fit.\u201d</p><p>Parisa laughed and closed the door behind her. It was very difficult to picture a Warrior of the Blood throwing anything that could resemble a hissy-fit. He might throw a tornado of rage, but a hissy-fit?</p><p>\u201cHow are you and Marcus doing?\u201d</p><p>Havily looked around the room and headed to the table by the window. She settled the vase there. Then she looked back at Parisa. \u201cAre you even staying in this room?\u201d</p><p>Parisa felt her cheeks warm up. \u201cI\u2019m not sure ... no. I guess not.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m here I\u2019ll be at the end of the hall.\u201d She pointed in the direction of Medichi\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>Havily\u2019s chest rose and fell with a sigh. \u201cI thought that might be the case. I\u2019m glad. Parisa, he\u2019s really suffered. Did you know he started drinking limoncello?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI saw him once or twice.\u201d Her gaze fell away from Havily, and her mind grew a little fuzzy. \u201cI found I couldn\u2019t voyeur him as much as I wanted to, not because I was unable but because it just hurt so much to see him and not be able to communicate with him. We kind of fell into this routine that I would voyeur him when I was ready for bed and he was through fighting for the night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t realize Havily had crossed the room until she felt an arm around her shoulders. Then Havily drew her into a big hug and held her for a very long time.</p><p>Finally she drew back. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing I really need to know. Were you hurt? Did Rith hurt you?\u201d Her voice sounded scraped and raw.</p><p>Parisa knew what was on everyone\u2019s mind. \u201cI wasn\u2019t raped. I thought I would be. I thought it would be the first order of business. I guess that\u2019s what a woman will always think when she falls into the hands of a bad man. But I wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why. The truth is, I don\u2019t know why either Greaves or Rith allowed me to live.\u201d</p> <p>Havily shook her head slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t have answers for any of that. We ... I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be coming back. There were so many attempts on your life as it was.\u201d Then a smile suffused Havily\u2019s lovely face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Parisa asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just so damn glad you\u2019re home.\u201d Once more her eyes filled with tears, and once more Parisa was gathered up into a welcoming embrace. But when she drew back this time, Parisa said, \u201cI\u2019m going to see Endelle. That\u2019s where I\u2019m headed once I get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said you were coming to see her. That\u2019s why I thought I\u2019d come by first. I figured if you could see Endelle, you could tolerate a visit from me.\u201d</p><p>Parisa laughed. \u201cI\u2019m going to ascend, Hav. I wasn\u2019t going to, not before I was ... taken. But now I have to find them. I have to search for them. I think I\u2019ll be able to find them because I met one of them, a woman named Fiona. She said she\u2019d been a D and R slave for over a hundred years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cD and R?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath and resurrection. That\u2019s what they call it because they\u2019re drained of their blood, filled with donated blood, then brought back to life.\u201d</p><p>Havily\u2019s eyes grew pinched. \u201cOh, God. So it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Parisa nodded but didn\u2019t match the tears in Havily\u2019s eyes. What good were tears? She needed to get busy, to prepare herself, and to find the women. \u201cI have to get ready now but I\u2019ll see you soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I have to change clothes and head to the palace myself. I work with Endelle four hours a night in the darkening.\u201d</p><p>Parisa nodded. Darkening work was critical for the war effort, and only Madame Endelle and Havily had darkening capability. It meant they could split-self; the second self would travel through a region of nether-space called the darkening and hunt for Greaves. The work was difficult and tedious, but when they found him he always had death vampires ready to fold to Metro Phoenix Two. The more death vampires Havily and Endelle blocked, the fewer the Warriors of the Blood had to battle every night.</p> <p>Havily blew her a kiss then lifted an arm and vanished.</p><p>Parisa took a step back. She\u2019d forgotten how often everyone did that. For the past three months, no one had dematerialized in front of her, not even Rith.</p><p>She moved to the closet and shifted hangers to look through the wardrobe. Half the clothes still had price tags on them. Shopping with Havily seemed like a hundred years ago.</p><p>She paused for a moment and dropped her chin. Wow. She was home\u2014sort of. She was back in Medichi\u2019s villa, but she had another home on Mortal Earth in Peoria, a neighbor of Phoenix. That home would have been vacant for almost four months now, from the time that Marcus and Havily had first materialized into her courtyard to visit her and protect her. Her wings had been in full-mount and she\u2019d been naked. Not long after, Crace had come to kill her.</p><p>For just a moment as she pulled a cornflower-blue silk top off the hanger, all the reasons she had decided back then not to ascend flowed through her. She\u2019d only spent a few days on Second Earth before Rith had kidnapped her, and those days had been nothing short of a nightmare. That experience had been the primary reason she had planned on refusing her ascension.</p><p>At least Crace was dead by Warrior Luken\u2019s hand, thank God, but everything had led her to the conclusion that she wasn\u2019t built for war.</p><p>Then Rith had enthralled her just beyond the white-washed building that housed the olive press.</p><p>She gave herself a strong shake and slipped the blouse over her head. But she was here now, her thinking and therefore her life altered dramatically, and she was about to face the most powerful ascender on the planet, a woman who had venom for blood.</p> <p>She straightened her spine and found a black silk pencil skirt. She didn\u2019t want to face Madame Endelle in something casual. Not when she intended to make at least one serious demand of a woman who never gave ground to anyone without a fight.</p><p>War changed people.</p><p>Endelle looked down at the survivor, otherwise known as Parisa Lovejoy. She had lovely eyes\u2014not lavender, not rose, that place in between. Amethyst.</p><p>Parisa had been taken from the villa three months ago a naive, frightened, overwhelmed young woman. She returned with a fire in her eye that had nothing to do with the warrior at her back.</p><p>Endelle glanced at Medichi. His jawline had turned to stone.</p><p>Huh. This couple had been arguing.</p><p>Arguing among the breh-couples seemed to be an epidemic these days. Alison had thrown a Jimmy Choo sandal at Kerrick and left him with a goose egg for a few hours until his normal preternatural healing kicked in. Havily had been screeching into her iPhone at Marcus most of the day, something about how she needed to be trained with swords, knives, and guns. Marcus was dragging his heels. Leave it to a man to want to protect his woman but not give her the tools to protect herself when the dumbfuck wasn\u2019t around.</p><p>And now it looked like the latest duo slammed with the breh-hedden had already been at each other\u2019s throats, metaphorically and physically, because, wow, Parisa had one bite mark on her neck. Jesus H. Christ.</p><p>The woman\u2019s complexion was flushed, too. She\u2019d gotten good and well fucked. She really shouldn\u2019t be complaining, but here she was all fired up.</p><p>\u201cSo what is it you want, Parisa?\u201d Endelle asked. Funny how when someone else had a rock in her shoe, she could be relaxed and gracious.</p><p>Parisa lifted her chin. \u201cI want to ascend right now. No ceremony, just give me a pair of fangs so I can get on with what I have to do next.\u201d</p><p>Endelle worked at not smiling, but it was tough. So their little librarian had made up her mind and the rest of them could go fuck themselves. She liked the spirit. Hell, she even approved. Ascension wasn\u2019t for sissies. And before her captivity, Parisa had been a little too much on the feminine-sniveling side to please Endelle. But here she was showing some balls.</p><p>Yeah, Endelle approved. \u201cAnd what is it you have to do next that\u2019s got your thong hiked up around your waist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go back for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to Burma?\u201d</p><p>Parisa clamped her lips shut. She even breathed dragon-like through her nose a couple of times. Then she marched in Endelle\u2019s direction, her arms spread about a foot apart, her hands straight out in front of her as though she meant to shake both of Endelle\u2019s hands at once. That or she was trying out a Frankenstein impersonation. Endelle was pretty sure neither was what she intended.</p><p>She was a bit surprised, however, when Parisa drew close enough to stand right in front of her and one extended hand landed on either side of her face. Parisa pushed back Endelle\u2019s yellow headband of cockatiel feathers. The amethyst eyes closed and Endelle felt a hard push against her mind. She really didn\u2019t think the librarian could hurt her, so she released her shields.</p><p>And she really shouldn\u2019t have done that. The images flew like knives at first. She had to remind herself to relax and let them flow. Holy fuck the mortal-with-wings had power.</p><p>Endelle relaxed and the shared memories slowed down. Start over, Endelle sent.</p><p>Parisa took a quick breath and the images ceased. Then they renewed, beginning with a young woman in light blue flannel pajama bottoms and a dark blue tank top racing across a green lawn, begging for Parisa\u2019s help. Tangling with that bastard Rith followed. Later, Parisa woke up with the woman\u2019s name on her lips, Fiona.</p><p>That\u2019s when the nightmare started. Endelle felt her stomach squeeze up in slow stages, hardening into a knot. She watched the whole show, the glass cells in a stone-like dungeon in which all the women lived, then the focus on the woman Fiona who was strapped down on a table, dead, really dead. Eyes glazed, blue lips, white complexion. But the techs brought her back, draining a bag of blood into her and using the defibrillator.</p><p>Finally, Fiona took a renewing breath, blood was forced down her lips, and ... holy shit, was that an orgasm?</p><p>When the woman lay alone in her cell, the images stopped.</p><p>Parisa drew back. She met Endelle\u2019s gaze but tears now tracked down her cheeks. Endelle didn\u2019t hesitate, not even a split second. She grabbed Parisa and hauled her into her arms. She let Parisa cry and didn\u2019t think less of her for it. The whole time she stared at Medichi over the young woman\u2019s head.</p><p>Even Endelle\u2019s eyes leaked a little, and her tears plopped onto Parisa\u2019s head. \u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Parisa whispered. \u201cI was there for three months and I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d The same words flowed over and over.</p><p>She\u2019d heard rumors for decades that Greaves was experimenting with women, turning them into blood slaves, but she\u2019d never believed it was possible. She thought about the small dose of blood the woman, Fiona, had been forced to drink. Without a doubt, Greaves must have been sharing his blood with the donors, not just keeping them alive but helping to bring them back to life. With the increase in preternatural powers, an ascender\u2019s blood gained restorative properties as well.</p><p>When Parisa was no longer trembling or weeping, she pulled away from Endelle. Parisa met her gaze fully once more, but her eyes were red-rimmed and her nose swollen and dripping. Endelle folded a tissue into her hand from the desk behind her and handed it to the young woman.</p><p>Parisa thanked her then blew her nose. \u201cThe warriors went back for the women but all that was left was some of the medical equipment.\u201d</p><p>Medichi moved in close. \u201cThere\u2019s no sign where they went. Not even a trace to follow. He probably moved them to a nearby location by van then folded them elsewhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMakes sense. That\u2019s what I would do.\u201d She looked down at Parisa and slid her finger under Parisa\u2019s chin. \u201cHow do you propose to do what my warriors couldn\u2019t? How do you intend to find them?\u201d</p><p>She sniffed and blew her nose. \u201cI can voyeur them. Well, not all of them, just Fiona, the woman with the dark blue tank top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have everything figured out but we have to do something. Now that I\u2019ve seen the horror they endure, I won\u2019t stop until we have all of them safely here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019re pushing for the ascension ceremony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d</p><p>Endelle nodded. She glanced at Medichi, but the stone of his jaw was still in place. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>His gaze fell to Parisa, and he shifted his jaw around a couple of times. \u201cI can appreciate and certainly approve of the use of her voyeur skills to locate Fiona, to try to contact her, but she\u2019s talking about making the run herself. That\u2019s all she\u2019s been talking about for the last hour. I think it would be foolish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Endelle asked. She was baiting him because sometimes it was just plain fun to watch one of her warriors go apeshit.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he thundered.</p><p>Ah, there it was.</p><p>His face turned a dark, angry red. She particularly loved how Parisa shifted to glare at him. She even planted her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cYes, Warrior Medichi, why?\u201d Even Parisa\u2019s voice had grown stronger in the last three months.</p><p>He began to pace. He moved crazy-fast. She was only surprised steam didn\u2019t flow behind him. \u201cI\u2019ve just gotten her back,\u201d he cried. He flung an arm in Parisa\u2019s direction. \u201cDo you know what the last three months have been like for me?\u201d He froze in mid-step.</p> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d he cried. He pulled his cadroen from his hair and threw it at the plate-glass window. It was a good throw and ordinarily would have done some damage, but she\u2019d put in bulletproof glass after the last time she\u2019d lost her temper. It was on the top floor, for Christ\u2019s sake, and even with the glass company hiring the preternaturally gifted who could levitate, the whole process had taken a week\u2014and it was summer in Phoenix. So, yeah, bulletproof glass.</p><p>His cadroen, made of leather and rhinoceros tusk, plopped onto the closest zebra skin. He stared at it. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to be talking about this. I\u2019m too raw.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to Parisa. He drew close and caught her on the inside of her elbow. \u201cI know I\u2019m behaving like a madman but I don\u2019t want to fail you again, can you understand that? And the thought of you being anywhere near Rith\u2014\u201d He closed his eyes and drew in a long, loud breath through his nose. \u201cWell, the whole thing makes me nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m getting that. But maybe we\u2019d better come to an understanding right now.\u201d Parisa faced him dead-on.</p><p>Endelle had a perfect view of her profile. What was with these brehs? Dammit, they were all so beautiful. But then maybe that was the least these men deserved for the way they had to put their lives on the line every night.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not responsible for me anymore, Antony. I\u2019m making the decision to ascend. I spent the last three months in a really weird kind of captivity but I also learned a lot about this world. Rith had a library, and one of the books I read was Treatise on Ascension, by Philippe Reynard. Do you know the one?\u201d</p><p>Medichi nodded. \u201cA little pompous but he\u2019s got most of the facts right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Reynard, one of the tenets of this world is service, and that is one thing I happen to agree with. I know I\u2019ve been given some strange gifts but I want to serve with them, to do my part. And it\u2019s more than that. The whole time I was under Rith\u2019s domination, do you know what I hated most?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. His eyes slid around uneasily, like he wasn\u2019t sure he was going to appreciate what she said next. Endelle braced herself for another fit.</p><p>\u201cWhat I hated the most was that I was incapable of just leaving\u2014he had enough physical power over me that I couldn\u2019t escape. And I was never once confined with locks or ropes or chains or anything. The doors were always open so that fresh air blew through the house. The domes of mist were so easily penetrated, as you very well know, but I didn\u2019t have the skill to just leave.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d had some of your abilities, your flight skills for instance, I could have flown through the mist, gone somewhere, done something. If I\u2019d had some battle skills, I could have used one of the many sharp knives he kept in the kitchen and made good use of it. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t have mattered because he has a great deal of preternatural ability, but at least I could have tried. I couldn\u2019t even try, Antony.\u201d</p><p>Endelle knew her mouth was agape. Parisa had made a compelling case, and Endelle agreed with her. But what caught her attention was how she called Medichi by his first name, as though she\u2019d been doing it all her life. For some reason that bugged the shit out of her.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest and said, \u201cJust so you know, O winged creature of Peoria, I do get a say in what you do and don\u2019t do once you ascend.\u201d</p><p>At that, Parisa turned toward her, amethyst eyes wide. \u201cWould you forbid me to arm myself or to go after the D and R slaves?\u201d</p><p>Endelle got totally sidetracked. \u201cD and R?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath and resurrection. Perfect epithet. That\u2019s what Fiona called it. The women died then were resurrected with defibrillators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Endelle felt ill all over again. She moved back to her desk and leaned her hips on the edge. The fur she wore itched and she scratched her arms down both sides. \u201cShit, I think I\u2019m allergic to this fur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Parisa and Medichi asked in unison, both noses wrinkling.</p><p>\u201cCoatimundi. We have \u2019em here in Arizona. I\u2019ll have to talk to my taxidermist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaxidermist?\u201d Medichi asked. \u201cYou mean furrier?\u201d</p><p>She slid her thumb under the edge of the vest and scratched. \u201cNo, I mean taxidermist. You don\u2019t think an actual furrier would touch this shit, do you?\u201d She blew air from her cheeks. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s take this one fucking thing at a time. Parisa, we\u2019ll get you ascended, but you\u2019ll have to have a ceremony with witnesses. COPASS has rules about that now. And because you\u2019ve had a Guardian of Ascension, your boyfriend here\u201d\u2014she jerked her thumb in Medichi\u2019s direction\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll have to perform the ceremony myself.\u201d She looked past them and shouted, \u201cAlison.\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later, the blond beauty, breh of Warrior Kerrick, appeared in the doorway. She had dark circles under still-lovely blue eyes rimmed with gold, but she gritted her teeth, her hand pressed to her way-too-big-belly for being seven months with child.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ve got twins in the oven,\u201d Endelle said, scowling at her stomach.</p><p>Alison crossed the threshold but didn\u2019t close the door. \u201cThe doctor only found one heartbeat at four months. She would have found two if there\u2019d been two. Believe me, she worked my stomach over every which way. This baby is just really active, and frankly I blame Kerrick. He\u2019s too powerful. I should never have bonded with him.\u201d She wasn\u2019t even smiling when she said it.</p><p>Alison had gotten knocked up right away and now she was a trifle irritable. Aw, too bad.</p><p>Again, Endelle worked hard at not laughing. \u201cOkay, whatever. Listen up. Parisa is ascending. Set up a ceremony at the palace for tonight at five. We\u2019ll have a sit-down dinner before the warriors head out. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d she muttered as she turned away. The door closed behind her. Shit, she didn\u2019t even say hello to Parisa. The pregnancy had really gotten the better of this usually calm, we-are-the-world therapist.</p><p>Medichi frowned and said quietly, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Endelle shrugged. \u201cHell if I know. She\u2019s been real bitchy for the last few weeks and no, I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019ve never been pregnant. Don\u2019t want to be. At least she\u2019ll get her figure back. That\u2019s one excellent benefit to ascension.\u201d She glanced at Parisa then scowled at her. \u201cI hope you\u2019re using protection.\u201d</p><p>The woman had the good grace to blush scarlet. Then her eyes got very round, as though she\u2019d just thought of it. Terrific. Medichi stared at the ceiling, studying the inset spot-lights. \u201cAll right, get out of my office. I\u2019ll see you both here tonight at five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Madame Endelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, ascendiate, just use your head. One grumpy pregnant woman around here is about all I can stand.\u201d She started to round her desk, thinking she\u2019d better check her emails, then decided to offer Medichi a little advice. \u201cAnd Warrior, for God\u2019s sake, go buy some condoms.\u201d She turned back thinking she might expand on the theme, but the couple were already gone.</p><p>\u201cIdiots,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She rounded her desk to sit in her big comfy executive chair. She leaned against the Appaloosa horsehide she had draped over the back.</p><p>Shit. Death and resurrection slaves.</p><p>Great. Just fucking great.</p><p>Didn\u2019t she have enough to worry about with Stannett\u2019s prophecy about an upcoming battle to end all battles?</p><p>But when all was said and done, that Greaves had developed a medical system by which he could harvest dying blood on a regular basis was some kind of sick-ass genius. So, yeah, D&amp;R slavery made complete sense. How would so many High Administrators and COPASS members ever agree to become addicted to dying blood without the promise of an easy supply that didn\u2019t involve killing someone through a personal use of fangs? Bunch of pansy-ass, goddamn fucking hypocrites. She hated Greaves for a lot of reasons, but she swore she hated these hypocrites more\u2014the ones who would take dying blood because they didn\u2019t have to be involved in either the slaughter or the slavery required for the harvest.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Condoms.</p><p>What a rookie mistake.</p><p>Medichi stood in the foyer of his villa and didn\u2019t look at Parisa. He shoved a hand through his hair then pulled his fingers out and looked at them. He\u2019d left his cadroen in Endelle\u2019s office. He rolled his eyes. Whatever. He pushed his hair over his shoulders to hang down his back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced at Parisa. Her color hadn\u2019t diminished very much. Her cheeks were still bright pink and she was staring at the dark plank flooring.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should go back to the guest room,\u201d she said.</p><p>He drew in a breath that sounded like someone was strangling an animal. \u201cNo\u201d came out half growl, half hiss.</p> <p>She looked up at him and took a step back. She put a hand to her chest. \u201cAntony.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut then turned away from her. \u201cSorry. Just the breh-hedden rearing its ugly head. I ... I have these instincts that just keep getting stronger. You know, like I want to lock you in my bedroom and never let you out of there\u2014for more than one reason.\u201d He stiffened at what he\u2019d just said.</p><p>He whirled back to her. \u201cParisa, I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean ... and I would never do that to you.\u201d He stopped.</p><p>A ghostly white shade had completely replaced the previous flush of her complexion. Her gaze fell back to the floor, this time skating from side to side. \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t. This is an adjustment for both of us. I\u2019ve come back here and I want to ascend but\u201d\u2014she lifted her eyes to him\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t know where I belong, even where I should live. You and I are dating, I guess. I told Havily that I\u2019d be sharing your room but we really shouldn\u2019t be doing that, should we? I mean, I can\u2019t just move in with you. I don\u2019t know anything about you. I know I trust you. Of course I trust you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned then pressed on. \u201cI have to get through the ceremony first, and then I want training. I know Kerrick trained Alison. I guess I should do something like that. I don\u2019t know.\u201d She put her hand to her forehead and turned away from him.</p> <p>Medichi stood very still, afraid that if he took a single step right or left, she\u2019d leave him, she\u2019d choose to live someplace other than beneath his roof, and he couldn\u2019t have that. She\u2019d suffered terribly, but so had he. How could he explain to her that the breh-hedden had been its own prison, that he hadn\u2019t been his own man for the past three months, that worrying about her had consumed his mind, his heart, his every waking action? He\u2019d had only one thought in all that time, to get her back whatever it took. Now she was back and he felt her slipping away from him.</p><p>He was trying to be reasonable, to find his rational thoughts, but fear rode his skin like a current of electricity. Even his jaw felt tight and hinged shut. He knew she needed space. She should have space. But if she didn\u2019t share his bedroom, sleep in his bed, let him feel the weight of her next to him, her hands reaching for him at night, her body pressed against him ... yeah, he thought he would go mad.</p><p>\u201cI have no right to ask,\u201d he said, his voice somehow managing to push past the tightness of his jaw. \u201cBut would you please stay, at least for the next few days. Please.\u201d He swallowed. A rock had lodged itself in his throat. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him and blinked. Her turn to stiffen. Her lovely eyes widened. She didn\u2019t seem to be capable of breath. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d It was a war of whispers.</p><p>She moved toward him slowly. She searched his eyes once more, then put her hand on his cheek. He loved that she was tall. In heels she didn\u2019t have far to go to reach him. Her palm was cool against his skin. Tears glimmered in her eyes. \u201cI ... I forgot for a moment what this has been like for you but I\u2019ve remembered. I wouldn\u2019t be so cruel as to walk out now.</p> <p>\u201cI saw you every night, remember? I mean every morning. I mean it was night for me and morning for you. You would tell me every night what you\u2019d done to look for me, where you\u2019d gone. You gave me hope and that hope kept me sane. I saw how you suffered. I saw you lose weight. I watched the circles under your eyes darken and deepen. I didn\u2019t even think that was possible for an ascended vampire, but a lack of sleep will do it, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He lifted a hand and slid it over hers. He pressed gently.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give this some time,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t leave your home, not now, not yet. We\u2019ll take this one step at a time. I can feel your distress and I can see your need. I won\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll share my bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll share your bed.\u201d She paused. \u201cFor a few days, maybe a week. Okay? Until we get everything figured out.\u201d</p><p>He moaned and dragged her into his arms. He held her close. She wiggled against him, straining. At first he thought she wanted him to release her, but when he gave her a little room she threw her arms around his neck and held on.</p><p>Christ. This was too much emotion for people who knew so little about each other. He closed his eyes. He could feel her heart beating in her throat, dull heavy thuds. His neck was getting wet. What a mess. Goddamn the breh-hedden.</p><p>The one taken suffers the most,</p> <p>But do not forget the warrior left in the breach.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>That evening, Parisa stood in the center of the rotunda floor, Havily behind her and to her left, Antony back and to her right. The rest of the Warriors of the Blood were ranged another ten feet behind her, standing tall and straight, sentinels of Second Earth. Each, like Antony, wore a black leather tunic and a brass breastplate with a silver sword emblazoned down the front, point down, with a green laurel wreath around the hilt.</p><p>Endelle\u2019s palace was a collection of white marble rotundas, hanging off the west face of the McDowell Mountains as though suspended in the air. Most of the rotundas had open walls and large terraces with a stone balustrade serving as the only separation from hundreds of feet of airspace.</p><p>She had spent the day sleeping, something she\u2019d desperately needed. Antony had kept his distance, giving her some space by stretching out on the couch in the den of his bedroom suite. She had told him it was okay if he shared the bed with her, but he\u2019d only lifted a brow, pulled a pillow off the bed, and headed for the couch. He\u2019d been right, of course. If they\u2019d shared a bed, how much sleeping would they have actually done?</p><p>So here she was, somewhat rested and ready to ascend, at last, to Second Earth.</p><p>She stood in front of Endelle listening to the careful words she read from a large ceremonial book that she held open in both hands. It detailed the terms of ascension: the necessity of service, the nature of which would be dictated by the Supreme High Administrator; the careful standards of Second Society; and the vows to abstain from committing the most heinous act of partaking of dying blood.</p><p>Was she really going to do this? Was she really leaving her old world on Mortal Earth behind?</p><p>She watched Endelle\u2019s lips move but she really couldn\u2019t hear her. Her fingers shook so badly, she had to ball her hands into fists. She hadn\u2019t thought she would be nervous, but somewhere between committing her life in service to Madame Endelle and the promise not to drink someone to death, the reality that she was ascending suddenly got to her.</p><p>\u201cAscendiate,\u201d Endelle cried, her voice a hard bite.</p><p>Parisa\u2019s hearing cleared. \u201cYes, Madame Endelle?\u201d Just above the neckline of Endelle\u2019s black ceremonial robes, Parisa could see a line of leopard fur. The Supreme High Administrator had a predilection for animal skins and hides, for bird feathers, and even on occasion for the skins of reptiles. Havily called her fashion-challenged ... to say the least.</p><p>Endelle rolled her eyes. \u201cDo you agree to serve Second Earth with a mind and heart dedicated to service?\u201d</p><p>Parisa nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you agree to abide by the laws of Second Earth, especially as they apply to the limitations of involvement with Mortal Earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you solemnly pledge your loyalty to me, as Supreme High Administrator of Second Earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I proclaim to this gathered assembly, who stand as witnesses to your ascension, that you are hereby granted ascender status. Come forth and allow me to imbue you with all the blessings of the vampire nature.\u201d She folded the ceremonial book away.</p><p>Parisa couldn\u2019t make her feet move. She felt dizzy and strange as she stared at Madame Endelle\u2019s outstretched hands. Was she really going to do this? She had forgotten that part of the ceremony would involve the acceptance of near-immortality and vampire fangs for the taking of human blood and the releasing of potent chemicals.</p><p>Oh. God.</p><p>\u201cParisa, don\u2019t flake out on me now,\u201d Endelle cried. \u201cGet your ass over here.\u201d</p><p>Endelle\u2019s sharp tone and irreverent words knocked some of the fear out of Parisa. She moved forward, although unsteadily in her four-inch heels. When she stood in front of Endelle, the disparity in height set Parisa at eye level with the leopard fur.</p><p>With warm hands Endelle touched Parisa\u2019s cheeks oh-so-lightly. A tingling began to build between her hands and Parisa\u2019s jaw. She looked up into Endelle\u2019s eyes, but they were closed.</p><p>Dizziness once more assailed her.</p><p>Endelle\u2019s eyes popped open. \u201cWhat the hell is with you women? You\u2019re as bad as Alison was during her ascension. Goddammit, release your fucking shields!\u201d</p><p>Parisa gasped. She closed her eyes this time, dove inside her mind, and let loose what she perceived to be those shields. Even Greaves had marveled at her shields, calling them magnificent.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d Endelle snapped.</p><p>Power flowed, a torrent through Parisa\u2019s body, of warmth and light, of a tremendous sensation of well-being. Her upper gums began to tingle at the base of each incisor. At the same time, she felt tendrils touching her mind, trying to reach within. She knew that sensation, and it had nothing to do with the ruler of Second Earth.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s happening,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting your fangs, just relax, vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>Rith. She knew it was Rith. She recognized his touch, although this one was a gentler version of all that she\u2019d experienced while under his control.</p><p>An image of him, his Asian features, his broad forehead and wide nose, his black hair, flowed through her mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She closed her eyes and focused on him. Oh, how she wanted him dead. She had never thought she would say that about anyone, but Rith\u2019s heinous blood-slavery operation had changed that. What if she could reach the monster and be rid of him permanently?</p><p>His smiling face taunted her. Without thinking, she thought the thought, and the vibration began. The next moment she was drifting, flying, moving.</p><p>Oh, God, she was folding!</p> <p>And somewhere in her consciousness, she knew she was folding straight to Rith. Somehow, the vampire had tricked her.</p><p>Medichi had remained as close to Parisa during the ceremony as he could manage without doing anything improper. The palace had open walls through many of the connected rotundas, and it wasn\u2019t so long ago that Greaves had organized an attack here following Alison\u2019s ascension ceremony. He had a right to be nervous despite the state-of-the-art security system Endelle had in place. It couldn\u2019t guard against every preternatural contingency.</p><p>Like this one.</p><p>He had watched Parisa weave on her feet more than once during the ceremony. But just as Endelle had empowered her with ascended life and with her vampire fangs, she disappeared. How? Why? Worse, was she in danger?</p><p>He rushed forward and met Endelle\u2019s surprised gaze.</p> <p>Her Supremeness blinked and said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s never happened before.\u201d</p><p>No shit.</p><p>Parisa had dematerialized. She had folded for the first time, but where had she gone?</p><p>As far as Medichi knew, she hadn\u2019t manifested that power yet or she would have left her captivity long before this. Had the ceremony brought on a new power? Probably.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for permission or direction. With a thought, he folded off the cape and breastplate that would hinder him if he had to do battle. He closed his eyes and found her trace, which was made up of beautiful amethyst trails of light. The color was not a surprise.</p><p>He followed the elegant pathway, his hand itching as he traveled through nether-space, ready to fold his sword into his hand the moment his feet touched solid ground.</p> <p>He materialized and at the same moment swept his sword into his waiting fist. Rith stood eight feet away, both hands on Parisa\u2019s arms, his expression intense, forceful. He was working hard, his concentration focused. Whatever he was trying to do, it was taking every ounce of his energy and his awareness. Her body shimmered with energy. She was battling to keep him from folding her with him. If he succeeded, he\u2019d lose her again, because Rith could block his trace.</p><p>\u201cHell the fuck no!\u201d he shouted. He raced toward her, his preternatural speed shrinking time to a nanosecond. He slid his left arm around her waist, pulled her back into him, then swept the sword through the air at the level of Rith\u2019s waiting neck.</p><p>He\u2019d expected to strike bone and decapitate the bastard so that when he sliced through air, and got caught in the momentum, he ended up whirling Parisa in a circle.</p><p>Rith had escaped. Folded. Damn that vampire was fast.</p><p>He glanced around, a layer of sweat blooming over his skin, adrenaline singing through his veins, heart pounding. Was another enemy waiting? A death vampire maybe? A dozen? A hundred?</p><p>What the hell was this place? It looked like an underground cavern. But some of it was man-made\u2014at least two of the walls were almost flat and the floor was a smooth, polished surface.</p><p>He turned in another circle, his sword outstretched. Parisa was limp around his arm. What had Rith done to her? Like he didn\u2019t know. He\u2019d forced his way into her mind trying to break her resistance to his will.</p><p>He swung her toward him, flipping her in his arm and gathering her close, his sword still flexing in his right hand. She whimpered against his chest.</p> <p>He thought the thought, the vibration began, and he was back at the palace right next to Endelle.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck happened?\u201d Endelle asked.</p><p>He turned to look at her, his gaze shifting about. He was in full warrior mode. Even his sword was still in his hand, something hard to do while dematerializing. Given the dangerous nature of his identified sword, he folded the weapon back to his weapons locker in his villa.</p><p>\u201cRith,\u201d he stated. \u201cAlmost had him, but he moved too damn fast. Can you block both our traces? We don\u2019t want that fucker showing up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, yeah,\u201d Endelle said. She closed her eyes, put her hand on Medichi. He felt her power, a smooth warm flow through him, through Parisa, and back into nether-space.</p><p>Medichi felt their pathways slam shut. At last he could take a breath.</p><p>Parisa moved in his arms then started hitting him and screaming. What the hell had that bastard done to her?</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d he whispered against her ear. But she couldn\u2019t seem to hear him.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou fucking bastard!\u201d</p><p>He released her. She flew out of his arms, backward. That she wore heels and didn\u2019t stumble seemed like some kind of miracle. She lowered her knees into a crouch, dropping her shoulders at the same time. She glared at him. She blinked. She glared some more.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he? I\u2019ll kill him. I swear to God I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d Her cheeks were flushed bright red and her hands clenched into white-knuckled fists.</p><p>The Warriors of the Blood drew closer to her. Only then did Medichi realize each was armed with a sword, each expression wild, ready to protect her.</p><p>Medichi crossed to her and stood in front of her. He held his hands out at his sides, intent on keeping her from moving too far away from him. She hadn\u2019t quite returned to herself, and the palace had many open terraces that dropped away to hundreds of feet below.</p><p>\u201cParisa,\u201d he said, trying for a firm voice.</p><p>She met his gaze, squinting. \u201cAntony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRith. I saw Rith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I followed you. I brought you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was some kind of cave. Then I looked into his eyes and I thought, Not again. He tried to fold me away, but I fought him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you followed after me? How did you know where to find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a trace. When someone dematerializes, they leave a trace of light to their next landing point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason that Thorne thinks Rith first moved the D and R slaves by vehicle\u2014because if he\u2019d folded them straight from his Mandalay home, he could have been followed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head several times back and forth.</p><p>Endelle drew close. \u201cAre you telling me that Rith, who has a shitload of power, tried to fold you with him and you fought him off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could you do that when he folded you out of here, out of the palace?\u201d</p><p>Medichi drew close to Parisa. The whole thing had rattled him. The same old questions surfaced: Could he keep her safe? Alive? Sweet Jesus.</p><p>Parisa shook her head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t fold me out of the palace. I folded to him. You had just completed the fang-face thing and his image took shape in my mind. I think he planted the image. He tricked me into leaving the palace. I had this moment of wanting him dead so badly that I thought the thought and suddenly I was flying through nether-space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the fold was all yours,\u201d Endelle said. \u201cWell, shiiiit! That\u2019s fucking beautiful. Well done, ascender.\u201d</p><p>Leave it to Endelle to find the silver lining in a second kidnapping attempt.</p><p>Medichi tried to take Parisa\u2019s arm but she jerked it away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d She looked wild-eyed as she met his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m just too upset. It\u2019s not personal, Antony. I ... goddammit, I want to hit something, I\u2019m so mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cAll right. You\u2019ve convinced me, or maybe Rith has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvinced you of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to train you to do battle: swords, knives, guns, hand-to-hand, whatever you fucking need.\u201d</p><p>At that she finally grew still and the tension eased out of her. She drew a deep breath. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Havily\u2019s voice rose to the rafters. \u201cThere, you see, Marcus! They\u2019re not even bonded and he can see reason. Why can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Medichi turned to stare at the elegant redhead. Her hands were on her hips as she glared at her breh. Marcus glared back.</p><p>\u201cThey have an entirely different situation,\u201d Marcus said, his brow low on his forehead, his nostrils flaring. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not discussing it. That subject is closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to know what else is closed?\u201d Havily lowered her chin, and there was nothing sugary or sweet about her attitude.</p><p>Marcus growled low, his eyes glittering.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think it, Warrior. When I say closed, I mean closed.\u201d Split-resonance. Nice.</p><p>But again Marcus growled, and his lids fell to half-mast.</p><p>Medichi foresaw trouble back at the villa. Havily was damn serious, and Marcus\u2019s testosterone had just leaped off the charts in a really unfortunate direction.</p><p>Medichi understood something about Marcus in this moment: The whole situation was arousing as hell to him. Yeah, Medichi so got that. The minute Parisa opposed him, about anything, it awoke some kind of bizarre sexual dominance instinct that sent electricity into his groin.</p><p>\u201cSomebody get a hose.\u201d Endelle laughed, then her gaze shifted to Parisa. \u201cAs for you, ascender, let me check your fangs. You disappeared before I could see if everything worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lowering my shields,\u201d she cried. \u201cBecause if that freak tries to invade my mind once more, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChill, ascender. You won\u2019t need to lower your shields. Now c\u2019mon, because the caterer\u2019s telling me our dinner is ready.\u201d</p><p>Parisa returned to the cradle of Endelle\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cAll right, open your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Parisa obeyed.</p><p>\u201cNow lower your fangs. It\u2019s not rocket science, just think the thought.\u201d</p><p>Parisa closed her eyes and relaxed her shoulders.</p><p>Medichi watched her tense suddenly and then he saw them emerge, sharp, pointed, and erotic. This meant one thing\u2014his woman could take his blood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A shiver ran through his body so profound, he actually took a step back to balance himself.</p><p>Parisa\u2019s head swiveled in Endelle\u2019s grasp. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the sage?\u201d she cried. She sounded a little funny because of the fangs. She put a hand to her lips then closed her eyes once more.</p><p>Slowly she opened her eyes again, then her mouth, and touched her teeth. She had drawn her fangs back into her gums. \u201cWell, that was really weird.\u201d But she looked over at Medichi again and must have realized his present conundrum. \u201cOh. My. God.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, but his voice had dropped about an octave. His eyelids felt heavy. The wave of tangerine that hit him forced him to take another step back.</p><p>\u201cYour fangs are working all right,\u201d Endelle said. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re going to need another hose. Jesus H. Christ.\u201d She made a disgusted sound at the back of her throat. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re officially ascended. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>She stepped away from Parisa and headed to her right, to the adjoining rotunda, her stilettos clacking across the marble floor. Her robe disappeared at the same time, revealing a leopard-skin dress. The warriors followed her. Trailing behind, Marcus and Havily argued in whispers.</p><p>\u201cBabe, be reasonable,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cYou\u2019re protected because of the bond. Parisa will be, too, once she completes the breh-hedden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Havily whispered back. She quickened her pace and disappeared into the dining room.</p> <p>\u201cBabe,\u201d Marcus whined, following after.</p><p>The ceremony rotunda was now empty.</p><p>Medichi kept backing up and Parisa followed after him, her gaze locked to his, her mind all but reading his. He backed up until he hit a wall and both he and Parisa were invisible to the other guests.</p><p>\u201cI want a taste ... now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Medichi groaned and God help him, he was going to give it to her. Talk about playing with fire. She put her hands on his shoulders and rose up on tiptoes, her gaze pinned to his throat. With her heels she didn\u2019t have that far to go, even though he was six-seven.</p><p>But he stopped her.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked, a squeak in her voice.</p><p>She stared at the vein in his neck, which throbbed heavily now. He wanted her to have it but he leaned down next to her ear and said, \u201cIf you take my vein I won\u2019t be able to control what I do and I don\u2019t think you want anyone finding us in here like that.\u201d</p><p>He drew back. She blinked up at him. \u201cWrist?\u201d she asked. Dear God, she licked her lips again, and the tips of her fangs showed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better do it quick and when I say stop, you\u2019d better stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Could her voice sound any more seductive? And she was shedding tangerine like she was an orchard.</p><p>He offered his wrist. She took it in both hands, then licked a line over the collection of veins that showed blue. She looked up at him. \u201cI used to watch you when you would take women into the booths at the Blood and Bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou told me.\u201d He should have been shocked. She was a good little librarian. Okay, maybe not so good, but it wasn\u2019t helping the problem his erection was having with his tunic. He was making one fine tent out of it. Once more he leaned close to her ear.</p><p>\u201cLick it a few more times. Because you\u2019re a vampire now, the veins will rise to the surface just right.\u201d She obeyed him. Her tongue was small and wet, very feminine. He became a thin glass window that would shatter with the slightest pressure. \u201cYeah,\u201d he murmured. He kissed her earlobe. \u201cNow go ahead, do what feels natural.\u201d</p> <p>She did.</p><p>Her fangs struck and he hissed. The sharp sting, the knowledge that she had pierced him, that she could pierce him in other places, sent pleasure streaking up his arm and spreading like fire down his chest and into his groin. Then she started to suck, her head bobbing over his wrist. He groaned. He was so close to coming and she wasn\u2019t even taking blood from his neck, for Christ\u2019s sake.</p><p>She whimpered as he stroked her hair, her cheek, her chin. Antony, she sent, her voice plaintive through his mind. I can taste sage as though your scent flavors even your blood.</p><p>He wanted her to take it all, to drink him empty, to take the last fucking drop. The breh-hedden roared through him as if his life force was her food.</p><p>The scent of tangerines rose into the air around him until he was mindless. Antony, I don\u2019t think I can stop. And I want you. I want you between my thighs ... now.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to stop, either, but the voice that had been seductive had turned deep and guttural, more animal than woman. Dammit, he should have waited until they were back at the villa. He tried to speak, then thought\u2014Why not let her have a few more swallows? He put his palm on her neck, riding the sucking bobs of her head, then moved in close and ground his erection against her hip. She made mewling sounds now and sucked harder. Dammit. For a terrible moment, he actually considered turning her into the wall and penetrating her. He knew she\u2019d welcome him.</p><p>With a will that came from the simple knowledge that a room full of people waited for them, he used his free hand and slid a finger into her mouth. As soon as he broke the suction of her lips, she withdrew her fangs and took a deep breath.</p><p>His wrist was reddened from the sucking. He smiled. He\u2019d wear it as a badge tonight. He wished it was possible to create a scar so that he\u2019d always have a reminder of this moment. It was the rare scar that stuck, though, in the ascended world.</p><p>He held her close.</p><p>\u201cI feel dizzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharing blood like this will do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I could think about was how much I needed the rest of your body. How much I want you inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. We\u2019ll do that later.\u201d</p><p>She shifted against him to look up at him. \u201cBut not much later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not much later because right now I\u2019m in pain.\u201d</p><p>Her smile cast the world in a beautiful glow. He leaned down and kissed her on the mouth, the taste of his blood lingering on her lips. He pulled back.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, Parisa.\u201d</p><p>Thorne sat on Endelle\u2019s right, always on her right, her right-hand man, her second-in-command, Thorne the Reliable, Thorne who sipped gazpacho from his spoon but couldn\u2019t look at any of his warrior brothers.</p><p>Stannett\u2019s recent fucking revelation ate at him.</p><p>The large soup spoon trembled in his hand and he set it down. Thank God there was so much noise at the table. Right now Endelle was yelling at Santiago, clear across the enormous round expanse of white linen, telling him that his latest blade design was more a short sword than a dagger. He was arguing back. To Santiago\u2019s right, Havily listened with feigned interest. He doubted she cared about the subject at all. She probably just wanted an excuse to turn a cold shoulder to Marcus.</p><p>So the breh-hedden didn\u2019t result in automatic relationship-bliss. But then what the hell did?</p><p>He was done with his soup. Hell, he hated these kinds of functions, wearing his dress uniform, his cape flipped back over his shoulder. At least they\u2019d removed the ceremonial brass breastplates, which now sat in a row against the rotunda wall looking like disembodied chests. Next to the breastplates, the wall opened up to one of the several palace terraces.</p><p>Luken leaned close. \u201cYou think Parisa\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>Thorne glanced at the dark-haired beauty. She had such an interesting face, a slightly pointed chin, full lips, and those amethyst eyes. Her cheeks were flushed, the kind of flush that came from taking blood. Medichi had flashed his wrist when he returned from the rotunda with Parisa hugging his arm. The breh-hedden really was riding this pair.</p><p>He had to look away. Sex, or at least the promise of it, shimmered in the air between them. He could almost see the glow of expectation. If Parisa seemed a little remote, what of it? She\u2019d been through hell for three months. She had a right to look remote.</p><p>But Medichi had that look, like he knew he\u2019d be taking his woman to bed soon. It made Thorne want things he wouldn\u2019t be able to have for another twelve-hours-plus. Once a day, he went to be with his woman in the Creator\u2019s Convent. Once a goddamn day and no one knew. His sister was the excuse but yeah, he went to see his woman.</p><p>He picked up his wineglass and downed the remainder of the sangria. He then lifted it in the air and waggled it at the waiter. He wanted maybe two more to help him calm the hell down.</p><p>Stannett and his damn prophesy about an upcoming battle.</p><p>After waging war against death vampires all night, and bringing Parisa safely home from Burma, he\u2019d spent the rest of the morning with Colonel Seriffe. With Endelle\u2019s permission, he\u2019d shared the prophecy with the head of the Militia Warriors. If Greaves intended an attack, the Militia Warriors would have to be involved. But the whole thing was fast becoming a nightmare. The Militia served both to keep the peace in regular ascended society and as backup against death vampire squads. But it was not a large force\u2014maybe four thousand strong in the Metro Phoenix area.</p><p>Stannett\u2019s Superstition Mountain Seers Fortress had once been the world\u2019s most effective predictor of future events\u2014it was the primary reason that until the twentieth century, Endelle had been able to control Greaves\u2019s intrusions into Second Society. But under Stannett\u2019s command, information from the fortress had dwindled to, as Endelle liked to put it, a frog\u2019s stream of piss.</p><p>Stannett had a lot of talented Seers, so either he didn\u2019t know how to make use of them, or he had plans of his own. Thorne knew the bastard well. He suspected the latter.</p><p>Endelle was frustrated to the point of madness but her hands were tied, as they often were, by the Committee to Oversee the Process of Ascension to Second Earth. COPASS. Yeah, the acronym suited this body of assholes. They\u2019d backed Stannett when he denied Endelle admittance to his facility. If she even asked for information from the future streams, he\u2019d shrug, smile, and apologize that his Seers, for inexplicable reasons, simply lacked the expertise and power. All lies, but who could prove it? He was no longer required to let anyone audit or even see his organization. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Luken whispered.</p><p>Both of Thorne\u2019s hands were shaking. \u201cSure,\u201d he said, glancing briefly at Luken. \u201cToo much Ketel One, but I\u2019m cutting back.\u201d It was both a lie and the truth. He was trying to cut back, yes, but that was only an excuse. In fact he knew something Endelle didn\u2019t: The Seer whom Stannett had referred to\u2014the source of the ominous prophecy\u2014wasn\u2019t at the Superstition Seers Fortress. She was at the Creator\u2019s Convent. Thorne knew her well, really well. So, yeah, Stannett had spoken the truth about her abilities.</p><p>Where the hell was the waiter with his sangria?</p> <p>He\u2019d had more than one conversation with Endelle since Stannett\u2019s revelation, but she hadn\u2019t been all that helpful. Her latest suggestion was, Would you please take a fucking chill-pill? It\u2019s probably just some Seer shit.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Christ. A major battle coming and he couldn\u2019t talk about it to Endelle, because he\u2019d vowed never to reveal the Seer\u2019s identity to Her Supremeness. Endelle was obliged by COPASS law to send any talented Seer to the Superstition Fortress, and that place had to be a hellhole right now. It certainly wasn\u2019t a bastion of freedom.</p><p>That Stannett played a double game by making frequent visits to the Creator\u2019s Convent, and not telling Endelle, had made Thorne\u2019s life close to unbearable. The Seer was his woman and had been his woman for the past hundred years.</p><p>Christ, what a fucking mess.</p> <p>More sangria would really help about now and he almost barked at the waiter when he finally refilled his glass.</p><p>Endelle was still arguing with Santiago about his dagger. The Latin warrior stood behind his chair with his latest design in his right hand, its hilt encrusted with three rubies\u2014always rubies for Santiago. He showed her some moves. Most of the brothers were watching. Santiago loved to put on a show, and thank God for it because the tremors had moved up Thorne\u2019s arms.</p><p>They were all here, every damn one of them, all eight now because Marcus had returned, battling two nights a week. He loved them all. He needed them all. If he lost even one of his men, how would they survive as a unit, not to mention win this goddamn war?</p><p>Time, even this hour-long dinner, had given Parisa a little perspective. Her gaze kept flipping to the bruise on Antony\u2019s wrist. He\u2019d had thirteen centuries to get used to taking blood and she hadn\u2019t. Not that she\u2019d hesitated. She\u2019d fantasized about it dozens of times, from the first moment she\u2019d voyeured Antony, watching him enthrall mortal women at the Blood and Bite, gaping as he took their blood at wrist and neck\u2014and once, shockingly, at a woman\u2019s ankle.</p><p>Desire streaked through her at the memories. At the same time another part of her brain recoiled: You can\u2019t really be a vampire. This has to be a dream. Maybe a nightmare.</p><p>Had she really sucked on his wrist and swallowed his blood?</p> <p>Vampire. She kept rubbing her tongue over her incisors. More than once she thought the thought just so she could feel her fangs emerge, then disappear. The whole thing was so unreal.</p><p>She glanced at Antony. \u201cWill you be battling tonight?\u201d What a strange question to ask, and yet it was the right one. Antony was a warrior and fought death vampires every night of his life.</p><p>He leaned close and put an arm around her shoulders. \u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThorne wants me to stick close to you, at least until we can figure out a safer arrangement.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, and he laid a hand over hers. She knew he meant to offer comfort, but a terrible feeling of being contained came over her\u2014boxed in, controlled. She pushed his hand away.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d His arm slid away.</p><p>She let her gaze skip from warrior to warrior, then to Havily who was still ignoring Marcus, and finally to Endelle, now standing beside her throne-like dining chair and holding Santiago\u2019s dagger in her hand. She tossed it back and forth, feeling the weight. Where was Alison? Oh, yeah ... baby troubles.</p> <p>Parisa felt confused. She had left her prison but right now she felt as though she\u2019d locked herself into another one. A different kind of prison, with different rules of service and war. But still a prison.</p><p>She stood up as the caterers were arriving with bowls full of flan. The sight of the egg-custard dessert, so different from Burma and rice and turmeric, made her gag.</p><p>\u201cI need to leave,\u201d she stated. She felt light-headed. \u201cThe food was lovely, Madame Endelle, but I have to go.\u201d</p><p>No one was listening to her. Santiago had just said something suggestive about the dagger and Endelle was chortling, her head thrown back.</p><p>Her chair scraped on the marble as she pushed it back. Her linen slid to the floor. She was turning away from Jean-Pierre, who had risen to his feet as well. She knew Antony was at her back.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong, cherie?\u201d Jean-Pierre\u2019s hand was on her arm.</p><p>Parisa stared at it. Rith always had his hands on her arms, controlling her, enthralling her. She shook his hand off. She backed away.</p><p>Antony slid in front of her. \u201cLeave her alone,\u201d he said to Jean-Pierre, too loudly.</p><p>\u201cShe is not well. Look at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch her, Jean-Pierre.\u201d</p><p>Parisa backed away from the sudden anger. The table had become a tableau of frozen movement. Everyone stared at Jean-Pierre and Antony, then slowly each gaze turned to her.</p><p>Only then did Antony leave his bull-like stance with Jean-Pierre and meet her gaze. He frowned. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go home. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cJust please take me home.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He walked toward her, a hand outstretched. Rith used to do that. He would stretch his hands out, first one then the other. Look at me, he would command. She would meet his gaze and be lost.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>Antony lifted both hands in surrender but kept coming. She kept moving backward. She stepped past the boundary of the wall. In some part of her mind she knew she was now on the terrace, and it was bounded by a low balustrade, nothing more.</p><p>But Antony kept advancing on her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take you home if you don\u2019t stop moving. I have to touch you to fold you back to the villa. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Some part of her understood. Sort of.</p><p>He stopped suddenly but she kept moving backward. A breeze, hot and full of rich desert scents, blew over her. The stone railing stopped her progress, hitting her low at the top of her thighs. She blinked, glanced over the edge, then jumped back in Antony\u2019s direction. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Endelle was there. \u201cWhat the fuck is the matter with you?\u201d She scowled. \u201cThis is ascension, chickie. Get used to it quick.\u201d</p><p>Warrior Kerrick drew up beside her. \u201cShe needs Alison. I\u2019ll get her on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d Parisa cried. She reached a hand toward Kerrick, who paused with his BlackBerry halfway to his ear. \u201cI don\u2019t want Alison. I don\u2019t need her. I just\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish the sentence. She took a deep breath, and her gaze fell to the bruise she\u2019d put on Antony\u2019s wrist. Her mind was an ocean that flowed first to one continent then back to the other.</p><p>She felt dizzy again and weak. So weak. She put a hand on Antony\u2019s arm. \u201cPlease take me to your home. Now. Please.\u201d</p><p>To sweep someone through nether-space was always one of the great pleasures of my ascended vampire life, second only to the giving and taking of blood.</p><p>\u2014From Memoirs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Medichi didn\u2019t wait for permission. He didn\u2019t even glance anywhere but at her face. He slid his arms around Parisa and thought the thought. The next moment he stood holding her in the foyer of his villa.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t know what to do with her except release her.</p><p>She took several steps away, leaving him with a cold weight in the center of his heart. He\u2019d been foolish. He knew that now. He had somehow thought that just being together would make for a quick transition into ascended life. He\u2019d become convinced of it when he\u2019d seen her amazing recuperative powers. When she\u2019d taken his blood, he\u2019d believed himself home free.</p><p>Foolish, indeed.</p><p>He gave her space. He even turned away from her to take a couple of steps to the central table of the foyer, the one that held an intricate and tall arrangement of white magnolias. The table was made of thick wood and, despite his size, he didn\u2019t hesitate to turn and lean his hips against it. Almost everything in his villa was warrior-sized. He crossed his arms over his chest and waited.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re angry with me,\u201d she said, her eyes haunted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m angry with myself. I\u2019ve been very stupid about this, about you. I\u2019ve been thinking with my dick and that\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>At that, a smile tugged at the edges of her lips.</p><p>\u201cGlad I amuse you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYour turn of phrase amuses me.\u201d</p><p>She was a librarian. She would notice things like that. He felt his lips curve, then he sighed. \u201cI want to do right by you here, Parisa. Tell me what you need from me. I\u2019m not without a lot of experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirteen centuries\u2019 worth,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYeah. And a few decades.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cPrecisely. I\u2019ve had a total of three decades of living and none of them here, none of them in this dimension.\u201d</p><p>An hour or so ago he\u2019d felt like a thin sheet of glass. That\u2019s what he saw in Parisa now, only for her it wasn\u2019t sexual as it had been for him. He thought he understood her better in this moment than he had all along.</p><p>He lifted off the edge of the table and moved a few feet away. The foyer was a large space, meant for mingling during large parties, the serving of cocktails, even dancing if anyone wanted to. There hadn\u2019t been a dance here in over a hundred years. That\u2019s how bad the war had gotten, the seemingly inexhaustible war.</p><p>He sat down on the floor as if he were sitting at a campfire, crossing his ankles then settling his forearms on his widespread knees. The ceremonial black tunic hung low and kept necessary things private. The cape and brass breastplate were back at the palace. Whatever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She seemed surprised as she looked down at him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGiving you time and space and all my attention. No one is here to force you to do anything. Endelle might bluster and try to bully you, but common sense always wins with her in the end. Still, I think since Alison\u2019s ascension she\u2019s grown more capable of listening to reason. Not much more, but more. As for me, if I\u2019m too possessive right now, I can\u2019t take the full blame for that. Your scent clogs all my logic and most of my sensitivity.\u201d</p><p>She released a deep sigh, so he knew he\u2019d done the right thing for her. Space. Funny, it was the last thing he needed.</p> <p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his loosely clasped hands then met her gaze straight-on. Shit, he was going to ask the hard question, the one he\u2019d never been able to answer. \u201cI never knew what happened the day that Rith took you. Do you think you could talk about it? Tell me? Tell me how I screwed up?\u201d</p><p>Her arms fell away from her chest. \u201cHow you screwed up?\u201d The question didn\u2019t seem to make sense to her.</p><p>\u201cI was your guardian. I let some preternaturally powerful asshole drag you off and I didn\u2019t even notice, not for half a minute.\u201d</p> <p>She took a step toward him. \u201cSo you really didn\u2019t see me disappear?\u201d</p><p>Talking about it brought the memory sweeping back in a slow flood of horror. He told her what it had been like for him, how he\u2019d been talking on his phone to Thorne while he kept track of her from his peripheral vision, and that only after a while had he realized that she was standing too still\u2014not even the breeze moving through the grove touched the hem of her sundress.</p><p>He talked for a ridiculously long time about the day of her abduction, how the warriors had all gathered at the villa, how the grounds had been searched and every building turned upside down to make sure she wasn\u2019t somewhere on the property. He talked about his sleeplessness. He talked about the limoncello.</p><p>He\u2019d meant to get her talking, and now he couldn\u2019t stop the flow of his own words if his life depended on it.</p><p>By then she was kneeling beside him, her fingertips touching the circles beneath his eyes. He met her eyes, wet with tears. She leaned close and kissed him on the lips.</p><p>He held very still. He wanted to drag her into his arms but he was probably always going to feel like that. He had enough sense to know that this wasn\u2019t the time for his male aggression to be at the fore. He sighed and kept his hands clasped tightly together.</p> <p>She sat as he sat, with her ankles crossed and drawn close, her knees spread. She slipped off her shoes and set them next to her. Her white flowered dress draped in folds over the empty cradle of her lap. She put a hand on his knee and drew a deep breath.</p><p>Then she began to talk.</p><p>\u201cThe house was lovely. Rith\u2019s house. It was made entirely of mahogany. It was a replica of an old British Colonial house. You didn\u2019t see it, did you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cOnly you flying through the dome of mist.\u201d Her hand was warm on his bare knee. \u201cThe rest of the warriors saw the house, but not me. Maybe you and I should go back, look around.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMaybe, but not yet.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to ask her a dozen questions. They piled up on his tongue and tried to break through his front teeth but he held them back.</p><p>Her nails scraped gently at his skin. She probably wasn\u2019t aware she was doing it. \u201cThe same day that he brought me to his house, he pierced my mind until I was screaming. When I first arrived, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing in that beautiful home or even who he was. He told me I wouldn\u2019t be hurt if I did as I was told, and that Greaves had asked him to house me for a week or so. Yes, he said a week or so. What then? I had thought. What would happen after a week?</p><p>\u201cHe left me sitting on a bench beneath a tamarind tree. It was the most beautiful garden. No one has ever had such a lovely prison, but it was like being punished by having an endless number of cotton balls thrown at you. They might not hurt, but after awhile the craziness sets in, the despair.</p> <p>\u201cSo I sat under that tree. I waited for hours, not knowing what to do. Finally, I went in search of him. I found three female Burmese servants who only glanced at me. I tried to speak with them, to ask them what I was supposed to do and where Rith had gone. None of them would respond.</p><p>\u201cI eventually found him in his study. He didn\u2019t even seem angry when he saw me. But he took me into a back bedroom and he must have enthralled me again because when I woke up or came to consciousness, I was bound to a very comfortable recliner, like a La-Z-Boy.</p><p>\u201cThen he entered my head. It was like whirling knives. I screamed and screamed until I was hoarse.</p><p>\u201cWhen he withdrew, he spoke five words: You do as I say. That\u2019s all he said to me during that first day. The lesson, however, was complete.</p><p>\u201cLooking back, life was simple after that. When I didn\u2019t do something exactly the way he wanted it done, he put his hands on my arms, then shot his mind into mine. The pain was brutal. But it always started with the hands. That\u2019s ... that\u2019s why I recoiled when you reached out to me like you did earlier, at the palace. I wanted you to understand.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, taking deep breaths. The thought of Rith going mind-diving sent his protective instincts skyrocketing. But this wasn\u2019t about him, or his reactions to what she was saying. This was about her. \u201cSo what happened at the dinner to put you back there, back in your prison?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and released another sigh. \u201cThe whole situation suddenly felt the same to me as being in Rith\u2019s home. Go here, sit there, do this, obey. Nothing else is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEndelle, then. You know she can be a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. Did it ever occur to you that you\u2019re all living in the same kind of prison? This is a beautiful villa, but Antony, you\u2019ve been a warrior for thirteen hundred years and it appears to be without end. You don\u2019t do anything except make war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I choose to serve Endelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Her expression was so earnest that he was taken aback. He thought for a long moment. \u201cLife isn\u2019t simple, Parisa. Not as an immortal, not as a vampire, not for anyone. There are worse things than what I endure as a warrior or what you\u2019ve endured as a captive.\u201d</p><p>He was afraid his words would be offensive to her, but she nodded. She leaned forward and stroked a hand along his back so that her fingers rippled over his scars. \u201cFiona has suffered more than I ever did,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLike I said, I had three months of being struck by cotton balls and all the while she was a D and R slave.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. She didn\u2019t seem quite so distressed.</p><p>\u201cThank you for not coddling me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be coddled. I know I\u2019m not strong like you, but I\u2019m trying. I want to be stronger, Antony, I really do. I want to be of use, but I also know it\u2019s going to take some time for me to adjust to everything.\u201d She slid her hand over his shoulder and down his arm, all the way down. He shivered.</p><p>She turned his wrist to face her. \u201cThis freaked me out at dinner. This is what set me off.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m so sorry but I thought you enjoyed it. In fact\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she cried. \u201cI loved ... taking your blood.\u201d Color flooded her cheeks. Was she going to start weeping? \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can explain it but it just became so real while I was sitting next to you that I\u2019d entered the world of the vampire. I guess I felt claustrophobic.\u201d</p><p>At that he smiled. \u201cIn a building with ceilings fifty feet high, you felt claustrophobic?\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his arm. \u201cYeah. I did.\u201d Then she laughed, a long trill that warmed his heart. Afterward, she leaned forward and rested her head on his forearm.</p><p>He shifted slightly and stroked her lovely dark brown hair. It wasn\u2019t fine but coarse. He\u2019d pulled her onto his lap at the Ambassadors Festival, the night Havily had been abducted by Crace. He\u2019d held her close then. She\u2019d gone through so much during that time without being ascended yet. Then she\u2019d lived for three months as a prisoner. Now she was here, ascended, bearing fangs, confused, distressed.</p><p>\u201cI can really see how this must feel like just another prison to you.\u201d</p><p>She released a heavy sigh. \u201cYes, it does, but thank you for understanding or trying to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do understand and you\u2019re right, I sometimes feel like a prisoner of this war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d She remained leaning on his knee.</p><p>He kept stroking her hair. He wanted to hold her, to kiss her, but he also didn\u2019t want to disturb this time with her. \u201cWell, I start training you to do battle, and after that, let\u2019s bring Fiona home. I think that\u2019s our first duty, Fiona and the rest of the D and R slaves.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and looked up at him as though seeing him for the first time. \u201cIt is that simple, isn\u2019t it. We take one step and then another\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and we try not to let the horror catch up with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it exactly. Yes, I felt exactly like that. I was sitting there and then I realized, Now I\u2019m a vampire. It turned me upside down.\u201d</p><p>He smiled because he\u2019d just realized something himself. \u201cYou turned me upside down. I was going along splendidly, behaving myself, except at the Blood and Bite, of course, and the next thing I knew I was smelling tangerines in my villa. Just out of a shower, still dripping, and there you were. The most beautiful woman in the world standing in my kitchen.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThe most beautiful in the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His voice had dropped an octave again.</p><p>She met his gaze, and something flickered in those amethyst depths. \u201cYou dropped your towel.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and shrugged. \u201cI dropped my fucking towel. Have I apologized for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was never a need for an apology, Antony.\u201d Her voice had gotten very low as well. \u201cI had never seen anything so beautiful. I thought I was looking at a god.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He leaned close and dragged his lips across the line of her cheekbone. \u201cDo you know what I remember about that day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember that you put your hand to your neck and stroked your skin, right about here.\u201d He used the knuckle of his forefinger to touch her throat. \u201cDo you remember?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cUh-huh. I do. My vein was throbbing.\u201d She drew back. \u201cRight here, pulsing like it was waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned a little closer lowering his knee so that she was forced to move into him. \u201cIs your vein waiting again?\u201d</p><p>He could smell a thick wave of tangerine rise from her body, flowing around him, drifting heavily into his nostrils, his sinuses, his brain. There wasn\u2019t a lot of room to maneuver, sitting the way they were, but he balanced on his hip, slid an arm around her back, and held her in place as he dragged his fangs across her throat.</p><p>Here, he sent directly to her mind.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, yes,\u201d she murmured. He felt her fingers now on his throat. As he drew back, her lips parted and he saw her fangs. Oh, shit, he was so in the wrong position to have his cock start demanding attention.</p> <p>He rose up on his knees and caught her around the waist with his hands. He drew her close and kissed her. \u201cWill you come to bed with me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, \u201cUh-huh.\u201d Her lips were still parted, the tips of her fangs calling to him.</p><p>He whispered, \u201cMy vein throbs for you as well.\u201d</p><p>Parisa rose to her feet, Antony with her. She dipped down to pick up her shoes. He slid an arm around her shoulders and guided her into the adjacent formal living room, then down the long, long hallway to his master suite. The house smelled sweetly of his rich sage mixed with leather and the musk of his skin.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>The trouble with walking such a great distance was that her mind had time to fill up with images again, but not ones that involved Antony\u2019s throat or her newly created fangs.</p> <p>Her thoughts started moving around, gnawing on problems she couldn\u2019t solve right now, fretting over just how hard it would be to learn to do battle or to protect herself, worrying about ... pregnancy.</p><p>She stopped in her tracks and turned to him. \u201cCondoms?\u201d she asked, her cheeks warming.</p><p>He nodded, then he smiled. \u201cCome on. We\u2019ll be okay.\u201d He urged her forward with a tug on her arm but she still couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>The trouble was\u2014and this was so wrong,\u2014she didn\u2019t want him to use a condom. She wanted to feel him just the way he was, all of him, inside her.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t get diseases,\u201d he said, \u201cof any kind, in case you were wondering. No herpes or HIV.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been wondering, but, \u201cGood to know. That means me as well now.\u201d Huh. Yes, there were definite advantages to ascension. She started walking again.</p><p>They reached the doors to his bedroom, a beautifully carved double set that had to be at least twelve feet high. He had his hand on the knob when she touched his wrist. \u201cI had my period three days ago.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, knowing full well that her cheeks were now flaming. Would he take the hint?</p> <p>But his eyelids dropped a good half inch and a soft growl sounded deep in his throat. \u201cYou sure that\u2019s what you want?\u201d</p><p>The only thing she was sure of right now was that she just was about to die of embarrassment. She barely knew Antony. They\u2019d only had sex once not counting mutual self-pleasure for three months, and here she was discussing contraceptive methods. And here she was saying she didn\u2019t want a bit of latex to interfere with her pleasure. Oh, God.</p><p>She put her hands on her cheeks and squeezed her eyes shut. Okay, maybe she was being childish. She drew back her shoulders and met his gaze. \u201cI want to have sex with you, we\u2019re fairly safe right now, and I don\u2019t want you to wear a condom.\u201d There, she\u2019d been brave and said exactly what she wanted.</p><p>He threw the door open, caught her up in his arms, and carried her to the bed, pausing only to kick the door shut. He tossed her on her back at the foot of the bed. Her legs dangled over the edge.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said, dipping down low and planting a hand onto the mattress on either side of her head. \u201cTell me how you want this. You\u2019ve been through hell. Let\u2019s see if we can make your life a little better.\u201d</p><p>She writhed under his gaze, his dark brown eyes glittering in the dim light. The sun was on the wane, but the shutters drawn almost three-quarters created a twilight in his bedroom.</p><p>She smiled up at him and slid her hand along the side of his cheekbones. His face was almost sculpted, the bones strong and pronounced. He was so beautiful. She hadn\u2019t been kidding when she said he looked like a god.</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d she said, wondering how she\u2019d gone from completely embarrassed to ready to tell him exactly what she wanted and in what order, \u201cI want your clothes off. I want to look at you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled then grinned. He pushed away from the bed, drew up to his full height, waved a hand, and that was it, clothes gone.</p><p>Oh, yeah ... ascension. She sat up and pushed at his abdomen. \u201cMove back,\u201d she commanded. \u201cI want to see you.\u201d</p><p>His smile remained. He stepped away from her and moved in a slow circle, his hands spread wide. Her gaze traveled up and down over a hard warrior body. Shivers moved along her shoulders and back, over her legs. He was lean, muscled, with broad shoulders angling to narrow hips and long powerful thighs. He was covered in fine black hair that made the tip of her tongue tingle as certain thoughts drifted through her head.</p><p>When he returned to facing her, she dropped her gaze to his cock and to his heavy, rippled sac. Pubic hair covered a good amount of his groin. He was partially thick so that he hung long, broad, and just off to the right ... as though with a touch or two, he would spring up, making all sorts of promises.</p><p>She had seen him stroke himself through her voyeur\u2019s window. But she wanted to see him do it now in front of her.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself,\u201d she whispered. She still sat on the bed, her feet flat on the floor, her white, flowered dress fanned around her hips.</p><p>He smiled, a small crooked smile, and his eyes looked knowing and very dark. He drew close, maybe a foot and a half away. His hand wrapped around his thick stalk and in a slow languorous movement rubbed himself from stem to stern and back.</p><p>\u201cCloser.\u201d Again she spoke in a whisper.</p><p>He moved to stand just inches away.</p><p>She put her fingers on his hand as he pumped. Then she leaned close and kissed the back of his hand. He stopped all movement and, groaning softly, let his hand fall away. Now she was kissing what she had wanted to kiss from the beginning.</p><p>She drew back and stared at the beautiful, broad head. She ran her thumb over the tip. He was wet. She leaned forward and licked the tip, the aperture where good things came from. Then she took the head in her mouth and sucked. He almost filled her.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d he whispered. As he groaned the room filled with sage. Shivers poured over her shoulders, tightening her breasts and working like fingers down her abdomen and lower.</p><p>She planted her hands on his hips and moved in, taking as much of him in her mouth as she could until he hit the back of her throat. With her fingers, she played up and down with what remained outside. When she cupped him low, he hissed and pulled himself out of her mouth.</p><p>She looked up at him and smiled.</p><p>\u201cIt feels too damn good.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>His eyes swam with fire. His fists were clenched at his sides. \u201cWhat would you like to do next?\u201d</p><p>The question felt like chocolate mousse after an already rich meal, decadent, unholy, way-too-much, and yet perfect. She smiled again. A ripple of possibilities sped through her mind. As she picked one idea up and set it aside, then another and another, she stroked his thighs, carefully avoiding his raging erection.</p><p>Choices. Choices.</p><p>She looked up at him, way up. \u201cTake your cadroen off. I want to feel your hair, all of it. I\u2019ve been craving my hands in it more than I can say.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his arms, swelling the muscles of his chest and upper arms. Her heart sped up. He was a god and right now he was hers as he released the cadroen and let his hair spread over his shoulders, down his arms, and down his chest.</p><p>She rose to her feet. \u201cNow sit down so I can do this right.\u201d</p><p>They traded places as he sat down. She turned into him and moved between his spread legs. He was a banquet, oh such a feast, but first\u2014his warrior hair.</p><p>She drifted her fingers from the top of his head all the way down past his shoulders and over his chest. She lifted her hands and thrust her fingers into his hair just below his temples.</p><p>She had wanted this from the first time she had voyeured him after a shower. She couldn\u2019t explain how his hair made her feel, but it was as though something essential lived there, a reflection of who he was, certainly of his warrior status.</p><p>She took a large portion and wrapped it around her hand. Then she loosed her grip and the strands eased, separated, and flowed over her fingers. He had very fine hair, so different from her own. She grabbed another thick portion, pushed her fingers through, and dragged downward until she hit a snag. She withdrew. She kept tugging, stroking, playing until he groaned and his lips found her in a surprising kiss. She hadn\u2019t realized how close she was.</p><p>She opened her mouth to gasp and his tongue filled her. \u201cOh,\u201d she murmured, leaning against him.</p><p>She suckled his tongue and his arms glided around her back, his erection still firm and hard against her abdomen. His hips rocked, and she felt that sturdy length glide up her abdomen. He kept thrusting his tongue and gliding his cock as he pushed the fabric of her dress around.</p><p>She drew back. Her lips felt swollen. \u201cI want my dress off.\u201d</p><p>He put a hand to her shoulder and folded the dress off. She had a glimpse of the white and splashy flowers appearing on a chair near the blinds.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s a great trick.\u201d</p><p>His hands were on her shoulders and he pushed away from her. He growled as his gaze drifted over the rest of her clothes, red lace underwire bra, red lace panties, no stockings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m smelling sage, lots of it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He made a sound like a grunt and grabbed her around the waist. He rose to his feet and lifted her to kneel on the bed. This put her breasts, in a most fortuitous happenstance, right at mouth level. She giggled. He scooped each breast out of her bra to rest in large mounds on the underwires. She drew back just out of reach of his mouth.</p><p>He looked up at her, uncertain, but she shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you could do that.\u201d But her look dared him and begged him at the same time.</p><p>He put his hands on her back and never lost eye-contact. His brown eyes were black in the twilight. He pushed on her back, forcing her toward him, his lips parted, his tongue drifting over his bottom lip.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>She resisted. She put her hands on his shoulders. She stared at him and pushed back, but he was stronger and kept pulling her toward him. Her nipples grew peaked, giving the lie to her resistance.</p><p>His tongue was so close. The well of her body tightened. She cried out, gave way. He pulled her in tight and took her left breast in his mouth, as much as he could. His movements were rapid and harsh, just what she wanted, as he sucked, pulled, licked, and worked her into a frenzy.</p><p>In this position, his thick cock found the inside of her left thigh. She pressed her legs together so that his cock could stroke the tight space between. He was way too low to penetrate, but the feel of his mouth on her breast brought deep moans from her throat.</p><p>Antony, she sent, straight to his mind. I need more. Now. Yes, her telepathy had improved.</p><p>She had meant for him to penetrate her hard and fast because she was so ready for him.</p><p>Instead he released her breast and, in a quick movement, grabbed her both high and low, behind her shoulders and across her bottom, then laid her out once more on the bed. He dragged her hips to the end so that her legs hung off the side, then he sank to his knees on the floor.</p><p>She leaned up, intending to protest, but he pushed her back. \u201cYou\u2019ve had your way,\u201d he said, holding her chest down with one hand while the other ripped her lace panties off. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to do what I want to do.\u201d</p><p>She might have protested but then he put his mouth against her lower lips and French-kissed her.</p><p>Oh. Dear. God.</p><p>He was a big man, and so was his tongue. He glided over her and she cried out. He kissed her labia then poked and prodded every fold of her with the tip of his tongue until she was gasping and panting.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cHold on for what?\u201d She looked down at him and he looked up. He smiled but it was a wicked smile, full of purpose and design and, oh, God, his fangs emerged.</p><p>He bent low once more. Nestling his face against her lower lips, he drew back then struck.</p><p>Oh, shit, he\u2019d used a fang. Just one. She felt a warmth right there. The pleasure started, a tingling at first, then like rivulets of electricity and pleasure mingled. Potions. That\u2019s right. His fangs could release chemicals. She whimpered and her eyes rolled back in her head.</p><p>He slid a finger deep inside, then two.</p><p>Her upper body felt frozen as the sensation glided over her. She flung her legs wide as though trying to escape it, which of course only made things worse, or better, since he groaned and his groan clutched something deep in her chest.</p><p>Tangerine, he whispered through her mind.</p> <p>He stroked her with his fingers. He laid his tongue flat against her and just rolled over her, the barest pulse of movement, but with the potion working it felt as if a dozen tongues were flicking over all that sensitive flesh. His fingers moved faster and then she cried out because it was like nothing she had ever felt before. If this was ascension, oh, God, give her more and more and more.</p><p>The orgasm struck, a bolt of lightning that traveled through her in a pulse of pleasure. She was bucking off the bed, but he kept her pinned now with an arm across her hips as she rode the orgasm. He kept moving his tongue, helping her along, sustaining the roll of ecstasy. Only as she stopped straining against his arm, only as her body settled down, did he pause, his fingers quiet, his tongue not touching her.</p><p>Even so, little jolts of orgasm struck her over and over.</p><p>Finally, when she lay quiet on the bed, he asked, \u201cReady for another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother what?\u201d Her heart skipped a few beats. \u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>Without asking for permission or giving her a chance to catch her breath, he thrust his fingers into her again and again, hard and fast. He laid his tongue against her once more, pressed into her, then rippled over her flesh. Another orgasm chased the last one, streaking through her until she was screaming and screaming. A full minute passed before her hips grew quiet. She couldn\u2019t stop the panting, though, and her heart raced.</p><p>His deep throaty laugh blew between her thighs. She heard the smugness, the delight, the thrill, and she knew he wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>Oh, dear God.</p><p>He worked her three more times.</p><p>Three more times.</p><p>Three more outrageous screams at the ceiling, more orgasms that were no doubt blinding her for life. The pleasure was so intense that tears streaked from her eyes and rolled into her hair.</p><p>She lay panting, again, a hand pressed to her forehead. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can take much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParisa,\u201d he said, his voice almost singsong.</p><p>Her hand fell away and she lifted her head and met his gaze. Such teasing, laughing eyes, so happy, so very wicked.</p><p>He rose up from his kneeling position as though moving in slow motion. He pushed his hair back with his hands and laced his hands behind his neck.</p><p>Her mind had turned to mush but her gaze had sharpened. He knew exactly what he was doing as his pecs and arms swelled and his abdomen tightened. Male beauty personified.</p><p>She took her time looking. Despite all the orgasms he\u2019d given her, hunger drove her all over again. As she took in the wonderful size of him, the beauty of his crown, the veins bulging and filling what needed to be filled, the heavy sac, she heard a growl and realized that her throat had formed the sound, a predatory and extremely possessive sound\u2014a vampire sound.</p><p>He lowered his arm slowly to hold his sac in one hand and show her one long stroke of his cock with the other.</p><p>\u201cYou want to finish this, vampire?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She met his gaze and for a moment time stopped. Never in her life had she felt more of a sense of belonging than she did at this moment. Vampire. She rolled the word around in her mind and something clicked into place. Maybe there was a reason why she\u2019d felt so separated from those around her. Maybe she\u2019d never really belonged on Mortal Earth.</p><p>But she belonged here, in Antony\u2019s bed. Of that one thing, she was certain. She belonged in this warrior\u2019s bed.</p><p>She opened her arms and he glided between her legs as he stretched out on top of her. She was wet but he was big, and it took a few strong, wonderful pushes to make his way inside. As he did, she felt full\u2014as though he wasn\u2019t just connecting sexually but working his way into her heart as well ... and she let him, whatever that might mean for the next few hours, days, or years.</p><p>He filled her and for some reason she felt whole. Yes, that\u2019s how she felt in this moment with Antony\u2019s body on top of hers, the weight of him pressing into her flesh, her muscles, her bones, she felt whole, as though the healing had begun. After everything she\u2019d gone through, what a surprise that sex with him would make her feel like this.</p><p>He looked into her eyes then kissed her, and she tasted all that she was on his lips. He began to move, to thrust, to draw back and push in. She slung an arm around his neck and kissed him back. She drove her tongue into his mouth and he groaned.</p><p>This wouldn\u2019t take long. She was already tightening around him, and the potion he\u2019d put into her was still acting like an aphrodisiac to all her sensitive lower flesh. She writhed beneath him, seeking contact in a dozen different places at once, which made all his groans deepen. She bucked beneath the pressure of each thrust until she was meeting him, slamming into him, dragging her internal muscles over the impossible length and girth of him.</p><p>He sped up. She gripped his back, sank her nails.</p><p>\u201cParisa, Parisa,\u201d he whispered between groans.</p><p>She could hear her voice, almost a high keening sound. The pleasure was intense and building, swelling, rising. She felt the orgasm coming, an enormous wave; when it descended it crashed over her, pushing Antony up as she thrust her hips into him.</p><p>He gave a shout, moved impossibly fast within her, pumping hard and with another shout spent himself. The jerks of his thick cock brought yet another climax, pushing her again to the heights. His eyes were wild as he met her gaze.</p><p>Antony breathed through her mind as it had every night for three months. A smile took his lips.</p><p>I\u2019m here, he whispered and her tears began to fall once more as she sank into the mattress.</p><p>He collapsed on her, which forced a sigh out of her throat. She held him close, her arms wrapped around his neck and all his warrior hair. His breathing was labored. So was hers. She closed her eyes and just let herself rest and breathe with the minutes that began to pass one after the other.</p><p>Maybe she didn\u2019t know a lot about what her life should be, but yes, she belonged here, at least for now.</p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, her eyes opened. She looked up at the beautiful dark wood coffer beams that formed a three-dimensional chessboard on the ceiling.</p><p>As her gaze grew more focused, she saw that words, in what looked like Italian, were burned in a beautiful flowing script along each beam, crossed and crisscrossed, one line running into the next. She followed each line and realized that at one point, the lines began to repeat, probably three times in all from one end of the long room to the next.</p><p>\u201cAntony,\u201d she whispered, her voice hoarse, her throat raw from making so much noise.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he mumbled against her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that writing on the coffer beams?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head slightly and looked at her. He put his fingers to her lips and a heavy, deep sigh left his body. \u201cA poem my wife wrote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were married?\u201d Of course he would have been married. He\u2019d lived for centuries. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded. \u201cA long, long time ago, before I ascended.\u201d</p><p>She felt the sudden stiffness in his body and wasn\u2019t surprised when he eased out of her and rolled onto his back, his gaze also drifting to the beams. She could feel the pain of those few words as though he\u2019d spoken it aloud. She didn\u2019t want to ask. She didn\u2019t want to know, not the meaning of the words, not why he ascended without his wife, but she had opened the subject, unwittingly.</p><p>She turned on her side toward him. She felt his seed and her wetness begin to spill out of her. \u201cHey, magical one, can you get me a few tissues or a washcloth?\u201d</p><p>He smiled then laughed. He folded what she needed into his hand but instead of giving it to her, he rolled toward her and murmured, \u201cSpread your legs.\u201d</p> <p>Still on her side, she lifted her left leg. He very gently covered the well of her, then cupped her. She lowered her leg, pinning his hand and the tissues in place. Because he faced her, he leaned toward her and kissed her. \u201cThank you for not asking.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him back. \u201cThank you for making love to me. It was exactly what I needed. Now I feel like I\u2019m home.\u201d</p><p>That made him smile.</p><p>Some mental health professionals insist that mind-engagement of any kind, including basic telepathy, is a matter more of great trust than of extraordinary preternatural power.</p><p>\u2014From Treatise on Ascension, Philippe Reynard</p> <p>Chapter 11</p><p>The next morning, Parisa stood on a semicircle of pavers in front of the villa, the place where Havily had taught her to fly. Now she was trying to learn something new, but what Antony wanted her to do had her stomach tied up in knots.</p><p>Jean-Pierre and Havily stood a good distance away, maybe twenty feet or so, giving her space as if they, too, sensed her struggle. Jean-Pierre had agreed to help with the training, and Havily, against Marcus\u2019s wishes, had insisted on being part of the lesson. Havily held a sword in her hand.</p><p>\u201cThe only way you can do this,\u201d Antony said gently, \u201cis if you lower your mental shields.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Her gaze seemed permanently fixed to his black tee just below the ribbing around the neck. She couldn\u2019t seem to look at him; nor could she explain why. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI know I asked you to help me so that I could learn really fast, but I\u2019m kind of stuck here.\u201d</p><p>Only then did she lift her gaze to his. A slight furrow marred his brow. He lifted a hand and touched her cheek lightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you this ... frightened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am frightened, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you\u2019re afraid Rith will find you again?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. I have no doubt that Rith has sufficient power to track me, but he can\u2019t make me fold to him again. What happened at the palace caught me by surprise. I felt drawn, so I folded. But believe me, Rith won\u2019t be able to do that a second time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if that\u2019s not what\u2019s bothering you, then what is?\u201d</p><p>The light went on. \u201cLetting someone, anyone, inside my head. I just have the worst feeling.\u201d And suddenly, the memory returned to her, so fast that she listed sideways. Antony\u2019s hand caught her and kept her from stumbling. \u201cGreaves came to me. I remember now. Oh, God. He sat in that large teak chair across from me. He drank tea from a white teacup. I was sitting on the bench beneath the tamarind tree, the one I told you about. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe drank his tea and he watched me as though trying to figure out how to take my mind, how to bypass my shields. Then he came to sit by me, but that\u2019s all I remember. Later, I woke up on the grass.\u201d She put a hand to her forehead and rubbed back and forth slowly. \u201cAntony, I think he might have gotten inside my head. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so uncomfortable right now. At least, I think that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not Greaves,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p> <p>She met his gaze again. \u201cYes. Of course I do. With my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you focus on that?\u201d</p><p>She took another deep breath and closed her eyes. He put his palms back on her cheeks, where they\u2019d been for the last several minutes.</p><p>She tried. She really tried. But she just couldn\u2019t let her shields down.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not as much as you think.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him again, her eyes flying open. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a current thought that suggests our mental shields reflect our life in some way. Maybe you need to ask yourself why your shields are like steel.\u201d</p><p>Parisa had to admit it made some sense. She met Antony\u2019s gaze again, but this time she smiled. \u201cDo all preternatural powers have some basis in neuroses?\u201d</p><p>At that he laughed. \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask Alison. She\u2019s the psychologist, but it\u2019s an interesting theory. A more accurate word, I think, might be personality. You have something of an analytical mind. Your tendency to shield like a citizen of the third dimension and not Second Earth might have something to do with that.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and focused not on her fear or her disinclination to lower her shields or whatever the hell this was, but instead on the woman who had come running out of Rith\u2019s house begging for her help. She couldn\u2019t be of use to Fiona if she didn\u2019t learn some battle skills. She had to be ready to defend herself, even in a limited way. As soon as Central got a fix on Fiona\u2019s location, the warriors would need her voyeur skills on-site, and she would be there.</p><p>Maybe it was remembering Fiona\u2019s desperation or her terrible death and resurrection, but she took Antony\u2019s hands and placed them on her cheeks. \u201cLet\u2019s just do this,\u201d she said, her jaw tight. And without debating the damn subject one more second, she let her shields fall, like gravity tugging apples straight down.</p><p>Antony\u2019s battle memories didn\u2019t rush at her. Instead, they came in a long slow glide. When the first image hit, of standing beneath a starlit sky at the Superstition Mountains, of Jean-Pierre beside him, of three death vampires in the air and four on the ground, she breathed in each passing frame like a sweet breeze.</p><p>She lived the battle with him and felt the strength of his emotional web, the pure adrenaline of a Warrior of the Blood, of his simple intention of making all the horrible monsters in front of him very dead. She felt all his expertise of having wielded a sword and a dagger for thirteen centuries. She experienced exactly how his body reacted while facing the enemy, the flexing of all the powerful muscles of his arms, back, shoulders, thighs, and calves; how he performed impossible feats of speed, of dematerialization, of whirling, of levitation, of strength. How he worked in tandem with Jean-Pierre, always marking the brother warrior\u2019s location to keep both of them safe and battling at peak performance. She saw the ground in front of him run red. She saw bodies and severed parts and feathers and wings scattered across the desert, a painting on a macabre canvas worthy of the worst of horror films.</p><p>She drew in deep breaths as though she were running a race, inhaling along with him in the memory, sucking in air.</p><p>Within the memory, she felt Antony fold a cloth from the villa, a stack that he kept next to his weapons locker, and with it he wiped down his sword as well as his dagger. She felt him call Jeannie and heard the woman\u2019s matter-of-fact voice repeating his commands to remove the battle debris. She closed her eyes with him, saw the flash behind her closed eyelids, opened her eyes, his eyes, and marveled at the clean earth.</p><p>The memory ended, almost too abruptly. Antony began to withdraw from her mind, which felt like a long pull of taffy until the stretch thinned, then broke. She stepped back and bobbed her head. \u201cThat was so strange.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t say anything, she looked up at him. His lips were parted, swollen. \u201cI liked being in there,\u201d he murmured, his voice like tumbling into a deep well.</p><p>She drew in a soft breath as sage surrounded her, pelted her, touched her in deep private places.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be there again.\u201d He moved closer, less than an inch away.</p><p>She shivered and felt her body respond to this very sensual invitation, but she had other concerns on her mind. \u201cHold that thought, Warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right.\u201d</p><p>She understood. He couldn\u2019t exactly control all that was happening to him because of the breh-hedden.</p><p>She took a small step back and met his gaze. She even put her hand on his chest as though holding him back.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked. Just like that the sage receded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It was amazing. I experienced what you felt while battling, and I\u2019m not even upset about what I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re distressed. I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>She blinked a few times. How could she tell him that what bothered her had to do not with the battle images but with how close he was standing to her, that he had already expressed how much he\u2019d like to be inside her head again.</p><p>It occurred to her in a swift flash that her life had never been about again, but more like never-again. For whatever reason, a collage of her own memories shot in front of her eyes, of being a child and later a teenager, the number of times she\u2019d been taken out of school, right in the middle of class, and moved across country. In her entire life, she\u2019d never been in a situation where she could develop long-term friendships, except at work. Even then she kept her personal life separate.</p><p>Later, when she\u2019d fallen in love, she was convinced her college sweetheart, Jason, was the one; whatever her life had been before, love had found her and she would build a new life with him. Then he\u2019d walked out that last night. He\u2019d called her inaccessible, which had made no sense to her. She had opened her heart to him and he\u2019d left. So, yeah, never again.</p><p>But why was she thinking of this now?</p><p>\u201cParisa, what is it?\u201d He frowned now, heavily.</p><p>She shook her head. She didn\u2019t know what to say to him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI ... it\u2019s just it was such a strange experience.\u201d She couldn\u2019t tell him the truth: that sharing his memory like that had left her frightened of something she couldn\u2019t explain. She just didn\u2019t want to be that close ... to anyone.</p><p>So she ordered her mind and walked away from him, swinging her arms about and focusing on the feel of the memory. In other words, she changed the subject. \u201cEven when I walk, I\u2019m feeling your muscles in my arms and legs. It\u2019s extraordinary, Antony. Do you think I could try wielding a sword now? And I\u2019d like to practice throwing a dagger as well.\u201d</p> <p>Medichi stared at Parisa, at his woman. He had never felt as far from her as he did now. For him the sharing of his battle memories had been sexy as hell, and he wanted more. In fact he wanted it so much he could taste it, but was it him or just the horrible demand of the breh-hedden?</p><p>It hardly mattered. Parisa had shut him down. She\u2019d closed up her mind and shut him down.</p><p>On the other hand, maybe it was for the best. What was he to her, anyway, but her Guardian of Ascension, the warrior assigned to keep her safe? Yes, he was her breh, just as she was his. But wasn\u2019t that all just destiny bullshit?</p><p>Parisa would be wise to keep her distance, shore up her defenses, turn him down. This was war. One long horrible war.</p><p>Fine. Then he\u2019d teach her to make war.</p> <p>He had several swords in his weapons locker. Only one was identified, which meant the rest would be perfectly safe for Parisa to handle. Identified swords were deadly weapons designed specifically for battling death vampires. If anyone but the swords owner touched the hilt or cross-guard, it would result in death.</p><p>The only exception was Alison, who had endured a one-on-one battle with Warrior Leto, a former Warrior of the Blood. Alison had brought his sword into her hand and somehow, through power he had never seen before on Second Earth, recalibrated the identification before the grip touched her palm.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t taking the chance that Parisa had that power. She was clearly a preternaturally exceptional ascender, but yeah, he wasn\u2019t taking chances.</p><p>For practice, therefore, he brought two unidentified swords and a dagger into his hands.</p><p>The swords were warrior-big and because Parisa had much smaller hands than even most Militia Warriors, the sword seemed disproportionate.</p><p>But the moment he gave it to her, she fell easily into the rhythm of his battle moves. She stepped away from him and went through a series of thrusts and blocks. He shook his head and smiled. Sometimes the vampire abilities astonished him, even after living on Second Earth for over thirteen hundred years. To receive his memories as she had and make use of them like this was simply amazing.</p> <p>Jean-Pierre stood on the lawn beside Havily, but at a discreet distance from Medichi and Parisa. The newly created ascender was determined to become a warrior as quickly as possible. She had asked her Guardian of Ascension therefore to give her some of his memories, mind-to-mind, and by the way Parisa now swung her sword in large perfect arcs, the experiment was quite successful.</p><p>Havily ground her teeth. \u201cDo you see how simple this could be?\u201d She held the practice sword in her right hand, the tip aimed at the dirt.</p><p>He turned to her and smiled. \u201cI take it Marcus does not know you are here?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cHe would skin me alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you did not tell him. Instead, you asked me to accompany you, but your breh does not know?\u201d</p><p>She had the good grace to blush.</p><p>He continued, \u201cSoeurette, your man will not wish me to show you how to throw the dagger or hold a sword. He does not approve.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t care anymore, Jean-Pierre. I must learn how to fight. He can\u2019t be with me every minute of the day, and we\u2019re at war.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d He looked at her. Insight pierced his skull. \u201cCherie, non, non, non! Tell me you do not expect me to share memories with you? If I entered your mind, a most intimate act, then oui, he would kill me, a blade straight through my heart. I would not like that.\u201d</p><p>The lovely redhead lifted her chin, fire rolling from her eyes. \u201cI must learn to defend myself. You saw what happened to Parisa. Rith found a way to trick her to folding out of the palace. Out of the palace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am not the one you need to convince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will not listen to reason and I\u2019m desperate.\u201d</p><p>Merde. What was he supposed to do? Marcus was his friend now. All had been forgiven. The past was as if it had never been, and for that the Warriors of the Blood had Havily to thank.</p><p>She had brought Marcus back into the fold three months ago. She had allowed the breh-hedden to take her for a magnificent ride and then she had ridden the beast to its knees. She would always be soeurette to the Warriors of the Blood.</p><p>But this? He could not do it, not to his brother, so he lifted a brow to her. She lifted her chin in response.</p><p>He chuckled. There was so much to like about Havily. Even her name was a delight for his hopeless French accent. \u201cHe would be very angry with me, cherie. I cannot do it.\u201d</p><p>She drew a deep breath that swelled her chest. She held that breath for a moment then let it fly out as though carrying her irritation with it. \u201cMarcus has no say in this. We may be bonded but I am not the dirt beneath his shoes.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre grinned. \u201cThe dirt beneath his shoes? That is very good. I will tell him you said that.\u201d</p><p>A shout of triumph drew his attention back to Parisa. While Jean-Pierre had stood arguing with Havily, Antony had folded a target to the front yard. The dagger now rested not far from the bull\u2019s-eye.</p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d Havily cried, gesturing with a toss of her arm in the direction of the target. \u201cAnd now, I politely request that you download your battle memories straight into my brain because this sword feels ridiculous in my hands. I might as well be holding a log.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI am willing to teach you the skills of the sword but I tell you again, Marcus would put a blade through my heart if he knew I had entered your mind so ... intimately.\u201d</p><p>Havily rolled her eyes and groaned. She gestured with a slice of her left hand toward Medichi and Parisa. \u201cBut that is what I need to be doing right now. Look at her. It\u2019s as though she\u2019s been wielding a sword for centuries.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid to Parisa. It was true. He had seen Kerrick give his memories to Alison all those months ago, and the result had been the same\u2014quite magnificent. It would seem that because both Parisa and Alison were powerful, and could receive the memories from one mind to the next, they could learn the battling skills in the flutter of an eyelash.</p><p>He sighed. He wished he could oblige Havily, but he could not.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Havily said. \u201cI can see you intend to be as stubborn as my breh, so I guess I\u2019ll just have to find Luken. He\u2019ll do it for me. He\u2019d do anything for me.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre gasped. \u201cYou would not wound him so,\u201d he cried. Luken had been in love with Havily since he\u2019d served as her Guardian of Ascension over a century ago. \u201cTo invite such intimacy when you know that his heart calls to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Havily met his gaze. \u201cI was the one trapped in a forge with a madman draining the blood out of me. I know why Parisa has insisted on being trained to fight. Neither you, nor Marcus, nor Antony, knows what it\u2019s like to feel so powerless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut were you not drugged? How could you have fought such a man anyway?\u201d</p><p>Havily glared at him. \u201cI have thought about this a lot, Jean-Pierre. There was a split second when Crace grabbed me during the Ambassadors Festival that I could have fought him. Instead I froze, and he carried me away. I didn\u2019t even think to struggle in his arms. Maybe if I\u2019d had a few skills, even how to handle a dagger, I could have folded a blade into my hand, sliced his arm, and escaped. I don\u2019t know. But I didn\u2019t even have the option. That\u2019s what I want here, enough skill to have a chance if another death vampire attacks me. You warriors are so physically big, so powerful, you can\u2019t imagine anything else.\u201d</p><p>He stared into her intense light green eyes. He had not considered how impotent she must have felt. He could not imagine what she had endured in Crace\u2019s terrible forge.</p><p>After a long moment, he nodded. Finally, he withdrew his Epic phone from the pocket of his jeans. He held a finger up to Havily. \u201cI have an idea but you must be quiet. Will you be silent for a moment?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He made the call. \u201cAllo, Marcus? I hope I do not disturb you.\u201d</p><p>Havily gasped but she was true to her promise. She pressed her lips together in a punishing line and remained silent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of a staff meeting,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cCan this wait?\u2019</p><p>The warriors always took one another\u2019s calls, day or night, meetings or no meetings. Jean-Pierre continued to stare at Havily. He once more took in the set of her chin. His resolution strengthened.</p><p>\u201cIn five seconds, mon ami, I\u2019ll be linking my mind with Havily\u2019s and sharing my battle experiences. It must be done.\u201d He said nothing more but ended the call and returned the phone to his pocket. He counted backward. \u201cCinq, quatre, trois, deux...\u201d</p><p>The air shimmered beside him and a second later Marcus went chest-to-chest with him. \u201cThe fuck you will,\u201d he shouted. His brows were little more than slashes above his light brown eyes, but right now they seemed to sink into his eyes. His face turned the color of a beet, the rich hue of rage.</p><p>Jean-Pierre stepped away from Marcus with a wave of his hand in Havily\u2019s direction. \u201cYou must settle this with your breh. She has threatened to ask Luken to help her, which is something I believe we must avoid for Luken\u2019s sake. But after listening to her, I believe you to be in the wrong.\u201d</p><p>The moment Marcus turned in Havily\u2019s direction and began chastising her about Luken, Jean-Pierre crossed the lawn to join Medichi and Parisa, who both stood with eyes wide as the shouting began.</p><p>Jean-Pierre gestured to the door. \u201cPerhaps we should go into the villa?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He held the door wide for them. Parisa walked swiftly before the men. Within seconds the door was shut upon the war that now raged on the front lawn of Antony\u2019s home.</p><p>Parisa didn\u2019t understand why the warriors were so resistant to training the women connected to them. Maybe she could never understand, not being male. Antony hadn\u2019t exactly been eager, to say the least, but Marcus was particularly adamant. Was it because they had completed the ritual, the breh-hedden?</p><p>She glanced at Antony. He frowned at the door. The words of the argument were indistinct, but the highs and lows, the sharpness of tone, slid easily through the thick wood.</p> <p>Antony gestured with an arm in the direction of the kitchen. \u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. He nodded a couple of times.</p><p>Jean-Pierre was not as tall as Antony; none of the warriors was. He stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Marcus and was just a little shorter than Kerrick. He had the most interesting lips of any man Parisa had ever seen: a full lower lip and the upper in two points that would have been pouty on a woman. He looked ... sensual. His eyes were gray-green and in turns thoughtful and amused. She\u2019d always had the impression that he was the kind of man who would probably make his lover mad as fire with a joke at just the wrong time for the sole purpose of getting a rise out of her.</p><p>He extended his hand as well to the doorway, an Old World gesture. She led the way. Coffee sounded good. Her mind still fluttered like a flock of birds. She had wanted to continue the training, but nothing could be done until Marcus and Havily had settled their differences.</p><p>Downloading the battle memories had been fantastic. Even now, as she walked through the sitting room, she matched the roll of Antony\u2019s walk if not the length of his stride. She knew what it was to move, to run, to fly in his skin; which muscles flexed and how they reshaped every movement when he thrust or sliced with his sword.</p> <p>Taking a lesson in swordplay afterward had been like talking in shorthand. She simply knew how to wield the long thirty-inch blade.</p><p>Another lesson in daggers would be next. She couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>Antony made coffee with a French press, which of course Jean-Pierre had given him years ago. The warriors seemed to speak in shorthand as well. She sat at the island and sipped her coffee from a heavy white mug, the kind that reminded her of old-fashioned diners.</p><p>The men also held mugs and stood facing each other between the island and the refrigerator. She sat on a stool opposite, her elbows propped up on the dark soapstone. She squirmed on the stool. She was feeling muscles she was pretty unfamiliar with, small ones on the insides of her thighs, muscles low on either side of her back. Her calves and triceps burned. Her mind may have known how to do battle, but the rarely used muscles were starting to fire up\u2014and not in a good way.</p><p>\u201cWhy is Marcus so distressed about teaching Havily?\u201d Parisa asked.</p><p>Antony slid his glance to her. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain. I didn\u2019t want to at first, either. In fact, I have to say that my first instinct, a crippling one, was to lock you up in my bedroom and never let you out.\u201d</p> <p>Parisa knew what he meant, but other images flashed through her mind and brought warmth to her cheeks.</p><p>He frowned slightly then his nostrils flared. His eyes widened. She shifted her gaze quickly to the light brown coffee in her mug. She liked cream, lots of cream in her coffee. Her cheeks were now flaming. She took a hurried sip and came up choking.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, cherie?\u201d Jean-Pierre asked.</p><p>Choking was an excellent excuse for her red face. She coughed happily and bobbed her head several times. \u201cFine. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>But when a cloud of sage suddenly swept over her, she didn\u2019t dare look at Antony. Instead she swiveled completely on the stool so that her back was to the men. She coughed a few more times then tried to take deep breaths.</p><p>She glanced down at her breasts. Her bra and T-shirt were too thin. Her nipples were drawn into stiff peaks. There were so many ways that this experience, this breh-hedden, had become something of a torture.</p><p>She slipped off the stool and meandered toward the door. Maybe she could walk it off. Maybe if she moved around, she\u2019d stop feeling so much.</p><p>\u201cParisa,\u201d Antony called to her, a question in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cMmm?\u201d she responded, sliding the mug up to her lips and taking a sip. Her forearms in that position covered her nipples. If this was the way it was going to be, she was so getting a different wardrobe. The size of her breasts had always been something of a struggle. It wasn\u2019t like either of the men in this room would fail to notice her arousal.</p><p>Oh, God. She was about to die of embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019re ready to voyeur Fiona? Jean-Pierre has suggested, rightly so, that we should think about moving fast on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Yes, let\u2019s do it.\u201d With her mind turned to more important things, she lowered her arms and walked toward them. Two pairs of eyes dropped to her chest and she gave a little squeak. Ooooh, shit.</p><p>Jean-Pierre turned politely away but Antony\u2019s lips parted and he couldn\u2019t seem to tear his gaze away from her breasts.</p><p>\u201cWell, let me see,\u201d she said, drawing her cup once more toward her lips. \u201cWhere would be the best place to do this? Also, I\u2019d like to touch your mind and see if you can see the vision as well. Endelle can.\u201d</p><p>But Antony leaned in her direction as though he could move through the island. I\u2019d like to touch something else, he sent.</p><p>Antony, she chided. Jean-Pierre is right here.</p><p>He\u2019s looking out the window.</p><p>Stop it with the sage. Her lips trembled.</p><p>Let me see you again and I will.</p><p>She was shocked and yet he was serious. She lowered her arms, and his lids fell to half-mast. He drew his mug to his lips and sucked a stream of coffee into his mouth with a hiss that made her thighs tremble. She knew, she knew, that if Jean-Pierre hadn\u2019t been in the same room, Antony would be all over her.</p><p>She had slept in his bed all night.</p><p>She had awakened to his big warrior body spooning her.</p><p>She had turned into him and stroked what was already hard and ready between them. The lovemaking had been brisk. She\u2019d risen to her orgasm within a handful of minutes. Her body was like dry kindling to his lit match.</p><p>She knew one thing\u2014she wasn\u2019t wearing a snug T-shirt around him anymore. In fact ... \u201cWill you both excuse me for a minute? I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She met Antony\u2019s surprised gaze but shook her head at him. She didn\u2019t want him following. She set her mug on the counter then hurried into the adjoining parlor, breathing a sigh of relief: Neither man could see her from this point on. She needed a different shirt and she needed it now. She also needed some distance from the sage-machine in the kitchen.</p><p>She passed into the foyer and realized she couldn\u2019t hear Marcus and Havily arguing. Good. Maybe Havily would join her in Antony\u2019s lessons. Marcus would have to return to work, but maybe Jean-Pierre could spar with her.</p><p>She passed into the formal living room and glanced out the front windows, but couldn\u2019t see them from that vantage.</p><p>She moved down the long central hall, aiming for Antony\u2019s bedroom, but when she reached the hub of the guest room suites, opposite the library, she heard Havily moan, a distant sound from behind the closed door of their bedroom. She should have kept going but for some reason she stopped in her tracks. The voyeur in her raised its ugly head and she took several steps in the direction of what used to be her guest room on the right and what was still Marcus and Havily\u2019s room on the left.</p><p>Rhythmic thumping met her ears and she put her fingers to her lips. She shouldn\u2019t be doing this, but she was caught by the sounds of their lovemaking. The squabble was over. She wondered if Marcus felt a need to stake his claim all over again.</p><p>Probably.</p><p>When the moans turned to cries, when she could hear Havily calling out Marcus\u2019s name, she woke up to the improper nature of what she was doing. She retraced her steps to the central hall then ran the rest of the distance to Antony\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>She went inside and closed the door behind her. A second suite of guest rooms separated Antony\u2019s vast master suite from Marcus and Havily\u2019s rooms so she couldn\u2019t hear them anymore. She took several deep breaths, forcing her body to calm the hell down.</p><p>She pushed away from the wall and moved into the bathroom suite, which contained two enormous closets. She just hoped she had something suitable to wear that would allow her a little modesty.</p><p>Jean-Pierre had felt trapped in the kitchen. Even though Medichi was the third warrior to be struck by the breh-hedden, the varied ways the obnoxious ritual affected the lives of the men involved was getting on his nerves. Mon Dieu, Parisa\u2019s nipples had been ripe as plums, ready to be plucked, and Medichi stared at her like he was most willing to do the plucking.</p><p>All Jean-Pierre had been able to do was get out of the way. He was surprised, however, when Parisa left the kitchen. Surprised even more when Medichi did not follow.</p><p>Of course, that left Medichi bent over the island, his elbows holding up his head. He\u2019d dragged the cadroen from his hair, which hung in thick straight walls on either side of his face. Jean-Pierre could not see any part of his face, but he understood his suffering. The breh-hedden was nothing less than torture.</p><p>Jean-Pierre remained by the window overlooking the front lawn. Marcus and Havily were no longer there. He was not certain where they had gone. Right now, he did not know what to do so he crossed his arms over his chest and stared out at the front landscaping.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Medichi said at last.</p><p>Jean-Pierre shrugged. \u201cIt must be very difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui,\u201d Medichi responded.</p><p>Jean-Pierre glanced at him. \u201cOui?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d Medichi\u2019s smile broadened, then dimmed. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve been around you a long time. I know a little French. And I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>The sounds of quick footsteps could be heard in the foyer. A moment later Parisa, now wearing a long, loose blouse, appeared in the doorway. She cast each man a quick smile. Though her shoulders looked tight, she said, \u201cI\u2019d like to be in the library when I first voyeur Fiona. Will you both come with me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rith seethed. An unusual state for him.</p><p>Even though the Seers had predicted Parisa\u2019s escape, he had not meant for her to leave; he had meant for her to die. But just when he\u2019d folded to her bedroom to get the job done, he\u2019d found the bed empty. After a quick search through the house, he\u2019d discovered her nude in the backyard. Disgusting. He still couldn\u2019t believe she had escaped. He still couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d cared so little for modesty that she\u2019d flown into the air with nothing on.</p><p>Worse, of course, now Greaves had a link with the woman, a very intimate mind-link. Rith despised her for it.</p> <p>He was in France now. He had several emergency transfer locations. This one was just outside Toulouse Two, in the south of the country. The blood donors were situated quite nicely in three bedrooms at the end of the hall. Drugged, of course. The necessity of moving them had created a great deal of anxiety and more chatter than he could tolerate.</p><p>He sat very still in front of his desk, in his Herman Miller Embody Chair, his feet flat on the floor, his shoulders relaxed, and his spine perfectly aligned. His computer was in front of him.</p><p>He\u2019d developed a program to track the predictions from the Seers Fortresses of the highest-performing groups, Mumbai, Johannesburg, and Bogot\u00e1. The program ran constantly. He could watch it stream; anytime two or three Fortresses delivered the same prediction, the various reports were automatically shuffled into a separate document.</p><p>But the information that came through was always the same\u2014Greaves would make use of the newly forged mind-link to his advantage.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let that happen. Not if he could help it. But he was nothing if not a great believer in acting on Seer information.</p> <p>From the time he had learned of Parisa Lovejoy, the mortal-with-wings, he had wanted to capture her for the Commander. Greaves would have use of her, and he would do anything for his master. There had just never been a hint from the Seers about a possible mind-link. If he\u2019d known, he would never have abducted her.</p><p>He stared at the streaming reports and found the movement comforting. When it came to an end, he started from the beginning just to watch the documents flit by.</p><p>He trembled, a long shudder down his body. He had a very simple problem. He needed to get Parisa back. Well, the truth was that he needed her dead, but clearly that meant first he needed to kidnap her again.</p><p>He took a deep breath, but another shudder traveled the length of him. He was not a sexual man; he did not have that capacity because of a certain unfortunate event several hundred years ago. But he believed his desire to have Parisa back came very close to that sort of base need and drive. He craved to have her once more under his control.</p><p>He had almost succeeded during the woman\u2019s ascension ceremony. He\u2019d teased her mind with an image of himself, and she\u2019d folded to him. He shook his head. So very close.</p><p>What a coup that would have been ... except for the fact that he didn\u2019t have permission from Greaves to go after Parisa again. He was playing with fire.</p> <p>What no one knew was that because Rith also had limited voyeur ability, he was able to find Parisa anytime he wished to. He had but to open what he called his little window, think of her, and there she was. Right now, she was seated in the library of Warrior Medichi\u2019s villa. He listened for a few minutes and realized she was attempting to voyeur Fiona. What a coincidence, but not a surprise.</p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t share this information with Greaves\u2014for the simple reason that Greaves didn\u2019t know he had the ability to voyeur. Indeed, he\u2019d only been able to voyeur two people so far, one of them being Parisa. The other was Greaves himself.</p><p>What a tightrope he walked.</p><p>The phone on his desk rang, a soft chime. He answered it quickly. \u201cYes, master.\u201d</p><p>Greaves\u2019s deep, pleasant voice filled the space. \u201cGood evening, Rith. I hope your day has fared well. How are the donors doing?\u201d He was always polite. Just hearing from his master made Rith smile.</p><p>He put the phone on speaker then shifted slightly to his right. He had a bank of monitors, with cameras fixed on each slave, just as he\u2019d had in the Burma location. All the donors were asleep. \u201cThe sedative is working quite well. All shipments should proceed as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent, but then I would expect nothing less of you. I just checked my messages and discovered that you had called. I trust nothing is amiss.\u201d</p><p>Rith took a deep breath then plunged into the delicate issue. \u201cI called to request permission to secure the captive again.\u201d He held his breath. He had little hope of having the request accepted\u2014he knew Greaves was working his own plan\u2014but he had to try. He had to.</p> <p>Silence returned to him, not pressing, which was good, but silence nonetheless.</p><p>Finally, Greaves said, \u201cYou have need of this captive?\u201d</p><p>Rith nodded, then became aware he hadn\u2019t spoken aloud. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that for you to place your request was no small thing, but I am sorry. I am waiting only for Parisa to open her voyeur window to begin utilizing the link. Though I am disappointed with the limitations of this link, I have great hopes of entrapping a warrior or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will promise, however, to contact you the moment I have information of use to you where the blood donors are concerned. I also wish to thank you for how well you kept Parisa perfectly groomed, healthy, and compliant. I commend you, Rith.\u201d</p><p>His heart softened, like pudding in his chest. \u201cThank you, master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs for Madame Endelle and our blood donors, no doubt she\u2019s been informed of our little operation and will want to disband it. I do expect the Warriors of the Blood to attempt to locate and assault your facility, and I suspect that they will try to do so through Parisa. With that in mind, I want you to choose among the death vampires at the Phoenix Estrella Complex, twenty of the very best, and bring them to your home in Toulouse. Then I want you to prepare to evacuate the facility upon my command. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Rith was always surprised that anyone would interest themselves in his blood donors. The women involved had no particular value. Why would the warriors waste such critical time and energy on such a useless mission? But then he often found the actions of the warriors to be incomprehensible. Why, for instance, had they come as an entire unit to Parisa\u2019s aid?</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt they will attempt a rescue,\u201d Greaves said. \u201cYes, yes, I already know your opinion. And I concur. Such a waste of military expertise on behalf of partially ascended mortal women\u2014I am as incredulous as I\u2019m sure you are. But we can use their absurd sense of chivalry to our advantage.\u201d</p><p>Rith smiled. \u201cYes, master.\u201d</p><p>True friendship bridges every terrible abyss.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Jean-Pierre thought the library was a sensible choice for Parisa. She was going to voyeur the woman Fiona, the death and resurrection slave, and since Parisa was a librarian by trade, she might feel more comfortable surrounded by books.</p><p>It had to be difficult for the dark-haired beauty to attempt contact with a woman she had met in such terrible circumstances. Who would want to be reminded of a captivity such as Parisa endured? But here she was, settling herself in the chair by the farthest wall, ready to do what she must.</p><p>Medichi had to be very proud of his woman. She was learning to battle with sword and dagger, and she was intent on rescuing those she had left behind. Oui, Medichi should be very proud.</p><p>Parisa now wore a loose white blouse that was gathered low on her hips.</p><p>Jean-Pierre remained in the doorway to give the young woman some space. He crossed his arms over his chest and smiled. She had been humiliated by the earlier evidence of her interest in Medichi. The two of them were so clearly in the first throes of love, embarrassed and excited by turns. It was a beautiful thing to behold\u2014especially to see Medichi caught, because he never allowed himself to love. To chase women at the Blood and Bite, bien s\u00fbr, but never to love. Seeing him now with Parisa, so kind and attentive, his eyes shining with affection, with desire, oui, very beautiful.</p><p>He wondered, though, what the breh-hedden might mean for the rest of the Warriors of the Blood. Three already had been caught by the fever\u2014Kerrick, Marcus, and now Medichi. Was this portentous? Was there a chance he would fall next into Cupid\u2019s lovely web?</p><p>A shudder went through him. He had been a lover of women his entire life, and every decade or so he enjoyed a deeper entanglement, an emotional one, but always the women were unable to handle the warrior\u2019s life and commitments. But the women who had come to his three brothers were so very powerful. Could it be different if such a woman came to him? A world at war in this way was a horrible thing. He saw how Parisa suffered, how she was struggling to grow, to meet her challenges. Could he bear to see a woman he loved suffering in all these ways? He thought not.</p><p>He glanced around the room, looking for distraction. Medichi\u2019s library was very tall, with bookshelves all the way to the fifteen-foot ceiling. He had been collecting since the printing press was invented. Most of the books were leather-bound. Jean-Pierre liked the fragrance in the room. Leather had a strong presence, a perfect binding for fragile pages and black print, very male and very female at the same time.</p><p>A tapestry hunting scene served as a valance over tall windows overlooking the front lawn. Wooden blinds kept the light at a minimum.</p><p>Medichi drew a chair close to Parisa\u2019s. He was not convinced that he was needed, but Endelle had assigned him to assist both Medichi and Parisa as they shaped their plan to locate and extract the slaves.</p><p>As Parisa leaned back into the chair, her dark brown hair disappeared into the chocolate color of the leather. She took deep breaths. He tried to imagine what this must be like for her, so new to ascension, so recently freed from her captivity, so overwhelmed by the breh-hedden. He admired her courage and God help her but she would need courage to be bonded with a warrior, to live as his breh to whatever degree they chose to accept the breh-hedden into their lives. He wished her well, he wished her joy and every happiness but he did not think she understood yet just how hard life would be mated to a Warrior of the Blood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He repressed a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI see Fiona,\u201d Parisa said.</p><p>So soon. Jean-Pierre was very impressed. Parisa had a soft voice, in the lower registers, very pretty, like velvet. Her cheeks bore a flush of excitement.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Medichi asked. \u201cCan you see her environment at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s walking outside, alone. There is a high wooden fence and beyond that, tall trees, but not the tamarind trees of Burma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry communicating with her telepathically.\u201d</p><p>At that, Parisa opened her eyes and stared at Medichi. \u201cDo you think I can?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, so reassuring. He was gentle with her. Parisa did not need a heavy hand. Medichi was exactly the right man for her.</p> <p>Parisa once more closed her eyes. A frown of concentration formed between her brows.</p><p>Jean-Pierre\u2019s nostrils flared and he looked behind him. Was someone baking? He smelled croissants ... again ... rich buttery croissants, like the ones he had smelled in Rith\u2019s house.</p><p>He heard footsteps and Havily appeared. Her eyes glittered and her lips looked bruised. He turned away so that she would not see his smile. She had been well kissed and perhaps more.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked quietly as she drew up next to him.</p><p>\u201cParisa can see Fiona now,\u201d he whispered. \u201cShe is trying to communicate telepathically.\u201d He leaned closer. \u201cWere you in the kitchen baking?\u201d The words seemed absurd, but he didn\u2019t understand what he was smelling.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I brought scones home from my Starbucks run.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cSo, I must know\u2014are you to learn to battle with Parisa now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and appeared just a little pleased with herself. \u201cYes, I am,\u201d she stated, keeping her voice low. \u201cAfter work, Marcus will do the download and I\u2019ll start training with you boys and Parisa tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTr\u00e8s bien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou approve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBien s\u00fbr. I think it wise.\u201d But he frowned. If he had a breh, would he speak so easily on a subject that meant his woman might attempt to engage a powerful death vampire in combat? A shiver went through him. Mercifully, he did not have to worry about such a thing.</p><p>He did, however, feel uneasy. The aroma of the croissants made him hungry ... for many things. How very strange.</p><p>Fiona stood very still. She glanced around her. No one else was in the garden, but she always felt as though several pairs of eyes were on her. From the moment the woman in the Burma garden, Parisa, had escaped, Rith had doubled, maybe tripled his surveillance of his blood slaves.</p><p>Right now, however, she swore she heard a voice whispering inside her head: Fiona, can you hear me?</p> <p>Again, she looked around then put her feet in motion. She wore sandals and her usual pajama ensemble. The fabrics were soft but she so craved something else, anything else, to wear, like the jeans so many of the newer arrivals wore. Jeans and a blouse and underwear. How lovely that would be.</p><p>Fiona, this is Parisa, can you hear me? Don\u2019t be afraid. This is telepathy and I\u2019m not very good at it yet so if you hear me just say something aloud. A simple yes will do. Remember, I can see you. I\u2019m a preternatural voyeur.</p><p>Fiona walked because she was afraid if she stopped and turned around to hunt for the source of the voice, Rith would jump out of the bushes and frighten her back into the house. But she didn\u2019t think it would do any harm to say a single word aloud. How could that be interpreted as something dangerous?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A faint girlish squealing sounded through her head and she almost covered her ears. It wasn\u2019t loud, but it had startled her. So she said aloud, \u201cIf you really do exist, and I\u2019m not just making up voices in my head, no more squealing, please.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Oh, I\u2019m so sorry, Fiona, but because I\u2019m voyeuring you I can both see and hear what\u2019s going on and I heard you. But just to make sure we\u2019re communicating, say yes three times in a row.</p><p>Well, if she was going mad, this was not a hard phrase to repeat. \u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d</p><p>I heard it and I saw your lips move. Fiona, listen to me, I am doing all that I can to locate you and I\u2019m not alone in my efforts. The Warriors of the Blood are helping me. We\u2019re all working to locate you. After I escaped from Rith\u2019s house, Warrior Thorne and his men returned for you but Rith had already moved you to another location. We think it was done first by van or some sort of automobile then by dematerialization. Are we right?</p><p>If this was her mind circling down the drain of insanity, she was certainly speaking to herself in remarkably lucid terms. \u201cYes,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cYou have it exactly right. He put us in a vehicle, a Hummer, I think, but only for fifteen minutes or so. Then we were dematerialized here.\u201d</p><p>Where are you? If we can pinpoint your location, I think we can come and get you, but we have to know which part of the world you\u2019re in now.</p><p>It was at this point that Fiona\u2019s heart began to thrum, to beat so hard in her chest that she could hardly breathe. Could it be this simple, after all these years?</p><p>Tears rushed to her eyes. She kept walking. She had almost died for good during the last blood-drain. If it hadn\u2019t been for James, that strange elderly man who sat on a bench and fed sunflower seeds to a flock of pigeons, she wouldn\u2019t be here right now. He\u2019d pressed her forward, into the future. He\u2019d put courage in her heart when she had been depleted. He had said she had reason to hope. She hadn\u2019t exactly believed him, but now she did.</p><p>Aloud, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard people speaking French.\u201d</p><p>Another squeal, which caused her to put her hands over her ears.</p><p>Oh, I can see that I hurt your mind again. I\u2019m so sorry, but even a language narrows the search.</p><p>This time, Fiona smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll find out as quickly as I can.\u201d</p><p>She saw movement from the corner of her eye. One of the Burmese servants had been tracking her movements and listening.</p><p>\u201cI have to go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho you talk to? You go crazy? Come. Rith want you back in your room. Enough walking.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t worry, Fiona. I heard her and I can find you anytime. I\u2019ll be back for you.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fail me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you mean, fail you? You go crazy. You been here too long. Not normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cCrazy.\u201d She then made a face and gave a little cry, which caused the woman to draw back.</p><p>\u201cI tell Rith what you do. He no like.\u201d</p><p>You do that, Fiona thought. Then the next time Parisa struck up a mental conversation, the women would ignore her. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time one of the D&amp;R slaves had ended up babbling endlessly to herself, but it was usually the beginning of the end. It usually ended in the woman\u2019s death at her next blood-drain.</p><p>Parisa leaned forward in her chair. She was thrilled at what she had just experienced, but for some reason her head ached fiercely.</p><p>Medichi touched her arm. She looked at him, at the concern in his dark brown eyes. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I have the worst headache, but I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all very new for you.\u201d</p><p>She sat up very straight and held her head immobile. Jean-Pierre and Havily stood near the doorway. Both frowned at her.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Havily asked. \u201cYou\u2019re very pale. Antony, look how pale she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see it.\u201d</p><p>Parisa heard them talking, but the throb in her head worsened. She could still see Fiona. She trailed after her in voyeur fashion, but the pain intensified so much that she finally shut down her voyeur window.</p><p>A moment later the pressure in her head eased, but tears tracked down her cheeks. \u201cThat hurt so much and I\u2019d had such success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay,\u201d Antony said, his fingers stroking her forearm lightly. \u201cThis was your first try. I take it you communicated with Fiona? You squealed a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Antony, who had slid from his chair and was now on his knees and leaning over her. He wiped at her cheeks. \u201cI spoke into her head and even though she wasn\u2019t able to answer back, telepathically I mean, she responded to my questions aloud and I could hear her. It was just as all of you said\u2014Rith removed the slaves in a vehicle, a Hummer actually. He drove for about fifteen minutes then dematerialized the group somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a group?\u201d Jean-Pierre asked. \u201cThat would be a shitload of power.\u201d</p><p>Parisa smiled. Shitload sounded like sheetload. She loved his accent.</p><p>\u201cWhat else can you tell us?\u201d Antony said.</p><p>Parisa tried to recall the conversation word for word and began relating it as best she could. She ended with, \u201cOne of the women who worked in the Burma house as a servant was tending to Fiona, ordering her around. She kept asking Fiona if she was going crazy, probably because Fiona was talking out loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering,\u201d Havily mused. \u201cYou said Fiona was walking in a garden. Was it daylight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes it was. Oh, that\u2019s significant, because it\u2019s still daylight here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the shadows? Were they long or nonexistent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery long\u2014as in it was almost evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s excellent. Now, what of the gardens. What kind of plants did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLavender. I saw lots of lavender. Juniper, I think. The garden had rocks, herbs maybe, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Once Parisa had answered all pertinent questions, Antony called Carla at Central.</p><p>Parisa could hear her squeals, sounds that echoed her own earlier cries of excitement. By the time Antony got off the phone, he was smiling. Carla felt certain, given all the information they\u2019d been able to provide, that they might be looking at the Mediterranean region. If her hunch was correct, she would have a fix on the location of the death and resurrection slaves within the next few hours.</p><p>Was it possible?</p><p>Antony, however, frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, now we need to get Thorne\u2019s approval to go after them. I\u2019ll want at least some of the Warriors of the Blood with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs there a chance he won\u2019t let them go?\u201d Thorne always had the final word.</p><p>Antony nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Militia Warriors? Could we take some of them instead?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to chance it. Death vampires can easily overpower a Militia Warrior. It takes a minimum of four Militia Warriors to take down one death vampire.\u201d</p><p>Parisa blinked several times. The profound difficulty of the war came into much sharper focus for her. \u201cI know I must have heard that statistic before but until just this moment I didn\u2019t get it. No wonder Greaves has an advantage. He\u2019s creating death vampires left and right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd supplying them with the necessary dying blood.\u201d</p><p>She felt ill. If she hadn\u2019t been sitting down, she would have fallen back into her chair.</p><p>Of one thing she was certain: Somehow Thorne had to give them enough Warriors of the Blood to bring Fiona and the blood slaves home.</p> <p>Greaves repressed his fury. Rith was not at fault for what had just happened, or rather for what hadn\u2019t happened, when he made use of his voyeur-link to Parisa.</p><p>As soon as the voyeur session had ended, he had folded to Rith\u2019s home in the south of France. He wanted to see for himself what Parisa had voyeured, and here he was.</p><p>He walked in the Toulouse garden, Rith beside him. The visual part of the voyeur had worked perfectly. He would never mistake this place for anything other than the setting in which the preternatural event had occurred. But another part had failed, some imperfection in the link.</p><p>\u201cParisa appears to have a connection with the woman, Fiona. Were you aware of it?\u201d Greaves spoke in his usual tone, but Rith\u2019s stare had gone blank.</p><p>\u201cI was not aware of a special connection, but I believe I might know when it occurred. Do you recall that when you first met Parisa in Mandalay, her dress bore grass stains and her hair was askew?\u201d</p><p>Greaves nodded. He slowed his steps to watch Rith carefully as he spoke.</p> <p>\u201cFor some reason, the blood slave Fiona had succeeded in escaping. She approached Parisa, begging for assistance. When I tried to draw her away, Parisa got caught in the ensuing struggle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. And there was physical connection, touch involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Greaves nodded again. \u201cOne small correction, though, my dear Rith. We call them donors, not slaves. There will be no acknowledged slaves in the Coming Order. Please make use of the correct term.\u201d</p><p>Rith bowed. He seemed genuinely distressed. \u201cOf course, master. Forgive me.\u201d When he rose back up and met Greaves\u2019s gaze once more, Rith continued, \u201cBut please help me to understand exactly what has happened. Are you saying that Parisa voyeured our blood donor in this garden? Here in Toulouse? And you say they spoke? Are we undone already in this facility? I hesitate to move everyone since I am draining a female even as we speak.\u201d</p><p>Greaves narrowed his eyes. Rith had not been himself since the gifted mortal escaped his Mandalay home. That was clear to him now. Something about Parisa\u2019s escape disturbed Rith. Greaves wished he had known. He didn\u2019t like waves, even small ones, in his extensive organization. If he\u2019d known that Rith would be knocked out of stride by losing control of the mortal-with-wings, he would never have agreed to Julianna\u2019s plan in the first place.</p><p>However, as upsetting as Rith\u2019s disquiet was, Greaves had a greater reason to be disappointed in his mind-link scheme. Though the plan had seemed clever at the time, a serious flaw in the usefulness of the link had emerged\u2014Greaves had been able to see the entire exchange but not to hear it. He had vision through the link, but not hearing.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know why it had failed, only that it had, probably because the woman was more powerful than even he understood. In addition, he could only make use of the link when the woman opened it. He had truly believed that successfully engaging the voyeur capacity of the infamous mortal-with-wings would have afforded him more access. But it hadn\u2019t. He struggled even now to calm his temper.</p> <p>He did not normally give himself to profane speech, but in that moment he had succumbed.</p><p>When Parisa had made contact with Fiona, Greaves had felt the mind-link vibrate within his head. He had opened the link and flowed along the preternatural highway until he could see all that Parisa saw through her voyeur\u2019s window. He had experienced a tremendous flush of excitement because the applications of the link with the woman, now ascended, seemed endless in scope.</p><p>The moment he recognized the blood donor walking in the garden, he had breathed a sigh of pure exhilaration. That is, until he saw the woman look around and he noticed that though her lips were moving, no sound was coming forth, which meant that though Parisa was speaking telepathically to the woman, he\u2019d been unable to capture the conversation, either side. What good were pictures without words in such a situation?</p><p>When the Burmese servant had arrived to take Fiona back to her cell, he had cut off Parisa\u2019s voyeur window with a prolonged punishing slash of his mind. Yes. He\u2019d been angry. He still was. He could not believe that with his vast array of preternatural power, he was somehow deaf in his voyeur-link with Parisa. Yet so it seemed.</p><p>Still, he controlled his temper.</p><p>\u201cWe are in no immediate danger, but you can always leave a donor behind if you\u2019re forced to vacate quickly. The women are meant to serve the greater good. Please don\u2019t get squeamish about this.\u201d</p><p>Rith shook his head. \u201cNot squeamish. Orderly. I merely prefer to keep the shipments as regular as possible.\u201d</p><p>At that, Greaves smiled.</p><p>\u201cDo I amuse you, master?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou please me. You always have an eye to efficiency, and your indifference to the lives of the donors is very uplifting.\u201d</p><p>Rith nodded. \u201cI know how to sustain the correct priorities. I have learned well from you.\u201d</p><p>Greaves recalled the garden from Parisa\u2019s voyeur perspective. He put himself in her shoes, especially since she was so well connected to the Warriors of the Blood. It would be just a matter of time, probably less than twenty-four hours, before the Toulouse location was discovered. \u201cI take it you have an escape plan in place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, master. Across the seas this time I think but I will not allow the slaves, that is, donors, outside anymore. Shall I take them at once? It would be no hardship.\u201d</p><p>Greaves pondered the situation. \u201cNo, I think not. I want to make use of the voyeur-link again, to see if I can improve its function. I\u2019ll let you know what the opposition plans to do. I have no doubt a rescue attempt will occur. So make your plans, be sure to secure at least twenty death vampires as previously discussed, and keep me informed. And now I must return to Geneva.\u201d He did not wait for further conversation, or to hear Rith\u2019s final obsequious salutation. He lifted his hand and was gone.</p><p>\u201cYou think I like saying no?\u201d Thorne\u2019s voice thundered through the Cave.</p><p>It was now nine in the morning and all the Warriors of the Blood were present, except Marcus. He\u2019d served his two nights a week battling; the rest of the week he performed the difficult office of High Administrator of Desert Southwest Two.</p><p>Parisa took a step backward, forgetting that Medichi stood right behind her. Thorne had been thundering for a few minutes now, pacing the length of the room, glowering. Yes, the warrior glowered.</p><p>Antony\u2019s large hands landed on her arms and steadied her. He leaned close and whispered against her ear, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her head brushing his chin and cheek. A lovely rush of sage distracted her for a moment until Thorne reached the end of the room, headed back, and met her gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re asking,\u201d he cried. \u201cI\u2019ve got five critical Borderlands to protect here in Metro Phoenix Two, every goddamn night. And you want to take them all with you on this mission? Right now the warriors need to be resting and sleeping, not out in some other part of the world doing battle. And if the grid does pick up another anomaly after nightfall, how am I supposed to keep death vamps from riding down the Trough and feasting on mortals without warriors guarding the access points? Answer me that.\u201d</p><p>Parisa couldn\u2019t. She knew the Trough was the space between dimensions, and that most of the death vampires weren\u2019t powerful enough to just fold through. They had to ride through the Troughs in order to get to Mortal Earth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Warrior Thorne,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have an answer. I just know that I can\u2019t leave those women there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least they\u2019re alive,\u201d he barked, now standing in front of her. His skin was flushed, and the whites of his eyes were bloodshot. \u201cBut every time a death vamp reaches Mortal Earth unimpeded, through the Trough, women die. Some men, too, but mostly women are the targets. What do you think I should do?\u201d</p><p>Parisa made a quick decision. She moved into Thorne and touched a cheek with each hand.</p><p>He stepped away from her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me show you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, but he didn\u2019t move when she lifted her hands to his face again. His gaze flickered with something like panic but he held still. She closed her eyes and let the memories of Fiona\u2019s death and resurrection flow.</p><p>His whole body jerked. He gasped at first, clearly resistant, then lowered his shields. It was like feeling a dam give way, her mind flowing into his as the images rocketed through. The only part of the memory she withheld was what had happened to Fiona after she drank the small glass of blood. At that moment, she removed her hands from his face.</p><p>Thorne stumbled back a few steps, his eyes squeezed shut. \u201cShit, shit, shit.\u201d He repeated the word about a dozen more times. He ended up leaning his hips against the pool table. He stared at the black tile floor and shook his head.</p><p>He looked even more wrecked than before, so she crossed to him then put a hand on his arm. \u201cNow do you understand? I was only held there for three months and not as a blood slave. Fiona said she was taken from Boston in 1886.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. She\u2019s been a blood slave that long? Even before the days of the defibrillator?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe almost didn\u2019t make it back this last time, and I feel compelled to get her out of there. I think she\u2019s reached her limit. Also, though I can\u2019t explain it, I feel a connection to her.\u201d</p><p>He blew air from his cheeks and slid his fingers into his hair, dislodging several strands from the cadroen. For just a moment, his messy hair made him look younger. He turned beseeching eyes to her. \u201cCan you go tomorrow, right after dawn? That way we could all go. The Borderlands will be quiet by then.\u201d</p><p>Antony drew close as well. \u201cWe\u2019ve considered waiting, but once Carla or Jeannie has a lock on the site we have to move fast. It could be any time now. Given the vegetation, the length of the shadows, there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019re looking at the Mediterranean. It\u2019s still a big area to cover for the grid but we want to be ready to go at the drop of a hat.\u201d</p> <p>Thorne sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ve really got it narrowed down then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Antony said.</p><p>Thorne looked up at him. Everyone looked up at Antony. He was two inches taller than Thorne. \u201cFine. You\u2019re right. You have to go. Take three warriors with you but if I know anything, this smells like a fucking trap.\u201d Thorne\u2019s lips curved in a crooked smile.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucking call me if you end up facing a regiment.\u201d</p> <p>For a reason Parisa couldn\u2019t explain, Antony smiled. Must have been a warrior thing because she hadn\u2019t heard anything funny at all. Antony added, \u201cI know how you hate missing a party.\u201d</p><p>Thorne nodded but his lips flattened to a more familiar grim line. He grabbed Antony\u2019s arm and squeezed, his knuckles whitening. \u201cCall me if you need me.\u201d He stared into the warrior\u2019s eyes for a long, determined moment then dropped his hand and turned into the room. \u201cWho the fuck is going with them?\u201d</p><p>All the warriors volunteered. Thorne nodded again, and this time he smiled. \u201cAll right, then. All right.\u201d Parisa glanced up at him. His voice sounded like it had gone through a shredder.</p><p>\u201cI am going,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. He stood by the bar, shaking a martini. \u201cI will not be left behind on this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d Again Thorne barked.</p><p>Both Zacharius and Santiago stepped forward and together gave a shout like a battle cry.</p> <p>Thorne grinned. \u201cSo the two of you want to go?\u201d</p><p>The warriors gave another shout.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Thorne barked. \u201cFine.\u201d He drew close to Antony and poked him several times in the chest. \u201cJust make sure you bring them home safe and sound. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, jefe.\u201d</p><p>Thorne shook his head and ended the conversation succinctly. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, Medichi had Parisa back at the villa, in his bedroom. He lifted a female weapons harness, made of black leather and silver buckles, over Parisa\u2019s shoulders. The openings at the sides would be closed with a number of small buckles, a different configuration than for the male warriors, especially since the size of Parisa\u2019s breasts added a new level of adjustment. In that sense, the harness was a clever work of art. Endelle said she\u2019d designed it herself since a man just didn\u2019t understand the numerous problems associated with trying to fit a single type of garment to the various sizes and shapes of female breasts.</p><p>\u201cThis is heavier than I thought,\u201d Parisa said as she pulled the harness down to her waist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s meant to offer protection from moderate dagger thrusts. A sword will cut through it, of course.\u201d He\u2019d already told her that a good sword would cut through bone. He didn\u2019t intend to tell her again.</p> <p>He fought the panic that swirled at the base of his gut. Yeah, he was nauseated. He didn\u2019t worry for himself, but Parisa had only had about three seconds of training to his thirteen centuries. She wasn\u2019t fit for battle, but then hopefully this wouldn\u2019t become one. Hopefully, Carla would come up with the coordinates, they\u2019d slip inside the facility, take the slaves, and leave.</p><p>Right. And hell wasn\u2019t hot.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go,\u201d he whispered. He shouldn\u2019t have said it but he couldn\u2019t hold back. He felt her stiffen beneath his fingers as he continued to make the various buckle adjustments.</p><p>\u201cThe hell I don\u2019t,\u201d she responded.</p><p>At her tone, he drew back and looked at her. He met her gaze and saw the hard light in her eyes, dimming the pretty amethyst to something like raging purple. He nodded. He knew that look. He\u2019d seen it, oh, about a hundred thousand times when he\u2019d looked in the mirror getting ready for another night of battling.</p><p>He\u2019d never thought of his librarian as a warrior, but shit, right now as she started easing one of the buckles into position just below her breasts, she looked like one. A librarian hard-ass. Who\u2019d\u2019ve thought?</p><p>Of course it was easier to have these thoughts than the other ones. Like how untried she was, or that with every minute he spent with her he was sinking into the bond that kept drawing them together, or that his heart ached now when he looked at her.</p><p>So ... shit.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>He went back to buckling. He folded the appropriate dagger into his hand, a short blade meant for the slot beneath her breasts. He handed it to her and let her work it in and out of the sheath several times until she said it felt right to her. It was a slick, flat, stainless-steel knife and could do some good in a battle.</p><p>When he was happy with the way the front looked, he turned her around. The harness made a T-formation from the shoulders to the lowest part of the waist, to allow for wing-mount. He wasn\u2019t expecting that they\u2019d have to fly but they were, as always, preparing for every contingency. Her back therefore stared at him and he couldn\u2019t help what he did next. He put his hands on the exposed skin and stroked in a long glide straight down.</p><p>Antony, she sent. Even within his mind, she sounded surprised but not displeased.</p><p>She shivered under his touch and a swell of tangerine rolled over him. He closed his eyes and did it again. Another shiver, another wave. Jesus. He moved in close, fitting his body against hers, folding his arms around her, gathering her in tight.</p><p>She didn\u2019t resist and her breaths were high in her chest. She tilted her head to fit into the scoop between his neck and his shoulder. He ground his hips, letting her feel what she\u2019d just done to him.</p><p>Her arm swept up and caught his face. She leaned into his cheek and caressed him. Antony came as another sweet drift through his mind. She was getting better at telepathy all the time. He worked his arms tighter around her. He rolled his hips forward. She pushed her hips back. He groaned. I could take you right now.</p><p>I\u2019d let you.</p><p>He groaned again, but it ended in a sound between a grunt and a sigh. He turned her in his arms. She caught his mouth and before he could think, her small feminine tongue was between his lips pushing. Hard.</p><p>His back bowed and he realized he was about fifteen seconds away from coming. Maybe a quickie ...</p><p>His phone buzzed.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>She eased back but even as she did, he caught sight of her lips, swollen and red. Her eyes danced with fire.</p><p>He kept an arm around her waist as he slid his phone from his pocket. \u201cGive.\u201d His voice sounded hoarse.</p><p>\u201cHey, Medichi. Jeannie here. Good news. We\u2019ve found it, that heavy dome of mist again. Double dome, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like you said. The Mediterranean. South of France. Outside of Toulouse Two.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath because suddenly he couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cGreat. Thanks. I\u2019ll gather the troops. Maybe five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>Jeannie always was. She\u2019d served a long time at Central. In the old days\u2014and that was only a century or so ago\u2014she\u2019d held mind-links with the Warriors of the Blood, taking and receiving messages. It was an exhausting job, and the modern inventions of the phone, then the grid, saved so much time and energy. She always worked a twelve-hour shift, serving alongside the Warriors of the Blood. There were others, Carla, for instance, but for the men, Jeannie was the one.</p><p>He thumbed his phone and slid it into his pocket. Funny how a brief conversation could take the edge off even the most profound erection.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s happening?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes.\u201d</p><p>Parisa moved away from him and all that beautiful tangerine scent faded. Her gaze fell to the floor, and he could feel her sudden anxiety like a whiff of smoke in the air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he said, his voice firm. \u201cJust stay at my back. Don\u2019t try to wage war if it comes to that. Use the dagger if you get up close enough but only if you can do serious damage.\u201d</p><p>She drew a breath. \u201cBecause an adversary can take the weapon away and use it against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her gaze to him. \u201cI\u2019m not ready, am I?\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t lie to her. \u201cNo. Not by half. But it doesn\u2019t matter, does it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. Not at all. I\u2019m going on this mission no matter what. I wanted to have some skills but I know it\u2019ll take years to be a capable warrior. That isn\u2019t what this is about.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI know. Just remember, you\u2019ve got a good throwing arm. You\u2019re one of the best I\u2019ve ever seen. Use it if you think you can make a difference. That\u2019s what these weapons are for.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a deep breath and held her arms out. \u201cIs everything in place?\u201d</p><p>His gaze unfortunately fell to her chest, emphasized by all the leather and buckles. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cOkay, Mr. Subtle. Let\u2019s just get this show on the road.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. He put a hand on her shoulder and without telling her what he intended, folded her back to the Cave.</p><p>When she arrived, she yelled, \u201cHey! Give a girl a warning. I\u2019m so not used to that.\u201d She shook herself like a dog coming out of the water then patted her arms.</p><p>\u201cSorry. But you seem so comfortable in our world. I keep forgetting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sometimes you need to smash your enemy into the ground,</p><p>Or at least try.</p><p>\u2014Braulio, former leader of the Warriors of the Blood, 3334 BC</p><p>Chapter 13</p> <p>Parisa might have argued with Antony but they weren\u2019t alone. Zach stood near the pool table, his thick curly hair drawn away from his face, tucked away in the cadroen but flared over his back as though the clasp couldn\u2019t contain it all. His eyes were his best feature, cornflower blue, thickly fringed with black lashes. There wouldn\u2019t be a woman in the world not jealous of those lashes. His lips were full, his nose curved, even sexy. He was the usual warrior height, which Havily had once told her was six-five. None of the warriors was shorter than that.</p><p>Jean-Pierre looked unsettled, his eyes floating back and forth. He hooked a thumb in the waistband of his kilt and scowled then shifted on his feet. Something was bugging him, but she didn\u2019t know him well enough to either guess at the problem or ask about it.</p><p>Santiago crossed from the brown leather sofa on the right and moved to stand in front of her. He took hold of her hand. \u201cIt is my pleasure to serve you, Parisa.\u201d He bowed over her hand and placed a kiss on her fingers.</p><p>She felt Antony move in tighter to her back. She could feel a growl rumble through his chest.</p><p>Santiago looked up from his bent position and grinned. What a tease. He drew back abruptly when the growl left Antony\u2019s throat. She glanced over her shoulder and stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to start that now?\u201d</p> <p>He offered her one as well, a warning. She turned a little more, still holding his gaze, and thought for just a moment that he was not just a man but a vampire as well. His deepest instincts had shifted when he ascended. She had to keep reminding herself that she was ascended now, that she had entered the world of the vampire, and that she was no longer on Mortal Earth.</p><p>She patted his cheek. \u201cOkay, down, Fido.\u201d</p><p>She had meant it as a joke, but Antony grabbed her hand and where Santiago had kissed her fingers he licked a long slow line. She gasped. She understood his intention but all she could feel was the softness of his tongue.</p><p>Her body gripped low and tight. Antony slung an arm around her waist and kissed her hard on the mouth. She knew he was marking her, claiming her, and part of her wanted to protest this absurd caveman behavior but her body was one complete betrayal of thought.</p><p>Tangerine, he whispered through her mind.</p><p>Sage, she responded.</p> <p>Jean-Pierre cleared his throat. \u201cI do not mean to disrespect this petite love-fest, but we need to be going, non?\u201d</p><p>Antony released her, his dark eyes flashing. \u201cYes.\u201d But he turned to Santiago first. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that again.\u201d</p><p>Santiago shook his head. \u201cMadre de Dios,\u201d he cried, both hands tossed in the air. \u201cI keep forgetting the breh-hedden has command of you in this way. Lo siento.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology accepted.\u201d He took in a deep breath and let it out. \u201cJeannie has the location in the south of France. We all know the drill. We have no way of knowing whether the enemy has troops in position, but we\u2019re going in armed as though the place will be crawling with death vamps. I\u2019ll keep Parisa at my back. When we touch down, she\u2019s going to try to contact Fiona and we\u2019ll go from there. Everyone ready?\u201d</p><p>Three nods. Four, including Parisa.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The words seemed so inadequate given what they were about to do.</p><p>Parisa looked up at Antony. He slid his arm around her shoulders. \u201cYou ready for a fold?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>He remembered.</p><p>She smiled and nodded.</p><p>He lifted his arm. She felt the vibration first, then a soft swish through time and space as though she were floating, a kind of metaphysical blink. She arrived outside a very familiar dome of mist, probably a double dome, in a grassy countryside. For a moment, she recoiled at the familiarity of the mist and a shudder passed through her chest. Could she do this? Could she return to the monster\u2019s lair?</p><p>She drew a deep breath, however, and ordered her nerves to calm down. It was her idea to come on the mission. She had no intention of losing heart now just because of a little mist.</p><p>The warriors each turned in a full circle and folded their swords into their hands. Fists pumped weapons, fingers adjusted grips. She had held a sword with the full advantage of Antony\u2019s memories, and she knew how complete a warrior could feel with his sword in hand. She wished for one now, but she knew it was ridiculous to think she could square off with a death vampire no matter how vivid the memories.</p><p>Santiago took point. He slipped quickly through the mist, disappearing, then returned with equal speed. Without a word, he waved the warriors forward and whispered, \u201cTwo layers.\u201d</p><p>Antony put his arm around her and kept glancing over both shoulders. It seemed ironic to her that once inside the double dome, he relaxed a little and let his arm drop away. Given the circumstances, she was probably in more danger inside the domes than out.</p><p>The warriors remained grouped at what proved to be the far end of a garden and the back door of a small stone farmhouse. Chickens pecked in the gravel yard and a wooden table sat outside the door. The place looked empty.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s here,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>None of the warriors spoke. Each faced the house, waiting.</p><p>Antony whispered, \u201cGo ahead, Parisa, see if you can contact Fiona.\u201d</p><p>With his arm around her, she relaxed enough to open the voyeur window. She thought Fiona\u2019s name and came suddenly into a small whitewashed room. The woman\u2019s beautiful chestnut hair was fanned out on a pillow. Her arm hung off the side of the bed, her hand limp. She was asleep in what was afternoon in France? Something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>Fiona, she sent, a sharp word through Fiona\u2019s mind. We\u2019re here.</p><p>The hand twitched and at almost the same moment, a violent headache struck Parisa\u2019s mind, just like the one she\u2019d experienced in Antony\u2019s library. Voyeuring had never been this way, ever. Had her ascension to Second Earth caused an unexpected problem? She stumbled backward and would have fallen, but Antony caught her.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeadache again. Give me a minute. I can see Fiona. I still have the window open. She appears to be asleep on her bed.\u201d The pain sliced through her like a knife. Tears rained down her face. She wanted it to stop. She held her hands over her lips to keep from crying out. She took deep breaths, one after the other. Only after an excruciating half minute did the sensation finally ease, then disappear.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the matter, cherie?\u201d Jean-Pierre asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cHeadache,\u201d she said wiping at her face and smoothing her damp hands on her soft flight pants. \u201cIt\u2019s been happening lately when I voyeur. I\u2019m okay now. Let me try again.\u201d</p><p>Once more she opened the voyeur window. Again, she called to Fiona in sharp telepathic tones then finally shouted, Wake up. Fiona, we\u2019re here. Wake up. Each time the hand would pop up and down. Once her foot moved.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s drugged,\u201d Parisa said. \u201cShe can only move her hand and her foot.\u201d</p><p>Zach glanced back at her, his curly black hair moving like a cloud over his back. \u201cThen let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s see if they have anything planned for us.\u201d</p><p>The warriors moved as a quick organized unit, knees bent, swords held at safe angles away from one another.</p><p>A sudden shimmering covered the entire back of the house, in front of the wooden table. The next moment, an array of death vampires, sixteen strong, appeared.</p><p>Parisa stopped in her tracks. Antony turned to her. \u201cStay put, but watch for Rith. Don\u2019t look him in the eye if he comes to you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Her vision grew blurry in the wake of a burst of adrenaline that pounded her heart. The warriors spread out, preparing for battle at a ratio of four-to-one, which she knew from conversations with both Havily and Alison was fairly SOP for the warriors. They fought hand-to-hand with death vampires every night.</p><p>What were sixteen more?</p><p>Another shimmering, however, brought eight more into sight, and more than one of the warriors muttered, \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Antony took a step back toward her but the battle was just suddenly on. Death vampires moved like the warriors did, with preternatural speed.</p><p>Parisa drew her dagger out of the harness. In the distance, she heard Rith cry out, \u201cI want the woman alive.\u201d He sounded so certain he would prevail.</p><p>Rith. She\u2019d heard his voice but where was he? Safe, no doubt, near the house.</p><p>Something cold settled within her chest, her heart turning to flint.</p><p>Rith.</p><p>Her gaze sought him and found him in the doorway that led into the house. He watched her.</p><p>The next moment he was beside her. She didn\u2019t hesitate but slashed at his arm. She struck home. He cried out, recoiled, and took a step back. Antony turned, ready to use his sword, but at the exact same moment Rith folded away.</p><p>The war in front of her hurt her virgin eyes. She had never seen the warriors engaged in battle like this. Each had six to contend with and several of the death vampires, in full wing-mount, had launched into the air.</p><p>The moment that happened, the warriors fell back in her direction. Before she understood the intent, she was surrounded by them in a wide circle. Because she was theirs to protect, none of the warriors mounted his wings.</p><p>She held her dagger aloft in warning, but all movement became a blur of speed. Through the batting of wings and swipe of swords, death vampires fell. She kept turning in that broad circle in case her blade was needed.</p><p>Zacharius leaped into the air, spun in a circle. He took an arm and part of a wing and sent a death vampire spiraling out of control. He came back to earth, met steel with steel, lunged, and another death vampire fell backward screaming.</p><p>The screams were all around her as swords slashed and clanged.</p><p>She turned. Jean-Pierre withdrew one of two daggers from his weapons harness with his left hand as he battled in lightning speed with two death vamps. He threw the dagger at the same time, a powerful throw in an upward motion that pierced the abdomen of a flying death vamp up through the fleshy part below the sternum. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The death vampire flew backward, his wings flapping slowly. He lost control, sliding into a roll that aimed his body toward the earth. He was soon flat on his back in a messy tangle of wings. He wasn\u2019t breathing.</p><p>Santiago had only two death vamps left and he fought both with a single sword that moved in a whir of motion from one to the next. She began to understand how it was that only eight Warriors of the Blood were holding back the tide of war.</p><p>She grew calm and as the death count mounted, she shifted her attention to her voyeur window. She gasped. Fiona was sitting up in bed. \u201cParisa?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m here, she sent. Do you know where you are in the farmhouse? The warriors are battling death vamps at the back of the house on the stone drive.</p><p>\u201cCome straight through...\u201d Her speech was slurred. \u201c... then take the hallway to your left. Go to the end. The door on the left is mine.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre was free. Parisa called to him. \u201cI have her. I know where she is.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre moved back to her, his sword held at the ready and off to his right side. \u201cWe will fold.\u201d She nodded.</p><p>With his left arm he held her firmly and folded her directly to the door, away from the carnage. When she touched down, she moved just as Fiona had told her, to the hall, then headed down to the end.</p> <p>Jean-Pierre was right at her back. \u201cDo not open the door, cherie.\u201d</p><p>She waited for him, her hand on the latch.</p><p>He moved in front of her but kept his sword out of her way. The identified swords could be deadly. He gave the door a hard shove.</p><p>Rith was there, in the far corner, as though waiting for her. He had Fiona in his arms. He smiled and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cCan you trace to them?\u201d Parisa shouted, desperate.</p><p>Jean-Pierre had the same idea because he moved in their direction then vanished but was immediately back, stunned. \u201cMerde. The bastard blocked his own pathway. How in the name of heaven did he do that?\u201d</p> <p>Parisa turned around. \u201cMaybe there are survivors in the other rooms.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre moved swiftly past her into the hall, his sword again ready for action. He crossed the hall and pushed the door open. Parisa looked within. Empty.</p><p>She glanced down the hall. Santiago, spattered with blood, his brows in a tight furrow, looked at her and nodded. He also shoved doors open. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here.\u201d He hit another. He stood and stared. Oh, God, she could tell by the way he froze that something was in there.</p><p>Parisa felt weak as she watched the warrior pale. He lowered his sword and moved on slow feet into the room. His lips worked. He was saying something.</p><p>Parisa didn\u2019t want to know what he had found but she followed him anyway. She had to. No more holding back or hiding from the truth of what this new world was all about.</p><p>She felt Jean-Pierre at her back. \u201cNon, cherie. This must be very bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she responded. She kept walking. She reached the doorway and saw the familiar machinery hooked up to a woman with coloring similar to the Burmese women. Her eyes were open. Blood had pooled onto the floor from open tubing still connected to her arm. Her lips were blue, her pallor, despite her dark skin, the color of ivory silk.</p><p>Santiago knelt beside the bed, his knees in the blood. He took the woman\u2019s hand. He put the lifeless fingers first to his lips then to his forehead.</p> <p>Parisa once again felt that flinty sensation in her chest. She drew close to Santiago and put her hand on his shoulder. He clutched at her hand, and this time when his lips met her fingers there was nothing flirtatious or teasing in the touch. His cheeks were wet. \u201cWho would do this?\u201d</p><p>The question was rhetorical.</p><p>The answer simple.</p><p>Greaves.</p><p>Greaves was the author of it all, the supreme creator, the monster.</p><p>Jean-Pierre heard Medichi\u2019s voice. He turned and made way for the warrior.</p><p>As Medichi moved in, Jean-Pierre returned to the hall. Zach stared into the room. \u201cJesus. Would you look at this.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre glanced at him. They were all feeling it, the shock of what was being done to these women.</p><p>He did not want to stay close to the murder scene. His feet turned back down the hall, down to the small room at the end, where he had witnessed that bastard Rith holding the woman Fiona, one hand over her mouth, one around her waist. The woman\u2019s eyes had seemed not quite focused. Parisa had called it ... drugs.</p><p>He stood in the doorway. The window was boarded up, the room dim like twilight. There was a strange scent in the space, though, like a Parisian boulangerie, where bread was made. They were in France. Perhaps that explained the aroma. He moved toward the bed, his brow pinched in a hard frown. He reached down to the linens and drew the top one to his face.</p><p>Oui, the scent was there. He breathed it in. Such a delicate aroma, like a very fine croissant, buttery, like bread but better.</p><p>He took another breath and another. He had his eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cJean-Pierre?\u201d Zach called to him.</p><p>He turned but couldn\u2019t quite see the warrior. He lifted the cloth to his nose and closed his eyes again. In the distance, he heard Zach call for Medichi.</p><p>What did the warriors know of good French baking?</p><p>He kept breathing, deeper and deeper. He widened his nostrils. He opened his lungs. The aroma dove into his brain and made circles, a hundred circles, a thousand. The scent became a whirlwind and swept through his body, changing him into something he had never been before.</p><p>Animal.</p><p>He ripped the linens from the bed, bundled them into his arms, and squeezed them against his chest. He picked up the scent and drank it into his body, into every cell. Blood from the battle came away but it didn\u2019t matter. He pressed once more. All that mattered was this scent and bringing it into himself, into his body, into his soul.</p><p>He left the linens on the bed. He hunted the scent through the room, but only the bed held it. He opened the old armoire but there was nothing inside. Still, a whiff of croissant rose to his nostrils. He dropped to his knees and smelled every corner of the bottom of the armoire. Nothing, yet the scent was stronger.</p><p>He pressed his chest to the floor.</p><p>The scent was coming from the bottom and from the left. He crawled on his knees and sniffed like a dog all the way to the back. The scent grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>He reached with long fingers and found what he hunted. It was cool on the tips of his fingers. Metal, perhaps.</p><p>He pulled it out from under the armoire. It looked like a locket, but his vision was not clear. He pressed it to his nose and smelled the heavenly bouquet. His heart ached deep in his chest, like a wound that had just opened up and would never again be healed.</p><p>He put the piece of jewelry into his pocket and turned back to the bed. There was nothing more of the scent to be found. The chamber was sterile, not lived in, at least not very long.</p><p>Everything in his life that had come before seemed so very small in this moment. All that mattered now was finding the woman, Fiona, the one who had a scent like a French boulangerie. He returned to the place where he had seen Rith disappear with the woman. He found the trace. He pushed against it. He tried to fold himself after the trace again, but landed back in the small bedroom over and over.</p><p>He began to pace in a circle, a lion trapped in a cage. He punched the air and cried out. He roared. He punched and punched. Again he folded into the trace. Again, the block pushed him back into the room. Over and over he punched the air.</p><p>He roared and shouted.</p><p>He heard voices calling to him but could not make sense of them. Was it her? Was she speaking? Summoning him? What was being done to her? Was she being hurt? Raped? Killed?</p><p>He could not bear the thoughts, and the part of him that was man disappeared. His arms stiffened straight to his sides. His fists clenched tight, his back bowed. His fangs emerged. He roared at the ceiling and could not seem to stop.</p><p>Hands pressed on him now, held him in place.</p><p>He felt a vibration and still he roared through nether-space, flying through time and darkness and hunger.</p><p>His feet touched down and he fell into an abyss as deep as hell.</p><p>Medichi stared down at Jean-Pierre. He drew his phone from his pocket and swiped his thumb across the front.</p><p>\u201cJeannie here. How may I serve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to get Alison for me. We have a problem at the Cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the warriors hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. Let\u2019s just say I think Jean-Pierre needs Alison\u2019s help. We\u2019re not really sure what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send her.\u201d</p><p>He thumbed his phone then returned it to his pocket. He didn\u2019t know what he was looking at. Jean-Pierre had passed out. His behavior at the farmhouse near Toulouse Two had stunned him. Zach as well. Parisa and Santiago had been with the blood slave and hadn\u2019t seen the worst of it but they\u2019d heard the roaring.</p><p>The sound had been like a hurricane, like great winds had poured through the house. He still didn\u2019t know what had happened.</p><p>Zach said he thought it was the breh-hedden stretching its claws out once more, but Medichi hadn\u2019t experienced anything like this, and he sure as hell hadn\u2019t passed out. Jean-Pierre was still out, lying on one of the ratty brown leather couches on his side, his body completely quiet, unmoving. Not even his eyelids moved.</p><p>Parisa slid her arm around his. \u201cWill he be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Rith caused this? Affected his mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He seemed crazed but I don\u2019t know why. He kept partially dematerializing then bouncing back like he\u2019d hit some wall he couldn\u2019t penetrate.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his arm. \u201cI think I understand. He was trying to reach Fiona.\u201d</p><p>Medichi looked down at her. \u201cSo you think it\u2019s the breh-hedden, too? You think this woman, Fiona, is the one?\u201d</p><p>She released a heavy sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. Oh, God, probably.\u201d</p><p>A faint movement of air sent Medichi whirling around. At the same moment, he stepped away from Parisa and folded his sword into his hand, ready for who the hell knew what.</p><p>But Alison materialized and his shoulders slumped. He folded the sword away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t seem distressed as she looked at him. By now, after seven months of living with a Warrior of the Blood, she knew the score. She understood the ever-present danger in which they all lived. She was very pregnant.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure.\u201d He explained the sequence of events and Jean-Pierre\u2019s strange behavior.</p> <p>Alison just stared at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t Kerrick go through something similar at the Blood and Bite? I mean, before we got together? Didn\u2019t he end up here at the Cave with all you boys around him?\u201d</p><p>Medichi felt himself pale. \u201cI had almost forgotten how crazed he was. So, you think this is the breh-hedden?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at Jean-Pierre. \u201cWhat would you have done if the first time the breh-hedden struck, you found that the woman you needed to be with, to protect, had been abducted by a madman?\u201d</p><p>He thought back to that moment of seeing Parisa for the first time in the kitchen of his villa, of having caught her tangerine scent, of having been driven toward her in a hypersexual way. He recalled the complete loss of rationality, of reasoning. He\u2019d turned into some kind of Neanderthal caveman who had to have his woman.</p><p>Marcus had done him the profound favor of punching him on the jaw and bringing him back to his senses.</p> <p>All so primal and to a large degree humiliating.</p><p>What man enjoyed being so out of control?</p><p>Alison dropped to her knees beside the couch. Jean-Pierre\u2019s battle gear was still blood-spattered but she\u2019d seen it before. He\u2019d once asked her how she bore it and she\u2019d said simply, When I see the blood, I know that other lives, innocent lives, have been spared, so I\u2019m grateful.</p><p>Alison was a pragmatic, soothing presence.</p><p>She put her hand on Jean-Pierre\u2019s head, a light touch. She didn\u2019t stroke his forehead or pet him, just settled her hand on him. He\u2019d experienced that touch more than once, and he knew that right now healing waves were passing through Jean-Pierre\u2019s mind.</p><p>After a minute, the warrior began to move. His eyelids fluttered, his fingers shifted, even his left knee drew forward.</p> <p>A few seconds more and his eyes opened. He leaned up on his elbow.</p><p>Alison sat back on her heels, her hand falling away. \u201cHow do you feel, mon ami?\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at his chest. \u201cWas I wounded?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDo you remember what happened?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at Medichi then Parisa. \u201cWhere is Zach? Santiago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorne sent them home to get some sleep,\u201d Medichi said.</p><p>Jean-Pierre sat up, a deep furrow between his brows. He pushed a fist into the couch beside his hips and started to lift himself up, then fell against the back cushion. \u201cMon Dieu, my head feels as though it will explode. What happened? My throat, it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t remember the farmhouse.\u201d</p> <p>He stared straight ahead, his lips parted, the furrow growing deeper. \u201cThe farmhouse. Toulouse.\u201d The city name rolled elegantly off his Frenchman\u2019s tongue. \u201cOui, I remember some things. Battling. I saw Rith. And I saw...\u201d He gave a sudden harsh cry and bent forward, his elbows on his knees, his long fingers pulling his hair out of the cadroen. He started rocking back and forth. \u201cHe has her. He has the woman. He has Fiona. Mon Dieu, mon Dieu.\u201d</p><p>Alison put her arm around his shoulders. \u201cYes, Rith has Fiona. That\u2019s right. You\u2019ve remembered correctly.\u201d</p><p>He rocked and rocked.</p><p>Medichi heard a strangled sound beside him. Parisa held the tips of her fingers to her lips. Tears ran down her face.</p><p>He put his arm around her and drew her close against him. Despite his bloody shirt and harness, she buried her face against him.</p><p>Medichi stood very still, offering what comfort he could but for some reason, watching Jean-Pierre rock back and forth took him on a hard, swift journey thirteen centuries back. He had rocked just like that, except that he\u2019d held his dying wife in his arms. He spoke the words that shot through his mind. \u201cJean-Pierre, she\u2019s not dead.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked at him. Even Jean-Pierre ceased rocking and stared. Medichi said it again: \u201cShe\u2019s not dead. Fiona is not dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you know?\u201d</p><p>He released Parisa and looked at her. \u201cWill you find her for Jean-Pierre? That will give him some peace.\u201d</p><p>She nodded but winced. She took a deep breath. He remembered her headaches.</p><p>\u201cI see her. She\u2019s in a long room with five other women. There were seven in Burma and one just died in Toulouse. How I hate this man.\u201d Her voice quavered as she added, \u201cAll of them are on cots even though the sun is shining through the windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain she lives?\u201d</p><p>Parisa nodded. \u201cI can see her chest rising and falling.\u201d She suddenly clutched her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have to close this.\u201d The moment she did, she gave a little cry. \u201cOh, God that hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t now?\u201d Medichi asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened. The voyeur never hurt before, not even a twinge. But now it\u2019s like knives in my head.\u201d She took a few more deep breaths then shifted her gaze to Jean-Pierre. \u201cShe is alive, Jean-Pierre. I\u2019ve seen her.\u201d</p><p>He put his head in his hands, his elbows still on his knees. \u201cWhat has happened to me? Why do I feel as though a rock sits in my chest? Why do I care so much about this woman I do not know?\u201d He grew very still.</p><p>Medichi could barely breathe. How long would it take before Jean-Pierre figured it out?</p><p>Not long. \u201cNon! C\u2019est impossible. Pas moi. Pas le breh-hedden. I love women. All women. I cannot devote myself to one, not now. Jamais! Fuck.\u201d</p><p>Medichi bit his lower lip hard. He understood the frustration. Completely.</p><p>But it was Parisa who started laughing. She laughed so hard that more tears ran down her cheeks.</p><p>Jean-Pierre\u2019s fury expanded. \u201cYou laugh at me?\u201d he cried.</p><p>She nodded then laughed some more. \u201cOui. Non. Oh, Jean-Pierre, all of us have felt what you\u2019re experiencing right now.\u201d</p><p>She cast an arm in Medichi\u2019s direction. \u201cDo you think I wanted this? To be enslaved by the breh-hedden? To be dragged into this war in this violent way? No, but here I am.\u201d She wiped her cheeks and the laughter fled her as suddenly as it had come. \u201cFiona has lived for over a hundred years as a blood slave and if you are being brought into her life\u2014to protect her, to love her, to care for her ... I think it\u2019s the very least she deserves.\u201d</p><p>A shared meal</p><p>A glass of wine</p><p>A sweet dessert</p><p>And you</p><p>\u2014Collected Poems, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Parisa stood in the shower, savoring the hot, hot, hot water beating on her neck and shoulders. she had hidden herself away in the guest room so that she could be alone for a little while.</p><p>A sad light had passed through Antony\u2019s eyes, but he hadn\u2019t argued. He\u2019d simply kissed her on the forehead, said he would take a shower as well, then prepare a light repast. Yep, he\u2019d really said light repast. The warriors often slipped into speech patterns that belonged to prior centuries, even earlier languages.</p><p>So she was showering in the guest room. She felt like a wrung-out towel.</p><p>Poor Jean-Pierre.</p><p>Poor Fiona, who must have known, even drugged, that she had been close to a rescue.</p><p>Instead, Rith had used her as bait. All the other blood slaves had already been moved to another location. Except the one who had died. The only consolation was that twenty-four death vampires were now well and truly dead.</p><p>She planted her hands on the wall of the shower stall, the tile cool beneath her fingers. She stretched her neck. That felt a little better.</p><p>She had seen the small clock in the foyer, the one that sat next to the magnolia centerpiece. It had been not quite noon.</p><p>She did have one satisfaction. She had cut Rith. Funny how she had always thought of herself as a nonviolent person, but right now all she wanted to do was hurt that horrible man.</p><p>Exhaustion suddenly dragged at her body.</p><p>Though it was only noon, and she\u2019d had a good night\u2019s sleep, it was all too much\u2014her recent escape from Burma, having entered into an extremely intimate relationship with a man she barely knew, ascending to Second Earth, the presence of fangs in her mouth, learning to battle by having Antony\u2019s memories downloaded directly into her mind, dematerializing, battling alongside the Warriors of the Blood, for God\u2019s sake, and watching the breh-hedden overtake yet another warrior. And not to mention the headaches that now accompanied her voyeur window.</p><p>But underneath everything was a fear that Antony would one day want more from her than she could give. Her heart had been broken once just a few months before her wedding. After that, she\u2019d lost interest in pursuing a relationship of any kind. She had a very specific drive toward Antony, a very powerful need, but beyond that she preferred to keep thinking in terms of her life, not theirs.</p><p>She felt caught in a maelstrom and yes, she had chosen to ascend and yes, she had worked to try to rescue Fiona and the other D&amp;R slaves, but it was all too much.</p><p>Oh, whatever.</p><p>She shut off the water and dragged the towel from the nearby rack. She caught the towel under her arm, bent her head sideways and squeezed the excess water from her hair. She was just a little pissed off at how hard life was right now so she dried her body as though punishing her skin, then did the same thing to her hair. She made little huffy cries of protest but to what? Fate? Life? God? Or the rough towel work?</p><p>Why was life always so damn hard? Even when she was a child, things hadn\u2019t been easy. Her parents had moved her around so much that she\u2019d never had any real friends. Early on she\u2019d learned that life could be cruel. She thought she\u2019d made peace with it, but right now she was just mad all over again.</p><p>She stomped around the bathroom a few times, punching at the air ... until the smell of saut\u00e9ed something\u2014onions, maybe mushrooms, definitely Italian sausage\u2014floated through a vent. Her stomach rumbled.</p><p>And just like that all her angst fled. If Antony was also cooking pasta, she thought she would die and go to heaven. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And there it was, the truth about existence as she saw it, that yes life was difficult but there were always pleasures, many pleasures to balance the hardships.</p><p>The smell of saut\u00e9ing vegetables and meat, especially since it didn\u2019t smell of Burmese ginger and turmeric, was one of those pleasures.</p><p>She brushed the tangles out of her wet hair then fluffed it a little with her fingers. She put lip gloss on then peered at herself in the mirror. With everything she\u2019d been through in the past forty-eight hours, she was certain she\u2019d look hollow-eyed, her nose swollen from crying, her eyes red. But that was so not the case.</p> <p>She sucked in a breath.</p><p>She had ascension skin and health. She actually looked good. Well, damn.</p><p>She heard a rap on the bedroom door. She hugged the towel around her body then laughed at herself. Antony had seen her naked ... more than once. Still, she felt embarrassed. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pasta is almost ready,\u201d he said. \u201cShall I put it in the warmer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in two minutes. Promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. Okay. See you in two.\u201d</p><p>She hurried into a black lace thong, a pair of jeans, a black lace bra, and a loose purple T-shirt. Well, it was loose everywhere except across her chest.</p><p>She left the odd sense of security she\u2019d had during this time in the guest room, and raced for the kitchen. The aroma made her mouth water. But when she did the little zigzag through the dining room to the doorway of the kitchen, what stopped her wasn\u2019t the candlelight on the island, or the sparkling glasses of dark red wine, or the sight of steaming pasta being gently coaxed into a white bowl from an oversized saut\u00e9 pan. All that was amazing, but what brought her to a full halt was Antony standing shirtless, his chest beautifully on display, his button-down jeans loose below his belly button, and his hair hanging damp almost to his navel.</p><p>Oh. Dear. God.</p><p>She could almost forget entirely about her empty, growling stomach at the sight of so much exotic masculine beauty. He looked up at her with the saut\u00e9 pan still at an angle and the last bit of pasta tumbling onto the plate and he smiled, that smile of his loaded with teeth and confidence. His eyes glittered in the candlelight.</p><p>\u201cSee something you like?\u201d</p> <p>Yes. God. Yes.</p><p>Medichi nearly dropped the saut\u00e9 pan at the wave of tangerine that suddenly hit him. He did take a step back to steady himself. Yeah, his woman liked what she saw.</p><p>He settled the pan and large spoon in the oversized sink, picked up both bowls of pasta, and moved around the island. She came forward at the same time and took the seat on the right.</p><p>She didn\u2019t meet his gaze but leaned over her plate. Holding her damp hair back, she closed her eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cHeaven,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He looked at her, at the delicate fingers on her hair, at the profile that seemed carved from ivory, at that which had become most precious in these few short months. His heart swelled when it shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>She was here.</p><p>She was safe.</p><p>She was right. This was heaven.</p> <p>Spearing a slice of sausage, she sank in her teeth and moaned.</p><p>Okay, that reminded him of a different kind of meal. He faced forward, grabbed his own fork and spoon, and began spearing and twirling. The moment he did, his hunger roared at him. One thing battling required was a solid, heavy intake of calories.</p><p>He avoided speaking to her because he knew what would happen. He\u2019d get lost in her voice, or the color of her eyes, or her scent, and he\u2019d start nuzzling her neck. Besides, the way she had launched into her pasta told him she was just as starved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m being rude. I\u2019m slaughtering this meal and not saying one word to you.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, smiled, then gestured with his fork to her bowl. \u201cEat. We both need it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, smiled in return, and reapplied her efforts. When the contents of her bowl were about half demolished, she said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been thinking about how to locate the women.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on her arm and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this right now. We just got back from a tough situation. You can take a break, breathe. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>She huffed a sigh and twirled her pasta slowly around her spoon. \u201cHow about just a couple of points and then I\u2019ll let it drop, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but just a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Okay.\u201d She nodded. \u201cFirst, have you already contacted Carla?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, before I started cooking. She\u2019s opened up the grid in France even though Rith could have taken the slaves anywhere. But she had to start somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s point one. The grid is already in place and searching. I was concerned about that.\u201d She shifted slightly and met his gaze. \u201cYou know how the earth rotates on its axis?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYep, twenty-four hours a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. If I voyeur Fiona and can find a window near her, we can help pinpoint her location by a sunrise or sunset. Yes?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cYou realize, Parisa, that you\u2019ve just cut the hunt time down by anywhere from one hour to twelve.\u201d</p><p>Parisa smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. I think we have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the headaches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019m going to have to suck it up, but I also thought if I can just swing in, take a snapshot, and get out, maybe the headaches won\u2019t be so bad. In fact, I want to give it a try right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait until you\u2019re done eating?\u201d</p><p>But she\u2019d already set her fork down. She\u2019d already opened the window.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWell, that was easy. And no headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. What did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asleep on a cot in a long room with several other cots. There was a bank of windows, and it\u2019s full light outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo window coverings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. Just a lot of deep blue sky.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI could open my window every half hour and check the sky. That would be a good start, right?\u201d</p><p>Medichi whipped his phone out of the pocket of his jeans and thumbed.</p><p>\u201cCarla here, how can I serve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a little brainstorm.\u201d He explained their new plan.</p><p>\u201cWow. I should have thought of that. Tell Parisa we just cut the search area by a lot.\u201d</p><p>Medichi laughed. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>He thumbed his phone and relayed Carla\u2019s part of the conversation. Once more, he gestured with his fork to Parisa\u2019s bowl. \u201cNow eat. And no more discussion.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him over a lump of sausage. When she\u2019d taken another sip of wine, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful cook and this is just heaven. Fresh basil?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI grow it in the herb garden.\u201d He gestured to the west wall. \u201cI have a garden back there.\u201d</p><p>She held her wineglass by the stem and swirled. \u201cYou\u2019re a renaissance man.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI like to cook. We had good food on our farm in Italy all those years ago. We had a vineyard and an olive grove as well, like I do here. I\u2019m thinking about having a wood-fire oven put in.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around the space. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand to his left. \u201cI\u2019d like to take out this entire bank of cupboards and counter and start over. I want to push this wall out, add French doors that will open onto the garden. I made the mistake of planting the garden out there, where the only access is going through the foyer doors to the back terrace. It\u2019s not that far but it\u2019s not convenient either. Besides, I\u2019d like to have a view of the White Tanks from this room.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and sighed. \u201cSounds like a good plan.\u201d Her shoulders looked a little slumped. Well, a good meal, red wine, and trauma would do that to a body.</p><p>He shifted his gaze away from her. She needed to get some rest, he could see that. He felt uneasy because he was torn down the middle. The breh-hedden wasn\u2019t just a sexual entity but demanded that he think of his woman in all respects, one of them being that she needed her rest. But the other half of him was a long drive of need that he\u2019d been keeping a lid on, oh, hell, from the last time she\u2019d left his bed.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>He pushed his empty bowl away and planted his elbows on the soapstone. \u201cYou probably could use some rest right now,\u201d he suggested, still not looking at her. He cleared his throat. \u201cIf you want to sleep in the guest room, I really would understand.\u201d</p><p>He waited, but she didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Parisa tried to interpret this suggestion, but her mind had switched from alertness to one big mud slide of lethargy. The meal, as wonderful as it was, had acted on her like a sedative.</p><p>She released a heavy sigh and put her wineglass back on the soapstone. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how tired I am.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, his gaze open, speculative, wary.</p><p>She frowned a little. \u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. \u201cNo. Never.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at that. \u201cNever? You\u2019ll never be mad at me, ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not right now.\u201d He smiled as well.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to sleep in the guest room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>At that she laughed. \u201cWhy did you suggest it then?\u201d</p><p>He looked away almost like he was embarrassed. But by what?</p><p>She put her hand on his forearm\u2014and the moment she touched him a soft buzzing sensation, a delicate vibration, ran through her hand. She stared at her hand and his skin, at the fine black hair. Her fingers drifted over his arm, savoring the muscle beneath and the texture of the hairs above.</p><p>He was so masculine, every bit of him, every line of him, and the hardened feel of his warrior muscles started waking her up but this time in an entirely different way.</p><p>She lifted her gaze to his and caught the roll of his scent, sage and all his wonderful maleness. She started sliding off the stool without even realizing she was moving, until she stood with her hips against the side of his. With her hand she started low at his waist and climbed, beneath his long hair, feeling both the gentle dips and swells of the scar tissue on his back as well as the larger, harder mounds of muscle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He flinched and she pressed the tips of her fingers into the scars. \u201cThis is part of you,\u201d she whispered. She pushed his long hair away from his back. He had tensed up, maybe uncertain, maybe ashamed. She leaned over his back and began to kiss and lick the stripes he bore.</p><p>He shuddered and leaned forward.</p><p>She slid her hand off his forearm then moved to stand behind him. She split his long black hair into two parts and pushed each part over the closest shoulder. She looked at his back in the soft candlelight. His wing-locks were visible as well as his scars. She drew close then took a deep breath.</p> <p>Your skin smells of sage and something very male, she sent. It makes me ... hungry.</p><p>He groaned and aloud, said, \u201cTangerine.\u201d</p><p>She drew back. \u201cDo you have any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTangerines.\u201d</p> <p>At that, he shifted toward her, turning so that he could meet her gaze. His lips were swollen with need, his eyes dark. He nodded. He started to rise but she pushed him down with her hand. \u201cTell me where they are. I\u2019ll get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put the last batch in the fridge, the drawer on the bottom.\u201d</p><p>She rounded the island, opened the refrigerator door, and found them. The cool air flowed over her skin, tightening her nipples. As she drew one of the tangerines out, she blushed at the very wicked idea that had taken hold of her.</p><p>She closed the door then turned toward Antony. He stared at her unblinking, his chin low. His palms were now flat on the soapstone. He looked ready to spring at her, land on her, take her to the floor.</p><p>She set the tangerines on the island. She pulled off her shirt but kept her bra on. With a knife she split one of the tangerines in half then pierced the fruit with the sharp tip again and again, grinding the blade into the wedges, tearing up all the connecting fibers, until the half tangerine was a wet, pulpy mess.</p><p>She set the tangerine on the counter, put her knife in the sink, and rinsed and dried her fingers. Very slowly, while watching Antony\u2019s face darken, she lifted each of her breasts out of her bra so that she was supported by the underwires. She didn\u2019t want to think of exactly how this looked\u2014but she knew Antony. He was loving this.</p> <p>She lifted the tangerine and held it low to the tip of her breast and slowly brought the juicy center to float over her peaked nipple. Tangerine juice dribbled down her abdomen.</p><p>She watched him, his gaze flooding with heat and something like pain. His arms fell wide. His chest rose and fell. Damn, he would hyperventilate if she didn\u2019t do something.</p><p>\u201cYou stay right there,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded, one deep low nod. She moved around the island, the tangerine still rotating, his gaze fixed to the sight. When he breathed, he now made a sound like a train engine.</p><p>As she drew around the second corner, he shifted on his stool. \u201cI have to stand up. You understand.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at his jeans. He was at a bad angle. She nodded.</p><p>His hips flexed.</p><p>\u201cLose the jeans,\u201d she commanded.</p> <p>His gaze flickered over her chest from one extended breast to the next. He folded off his pants.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d gone commando.</p><p>And he was a rigid line of pleasure waiting to happen. He wept from the tip. His breathing was still harsh, chugging along.</p><p>As she drew close, she lifted the tangerine from her breast and put it against his mouth. He groaned loud and long, leaning toward her but sucking hard at the fruit. The sight brought a strange rush of tears to her eyes. She reached low and touched his cock, stroking him very lightly just at the smooth round head.</p><p>Antony, she sent softly into his mind, did I tell you how much it meant to see you each night, to watch you pleasure yourself? To take tangerines into your mouth? It helped me to know you were real and you were there, that I wasn\u2019t alone. You kept me sane.</p><p>He drew the tangerine from his lips. His breathing eased. His hips flexed and he pushed his cock farther through the grip of her hand. \u201cThis is better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Oh, yes.\u201d</p><p>He caught a tear as it rolled down her cheek, then sucked the drop from his finger. He moved into her, his cock folding up to fit against her abdomen. He slid his arms around her back trapping her arms low, then he kissed her, a tangerine-flavored kiss that knocked her senses flat.</p><p>He pushed his tongue into her mouth and made her pulse throb with each thrust. Her arms drifted around his waist. She clung to his skin, pulling and kneading, even the ribbed scar tissue.</p><p>He left her mouth and kissed down her neck. When he licked over her vein pleasure shot through the well of her body, anticipating a hard strike of fangs. But he didn\u2019t linger there. He moved lower, bending over and angling his head so that he could reach what she had offered by the refrigerator.</p><p>His tongue licked down her chest and moved to the tangerine nipple. He groaned all over again as he drew the tip into his mouth and began to suckle.</p><p>Her body tightened very low and began to pull inward with each suck of his mouth and lips. Her breathing transformed into soft pants, one after the other, until she was dizzy. She settled her hands on the top of his soft hair.</p><p>Her hips bucked at the sensation between her fingers, the pull of his mouth on her breast, and the responsive tugs between her legs.</p><p>\u201cAntony,\u201d she cried out. Frustration had her now. She needed more from him.</p><p>He drew back. His lips were red and swollen from suckling her, his eyes wild.</p><p>\u201cHelp me, Antony.\u201d She slung an arm around his neck and kissed him.</p><p>He picked her up in his arms and cradled her against his chest. She pressed her face into his neck. She felt her fangs emerge and began to lick his throat. He moved her into the hallway that led in the direction of the pool and the guesthouse, but not very far. She thought maybe he meant to have her in the pool.</p><p>Instead he turned up the narrow spiraled staircase, holding her at a careful angle so that she didn\u2019t scrape anything. He was almost too big for the space himself, but he managed it.</p><p>\u201cThe bed in the turret room is at a perfect height for what I want to do to you.\u201d</p><p>She hissed and shivered. A low chuckle rippled from his throat. \u201cI\u2019m going to do you, Parisa. I\u2019m going to do you over and over right against this bed. And you\u2019ll be screaming.\u201d</p><p>Her hips bucked against him. She needed to get her pants off. She needed him inside her.</p><p>In the turret he put his hand against her pants and folded them off. Cool air flowed over her skin.</p><p>He slid his fingers down the sides of her thong and she heard the lace ripping as he pulled it apart. But, oh, God, the sensation of him doing things to her made her ache deep inside her body.</p><p>He moved her backward step by step until the back of her legs hit the bed. He pushed her onto her back and followed. Her feet just touched the floor. He spread her legs wide and eased down onto her.</p><p>She hissed again and wriggled her hips.</p><p>\u201cSo anxious for me,\u201d he whispered against her neck. He licked her throat, and her vein throbbed.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d she whispered. She wanted him to strike.</p><p>Instead he rose up a little and began to push inside. She closed her eyes and breathed, savoring every inch of him as he pushed, drew back, pushed a little more, fitting himself carefully inside her.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ... but faster.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled again, very low. He kissed her eyelids. \u201cI\u2019d ask you to open your eyes and look at me, but I have something different in mind.\u201d</p><p>Of course then she had to open her eyes. She looked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen your voyeur\u2019s window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He just smiled. A certain thought occurred to her, and a flush flowed up her face. Yes, she was embarrassed.</p><p>He leaned close. \u201cYou want to do it,\u201d he whispered into her ear. Shivers chased over her neck and down her arms. \u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but it\u2019s so ... naughty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to get as close as you can and watch me push into you. I want you to see. Believe me, if I could do it, I would. I\u2019d love to watch this.\u201d</p><p>Parisa couldn\u2019t believe she was about to do this. Yes, she had voyeured Antony when he pleasured himself but somehow this felt different.</p><p>And yet ...</p><p>She opened the window. The pain hit hard, but this time she pushed back at it until it seemed to fall out of her head. Then she raised her shields hard. She took a deep breath, but the pain didn\u2019t return.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked. \u201cI forgot about the headaches.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI think it was a shield problem. I\u2019m okay now.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cGood.\u201d Then he pushed into her in a long silken glide. She was tight but very wet and she gasped before she could say, \u201cYou sure you want me to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you describe it to me.\u201d</p><p>At that, she brought the window in close to Antony from behind. What a glorious sight, better than a mirror. Watching his buttocks flex over her at the same time she could feel what he was doing inside her doubled the sensation.</p><p>She clenched.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I wanted,\u201d he whispered against her cheek. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Your backside rippling over me as you push inside.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cGet in closer. Really close.\u201d He pulled out of her almost to her entrance, then hovered.</p><p>She panned the window around his buttocks to the side\u2014and there it was. His cock, long, thick, and hard. \u201cI can see the length of you. Antony, so beautiful.\u201d Her mouth was dry. Oh, yeah, she was panting. He started to push inside and she gave a cry.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so close and all I\u2019ve done is look at you, but oh, God ... so big, so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, pushing harder and faster. She kept the window positioned at his hips; he maintained just enough distance that she could watch his cock go in and come out, over and over.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a piston, Antony.\u201d She couldn\u2019t really breathe very well. He was big and he was hitting her cervix and suddenly she was just full of pleasure and screaming. The window closed but a rush of ecstasy drove through her, tightening and releasing, drawing him out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He bowed backward and gave a shout, then another.</p><p>He spilled his seed but didn\u2019t slow. Another orgasm caught her hard, really hard. Pleasure spiraled up through her body then down, streaking up her labia and clitoris. She rocked against him and still he kept pumping into her.</p><p>She drew back and looked at him. His eyes were rolled back in his head. \u201cMore,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOh, God there\u2019s more.\u201d He cried out and as he ejaculated again, she was swept up into the stratosphere, pleasure like lightning moving over her entire body while she clenched and tightened around his driving cock.</p> <p>Finally, her body quieted, and Antony was able to slow his movements. He lowered himself onto her, released a sigh, and relaxed. She surrounded his shoulders with her arms.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t felt this way in a long, long time,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>His body stiffened, then he forced himself to relax. \u201cNot since my wife. I haven\u2019t allowed this kind of closeness since my wife.\u201d</p><p>She held him tighter. \u201cAnd for me, not since my fianc\u00e9. He kind of broke my heart. We were planning our wedding, I\u2019d just bought the invitations, and he announced he couldn\u2019t marry me. He thought I was inaccessible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d offer to break his neck but I\u2019m too glad you\u2019re not with him anymore.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. Funny, that was the first time she\u2019d ever thought of Jason without hurting. She sighed and slid her arms around him even harder. Only her fingertips met in the middle. All his powerful warrior muscles got in the way. Ah, too bad.</p><p>She giggled.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou know what the bad thing is?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He lifted to look at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat your bedroom is so far away. I\u2019d love to curl up next to you right now and take a nap.\u201d</p><p>But a slow smile spread over his face. The vibration began.</p><p>The next minute she was lying in exactly the same position, with him still inside her, but stretched out on his bed. She\u2019d totally forgotten he could do that.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she cried. \u201cI told you to give a girl a warning.\u201d</p><p>But he only laughed and nuzzled her neck. \u201cCouldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cWhat a world,\u201d she said. \u201cRight this moment, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>No greater gifts exists on Second Earth,</p> <p>Then that which comes from the vein.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Greaves made several attempts to break back through the shield that surrounded his voyeur-link with Parisa. He sat in his Geneva office contemplating the most recent occurrence.</p><p>He\u2019d caught a strange glimpse of naked bodies, a breast, a very large breast, the scars on Warrior Medichi\u2019s back; then he\u2019d felt Parisa\u2019s mind push at him, hard. He hadn\u2019t been prepared, otherwise he could have prevented it, but she actually pushed him out of her head and slammed impenetrable shields in place.</p><p>The level of her power had surprised him. He questioned his wisdom in letting her escape from the Burma house.</p><p>He had only himself to blame. At the time, he\u2019d thought Julianna\u2019s suggestion rather brilliant but now, given that the newly created ascender had more power than ever, he realized his error.</p><p>But this most recent event which involved the loss of twenty-four death vampires to the attack by the Warriors of the Blood on the Toulouse farmhouse, really elevated his blood pressure. On the other hand, because he\u2019d had the foresight to order Rith to import a proper amount of death vampires, Rith been able to fold all the blood donors out of Toulouse and secure them in a new facility. In that sense, the smooth running of his emerging empire was kept firmly in place.</p><p>There was that silver lining again.</p><p>As for what he meant to do next, well, those decisions were presently dancing in the air. Rith\u2019s most recent, Seer-based emails had changed his view of the future, especially where the mortal-with-wings was concerned.</p><p>The emails had been both encouraging and alarming. The most powerful Seers Fortresses had predicted a major decisive battle, which he would win. On the surface, this sounded like good news, but Greaves was not a neophyte in any sense of the word. He might have been exhilarated by the prophecy, a millennium ago. But he had lived too long as a vampire not to know how changeable the future really was. His only real difficulty right now was determining exactly what he should do with this information.</p><p>But it was the other set of emails that concerned him most, that had the power to send little shivers down his neck and spine.</p><p>Though Greaves knew, by Rith\u2019s account, that Parisa had royle wings, he hadn\u2019t given the circumstance much thought or even interest. The supposed magical nature of royle wings had, over the millennia, slid into the category of vampire mythology, nothing more.</p><p>Legend held that such wings had the power to create peace. According to Philippe Reynard\u2019s definitive work on the history of ascension, the actual translation for royle from the ancient language was \u201cbenevolent wind.\u201d Greaves could recall that as a little boy, when he\u2019d been in the care of his mother, she\u2019d told him stories about the first vampire, Luchianne, her royle wings, and how she had the power to create a vast wind that could calm an entire army\u2019s fighting rage.</p><p>It was absurd, of course. Yet because he\u2019d heard the story at his mother\u2019s knee, somehow the fable had intense meaning for him. He was a man more of instincts than analysis, and in this situation, he felt the critical nature of all the emails that had begun flowing his direction concerning the emergence of Parisa\u2019s royle wings, more than he had about a possible forthcoming decisive battle.</p><p>So, the larger question for him had become what to do about Parisa Lovejoy. The smaller question\u2014should he orchestrate a battle\u2014he had already turned over to his generals in his Estrella Complex in Metro Phoenix Two. They had been ecstatic to learn he actually wanted two full divisions assembled in northern Arizona, as surreptitiously as possible\u2014yes, that had been a little joke. Setting up supply lines alone for thirty thousand soldiers would be a work of monumental proportion.</p><p>Even now, General Leto was importing death vampires from all over the globe, provided by his allied High Administrators. He did take a moment to smile, even to fantasize about such a battle. The truth was simple: He could take Endelle\u2019s forces in a heartbeat if it came down to a numbers game. And he was a smart enough vampire to work the numbers.</p><p>But there was that other pesky, nagging truth that often wars weren\u2019t won by the numbers. So many other factors could alter an obvious outcome. One had only to follow both amateur and professional Mortal Earth sports to know this was true, that occasionally the team with all the right numbers could lose a championship to a phenomenon known as \u2018heart.\u2019 Absurd but true.</p><p>So he was preparing, and in his preparations he was cautious. What else would a vampire over two thousand years old be?</p><p>Rith arrived with the usual empty medical blood bag, plastic tubing, and sterile needle. Time to feed the blood donors.</p><p>He rose from his chair and removed his suit coat. He pinched the shoulders and brought the sleeves together to effect a careful fold. He paid a fortune for his suits, tailored as they were by Hugo Boss on Mortal Earth. He had fittings four times a year.</p><p>He removed the French cuff link from the right sleeve of his silk shirt, an amethyst color this time in honor of his continued pursuit of the mortal-with-wings. Though she was now ascended, for him Parisa Lovejoy would always be the mortal-with-wings. She had been an anomaly as great as either Alison Wells or Havily Morgan.</p><p>Three powerful women had arrived to serve as brehs for the Warriors of the Blood.</p><p>He sighed as he set the amethyst link on his desk.</p><p>He moved to the large plate-glass window of the building he owned, a stone structure that resembled work from the mid-1800s but of course with electricity and running water. The basement, blasted out of the earth, held his famous Round Table, the seat of his Coming Order. Greaves did value modern times, enormously, but there were occasions when his soul longed for the earlier days of stone and earth, of fire, and of hundreds of servants to carry out the menial tasks of slaughtering and preparing food, and scrubbing laundry on the banks of a river.</p><p>Now he had to hire his help and pay decent wages.</p><p>As he began rolling up his right sleeve, he looked out over Geneva Two. Its population was a mere hundred thousand, a fraction the size of Mortal Earth\u2019s city. He had chosen his site well, at almost the tip of the Petite Lac, that part of Lake Geneva that seemed almost like a lake unto itself. The view from his penthouse was really exquisite, especially at night with the black expanse of the water surrounded on both sides by the twinkle of modern lights.</p><p>With his right sleeve rolled up past his elbow, he turned and made his way to the black leather sofa. Rith already had the necessary equipment set up.</p><p>He sat down, and Rith used the tourniquet to bring his vein forward. With the precision of decades, Rith drove in the needle and the blood started to flow. He donated once a week; his blood formed the basis of the cocktail that brought his female donors back from oblivion and had them ready to serve in another month\u2019s time.</p><p>He glanced at Rith, at the broad forehead and relatively unattractive features. Rith didn\u2019t partake of dying blood, though many believed he did. He could have used a little beautification. But the man was staunchly opposed.</p><p>He watched the bag fill. \u201cHave you ever tasted my blood?\u201d</p><p>Rith glanced at him, giving him his infamous blank expression. \u201cNo, master. Never.\u201d</p><p>Darian flared his nostrils. He breathed in the perfume of the man\u2019s skin. Most of the time he could smell a lie, but not today. Or at least not on Rith.</p><p>\u201cHave you read the latest emails about the Mumbai and Bogot\u00e1 predictions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. You flagged them.\u201d</p><p>Rith\u2019s fingers actually trembled. As well they should.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we to do?\u201d</p><p>Rith pulled the needle out and pressed a square of gauze against the wound. He taped the gauze in place. \u201cI have begun the process of mobilizing my army. As for the mortal-with-wings, I wish to know your opinion. What do you think we should do about her?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think we should find her and kill her, of course. She is too dangerous for the Coming Order.\u201d</p><p>Darian smiled then chuckled. \u201cI adore how you speak of killing her the same way you would speak about creating a floral arrangement. We should put the roses in first, then the lilies.\u201d He chuckled again. Rith eased him. He always had. In some ways, Rith was an extension of his own careful, ordered, sociopathic mind.</p><p>\u201cShe is dangerous, master. Very dangerous. Only an hour ago, another report came, from Johannesburg this time, as they used to when Alison was in her ascension process, that Parisa will change the course of the war.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlison was supposed to have that kind of effect, but she has accomplished nothing of significance. If anything, Havily Morgan has wrought more damage since she brought Warrior Marcus back from Mortal Earth to serve as High Administrator of Desert Southwest Two.\u201d A faint shudder went through him. Marcus had indeed stalled Greaves\u2019s efforts to turn High Administrators. \u201cI give you permission to do what I see in your heart you wish to do anyway.\u201d He watched Rith carefully. \u201cGood God, Rith, are you actually smiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, master.\u201d Rith placed the blood in a special pack then settled it in a cradle within an Igloo container. He had a runner outside ready to transport the blood to a lab that created the cocktail for the various blood donor facilities. It pleased Greaves to think that a drop or two of his blood ensured that his donors remained alive and healthy so that they could keep producing.</p><p>In that way, he was a true sustainer of life.</p><p>Which made him chuckle again.</p><p>With all his equipment packed up, Rith turned and headed to the door. Greaves rolled his shirtsleeve down and rose to his feet. \u201cIt is a lovely thing to see you so happy, Rith.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, master.\u201d</p><p>Rith actually bowed. Greaves was in favor of the gesture, but it was an antiquated European cultural tradition that was considered pass\u00e9.</p><p>With a dismissive wave of his hand, he bid his servant good-bye.</p><p>Parisa dreamed of peaches rolling around in her mind.</p><p>They moved around, crashing into one another and pummeling the inside of her head. All that movement hurt. Finally she jerked awake and put her hand to her forehead.</p><p>Oh, thank God she had only dreamed the pain.</p> <p>She glanced at the clock. She had been checking her voyeur window every half hour. She must be on Fiona time since she\u2019d only drifted off for about fifteen minutes.</p><p>Once more, she opened her voyeur\u2019s window. Still daylight. She shut it down fast. Good, still no headache.</p><p>Antony was right next to her, his warm body pressed close to her side, his back to her. She shifted to look at all the silvery scars and his long warrior hair. She wanted to touch him but didn\u2019t want to wake him. He\u2019d been through so much in the past three months.</p><p>She stared up at the ceiling, at the coffer beams and the words in Italian burned into the wood. Antony had said it was a poem his wife had written. She hoped one day he would share the translation with her.</p><p>Her thoughts turned back to her dream. So what had she been dreaming?</p><p>Oh, yeah. Peaches. How weird to think of a sweet round fuzzy fruit banging around in her head and causing such pain.</p><p>She flung an arm over her head and took a few deep breaths, grateful the dream hadn\u2019t been real.</p><p>How comfortable this was, feeling the movement of Antony\u2019s regular deep breaths rising and falling against her side.</p> <p>She was naked.</p><p>He was as well.</p><p>He\u2019d made love to her\u2014she smiled\u2014in the turret room so that he could create just the right angle. He\u2019d enabled her to see that beautiful part of him thrusting between her legs and disappearing. Tears welled up in her eyes just thinking about it. She hadn\u2019t taken a lover since her fianc\u00e9; she didn\u2019t believe in promiscuity. She never had. Yet here she was, bedding a man she hardly knew.</p><p>She released a sigh. What was she doing, anyway? What was she thinking to have become so instantly involved with Antony?</p><p>At the very least, she should give herself time and space to make sense of this new world, to discover where she fit within Endelle\u2019s administration. She should get her own apartment\u2014only how was she supposed to be safe when it was clear Rith was still after her?</p><p>Endelle had continued to sustain the dome of mist over the villa, a constant protection for her. And when crews came to work in the vineyard or the olive grove or anywhere else on the property, the plan was that she would either stay at Endelle\u2019s administrative headquarters or have Carla or Jeannie fold her directly to the palace. Whatever.</p><p>Her thoughts shifted to Fiona, as they often did. Because she\u2019d seen the woman several times now, both in person and through her voyeur window, she felt a connection to her and certainly a powerful drive to release her from the terrible slavery that held her prisoner. She recalled touching her for the first time, holding her arms and feeling the peculiar vibration flow between them.</p><p>Though her own captivity had been relatively gentle, she knew what it was not to be free, to be held to a strict schedule, to never be allowed to leave a narrow, tightly governed space.</p><p>Peaches.</p><p>Peaches.</p><p>Greaves was sometimes called the little peach.</p><p>She sat up suddenly, which caused Antony to jerk awake. He leaped from bed and before she knew it, he had his sword in hand, his very nude body hunched in an aggressive position. He turned slowly in a circle examining every corner of the room. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he cried.</p><p>She glanced at him and covered her mouth. She was trying not to laugh. \u201cI\u2019m sooo sorry, Antony. I had a nightmare.\u201d That was partially the truth.</p><p>His sword vanished first, then he slumped forward onto the bed and groaned. \u201cThank God.\u201d He looked up at her, his eyes bloodshot, weary. \u201cThank God.\u201d He shifted to stretch himself out on the bed next to her, propping himself up on his forearms. \u201cAre you all right? What kind of bad dream?\u201d</p><p>She settled down beside him, her head on her pillow. She dragged the sheet up over her breasts and under her arms. She put her hand on his bicep, one of her favorite places, her thumb stroking back and forth. \u201cI think I know what happened, why I had headaches during the recent voyeurs, even though I\u2019d never had them before.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreaves.\u201d</p><p>He looked back at her and scowled. \u201cWhat do you mean, Greaves?\u201d</p><p>Then the memory came forth, of being on the teak bench that last day, of Greaves coming to her and sitting down next to her, of doing battle against his mind, of his intention to break through her shields. She again shared all this with Antony. But only in this moment, maybe because of the peaches-like-bowling balls dream, did she remember what else he had done. \u201cHe kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did what?\u201d he barked.</p><p>\u201cHe kissed me. I\u2019m only now just remembering. The moment his lips touched mine, I thought of you and my shields just fell flat. Then I must have passed out because I woke up on the grass, on my face, without being able to remember anything. But, I\u2019m telling you, Greaves got through, he broke through my shields, and he\u2019s been in my mind. Antony, I think he\u2019s been causing the pain when I open my voyeur window. He\u2019s linked to me somehow. That\u2019s how he knew we were coming for the D and R slaves. That\u2019s why Rith met us in Toulouse with all those death vampires and all the slaves but Fiona gone. Greaves warned him.\u201d</p><p>Antony stared at her for a long hard moment, his eyes darkening in stages. His chin dipped low. His shoulders hunched.</p><p>She didn\u2019t at first understand what was happening to him.</p><p>A growl emerged, a sound that told her his ascended vampire nature was in the fore and his rational brain had taken a hike. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him. I\u2019ll fucking kill him.\u201d</p><p>She thumped him on the shoulder. \u201cAntony, stop! Don\u2019t go all Neanderthal on me. This is good news because now I know what\u2019s going on. We can use it to our advantage.\u201d</p><p>He looked away from her, rolled onto his back, then took several very deep breaths. \u201cIt\u2019s the breh-hedden. In all my ascended life I have not experienced anything like this. For a moment, the only thing I wanted was to find Greaves and tear him limb from limb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got that.\u201d</p><p>He released a deep sigh then shifted to meet her gaze. He put a hand on her shoulder and said, \u201cSo you think Greaves has some kind of link with you. A mind-link to your voyeur window.\u201d</p><p>When he said it like that, she suddenly felt cold, sick, clammy. The thought of such a monster having control of her turned her stomach. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe he does. Is there any way I can get rid of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe person establishing the link has to break it. At least, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s usually done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I just remembered. He saw us. When I voyeured, you know, us, in the turret room, he saw us.\u201d</p><p>At that Antony drew his hand into a fist. He muttered a string of obscenities, which seemed quite appropriate. \u201cYou think he saw the whole damn thing?\u201d He was shouting now.</p><p>Parisa thought it through. \u201cWait. Maybe not. When I first opened the window, the pain began and I pushed it away. Mentally. I remember thinking that I so didn\u2019t want to have pain right then, so I gave it a hard push and then I felt nothing. I felt like I normally did.\u201d</p><p>He met her gaze and nodded. \u201cYou may have pushed him out. Jesus, what power.\u201d</p><p>She leaned into him and bumped her forehead against his shoulder. \u201cOh, God, I hope so. I think so.\u201d She bumped her head a few more times, which seemed kind of silly but it comforted her. \u201cYou know, if my life gets any weirder, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his arm around her and pulled her up next to him, holding her close. \u201cGet some rest. Later maybe we can experiment. But if this is true, then it would explain why we had a greeting party in Toulouse.\u201d</p><p>She rolled into him and snuggled close. She slung a leg over his legs and an arm over his stomach.</p><p>\u201cHow did you figure out it was Greaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dreamed of peaches rolling around in my head, crashing into one another. Then I remembered that Greaves was sometimes called the little peach. On some level, I must have known, but it was only through my dream that the knowledge was able to break through to my conscious mind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sleepy. Not even a little. Her mind worked over the dream, over Greaves\u2019s mind-link. Because she couldn\u2019t sleep and because she was nestled against Antony, she opened her voyeur\u2019s window. Instead of focusing on Fiona this time, however, she chose a more innocuous object: the White Tank Mountains just beyond the villa. She panned her window back and forth. She wanted to see if and when the pain would come.</p> <p>After a few more seconds, there it was, a flash of pain, but smaller this time, thank you God.</p><p>She shifted her attention to the pain, but it retreated. She relaxed and watched the pain until it faded to nothing. She remained very still within her own mind. She needed to understand, she wanted to understand, exactly what was going on.</p><p>She took slow, even breaths and waited. She panned to the north side of the villa property, in the direction of Antony\u2019s olive grove. She began moving the window through the grove as though searching, but the whole time she kept her attention focused on the point where the pain had receded.</p><p>She moved to one end of the grove and back. She crossed a dirt lane and moved into the vineyard.</p><p>She waited.</p> <p>After what felt like five minutes, she felt a twinge within her mind\u2014then a distinct absence, much like what she\u2019d felt when she\u2019d pushed Greaves out of her mind in the turret room.</p><p>So she was right. Greaves was there. She also thought it was very telling that the level of pain the mind-link usually induced had diminished. If all her suppositions were correct, no doubt Greaves was working his end of the equation as well.</p><p>She repeated the process two more times. Each time, the experience was the same.</p><p>So it was all true. Greaves had formed a link with her. She knew that telepathic links could be forged between powerful ascenders\u2014Endelle had one with Thorne, her second-in-command. When she needed him, all she had to do was think about him and send a command. He could respond mind-to-mind.</p><p>This was similar. But was it telepathic, or was it related strictly to her voyeur\u2019s window?</p><p>Only one way to find out. She closed her eyes and, without opening her window, focused all her mental attention on Greaves. Are you there, Commander? she sent.</p> <p>She waited.</p><p>Nothing returned to her. Nothing. Not a flash of pain, not even a twinge.</p><p>She made the attempt several times.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>If all her musings were correct, then Greaves had apparently formed a link with her voyeurism but not with her telepathy.</p><p>A flush started at her forehead and climbed down her face, her neck, her chest, and over her arms. She felt hot and cold at the same time. Her palms were clammy.</p><p>Antony\u2019s breathing was now deep and even. The warrior needed a nap.</p><p>Slowly, she pulled away from him. She slid off the bed and padded her way to the bathroom. The toilet had its own little room. She grabbed a towel, went inside, and closed the door. She was completely naked so she wrapped the oversized black bath towel around her body and sat down on the lid.</p> <p>She leaned over and, with her elbows on her thighs, she put her head in her hands. Sweat now dripped down her neck and from beneath her breasts.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe very well so she worked at that for a long time until she knew she wouldn\u2019t hyperventilate. She wasn\u2019t sure exactly what was wrong with her but of all the things she had experienced in the past three-plus months, the thought that Greaves had a link to her made her nauseous. She felt controlled and put in yet another box. She hated these boxes. She hated that she was living in Antony\u2019s villa again, with another dome of mist over the property, she hated that she\u2019d spent the last few months in Rith\u2019s residence living like some kind of mystical bird that had to be coddled and caged, and she really hated that anyone had access to her mind like this.</p><p>But what distressed her most of all was that she was sharing Antony\u2019s bed as though they\u2019d been lovers for years. Where was her choice in any of this? She hadn\u2019t exactly chosen Antony. He\u2019d simply shown up in her voyeur\u2019s window about the same time she\u2019d mounted her wings for the first time.</p><p>Her previous life, the one she\u2019d lived as a librarian on Mortal Earth, had been a life of her choosing. No one had forced it on her. No one had come along insisting that she shelve books to assist the war effort. No, she\u2019d become a librarian by choice.</p><p>Now she was locked into some kind of \u00fcbersexual relationship with Antony and as pleasurable as it was, what was it really? Well, if she\u2019d understood everything that had been going on since she\u2019d first been brought to the villa, her entire relationship with Antony was because of the breh-hedden, something she didn\u2019t understand, but which had also locked her down and helped force her into this box.</p><p>Right now, she felt no different, well maybe a little different, than when she\u2019d lived in Rith\u2019s house in Burma, like a jewel that was owned by someone else and needed constant guarding and polishing and tending.</p><p>Her thoughts weren\u2019t entirely fair, maybe not as rational as she wanted them to be, but something about Greaves having possession of her mind had sunk her, put cement in her spirit and taken her to the bottom of the lake. Maybe she needed to cry. She worked at it, and squeezed out a couple of tears but she just wasn\u2019t in the mood to give vent to her feelings through her tear ducts.</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t what she needed.</p><p>She needed the link broken, but how? Maybe Endelle could do it. Everyone kept mentioning how much power she had.</p><p>Then again, Endelle certainly couldn\u2019t change the fact that she was sequestered in this villa, unable to even walk about on the grounds without Antony glued to her side.</p><p>And now she had a voyeur-link with a monster.</p><p>When she left the bathroom, she\u2019d come to at least one decision. She intended to move into one of the guest rooms. Not the original one she\u2019d used\u2014it was across from Marcus and Havily\u2019s room\u2014but one closer to Antony.</p><p>With the towel still wrapped around her, she padded through the bathroom. She was surprised to see Antony sitting up in bed, his arms folded across his bare chest, his long hair hanging around his shoulders. He was looking in the direction of the den, through to the windows that opened onto the front lawn. She knew he could hear her, but he didn\u2019t turn in her direction. He just stared across the room.</p><p>She rounded the bed and stood a few feet away facing him. His gaze was still fixed in the same direction. She waited.</p><p>\u201cYou were in the bathroom awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking. And I thought you were asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. I woke up to an empty bed and I panicked. Then I realized you were probably in the bathroom. I got up and checked. I could hear you breathe and sigh. Your thoughts were very loud, I just couldn\u2019t read them.\u201d</p><p>He sort of smiled, a half smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot to digest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have I.\u201d His frown deepened. \u201cI think we should complete the breh-hedden.\u201d</p><p>Somehow it was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. She even moved back a full step. \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. Okay, so she\u2019d almost shouted the question.</p><p>Maybe it was the tone of her voice, which she admitted did sound incredulous, even to her, but his brows shot up and his arms unhinged but they didn\u2019t come apart all the way. He looked wound up, braced for anything, tight.</p><p>He heaved a sigh. \u201cBecause if we complete the breh-hedden, which involves moving into each other\u2019s minds at certain times, then I\u2019m guessing that no one can form this kind of voyeur-link with you ever again. Certainly not without my knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to complete the breh-hedden so you can have charge of my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. He pushed a hand through his hair on the left side until it hung away from his face. \u201cNot have charge, never that. But maybe I could protect you better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of maybes.\u201d She sat down on the edge of the bed, the very edge, as in she took up three inches of mattress at the most.</p><p>Her head wagged back and forth and her gaze fell to the dark planked floor. The villa was beautiful and the wood gleamed, another lovely prison. \u201cI don\u2019t want to complete the breh-hedden, and I don\u2019t want you to move into my head ... ever.\u201d She turned to him. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure that I want you, really want you. I feel trapped, Antony. This ... this thing grabbed hold of both of us and chained us. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here. Then Madame Endelle assigned you as my Guardian. Well the guard part of that word feels about right.\u201d</p><p>He looked appalled, his eyes wide, his brows raised, his lips parted. His cheeks had a drawn look, liked he\u2019d sucked in the shock of her words and couldn\u2019t let it back out.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI guess you have been thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve just realized how inaccessible you are.\u201d</p><p>She stood up and stared at him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that.\u201d Thoughts of Jason and the way he\u2019d broken up with her shot through her mind. He\u2019d used that word to describe her as well, but this wasn\u2019t fair at all.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it? At least be honest with yourself about what it is you\u2019re doing right now, about all the things you just said to me. You just said, I\u2019m not even sure I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I meant this breh thing has charge of us both right now. Maybe you don\u2019t even want me.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, a strange slow movement. \u201cMaybe the fuck I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She was breathing hard, and panic began to rise. What was she doing? Was she breaking up with him? Had she been cruel? By the look on his face the answer had to be yes.</p><p>She felt an urge to apologize, but when she opened her mouth what came out was, \u201cI want to move into one of the guest rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Take any one you want. It doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d</p><p>She felt the bitterness in each word. Fine. This was for the best. She needed space. She\u2019d been needing space for three long months.</p><p>She gathered up some of her clothes and left the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How fucking strange.</p><p>Medichi stared at the closed door, the carved wood panels that comprised a thick private partition between his room and the rest of the villa.</p><p>His arms hung loose at his sides now, like they had nowhere of importance to be. Less than an hour ago, one of his arms had held his woman tight, now he had no woman, just this pit in his chest that had taken the place of his lungs.</p> <p>Parisa wasn\u2019t completely off base. She had posed at least one rational question. How could either of them know what was real or what was just some bullshit preternatural creation of the breh-hedden?</p><p>There was just one problem.</p><p>He pulled her pillow up to his nose and smelled. Tangerine. The whole time she\u2019d been talking and arguing and looking edible with just a black towel around her luscious body, the whole time she\u2019d been yelling, he\u2019d been hard as a rock and ready for her. Goddamn breh-hedden.</p><p>On the other hand, he took a deep breath and admitted the other truth, the one that lurked in the back of his head: He was just a little bit relieved that she wasn\u2019t here, wasn\u2019t beside him, wasn\u2019t reminding him of his new duty as a Guardian of Ascension, as her breh.</p><p>Fuck. Him. Because he almost smiled.</p> <p>Relief flowed through him like a dam had just given way.</p><p>He was free.</p><p>Shit. He was free and he loved it, bastard that he was. He shouldn\u2019t be feeling this way. He cared about Parisa. He really did. Or maybe it was just that he felt he should care about her.</p><p>But time peeled away in a great rush and as had happened a thousand times since his ascension so many centuries ago, the image of his wife in his arms, bleeding her life away, beat the shit out of him.</p><p>He understood then what haunted him about Parisa, about how protective he felt toward her, about how the breh-hedden had fucked him over. He\u2019d lived a relatively secure life in his Italian world. His family had owned a small country house for over a century and had worked their vineyards and olive groves for multiple centuries before that.</p><p>So when the enemy came, he\u2019d been unprepared. He wasn\u2019t responsible in the sense that he had failed to do a soldier\u2019s duty. He\u2019d failed because he was a man, not a soldier, and overtaken by superior numbers and weaponry.</p> <p>But now he was a warrior, seasoned and powerful, and he\u2019d already lost Parisa once while under his protection.</p><p>She had been returned to him and in the overwhelming aftermath, the pure heady relief of having her under his roof once more, he\u2019d been unable to stay away from her. He\u2019d needed her in his bed, needed to bury himself inside her, to feel that she was truly alive and safe in his care.</p><p>In his care.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be in his care.</p><p>She wanted to be as free of the breh-hedden as he did. She wanted her freedom. He wanted to be free of the guilt of keeping her safe when he knew damn well that was an impossible task. He\u2019d already failed once. He would again.</p><p>So ... shit.</p><p>He could train her, though. He could continue to layer skill upon self-defense skill. He could help her with flying, with the dagger and sword. He could teach her more about her shields and how to withstand Rith\u2019s attempts to enthrall her.</p><p>Yes, he could do that.</p> <p>But would it be enough?</p><p>This was a world at war.</p><p>Nothing would ever be enough until Greaves was dead and buried and his emerging empire crushed.</p><p>But how the hell would that ever happen?</p><p>The first path seduces by promise,</p><p>The second appeals to pride,</p><p>But the worthy path demands surrender.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>When Parisa left Antony\u2019s bedroom, she made her way to her original guest room because it was familiar, most of her clothes were still there, and she was really upset.</p><p>She got dressed in jeans and a cherry-red silk tank top as her mind spun in circle after circle trying to make sense of the stupid breh-hedden, and the hunky man naked in bed at the end of the villa, and how her body kept crying out for him.</p><p>She was reeling and she knew it. She also knew something else. If she didn\u2019t let this out, she\u2019d go crazy. But who could she talk to? Right now, it couldn\u2019t be Antony. The truth was, the whole time he\u2019d been sitting up in bed, he\u2019d shed his sage like a spice grinder; leaving his room had been a supreme act of will.</p><p>Her thoughts turned to Havily. Yes, Havily.</p><p>She left the guest room and headed to the leather-and-book haven to make her phone call.</p><p>Havily, bless her, said she\u2019d be at the villa in five minutes and she\u2019d bring coffee.</p><p>While Parisa waited, she opened her voyeur window, thought of Fiona, and made a swift check of the room. The windows were still really light. She closed the window and as before with just a sneak-peek, no pain. Well, at least that was something.</p><p>She made her way to the foyer, barefoot, and waited. A few minutes later, there she was, the red-headed beauty, and Parisa\u2019s first ascended girlfriend.</p><p>The relief she felt was surprising but if anyone might know what she was going through, it was Havily. Three months ago, Havily had walked through her own private breh-hedden heaven-and-hell combo.</p><p>With a mug of coffee in hand, Havily suggested a walk through the formal garden. It was still hot for September, but Parisa didn\u2019t care. It was just great to be with a friend, to be outdoors, to be chatting about the weather, about the flowers, about nothing important.</p><p>Parisa walked on as many of the grassy portions of the garden as she could find. Sometimes she had to step onto gravel, but mostly she found lawn to cross.</p><p>Havily asked to hear her version of what happened at the Toulouse farmhouse. Parisa told her from beginning to end.</p><p>\u201cTo have come so close to rescuing Fiona, to have seen her, and to have watched Rith drag her away, you must be really upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Jean-Pierre almost had him but Rith blocked the trace.\u201d</p><p>Havily whistled. \u201cThat is a lot of power. As far as I know, none of the Warriors of the Blood can block a trace.\u201d She was quiet for a moment then asked, \u201cHow did Jean-Pierre take it? I mean none of the warriors likes to fail ... at anything.\u201d</p><p>Parisa glanced at her, uncertain what she should say. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I should tell you, but I have a feeling Marcus will know by the end of the day anyway.\u201d</p><p>Havily stopped her with a gentle hand pressed to the inside of her elbow. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Parisa shook her head. \u201cIt was the breh-hedden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Havily cried. \u201cYou mean, Jean-Pierre?\u201d</p><p>Parisa nodded. She let her friend figure the rest out.</p><p>Havily gasped. \u201cFiona? The blood slave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Do you remember when I was first voyeuring Fiona in the library? You were there and you were standing next to Jean-Pierre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Oh, now I remember. He asked if someone was baking something.\u201d</p><p>Parisa nodded. \u201cHe said he smelled croissants.\u201d</p><p>Havily bit her lip. \u201cCroissants?\u201d She chuckled. \u201cOh, I know it isn\u2019t funny. The breh-hedden has its truly horrible moments, but these scents are ridiculous and so...\u201d She waved her hand in the air.</p><p>Erotic. That\u2019s what Parisa thought but she didn\u2019t want to say it aloud. She knew by the faint flush on Havily\u2019s usually creamy cheeks that her thoughts had taken a similar turn. Parisa knew that Marcus, for Havily, smelled of fennel, which Parisa couldn\u2019t imagine being in the least seductive. But then until she\u2019d caught Medichi\u2019s sage scent, never would she have thought to experience such terrible need from a spice reminiscent of poultry and Thanksgiving, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Havily murmured. \u201cSo, the breh-hedden strikes again. Do you realize that makes four warriors? Four!\u201d</p><p>Parisa shook her head. She let Havily move into the next garden room beneath an arch bearing a vine covered with lavender flowers that were a unique shape, sort of curled in on themselves.</p><p>The next room bore white flowers on varying shrubs and smaller plants: roses, white lantana, even star jasmine that climbed a half dozen trellises at evenly spaced intervals.</p><p>\u201cJean-Pierre must be going mad by now,\u201d Havily whispered, as though speaking aloud would somehow wound the absent warrior.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that. I\u2019ve had my own troubles this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. I recognize that tone of voice. So, what happened, girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, what happened?\u201d Parisa knew her voice sounded strange, even shrill. She had never been good at lying.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Talk to me. It doesn\u2019t take advanced preternatural power to get a phone call from you and not know something was going on. Besides, you kind of have break-up written all over you, and I so get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>Havily laughed. \u201cWhat did you think? That the breh-hedden hit me and I opened my arms wide and that was it? I fought it tooth-and-nail for a good long while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I hurt Antony.\u201d</p><p>Havily smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why are you smiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not what you think. I just love that you call him Antony. No one does, you know, except me. Alison has started doing it as well, but that\u2019s it. Endelle calls him \u2018asshole\u2019 like she does all the warriors. Otherwise, he\u2019s been Medichi, I think since the day he ascended. Of course, I don\u2019t know for sure. I\u2019ve only been here a century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. A century. You\u2019ve seen a lot, then.\u201d She took another sip. Coffee always cooled down too quickly. She preferred it so searing hot that she had to sip to keep from burning her tongue.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to guilt you by saying this, but I have loved seeing Antony with you. Marcus said he\u2019s never even had a girlfriend in all this time, all these centuries.\u201d</p><p>At that, Parisa stopped. \u201cWhat do you mean? As in never?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in never. As in, he\u2019s been shut down since he ascended. Oh, he gets laid plenty. All the Warriors of the Blood do. That\u2019s what that wretched club is for, the one in south Phoenix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Blood and Bite.\u201d</p><p>Havily shuddered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Parisa didn\u2019t look at her. She didn\u2019t want to admit that she\u2019d voyeured the club lots and lots of times, and spied on Antony when he made love to other women. She felt her cheeks heat up. She wasn\u2019t exactly proud of this part of her, that she was by nature something of a voyeur. Although, to be fair, she never voyeured the other warriors, just Antony.</p><p>\u201cI need to ask you something,\u201d Parisa said.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf the breh-hedden didn\u2019t exist, do you think you\u2019d still be drawn to Marcus, still be in love with him, or have you ever thought this could just be one enormous lie?\u201d</p><p>Havily put both hands around her mug and sipped. Her gaze flitted around then finally landed on Parisa. \u201cYou\u2019re very analytical, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think I am.\u201d</p><p>Havily lifted her brows. \u201cTruth? I\u2019ve asked myself the same question many times, but in the end I went with my instincts. I started out loathing Marcus because he had deserted the Warriors of the Blood two centuries ago, but the more I was with him, the more I understood the whys of what he had done and I truly came to respect and value the honorable man I know him to be. I don\u2019t think the breh-hedden can overcome things like poor character, cowardice, embedded personality traits we can\u2019t respect.</p><p>\u201cYour difficulty may lie elsewhere because if I\u2019ve understood your voyeur gifts as you\u2019ve explained them to me, you\u2019ve known Antony for well over a year now. And as you probably already know, he\u2019s a fine man, a good man, and he has a great heart.\u201d</p> <p>Parisa had to look away from the sincerity in Havily\u2019s eyes. She took refuge in bringing her mug back up to her lips. Oh, her friend was way too right about that. Antony was a good man.</p><p>\u201cIn fact,\u201d Havily continued, warming to her theme, \u201cI wonder if something else is bothering you, something that has nothing at all to do with Antony.\u201d</p><p>Yes, her friend was way too perceptive. She opened her mouth to speak, even to argue but one word slid through her mind and created way too much pain. Inaccessible.</p><p>She squirmed. She even tossed the remaining inch of her now cool coffee into a bed of ferns and trailing white lantana.</p><p>Inaccessible.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all too much,\u201d she said. The explanation sounded weak, but it was all she had.</p> <p>\u201cI know I\u2019m going to sound just like Alison and all her psycho-speak, but here goes\u2014you have every right to these feelings. Look at what you\u2019ve been through. Hopefully, Antony will give you the time you need to sort everything out. The breh-hedden isn\u2019t exactly fair. It\u2019s like this massive hand at your back pushing you into things you\u2019re sure you should stay well out of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you suggest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy the sex and let life happen.\u201d</p><p>Parisa laughed. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>Havily shrugged. \u201cWell you have to admit it\u2019s kind of amazing, isn\u2019t it? I mean, these warriors are, well, big, and if you recall I was there when Medichi dropped his towel. He reminded me of Marcus. Oh, I sound just like Endelle and now I\u2019ve made you blush.\u201d She laughed again.</p><p>When Parisa was quiet, Havily nudged her with her elbow. \u201cSo how is it with him?\u201d</p> <p>Parisa drew in a breath. \u201cAmazing. The connection\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s instantaneous. Have you been in his mind yet?\u201d She sounded terribly eager.</p><p>Parisa met her gaze. She didn\u2019t want to tell her that that was the last place she wanted to be\u2014and she certainly didn\u2019t want Antony in her own head\u2014but the look that overcame Havily\u2019s face was something medicine should study. She looked in turns euphoric and hungry.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t been in Antony\u2019s mind. I\u2019m not sure I think it\u2019s a good idea. And if it\u2019s all right with you, I need to change the subject.\u201d</p><p>Havily sighed. \u201cWell, believe me, I do understand what you\u2019re going through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming, Hav. This really helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ve missed you, you know.\u201d</p><p>Parisa nodded. This was such a strange sensation. Havily really was her friend, had been her friend from the beginning. She\u2019d never really had friends on Mortal Earth. She enjoyed the women she worked with but friendship was something she\u2019d known so little of and really didn\u2019t quite know how to embrace.</p><p>Havily reached into the pocket of her cream-colored tailored slacks. She withdrew her phone and glanced at the screen. \u201cOh, Lord, it\u2019s Endelle. I have to get back. I kind of snuck out. She probably just figured out I was missing. I\u2019m on a very short leash these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know it\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to fire you or anything.\u201d</p><p>At that, Havily burst out laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s sooo true.\u201d She chuckled a couple of times, then said, \u201cWell, I\u2019d better be going. Please, call me anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I will.\u201d And she meant it.</p><p>Havily lifted a hand in the air and vanished.</p><p>Parisa stared at the empty space. She was moving in the direction of the house when the air shimmered. She smiled. What had Havily forgotten to tell her? Something more about what it was to make love to a warrior?</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Havily.</p><p>A second more and Rith smiled at her, that easy blank smile of his that sent shards of fear slicing through her chest. She couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cRith,\u201d she murmured. Her heart banged out a few beats and threatened to give up completely.</p><p>He moved toward her, slow steps, his arms outstretched, always outstretched. She felt that lazy sensation in her mind, like sluggish pond water. She blinked. She felt so sleepy.</p><p>No. No. No!</p><p>She closed her eyes, set an image in her mind, a simple location, a very familiar place, and thought the thought. She felt the vibration.</p><p>Fear held her immobile\u2014or maybe it was the sensation of flying through nether-space without someone else to serve as a tether, something she\u2019d only done once before. The journey ended with her bare feet on hard planked wood in Antony\u2019s bedroom, her mug still in her hand.</p><p>She glanced at Antony, who stood in front of the shattered mirror in the bathroom, his brush poised halfway down his hair as he stared back at her. He wore jeans and, once again, no shirt. She felt the air move near her and whirled around. Rith had followed her, traced after her.</p><p>She pointed at him and cried out, \u201cRith!\u201d</p><p>From her peripheral vision in the direction of the bathroom she saw a flash of steel then Antony moved with preternatural speed as he streaked by her and blurred into the bedroom. His sword cut through empty air in exactly the same space the monster had inhabited a split second before.</p><p>He turned back to her, his eyes wide.</p><p>It had all happened so fast. \u201cDid you see him?\u201d she cried. \u201cYou saw him, right? Rith? Right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his mouth agape. He looked at the floor as though trying to make sense of what had just happened. He shook his head. \u201cShit!\u201d He vanished but popped back into the bedroom. He did this a couple of times.</p><p>\u201cShit! This is what happened to Jean-Pierre in the Toulouse farmhouse. How the fuck does Rith block a trace like that?\u201d He was breathing hard. He looked confused.</p><p>He glanced at his sword and folded it away.</p><p>He moved toward her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think so.\u201d Then her mind reviewed the last half minute of her life, in particular that very bizarre moment of watching Rith move toward her then make a simple decision to escape. \u201cI folded again,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought the thought and I folded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the Italian garden, in the room with the lantana and ferns and the ficus trees. I was standing barefoot on the lawn. Havily had just folded back to Endelle\u2019s office.\u201d She looked down at her feet. \u201cSee. I\u2019m still barefoot.\u201d Which of course made no sense in terms of what she had just done, but somehow it made it more real for her.</p><p>He stood in front of her now, his lips parted, his eyes wide. He kept searching her face. She wasn\u2019t sure what he meant by it. \u201cYou dematerialized again,\u201d he stated.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cOf course you did. Shit, Parisa, we need to practice that, too.\u201d He reached out and touched her arm almost as though he didn\u2019t believe she was real. \u201cI love that you\u2019re so fucking powerful.\u201d</p><p>Parisa looked away from him. His hand slid down her arm. He caught her hand. She didn\u2019t let go. \u201cHey, you okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI got away from him but it feels like I just got lucky. That\u2019s all.\u201d She squeezed his hand. \u201cHe got through a dome of mist that Endelle, Endelle, created. He knew where I was and he waited until Havily was gone to try to abduct me again. He almost had me again.\u201d Her chest felt tight but there were no tears. No more tears. She needed to figure this out. \u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Antony said.</p><p>She drew her hand out of his and wrapped her arms around her stomach. \u201cHow am I supposed to stay secure or even stay alive if that bastard can get in here like this?\u201d She paced in a circle. He didn\u2019t try to stop her.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk this over with Endelle,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re in real trouble here. We need a plan of attack. For whatever reason, Rith is determined to get you back.\u201d</p><p>No shit.</p><p>Half an hour later, Parisa stood at the railing of Madame Endelle\u2019s favorite garden at White Lake, the place Her Supremeness had elected to take the meeting. The garden had been modeled on the Butchart Gardens on Vancouver Island, Mortal Earth, which Havily had suggested she visit many decades prior. It was hard to imagine such a difficult woman being inspired by anything, but the sunken garden had done just that.</p><p>\u201cI love this pit,\u201d Endelle said. \u201cHow deep do you think it is, five hundred feet? Has to be more than that.\u201d Both her hands gripped the iron railing that overlooked what amounted to paradise. Thousands of flowers, trees, and shrubs filled every bed. In the center, just like at Butchart, a small hill rose, a sort of earthen castle, a playground to climb, savor, and be enjoyed by children. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Parisa wondered if there would ever come a time when she would stand anywhere near Madame Endelle and not want to either cringe beneath her hard gaze, or scream at her. She was the hardest woman she had ever known. The warriors both feared and loved her. And she was tall, taller even than Antony when she wore her stilettos. And she always wore stilettos.</p><p>She sported cowhide today. Not fine leather, but actual hide in squares of brown and white, alternating like a checkerboard. The skirt was short and stiff, bristly. Parisa never knew what to make of the woman\u2019s fashion choices.</p><p>She resisted the urge to pet the hide.</p> <p>The strange piece was offset with a soft brown suede vest, cut deep so that four inches of cleavage showed. She had muscular arms. Had she not been Supreme High Administrator of Second Earth, Parisa thought Endelle could have served as a Warrior of the Blood.</p><p>Looking up at the formidable woman, Parisa asked, \u201cHave there ever been any female Warriors of the Blood?\u201d</p><p>Endelle\u2019s brows rose. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not, but what about Luchianne? She was the first vampire. Was she warrior status? I\u2019m told you knew her.\u201d</p><p>Endelle shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve never thought about it, I suppose. I knew the woman nine thousand years ago.\u201d She squinted her ancient lined eyes as she looked into the past. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t as tall as me but she bested Alison. Maybe six foot two. She came out of Sumer, or at least that region. Marcus came out of Sumer as well but he was born millennia after Luchianne\u2019s ascension to the Upper Dimension. So what the hell did you want, Parisa? I take it you didn\u2019t demand an audience just to discuss ascension history?\u201d Endelle always sounded, even in conversation, just this side of angry.</p> <p>Parisa told her about Rith.</p><p>Endelle glanced at Antony. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill the bastard?\u201d</p><p>Antony explained about the trace block that Rith had employed at both the Toulouse farmhouse and now his own villa.</p><p>She glanced at Parisa and scowled. \u201cShit. He folded through my mist. And he folded straight to you. Shit.\u201d Her scowl deepened as she continued to stare at Parisa. She also nodded several times. \u201cSo let me understand you, vampire. So far, you\u2019ve escaped Rith by cutting him with your dagger while in France and today by dematerializing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth times you got lucky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would have to agree with you.\u201d</p><p>Endelle grimaced and cocked her head. She wore a headband that bore an assortment of brown feathers angled into the air, pheasant maybe. If they\u2019d been arranged to stand straight up, Parisa thought the headpiece came shockingly close to images of Native American culture.</p><p>Her Supremeness continued, \u201cHow the hell were you able to dematerialize when you\u2019ve only been ascended about half a minute? I mean, I could do that when I ascended, but then I\u2019m, well, me.\u201d</p><p>Parisa shrugged. \u201cHow the hell did I have wings on Mortal Earth?\u201d</p><p>At that, Endelle laughed. \u201cYou know, your speech patterns have changed. You used to be rather stiff in the ass. You\u2019re loosening up. I think that\u2019s a good thing. Medichi good in bed? Is that why you seem so different? Does he satisfy you? He should. He\u2019s hung like a horse.\u201d</p><p>Parisa\u2019s mouth opened and stayed that way. Her cheeks flamed.</p><p>\u201cEndelle, for Christ\u2019s sake,\u201d Antony cried.</p><p>Endelle rolled her eyes. \u201cCreator, save me from prudes.\u201d She turned around and leaned against the railing. She cast her gaze up and up. \u201cI love the White Tanks. They just do it for me. The contour of the entire mountain range is goddamn breathtaking.\u201d</p> <p>Parisa slid her gaze up Endelle\u2019s profile. She really was a great beauty even though it was hidden most of the time behind her sailor\u2019s mouth. She had lovely olive skin and features reminiscent of an Arabian princess. She should have been draped in lovely silks instead of cowhide and feathers.</p><p>Parisa gave herself a shake. She was here for a reason. Focus. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. If Rith can get onto the villa grounds then he\u2019ll find a way to enthrall me again.\u201d</p><p>Endelle nodded. \u201cIs Medichi still training you? Are you flying much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were going to do that after we talked to you.\u201d Her thoughts whipped to Fiona, and she turned to Antony abruptly. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>Antony drew his phone from the pocket of his jeans. \u201cIt\u2019s been half an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Endelle cried. \u201cDo you have someplace better to be? Am I fucking boring you?\u201d</p><p>Parisa couldn\u2019t help it. She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re so funny.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the right thing to say. The pheasant-like feathers lifted straight up. Parisa added quickly, \u201cI\u2019ve been voyeuring Fiona, quick snapshots, to see the sky in the window above her bed.\u201d She explained about the search grid.</p><p>The feathers eased down and Endelle\u2019s brows rose. \u201cWell, damn, ascender, you\u2019ve got a brain in that pretty head of yours. Not half bad.\u201d She narrowed her gaze and appeared to be thinking. After a moment, she said, \u201cOkay, keep up with the weapons training. The more you know about how to use your dagger, the better.\u201d She looked past Parisa to Antony. \u201cI think we should set up some Militia Warriors to serve as guards around the property as well. Rith isn\u2019t a fighter, so he\u2019ll be less likely to try to take Parisa if there are warriors everywhere. When I get back to the office, I\u2019ll give Seriffe a shout. Also, why don\u2019t you set up a telepathic link with Parisa? That way she can reach you instantly.\u201d</p><p>Parisa put a hand to her chest and stared once more into the sunken garden\u2014anywhere but at Antony or Endelle. Paths meandered from one to the other, crisscrossing. Tourists walked to and fro.</p><p>A teenager, wearing baggy pants, stripped off his T-shirt and mounted his wings. He flew in the lumbering pattern of youth all the way to the top of the hill. A voice came over the loudspeaker. \u201cThere is no mounting of wings in the garden. Retract immediately or we\u2019re sending security in.\u201d</p><p>The teenager, now standing next to a teen girl, lifted his hand in a one-fingered salute, but he drew his wings in then put his arms around the girl. Parisa smiled. At least some things hadn\u2019t changed on Second Earth. It all seemed so normal. There was that word again ... normal. There was nothing normal about a vampire trying to abduct her ... again.</p><p>She looked back at Antony. He frowned at her and she could probably guess at his thoughts since they\u2019d so recently had a fight about this very thing, about how he thought they should get closer as in complete the breh-hedden and how she didn\u2019t. Yes, it might make it safer but she didn\u2019t want to be that close to Antony, or anyone, much less share what amounted to a Vulcan mind meld.</p><p>\u201cSo do you think this is a good idea?\u201d she asked. \u201cA telepathic link?\u201d</p><p>He smiled but it was crooked and maybe just a little bitter. \u201cYep. It means that we could communicate telepathically over long distances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do that anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cI called to you from Burma, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is different, a solid connection, a link. No one else could break it or interfere. With ordinary telepathy, someone could cut off our conversation. That wouldn\u2019t be possible with a mind-link.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is the problem, ascender Lovejoy?\u201d Endelle cried. \u201cWhy are you resisting this? You need a fucking link to Warrior Medichi. EOS. It\u2019s also like GPS. He\u2019ll know your location without needing you to send a mental image and don\u2019t frown at me. Just do it. Damn, I\u2019m so sick of the whining. Do you want to live or not? Huh? Answer me that, because it\u2019s a goddamn simple question.\u201d</p><p>One thing about Endelle, she could boil an issue down in two or three sentences. Did she want to live? Yes. Did she want a mind-link with Antony? No. It meant intimacy and it felt like she was being forced into yet another box.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she muttered. \u201cBut I\u2019m not happy about this.\u201d</p><p>Endelle snorted again. \u201cWho the hell cares if you\u2019re \u2018happy\u2019 or not?\u201d She made air quotes.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d Parisa said. \u201cAnd it might even interfere with a telepathic link.\u201d</p><p>Endelle met her gaze. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to imagine what would interfere with a mind-link.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA voyeur-link.\u201d</p><p>Endelle moved her head back and forth slowly. \u201cWhat the hell is a voyeur-link?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Greaves created a link with me when I was in Burma.\u201d She told her about Greaves\u2019s visit, about the kiss, about dropping her shields, and waking up on the grass. \u201cThe thing is, whenever I opened my voyeur window from that moment on, I would experience pain, sharp pain. Lately it\u2019s gotten better, and now after a few seconds it disappears but I suspect that\u2019s because Greaves is trying to be discreet.\u201d</p><p>Endelle was nodding. \u201cWhich would explain why there were so many death vamps waiting at the Toulouse house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I\u2019ve experimented with it, but I was wondering. Since you\u2019re so powerful, could you see if I\u2019m right? Could you search my mind for that kind of link and break it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe author of a mind-link has to break it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Antony said but I\u2019d still like you to see what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Endelle sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to lower your shields. All the way. Can you do that or do I have to kiss you, too?\u201d Her lips actually curved. So besides cursing, and wearing outrageous clothes, Endelle could sometimes make a halfway decent joke. Nice.</p><p>At that, Parisa laughed. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, still smiling. \u201cFor you, I\u2019ll lower my shields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Endelle said. \u201cLooks like you might even trust me a little.\u201d</p><p>Parisa shrugged. \u201cMaybe a little.\u201d</p><p>Endelle just shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re one stubborn female, but I\u2019ll admit you\u2019ve got some potential.\u201d</p><p>Endelle put her hands on Parisa\u2019s face. Parisa closed her eyes. She took a deep breath and let her shields fall, all the way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Endelle traveled through her mind like warm water. The movement was gentle\u2014quite a contrast with the woman\u2019s rattler-like temperament.</p><p>Parisa knew when Endelle found the voyeur link, because pain snatched at her, deep searing pain that caused her to push at Endelle\u2019s arms and fall backward on her bottom next to the railing.</p><p>She drew her knees up to her chest and tears flew down her cheeks unbidden.</p> <p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Endelle cried. \u201cWhat did you do that for?\u201d</p><p>Parisa looked up at her and scowled. Antony had dropped down beside her. \u201cYou okay?\u201d He asked that a lot.</p><p>But Parisa met Endelle\u2019s gaze. \u201cThat hurt like hell. What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Endelle cried. \u201cNot a damn thing. I got to the link and looked at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt felt like fire inside my head.\u201d</p> <p>Endelle shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ve just confirmed the truth that only the author of the link can break it. I could barely get near it without causing pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s Greaves?\u201d Antony had a hand under Parisa\u2019s arm, and she leaned on him as she scrambled to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell but from everything you\u2019ve just told me and from the burning sensation, I\u2019d say yes, this smacks of that pansy-ass bastard.\u201d She huffed a sigh. \u201cWell, ascender Lovejoy, there\u2019s nothing more I can do here and, unlike you, I have to get back to work. But no more whining, goddammit.\u201d She lifted her arm and like that she was gone.</p><p>That was it? That was all the help she was going to get from the most powerful vampire on Second Earth? Great.</p><p>Parisa was about to turn to Antony and say something to him, but a wind came up with grit flying in her face that stung, a wind that had Endelle\u2019s signature all over it. She cried out and Antony moved in front of her, muttering a string of curses.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can be such a bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Parisa said, \u201cshe really wasn\u2019t much help, was she?\u201d</p><p>Antony chuckled. \u201cShe has her moments. This wasn\u2019t one of them. Let\u2019s get back to the villa, we\u2019ll do some flying then more work with the dagger and sword. I\u2019ll download a few more memories if you like.\u201d He paused and met her gaze. He still stood in front of her. She watched his chest rise and fall in a heavy sigh. \u201cI won\u2019t force a mind-link on you. Even though it\u2019s a good idea and I really want you safe, I think this must be hell for you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. But you know, I think Endelle is right about one thing. I\u2019ve been feeling sorry for myself and I\u2019m going to try to do better.\u201d</p><p>Antony put his hand on her shoulder, gave her a gentle warning, then she was flying through nether-space.</p><p>The stories told of Luchianne, the first vampire, always mention her royle wings, which were said to produce inexplicable flames.</p><p>\u2014From Treatise on Ascension, Philippe Reynard</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>When Medichi got Parisa back to the villa, he remained in the foyer with her. He drew his warrior phone from the pocket of his jeans and ran his thumb across the smooth black exterior.</p> <p>\u201cCarla here. How may I serve?\u201d It was still daylight so Carla was on duty. Jeannie showed up at dusk, and for an hour or two their schedules would overlap.</p><p>\u201cHi, Carla. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Warrior Medichi. Just fine. We\u2019re cruising the grid. I have two of my techs in here today just to keep the search progressing as fast as we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. We have aerials of both the Burma anomaly and the Toulouse anomaly so we know what we\u2019re looking for but we really need to narrow the search down. We\u2019re over China, where it\u2019s light right now, but so far it looks clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParisa just did a quick voyeur. The sky is still very blue, wherever it is that Rith has the women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Right now we\u2019re looking at anything from Beijing to Sydney, anywhere that the sun hasn\u2019t set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Thanks for checking in.\u201d</p><p>He thumbed his phone then slipped it back into his pocket.</p><p>He turned to Parisa. \u201cThe grid is somewhere over China right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019re getting closer. \u201c</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be sensitive here, so bear with me. I know Endelle was adamant about a mind-link and I think it\u2019s a good idea, maybe even a necessary one. But because of your voyeur-link with that bastard\u2014\u201d He clenched his fists then struggled to relax his hands. He took a couple of deep breaths. \u201cAnyway, if you don\u2019t want to create a mind-link with me right now, I\u2019d be okay with it. Honestly, with all that you\u2019re going through, I think this should be your call.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cThank you for that, Antony. I really appreciate it.\u201d After a moment she added, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we hold off on that for a little while. The headaches\u2014\u201d She blinked and her mouth fell a little. \u201cWait a minute. Antony, I just realized we could play Greaves with the voyeur-link.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so far it seems to me that Greaves never connects instantly, so there must be a slight delay for him when I open the link. I\u2019ve been able to take these peeks at Fiona, but there\u2019s no flash of pain. The whole pattern is so obvious to me now. But I could establish my own pattern of voyeuring innocuous things, let him check in and watch, then get bored and leave. That might disrupt him just enough to ensure we get the slaves out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, that might just work,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going to try it now.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and for the next few seconds he watched her. She winced then took a deep breath, but he could tell she was sustaining a voyeur. The whole thing lasted a good long minute.</p><p>Finally, she opened her eyes and smiled once more. \u201cI panned your library that whole time. Right at the beginning, after a few seconds, I felt the usual sudden pain. But then I think the master got bored.\u201d She even laughed.</p><p>\u201cThen we can use your knowledge of the process to our advantage.\u201d</p><p>Her smile broadened. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Medichi smiled and something warmed in his chest. Here she was, stuck with a fucking voyeur-link to the vilest vampire on the planet, and she was laughing. She ought to be rewarded.</p><p>Though he considered taking her back to bed, he knew there was something else she loved doing, a lot.</p><p>He smiled at Parisa. \u201cWell, how about a flying lesson?\u201d</p><p>The sheer joy on her face tightened his chest. He loved that she wanted to fly, he approved of her drive to learn to use Second Earth weaponry, and he really admired the way she was putting her life on the line for Fiona.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to do anything she was doing. No one had required her to ascend, but she had. No one demanded that she help rescue the blood slaves, but from the beginning she\u2019d insisted on front-and-center involvement. The woman was game and breh-hedden or no breh-hedden, Parisa was revealing the truth of her character left and right and dammit, he respected her.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019ll need to change into flight gear. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She started to head into the formal living room, clearly intending to walk to her room, but he called after her, \u201cFold, Parisa.\u201d</p><p>She turned back, a faint frown between her brows. He smiled as he said, \u201cDematerialize. Remember? You can do that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cI forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork that muscle along with everything else. Rith knows now that you have dematerialization capacity, but he\u2019s fast. If he catches even the tip of your finger while you attempt a fold, he\u2019ll be able to take you with him wherever he wants to go and we\u2019ll be back where we started.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, closed her eyes, thought the thought. She vanished. She returned almost as quickly. She smiled at him then lifted her arm and dematerialized again.</p><p>That smile. Her smile. She seemed so pleased with herself. As well she should be. Damn, the woman could fold and she\u2019d only been a vampire for how many hours? Christ, it hadn\u2019t even been a full day.</p><p>When she returned, she wore Havily\u2019s old flight gear. The tight black leather, which would have fit Havily perfectly, was just too small for Parisa and didn\u2019t he love it, perverted bastard that he was.</p><p>Without thinking too much about it, he folded off his T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Parisa cried.</p><p>He glanced at her face and saw that her cheeks were flushed, and not from embarrassment as her gaze skated over his shoulders, his chest, his arms. He couldn\u2019t help but flex his biceps and pecs just a little. He smiled, way too smugly no doubt, as her lips parted and she blinked a couple more times than necessary.</p><p>He knew what he looked like; he\u2019d had plenty of women over the years take delight in his body. He knew the effect he had. But when a swell of her tangerine scent, softened by a layer of scent that was just her, crossed the few feet between them, his body responded.</p><p>He lowered his chin and finished closing the gap so that he had his arms around her in a nanosecond. But her hand flew to his chest, not to welcome him or to touch him, but in protest. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. Yet the glitter in her eyes told another story.</p><p>He didn\u2019t try to push her hand away, at least not with his hand. Instead, he pushed against her hand with his chest. The movement caused his pecs to swell. She watched his chest then licked her lips. Her elbow gave way from the pressure and he enfolded her in his arms, her hands between them, her fingers plucking at his skin and at the fine hairs between his pecs. She seemed to like doing that.</p><p>He kissed her, a soft dragging kiss that elicited a girlish moan. Antony drifted through his head.</p><p>He loved the sound of her voice in his mind. He worked his arms a little farther around her. He eased one leg beside her so that his hips met hers. He ground against her and let her feel what he wanted her to feel, the hard length of him. She could blame the breh-hedden all she wanted, but she was beautiful and sexy as hell. What more did a man need? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One of the hands against his chest started moving down his abs, and he released her enough to let her go where she wanted. When she reached the head of him, her fingers stopped then began a light drift over the tip.</p><p>He groaned against her mouth, she parted her lips, and he drove inside ... hard.</p><p>A sound between a cry and a moan erupted from her throat. She may have been insistent about moving into one of the guest rooms, but that had nothing to do with the strength of her attraction to him. She wanted him and right now, after all her protests about not wanting to feel so trapped, her desire, her need, felt very, very good to him.</p> <p>He drew back and looked down at swollen lips and glittery eyes. She withdrew her fingers from his crown, then settled both hands on his waist, her fingers cool against his bare skin.</p><p>She was tall enough to fit him; even in her bare feet he didn\u2019t have far to go to kiss her. What would it be like to be inside her head, to move inside her head and take possession? He knew that completing the breh-hedden meant that all three things had to happen at once: penetration, sharing of blood at the same time, and deep-mind engagement, much deeper than mere telepathic communication. And as much as he might complain about it, he wanted to be with Parisa in just that way, wholly connected.</p><p>He\u2019d once overheard Kerrick and Marcus talk about it, bits and pieces. Mostly, he\u2019d heard the low guttural sounds the men made as they agreed about the experience. Kerrick had said that Alison released power, her abdomen to his. Marcus had said that Havily often pulled them into the darkening and took them for a second ride right in the middle of everything.</p><p>What, then, would it be like with Parisa, with a woman so powerful? He\u2019d always enjoyed sex, taking a woman, bringing her to a roaring orgasm. But this was infinitely more intense. How much of that was the breh-hedden? Shit, he\u2019d never know. The breh-hedden seemed to be so different for those involved. How would it differ for them if they completed the act?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about so hard?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He blinked and she came into focus, a frown in her amethyst eyes. \u201cAren\u2019t you curious, even a little, with that scientist\u2019s mind of yours, what it would be like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the breh-hedden?\u201d Her voice sounded low, a little hoarse.</p><p>He nodded slowly and trailed a finger down her cheek.</p><p>She drew in a ragged breath, turned into that finger, and licked the tip. Oh. God. \u201cI\u2019ve wondered,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course I\u2019ve wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I wish?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, her eyes smoldering. \u201cWhat? What do you wish?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish we could do it without repercussions.\u201d He pulled her hard against him. \u201cI want to fuck you with my mind buried in your mind, my fangs sunk into your neck, and my cock so deep inside that you\u2019d feel me for a week afterward.\u201d</p><p>Her knees buckled. Her knees buckled.</p><p>He chuckled low as he supported her with his arms around her. He whispered into her ear, \u201cI want you in my bed, Parisa. Fuck the guest room. I want you close so that when I get this hard, I can throw you on your back and plunge into you.\u201d</p><p>He felt her breath hot against his neck. Her tongue flicked over his throat. To her mind, he sent, Imagine this, you riding me, your fangs in my throat, my fangs in your wrist, my mind moving into yours then you taking over and moving into mine. Imagine what that would be like.</p><p>She was moaning now, her body writhing against his, her tongue arching over his vein, flexing, bringing forth what he could tell she wanted ... right now.</p><p>He knew that if he wanted to, he had the power in his hands to follow through with this, to fold her to his bed and live out the fantasy. Her body was clearly in a state of surrender.</p><p>But that\u2019s all it was, a fantasy. If he seduced her right now, after all that she\u2019d said to him so recently, she\u2019d never forgive him afterward. If he understood things, the bond of the breh-hedden, once completed, couldn\u2019t be broken afterward except by death.</p><p>So ... shit.</p> <p>He trembled, actually trembled as he drew back from her. She whimpered her protest. He gathered her hands and kissed her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat ... what are you doing? Why did you stop?\u201d Her cheeks turned crimson. \u201cIs it me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know I\u2019m being difficult and I want you, Antony, I do. I\u2019ve wanted you for such a long time, from the first time I mounted my wings and the voyeur window opened and there you were. I can still picture you. You were at the Blood and Bite standing next to Jean-Pierre. You were smiling and I thought, what a gorgeous man. But it wasn\u2019t just that you were so handsome.\u201d Her fingers touched his cheeks and there were tears in her eyes. \u201cIt was that I felt I could see into your soul as well. You ... you have a light in your eyes you probably don\u2019t even know is there. I ... I have always believed in you.\u201d</p><p>Of all the things he might have expected her to say after he\u2019d shut down the passion between them, this wasn\u2019t it. He\u2019d expected her to cry out, to complain, maybe even to shout at him\u2014not to extol his virtues.</p><p>Again ... shit.</p><p>He so didn\u2019t want this, need this, but something inside his chest began to fall, like a wall of clay against powerful ocean waves. The crumbling began in stages, but all those walls fell, the ones he\u2019d erected thirteen centuries ago, the ones he\u2019d thought were made of obsidian. Instead, just clay to the right kind of woman.</p><p>Double shit.</p><p>He drew her close and she opened her arms at the same time, wrapping them around his back. He felt a little sob against his chest. They were so fucked.</p><p>Neither of them wanted what was happening. He\u2019d been crushed by life. So had she. He couldn\u2019t say he totally understood the difficulties of her childhood, of moving several times a year so that she never felt grounded, that she could never establish long-term friendships, but he did know what it was like to have life take a destructive turn leaving only one thought: How do I keep myself from getting hurt ever again?</p><p>But would it ever be possible for the walls of isolation she\u2019d created for herself to crumble against the weight of his presence in her life? Could she love him?</p><p>Could she love him?</p><p>He held her for a long time, and she didn\u2019t move except to nestle into his shoulder. He felt her breathe in between his own breaths.</p><p>Finally, she said, \u201cI can hear your heart beating. I love that sound. I think I could listen to it forever.\u201d</p><p>A heavy sigh rolled out of his body. He didn\u2019t know what to do. He didn\u2019t know what the fuck to do. Every second he was with her, he just sank deeper into these feelings that seemed a helluva lot like, yeah, love.</p><p>But there was something he could do for her that had nothing to do with whether either of them should surrender to the breh-hedden.</p><p>He drew back and once more took her hands. \u201cYou practiced flying in Burma, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day. Rith demanded exercise first thing in the morning, so I flew.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI want to take you someplace special right now to do our flying. It will be a challenge but I won\u2019t let anything happen to you. Are you willing?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. No ... she beamed. \u201cHells, yeah, Warrior. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>There it was again. She was so game when she\u2019d been dropped right into the middle of a war.</p><p>\u201cAnd Antony\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re stuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, but what the hell, let\u2019s fly.\u201d</p><p>Her smile broadened.</p><p>He closed his eyes. He thought the thought. The distance from his villa to the Mogollon Rim was over a hundred miles. But folding took only seconds.</p><p>When his feet touched down and he released her from the circle of his arms, she gasped. The canyon floor lay two thousand feet below.</p><p>\u201cThis is the Mogollon Rim,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you ever visited here or not. I know you can take jeep tours from Sedona, Mortal Earth, all the way up.\u201d</p><p>The small town of Sedona Two rested below, nestled at the base of the rim, bisected by Oak Creek. From where they stood, the town wasn\u2019t visible. There were too many twists and turns in the various canyon walls. \u201cBoth Thorne and Jean-Pierre have homes here. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut I\u2019m not surprised. Who wouldn\u2019t want to live here? Oh, smell the pine. It\u2019s heavenly. And it\u2019s much cooler than in Phoenix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not quite at seven thousand feet.\u201d He dipped down to look at her again, to once more catch sight of the eager glitter in her eye. \u201cYou ready to fly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Antony, yes. More than anything in the world.\u201d</p><p>Parisa sucked in the dry mountain air, the resinous pine scent, and the sage that belonged to the man whose arms were still holding her from behind. She wanted to cry, then cry out.</p><p>This was where she belonged. Here. This was home. \u201cI want to live here,\u201d she said.</p><p>He leaned close to her ear. \u201cThen you should. You\u2019d have two great neighbors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I would. I love the warriors, Antony. I love them. Does that sound strange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my brothers so I love that you love them. No, it doesn\u2019t sound strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never forget seeing all of them, all of them, in Burma. They were there for me and I want to be there for them, to repay them in whatever way I can.\u201d She turned her head to look at him. She kissed him on the lips. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not holding on.\u201d She pressed the arms wrapped around her, which seemed ironic. Thanks for not holding on.</p><p>He nuzzled her neck. \u201cIt\u2019s both of us, Parisa. I never intended to take a wife again. I still don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. So they were both inaccessible. She smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled. He understood as though he\u2019d read her mind. He stepped away from her and gave her space.</p><p>She closed her eyes and leaned forward just a little bit. She took in a deep breath. She felt the apertures all down her back dampen with moisture. Hormones flooded her veins, and the muscle and tissues of her back swelled. The feathers and attending mesh-like superstructure came next in an elegant erotic seamless flow from her body until they emerged in a powerful thrust into the air. She still didn\u2019t understand how her body could create such magnificence, but then how could she dematerialize or send her thoughts into someone else\u2019s mind or open her voyeur\u2019s window?</p><p>Ascended life, her new life as a vampire, was a mystery, complex, incomprehensible at times, and yes, like now, wondrous.</p> <p>Her nipples were hard now and smashed against the inside of the leather vest. She couldn\u2019t help it and she hated to admit it, but desire swirled very deep. Why was mounting her wings so much like sex?</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>Just as she opened her eyes, a breeze blew from behind her, catching her wings before she could think to draw them into the close-mount position. Without warning, she was airborne.</p><p>She panicked but Antony was just there, his wings at full-mount and already in flight. He caught her hand and gave her a moment to assess and adjust. Her wings shifted, rippled, and played with the wind so that she grew steady in the air, confident. Yes, she\u2019d been practicing, but there was also a part of her, a very instinctive part, that simply knew what to do.</p><p>We\u2019ll fly down, he sent. Each intersection of canyon or narrowing of gorge will bring a shift in wind. Can you handle it?</p> <p>Parisa cupped the top of her wings, which kept her floating in place, not descending. He matched her with the ease of someone who\u2019d flown for centuries. That knowledge added to her confidence.</p><p>Antony\u2019s wings were spread out above her and to her right. He hovered just as she did, making infinitesimal adjustments with each erratic current of air. She caught his gaze and nodded.</p><p>He smiled. Oh, how she loved that smile. Something around her heart began to peel away like paper touched by fire. What was left exposed was raw and yet hopeful, something she hadn\u2019t experienced ... ever. Could she have a life with this man? How strange to be asking the question when just a couple of hours ago she\u2019d all but shoved him out of her life.</p><p>Well, one thing she did know\u2014she wouldn\u2019t have the answer right this minute.</p><p>She took a deep breath and let go, she let go of all that had happened; her captivity of the past three months, the struggle to understand the first mounting of her wings and the discovery of the world of vampires, of her recent ascension, of fending Rith off twice now, and her terrible fear of the breh-hedden.</p><p>She let go and savored this moment in time, as she lowered her wings and began the descent into the twists and turns and elegant beauty of Sedona\u2019s red rock canyon. She dipped and turned, adjusting for each punch of wind, each stream, each swirl of breeze. Sometimes she spread her arms to match the movements of the wings; sometimes she kept them close at her sides.</p> <p>She forgot about Antony for a good long while. She saw only the green pines, the manzanita, the ancient junipers, the smooth-edged expanses of red boulders and small treeless mesas, the water in the creek as it made its way down and down, the startled deer jumping below as her predator wings and Antony\u2019s created shadows across the landscape.</p><p>She took in the fresh air, warm and dry. Very dry.</p><p>Antony was suddenly laying thoughts over her mind. Your wings are beautiful. In the sunlight, they dance with unexpected color, almost like flames.</p><p>She sent, We have the same wings. Fly in front of me for a moment and let me see yours.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to leave this position. I don\u2019t want to lose sight of you, not for a moment, in case you need me.</p><p>I\u2019m okay. Really. Please, Antony. I remember your wings in Burma. I recall the flames. I thought it was the storm. Please.</p><p>Okay, he sent but he sounded really reluctant. But just for a moment.</p><p>He shot forward with a quick downward sweep of his wings. There they were, the cream color of the feathers moving like flames. It was extraordinary, like wings of fire.</p> <p>Oh, Antony, they\u2019re so beautiful. But what makes them like that?</p><p>He laughed aloud then sent, I have no idea.</p><p>He dropped back immediately to fly beside her then added, Come this way.</p><p>She glanced at him and watched as he dipped his right wing and began banking to his right and down at the same time.</p><p>She followed, dipping her wing as if she\u2019d practiced for years. She had just started making the turn when a wind shear to her right caught her completely off guard and knocked her sideways. She rolled; she had practiced rolling in the dome, way up high. When her back was once more to the sun, she brought her wings straight out and leveled her body.</p><p>She smiled but almost plowed into Antony, who\u2019d brought himself into the parachute position to hang in the air in front of her. His legs dangled down like he was standing in midair, his expression stunned.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she called as she popped her wings into parachute position to match him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d he cried.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expected you to need help, and instead you righted yourself like you\u2019ve been flying for decades.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but smile. It was the best compliment he could have given her.</p><p>He shook his head, unfurled his wings, and rocketed toward a deep brick-red configuration of rock, flat and smooth and hundreds of feet across. A recent rain had left pools of water in some of the shallow indentations.</p><p>She followed him and landed easily. She pulled in her wings to close-mount so that the feathers were pressed against her body and random wind eddies wouldn\u2019t sweep her away again.</p><p>She faced the canyon below but also had a view of the curve of the rim off her left shoulder. They\u2019d already traveled several hundred feet down.</p><p>She sighed as Antony drew up behind her and wrapped his wings forward to engulf her. She could not have been more content.</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her cheek. It almost felt like a date.</p><p>She smiled at the thought then let her gaze drift, rise and fall, shift to whatever object grabbed her attention, an outcropping, a hawk on the wing, the deep blue mountain sky over the rim. Why couldn\u2019t life be this simple always, a shared moment of the beauty of nature, the close comfort of another human being, okay, vampire, maybe even making simple plans, like where to have dinner.</p><p>Just as the question formed in her mind, unease descended. She felt sick into her abdomen. Her thoughts turned to Fiona. Without willing it, her voyeur\u2019s window opened and Fiona was just there. She sat on the edge of what looked like a camping cot, her hands in fists as she gripped the edge. She looked frightened, her lips set in a grim line, her eyes wide. Her chest rose and fell quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Antony asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve really tensed up. Is it me? Am I crowding you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried. \u201cIt\u2019s Fiona. My window just sort of opened on her but I don\u2019t know why. Hang on. Let me see if I can communicate with her.\u201d</p><p>But as she reverted her attention to the voyeur window, another male voice broke over her hearing. Rith spoke in his cool demanding tone, \u201cI said, summon her. Summon Parisa and do it now.\u201d</p><p>Fiona shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t. I don\u2019t have that kind of power. I don\u2019t know why you think I would.\u201d</p><p>Parisa gasped. Fiona was wrong. She did have the power to summon her, she just didn\u2019t know it. Aloud, she explained to Antony what was going on, ending with, \u201cBut Rith is there. What do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it play out.\u201d</p><p>Parisa trembled. She was grateful Antony held her wrapped up in his wings.</p><p>Rith drew close to Fiona. Parisa knew what would happen and she wanted to warn her, but it was too late. She flinched as Rith struck Fiona hard across the face.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t call her,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how. Why would you think I could call her? I\u2019m not like you. I\u2019m not fully ascended. I\u2019m not a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Parisa heard a strange whimpering sound. She panned to the left, to a long row of cots. Bodies were huddled beneath blankets. Some shook, but more than one whimpered.</p><p>She panned up to the windows, but they were still full of sunlight. Good to know.</p><p>Just as she panned back to Fiona and Rith, a sudden twinge pierced her mind. Greaves. Shit. She closed the window as quickly as she could. Maybe she\u2019d been in time. Maybe Greaves didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d been voyeuring.</p><p>\u201cAntony, I had to shut the window down. I felt Greaves. But I did see the windows and it was still light outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let me call Carla to give her the update.\u201d</p><p>Antony withdrew his wings and stepped away from her. He fluffed and retracted the wings in an amazingly swift and fluid movement.</p><p>Parisa had thought they would continue to fly, but even as the disappointment hit her, she realized that her surprise contact with Fiona had ended the simple joy of the flying experience. She\u2019d be worried the entire time if they continued heading down through the canyon to the town below.</p><p>He held his hand out to her. \u201cI\u2019ll support you while you retract. Go ahead. Full-mount first.\u201d</p><p>Parisa nodded but the process was difficult because of her inexperience and all the wind eddies. Rith\u2019s double dome of mist had protected his Mandalay home from storms, wind, and rain, so when it came to flying or in this case, drawing her wings in, she lacked experience with the elements. Still, within a minute she was fully retracted, and her back muscles were already thinning.</p><p>He pulled his phone from his pocket and called Carla. He relayed the update then thumbed his phone and returned it to his pocket.</p><p>\u201cRith struck her. He was trying to force her to contact me. I think she did so without realizing it. I really think Fiona has untapped powers.\u201d</p><p>Antony nodded. \u201cWell, if she\u2019s Jean-Pierre\u2019s breh, then of course she would.\u201d</p><p>He glanced around, even up into the skies. She understood his thoughts and suddenly felt very vulnerable out in the open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the villa. I think we\u2019ve been out here long enough.\u201d</p><p>It was always a risk, being in the open. Antony held her steady and with a smile and a nod, folded them both to the villa.</p><p>She felt the front pavers beneath her feet, but the sight of Militia Warriors now stationed throughout the property startled her.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, feeling her tension. \u201cI almost drew my sword. I forgot they might be here. Endelle said she\u2019d call Seriffe. But if Rith shows up again, uninvited, he\u2019ll have to face an army this time.\u201d</p> <p>Rith felt his phone vibrate in the pocket of his white cotton trousers. He withdrew the Nokia and smiled at the word MASTER, which indicated the call\u2019s origin. He brought the phone to his ear. He felt pleased. \u201cYes, master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing over there, my dear Rith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExperimenting.\u201d The woman Fiona had a bright red handprint on her left cheek. A small trickle of blood ran from her left nostril. It was actually rather pretty, that red stream on her creamy complexion. Fiona had very good skin, for a Caucasian.</p><p>\u201cI felt Parisa\u2019s voyeur window open and I had a glimpse of the women in a long narrow room on cots. Was that your doing somehow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I believe so, master. I asked the woman, Fiona, to contact Parisa. It would seem it worked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInteresting. Do you suspect Fiona of undeveloped powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have for some time. How is that she has lived this long when no one else has?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you may be right. I will read her powers the next time I come.\u201d He paused. Rith knew better than to disturb his master\u2019s ruminations. After a long moment, Greaves said, \u201cBe prepared to move the donors again. In the meantime, you may want to stop further experimentation until we have command of Parisa. We would not want Fiona to develop the ability to communicate with our mortal-with-wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, master.\u201d Greaves was right. Parisa\u2019s ability to reach out to Fiona also allowed her to see his dying blood acquisition facility. What else she was capable of, who could say, but he didn\u2019t want to risk discovery. If he had to move the slaves again, he would disrupt the dying blood supplies he sent around the world.</p><p>As Fiona met his gaze, he really didn\u2019t appreciate the hard look in her eye. He lifted a brow. He pushed at her chest with his power, that physical power he used to command obedience. She resisted at first but after a minute fell back against the cot. For good measure, he sustained the pressure while he worked.</p><p>Into his hand, he folded restraint straps from a special chest he carried with him from place to place. He didn\u2019t touch her as he directed the straps through the air, around her wrists, and through the slots in the cot. He did the same to her ankles.</p> <p>He ignored her after that but he kept the pressure on her chest until she was gasping for air. He didn\u2019t relent until she passed out. Only then did he let her breathe.</p><p>At the same time, he chose the next donor, the woman who had been whimpering. He really would not tolerate such pathetic noises among his slaves.</p><p>\u201cYou will be next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I gave blood two weeks ago. I\u2019m not ready.\u201d</p><p>He passed a hand over her eyes, and her gaze became blank. He left her in that state. He was debating whether or not to bring her back afterward.</p><p>Who is the true warrior</p><p>But the one tried in battle.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p> <p>Chapter 18</p><p>Medichi stood on the half-moon of pavers that formed the large patio in front of his villa. He watched Parisa throw her dagger with unparalleled accuracy. The target was now thirty feet away and still she nailed the bull\u2019s-eye every time.</p><p>An hour had passed since they\u2019d returned from the rim. Parisa had done her voyeur window quick-checks twice now, but there was still a lot of blue sky at the window. Time was counting down, though, and he was ready.</p><p>She\u2019d done her set-Greaves-on-the-wrong-path routine a number of times as well. That she experienced pain every time bugged the shit out of him, but there was nothing he could do and she was determined to see their plan through. Damn, he was proud of her.</p><p>He\u2019d consulted with Thorne more than once, keeping him updated. This time, however, Thorne wanted all the warriors to go on the mission. Medichi wasn\u2019t certain why, but it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>He felt a movement of air behind him. He whirled and folded his sword into his hand despite the dozen Militia Warriors stationed around the lawn.</p><p>Jean-Pierre shimmered into being.</p><p>Medichi released a breath. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call first?\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre pushed a hand through his long, wavy, light brown hair that hung beside his face to mid-chest, and down his back. He wasn\u2019t wearing a cadroen and he looked like hell. \u201cD\u00e9sol\u00e9,\u201d he murmured. Sorry.</p><p>\u201cYou look like fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be sleeping right now. Thorne will want you at the Borderlands tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I cannot sleep. I have so much fatigue. Medichi, I did not know how hard it was. The breh-hedden. It\u2019s like a torture in my head and a fire here.\u201d He circled his palm over his chest. He wore a navy T-shirt, jeans. Medichi glanced down. He wasn\u2019t even wearing shoes.</p><p>Medichi chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jean-Pierre, but welcome to the goddamn club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you bear it for three months? I have borne her disappearance for less than a day and I want to hurt someone very badly.\u201d</p><p>Medichi sighed. His gaze shifted to Parisa, who was heading toward the target to pick up the practice daggers. She still wore the flight suit and his gaze fell as always to the swell of her breasts. Parisa, he sent.</p><p>She stopped mid-stride and turned toward him. Yes? Her gaze shifted to Jean-Pierre, and she waved at him. He waved in return.</p><p>He felt like a pig speaking the words but he responded as gently as he could inside her mind, Maybe a shirt? I hate to ask, but you\u2019re very voluptuous.</p><p>She almost glanced down at her chest, but instead her hand came to the deep cleavage, her fingers resting on the push of her breasts beyond the leather. Her gaze shifted to Jean-Pierre and her cheeks fired up. She then glanced at the Militia Warriors who were at least some distance away.</p><p>Oh, you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll change now. Sweet Jesus, but Jean-Pierre looks wrecked.</p><p>She started to walk in their direction, but he added, Fold.</p><p>Right. Right.</p><p>She lifted an arm, closed her eyes, then vanished.</p><p>\u201cMon Dieu,\u201d Jean-Pierre cried. \u201cDid your woman just dematerialize?\u201d</p><p>Medichi shouldn\u2019t have been so pleased, but he was. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. He crossed his arms over his chest. His pecs swelled. His woman was the only other known mortal to have born wings before her ascension other than Luchianne, she could communicate telepathically, she had a voyeur\u2019s window which was an acknowledged Third Dimension ability, and she could dematerialize. He felt damn proud.</p><p>\u201cYou are preening like a peacock, mon ami.\u201d Jean-Pierre smiled and nudged him with his elbow.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your cadroen?\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre sighed. \u201cWhat do I care for the cadroen? For anything, when my woman is held captive by that beast.\u201d His gaze fell to the nearby lawn. Back and forth his gaze flew as though hunting for her. \u201cI do not know what to do, mon ami. I am desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you sound so damn hoarse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have been shouting into the wind, calling for her. The breh-hedden is a terrible madness.\u201d</p><p>The air shimmered next to Jean-Pierre. Medichi leaped back and brought his sword into his hand once more. Jean-Pierre did the same, but it was Parisa now wearing a loose blouse over her flight suit.</p><p>Medichi groaned and got rid of his sword.</p><p>Jean-Pierre folded his away as well. This time he moved in a circle, his eyes closed, his hands once more pressed against his head.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong? I was practicing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did fine. We\u2019re just on edge.\u201d To her mind he sent, Fiona, then gave a swift jerk of his head in Jean-Pierre\u2019s direction.</p><p>Jean-Pierre came to a stop next to Parisa. \u201cThorne said Rith tried to abduct you again. Is this true, cherie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s when I discovered I could dematerialize.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHave you tried to see the woman again, Fiona, with your voyeur window?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. She explained what had happened, that somehow Fiona had opened the window while they were in the Sedona canyon. She didn\u2019t tell him that Rith had hit her and for that, Medichi was grateful. \u201cDid Antony also tell you that I probably have a voyeur link with Greaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui. That you have headaches now when you try to see something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, exactly. So we\u2019re being careful how we use the window. We\u2019re only opening it once every half hour, very quickly so that I can see the windows and judge the light. Once the sun sets we can really narrow the location.\u201d She turned to Medichi.</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d Jean-Pierre asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe five minutes. Sorry. Wherever they are, it\u2019s still light out.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He looked up at the sky. \u201cWell, there is one thing for certain. She is not in France. It has been night there for hours now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Medichi met her gaze. \u201cWe could give it another shot, don\u2019t you think, Parisa?\u201d</p><p>She looked at Jean-Pierre and nodded. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>A sound erupted out of Jean-Pierre\u2019s throat, something between a huff and a cry. Before Medichi could stop him, he had grabbed Parisa and hauled her into his arms. He repeated, \u201cMerci\u201d over and over.</p><p>Medichi felt his nostrils fold inward and his hands bunch into fists. His brain shut down and all he could think was that another man had his hands on his woman. The sequence was irrational, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter.</p><p>\u201cTake your hands off her,\u201d rushed out of his throat, a throat that felt too small for the words. At the same, time he grabbed Jean-Pierre by the shoulders and started dragging him away from Parisa. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop that!\u201d came from Parisa. He froze. He stared down at her, his entire body immobile.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Antony?\u201d she cried. \u201cHe was thanking me. That\u2019s all. What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>But Jean-Pierre pulled away from her and started to laugh. He dropped to his knees and put his head in his hands and kept on laughing. This time, he repeated \u201cMon Dieu\u201d over and over, finally ending with, \u201cWe are in hell.\u201d</p> <p>Medichi just stared at him. Strange sensations flowed through his blood. He felt as though he\u2019d just faced a dozen death vampires. His arms and legs shook. \u201cThis is a nightmare,\u201d he cried. \u201cI was ready to kill you.\u201d</p><p>He walked in circles just as Jean-Pierre had. He couldn\u2019t look at Parisa for the longest time. When he\u2019d calmed down enough, he turned to her to apologize, but she held her fingers up to her lips and he knew she was smiling, even laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Medichi shouted. No man liked to be laughed at.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your cadroen?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He reached back but it was gone. What the hell had he done with his cadroen?</p> <p>Parisa approached him, smoothed his hair with her hands, then kissed him on the lips. He released a heavy sigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI hate to admit it but it\u2019s kind of sexy. You went wild there for a minute. I think you threw your cadroen so hard it landed in the pool, then you started tearing at your hair and growling. I don\u2019t mean to laugh. Really.\u201d She softened the blow of these words with another kiss on his lips.</p><p>Dammit, he\u2019d forgive her anything if she just kept kissing him. He slid his arms around her, yet he couldn\u2019t help but glare at Jean-Pierre over her shoulder. \u201cJust don\u2019t do that again, okay? Think what you would do if I hugged Fiona.\u201d</p><p>When a hard light entered Jean-Pierre\u2019s eye and he rose to his feet and lowered his chin, Medichi added, \u201cExactement, mon ami.\u201d</p><p>Parisa pulled back. She glanced at Jean-Pierre then rolled her eyes. \u201cAll right you two Neanderthals. Let me have a look.\u201d</p> <p>She closed her eyes and opened them a moment later. She shook her head. \u201cSorry, Jean-Pierre, it\u2019s still really light outside.\u201d</p><p>The afternoon wore on Parisa, partly because Jean-Pierre stayed on at the villa. She always knew when half an hour had passed between voyeur-peeks because whatever she was doing, whether working out with sword or dagger, or preparing dinner, or even napping, he came to her with such a stricken look that she didn\u2019t bother even asking what he wanted\u2014she simply opened her window, looked at the color of the sky, then shut it down.</p><p>At seven, Jean-Pierre finally left, folding to the Blood and Bite where all the Warriors of the Blood gathered before battling death vampires at the Borderlands. He had hated to leave, knowing that the hour was drawing close, but Thorne had made it clear that once Central had a fix on the women they would\u2014for this one critical mission\u2014leave the Borderlands as a unit, fold to the women, and take care of business. Colonel Seriffe was making arrangements to have large contingents of Militia Warriors ready to take their place until they returned.</p><p>Everything was set to go.</p><p>But by nine o\u2019clock, the sheer waiting had stripped her nerves raw. She wore her weapons harness, black cargo pants, and Nikes and paced the foyer. She opened her window every ten minutes now. Central\u2019s grid had the area of search down to one strip of longitude, because eleven hours had now passed since Parisa had first viewed the sunlit window. The earth moved, the sun shifted, and every place that night had begun to cover became one less possibility.</p><p>It was just a matter of time, maybe even minutes.</p><p>At nine forty-five, Parisa stood beside Antony in the foyer. He, too, wore battle gear. Thorne had let the warriors know it would be anytime now.</p><p>She opened the window.</p> <p>Antony had his phone to his ear, Carla at the ready.</p><p>And there it was, a beautiful violet and gray haze across the sky.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSunset,\u201d she cried.</p><p>Antony spoke into the phone. \u201cSunset, Carla.\u201d He smiled, but then even Parisa had heard her squealing.</p><p>Antony phoned Thorne, exchanged a few words, then tucked his phone into the narrow pocket of his battle kilt.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all waiting at the Cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAbout an hour ago, Thorne called Seriffe. Apparently there are now a hundred Militia Warriors stationed at every Borderland on Mortal Earth.\u201d</p><p>Parisa blinked. She was stunned. \u201cThat\u2019s five hundred warriors. Who\u2019s making the mist?\u201d If there were that many hunky warriors, in leather battle kilts and black leather wrist guards, hanging around various Metro Phoenix access points on Mortal Earth, then someone had to create a protective layer of mist. One of the big rules between Second Earth and Mortal Earth was keeping Second Society a secret.</p><p>Antony laughed. \u201cLeave it to you to be thinking about logistics. The truth is, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m guessing Endelle. Mist is one of her best things.\u201d</p><p>Parisa felt herself grow very still inside. \u201cThis is it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOur best shot. You ready to bring Fiona home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. I really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady to fold to the Cave?\u201d</p><p>This time it was her turn to smile. \u201cThanks for the warning.\u201d</p><p>The vibration began.</p><p>When her feet touched down, she glanced at all the men. One things was clear right away. The men had cleaned up. There was no blood spatter, no sweat among them.</p><p>Everyone was there ... except Jean-Pierre.</p><p>Jean-Pierre was still at his house. Thorne had made it possible for each warrior to shower, a kindness extended to the several frightened women who would hopefully soon be in their charge. Such victims did not need to see the results of their battling at the Borderlands. War was a dirty, sweaty, messy business after all was said and done.</p><p>He remained at his home in Sedona, which he had built next to Oak Creek. He stood beside the small wood bridge he\u2019d built. Stripped tree branches served as the railing, and hand-hewn planks for the curved arc of the base. His home was a rabbit warren, all wood and stone, with narrow connecting halls not much wider than the breadth of his shoulders. The entire house was built in sections from white oak. The floors were Brazilian rosewood because he liked the sweet smell when he worked the wood.</p><p>Alison would tell him the home was a form of therapy. Most certainly it was not a form of architecture. Probably just a look into his mind.</p><p>He shrugged. But he loved this home and now he had the darkest thoughts of all, that he would bring the woman here, the woman Fiona, the one he would meet in a few minutes, maybe hold in his arms.</p><p>He put a hand to his weapons harness just over his heart. He felt the hilt of one of the two daggers he carried. Within his chest, he felt a vibration, something holy and terrifying. What had been so empty for so long now filled with lightning. His heart jerked in response, and he couldn\u2019t breathe. Merde.</p><p>His knees felt weak, as if he\u2019d lost the tendons somewhere in the past few days.</p><p>Fiona.</p><p>Fiona.</p><p>Now his chest hurt when he thought of her and his head throbbed. Already, he despised the breh-hedden and he had only been its victim for such a short time. He patted the Velcro pocket of his kilt and felt the treasure hidden deep within, bound in soft layers of velvet. The locket. The one he had found at the base of the armoire in Toulouse, the one that held the scent of his woman, of Fiona. He would return it to her, even though part of him wanted to keep it forever.</p><p>He was so fucked.</p><p>He needed time to think before he got the call from Thorne saying that Central had found them, a call he expected any moment now. How was he supposed to keep a clear head when his body betrayed him like this?</p><p>He planted a hand on the end post of the bridge and sucked air through his nostrils. The smell of damp sycamore leaves rushed through his brain, that heavy scent, aromatic, clean. His mind felt clearer, sharper. Oui, he could think again. Un peu.</p><p>He straightened his shoulders.</p><p>He felt like a fool because he had laughed at the other men, at Kerrick, at Marcus, and once upon a time at Medichi, but that was before Parisa\u2019s abduction, long before, when the breh-hedden had smashed the tall warrior into the ground. Medichi had been a walking open wound even before the abduction of his woman.</p><p>Jean-Pierre would laugh no more. He could not even laugh at himself, and usually that was not a difficulty.</p><p>He just had not expected so much pain and such a fierce drive to be with a woman. He ached deep into his soul. His mind was possessed and his body weak in the knees. Again ... merde.</p><p>His phone buzzed against his waist. He slipped it from the narrow pocket of his battle kilt. His heart thundered, because he knew what was about to happen.</p><p>\u201cOui,\u201d he said, not thinking. He cursed again. He rarely answered his phone using any form of French.</p><p>\u201cWe have them.\u201d Thorne\u2019s voice, splintered like dry wood, grated his ear. \u201cCome to the Cave. Now.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre thumbed his phone and tucked it back into the pocket. He stared at his house, at the windows in various shapes and sizes, the backdrop of large sycamores. He had built the house in a grove of them. He had the horrible sensation, yet strangely exhilarating, that his life was about to change forever.</p><p>He closed his eyes and thought the thought. He moved through nether-space, through a fine rush of wind that wasn\u2019t wind. For a split second his body felt free, weightless, his mind at ease.</p><p>He landed in the Cave. Everyone was present. Parisa was armed for battle in a snug leather vest, buckled in places for fit, a single dagger hilt showing at her waist. Her breasts were too large to allow for more than one. Medichi stood close to her, his body touching hers, shoulder and hip, an arm across her back.</p><p>He looked intense and haunted, his eyes too bright.</p><p>Jean-Pierre had to look away. He understood.</p><p>Thorne was speaking but what was he saying? Yes. A battle plan.</p><p>New Zealand. The slaves were held in New Zealand. A place called Lower Hutt City Two, a rural location, very private, a few miles from Wellington Two, the capital, near the ocean. Same situation\u2014a double dome of mist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thorne divided all eight warriors, eight because Marcus would not be left out of the mission. There would be two groups of four, one group to come from the south, the other the north because who knew what they would find. Parisa had voyeured seven slaves, including Fiona, in the Toulouse farmhouse. But Santiago had found one of the slaves dead, a woman whose bracelet had said DOHNA, a Tibetan woman.</p><p>\u201cUnless Rith has added more females to his stable,\u201d Thorne said, his raspy voice cutting through the tension in the room, \u201cwe should find only six women.\u201d He met Jean-Pierre\u2019s gaze. \u201cI want you on point.\u201d His gaze shifted to Medichi. \u201cI don\u2019t like it that ascender Lovejoy is going. You know that. She may be good with a dagger, preternaturally good, but a sword can reach her as quick as lightning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d Medichi\u2019s voice had an edge.</p> <p>Jean-Pierre shifted his gaze to Kerrick, who stood with a very stiff jaw beside Marcus. Both seemed uneasy, rigid. Neither looked at Medichi. Jean-Pierre understood. They were an emerging brotherhood now, men who had brehs, treasures it would be too painful to lose. Had Marcus argued with Havily about coming on this rescue? Havily was not here. Did Marcus win an argument? Maybe Thorne would not allow it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Thorne\u2019s voice rumbled through the room once more.</p><p>Carla folded each group to opposite ends of the dome of mist. Jean-Pierre was with Medichi, Parisa, Santiago, and Zacharius. Thorne had Luken, Kerrick, and Marcus.</p><p>Jean-Pierre folded his sword into his hand the moment his feet touched solid earth. The sky was still partially light, which was good for battling. He spun in a circle, as did the other warriors. Even Parisa followed suit, her dagger in her hand, her shoulders hunched, knees bent. Merde, she behaved like a warrior, but then she had Medichi\u2019s battle memories now.</p><p>A strong breeze blew from offshore, carrying the smells of salt and fish. Medichi had his phone to his ear. He spoke softly then turned back to the group. \u201cThorne\u2019s in, near the barn. No sign of death vamps.\u201d</p> <p>He gestured to Santiago, who inclined his head, disappeared through the mist, then came back. He drew close. \u201cOne death vamp asleep by the door. His sword is on the ground.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre smiled.</p><p>Parisa spoke. \u201cLet me do it.\u201d</p><p>All the men turned to stare at her. Medichi started to protest, but she glared at him then lifted her dagger. \u201cIn the throat,\u201d she whispered softly, \u201cfor all the women drained of their blood. Give me this.\u201d</p><p>There was not a warrior present who did not know exactly how she felt.</p><p>Medichi glared at Parisa, but his entire body froze perhaps long enough for his rational mind to move to the front of his brain.</p> <p>Parisa added, \u201cI\u2019ll use my window first. I\u2019ll be careful but I need to do this.\u201d</p><p>Merde. Medichi was trembling, his sword flexing up and down, his knuckles white around the grip. But he nodded. \u201cYou go in, let the dagger fly, then come back out.\u201d</p><p>Parisa inclined her head.</p><p>Parisa turned in the direction of the mist. Dusk was settling deep now, the shadows everywhere a dark gray. She closed her eyes and opened her voyeur\u2019s window. She saw the death vamp in profile, sitting in a chair. He was snoring. No one else was around.</p><p>She shut the window down. She moved through the first dome of mist, the one made up of white crochet-like filaments. The second was the elegant blue-green. She passed through and there he was, a beautiful glorious creature, pale of complexion, black hair hanging loose and wavy to his shoulders, his chin buried in his chest. He wore leather flight gear, but no weapons harness. His chest was bare. She forgot her mission for a moment at the sight of him. His beauty was meant to enthrall, and she felt the tendrils of interest and attraction reach out to her even while the bastard slept.</p><p>Eff that. She hoped he was having pleasant dreams because these would be his last.</p><p>She understood one thing about having downloaded Antony\u2019s battle images\u2014to hesitate was to lose.</p><p>She felt Antony\u2019s muscles as she walked forward, the heaviness of them, in his tall warrior physique. The sense of him gave her strength and courage. Her fingers trembled, though. Too much adrenaline. She worked to breathe, to calm her heart.</p> <p>She stopped as the bastard jerked awake. Something must have disturbed him. Then she heard fighting beyond the house, on the other side. The death vampire rose to his feet, and suddenly his sword flew from the ground into his hand.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she called out. As he turned toward her, his sword still lax, she settled her gaze on his throat and let her dagger fly. She had speed and she had strength in her throw. Medichi was right\u2014she had a gift for dagger work. The blade was long and sank to the hilt, which meant it pierced the spine and went all the way through. The vamp crumpled where he stood, his sword falling from his hand.</p><p>She turned and fled back through the mist.</p><p>She caught Medichi\u2019s eye. She nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s down.\u201d</p><p>Medichi put his hands on her arms. \u201cYou\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but there\u2019s fighting on the other side of the property.\u201d How calm she sounded even to her own ears.</p><p>He released her arms and spoke to the group. \u201cForward.\u201d</p><p>In a swift, preternatural flow, the warriors moved into the mist. Medichi waited for them to pass, keeping his arm against Parisa\u2019s back. \u201cGet your dagger from the pretty-boy. Keep moving. Do you know where the slaves are being held?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Once they were on the other side of the blue-green mist, she glanced up at the second story. She recognized the row of windows from the outside. She pointed. \u201cUp there.\u201d</p><p>By now the warriors were running toward the back door of the house. She moved beside Antony until she reached the fallen death vampire. Antony bent down, but she touched his shoulder. \u201cLet me. I\u2019m the one who should do this. I killed him.\u201d She felt the imperative of it. She had done this thing. She had taken a life, however heinous it was. She needed to remove her blade.</p><p>She knelt down and had to push the death vampire\u2019s milky shoulder until he rolled onto his back. She moved to stand over him. His eyes were open but glassy. He was gone. So fast. She took the dagger by the hilt and withdrew the blade.</p><p>Her stomach turned. She shifted away from the body and almost threw up. She took deep breaths.</p><p>She felt Medichi\u2019s hand on her back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cIt happens to all of us, but we have to go. We have less than a minute to get this done. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She took one last deep breath and felt her stomach settle back into place. She wiped the blade on her black cargo pants, a movement she\u2019d seen in more than one of Antony\u2019s battle memories.</p><p>She rose up. Antony\u2019s gaze seemed to work in a complete circle, the upper half of his body whirling to keep track of the entire 360 panorama. She mimicked him as he moved to the back door, always checking her back trail.</p><p>She heard heavy battle sandals on the stairs. She followed the sound.</p><p>When she reached the steps, the front door was thrown wide and she had a view of the yard beyond\u2014and of Thorne\u2019s blade slicing through a death vampire. Blood flew. She turned away as another wave of nausea rolled through her.</p><p>She ran up the stairs. At the landing, off to her right, Santiago emerged from a room and thrust his chin in the opposite direction. To the left she saw Zacharius in the doorway. He spoke into the room, \u201cJean-Pierre, you all right? Shit.\u201d</p><p>Parisa hurried to the door. Jean-Pierre held Fiona in his arms and he was weeping. \u201cIs she dead?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head rapidly.</p><p>\u201cHurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know.\u201d</p><p>Parisa nodded. He was holding his breh, and overcome. Antony called from behind her. \u201cJean-Pierre, take her to the palace. Carla has Horace waiting for the women as well as a medical team. We\u2019ll follow. Thorne and his men are finishing up out front.\u201d Jean-Pierre vanished with Fiona. Parisa blinked\u2014just like that, the woman she had met such a short time ago was saved.</p><p>Santiago went to the end of the row of cots. The last cot was empty, perhaps originally intended for Dohna.</p><p>Paris turned to Medichi. \u201cWhere\u2019s Rith and the serving women?\u201d</p><p>He looked past her. \u201cZach, you see Rith?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. He had a woman in his arms. The insides of her elbows were taped up and her face was white, chalk white, ghost white. Oh, God. She struggled against him and cried out, \u201cNo ... no,\u201d but her voice was slurred. Yep, the women had been drugged.</p><p>\u201cTake her to the palace.\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded, then he was gone.</p><p>\u201cHow we doin\u2019?\u201d Thorne\u2019s voice boomed through the room.</p><p>Parisa turned back to look at him but Thorne\u2019s gaze shifted just past her shoulder then he cried out, \u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>Parisa had her dagger in her hand and didn\u2019t hesitate. Whatever was behind her was bad, the enemy. She whirled and thrust and there was Rith, a surprised look on his face as her blade slid into his stomach.</p><p>She withdrew, but not because she was squeamish. She withdrew to plunge again, moving into him this time, putting more force behind the blow. She withdrew the blade again. He stumbled backward, turned, and fell onto an empty cot. She followed after him and cried out, a harsh warrior cry. She started plunging the knife over and over and over until she felt gentle hands on her arms and Antony\u2019s voice in her ear. \u201cEase down, Parisa, he\u2019s gone. Ease down. That\u2019s it ... ease down.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and realized her blade wasn\u2019t buried in flesh but in the thin padding of a fairly nice camping cot. There was blood, however; Rith\u2019s blood. He may have dematerialized but she\u2019d hurt him.</p><p>She held her dagger up, her hand shaking.</p><p>Thorne\u2019s voice once more boomed the length of the room. \u201cLuken, take the next one. Santiago, there\u2019s one more past Medichi. Kerrick, okay, you\u2019ve got one. You\u2019re good. Back to the palace. Marcus. Good, you\u2019ve got the last one. At least I think it\u2019s the last one. Do we have all six?\u201d</p><p>Antony called back to him. \u201cYes. Jean-Pierre has Fiona. She went first.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here. One of the death vamps sent for reinforcements.\u201d</p><p>The next thing Parisa knew, she stood in the middle of a rotunda, the one where she\u2019d had her ascension ceremony. Her hand still shook, but she clutched her dagger hard in her fist.</p><p>The dagger was bloody and so was her fist.</p> <p>The funny thing was ... the funny things was ... she didn\u2019t react the way she\u2019d expected. She\u2019d thought she would feel dizzy, feel a need to vomit again, become hysterical. Instead her heart had settled down, and little by little her nerves grew steadier.</p><p>She held her free hand out and pictured Antony\u2019s sink in his master bathroom. She saw the black washcloth and thought the thought.</p><p>A vibration passed first through her mind, then her body. The next moment, like magic, she held the washcloth in her hand. She\u2019d accomplished another first\u2014she\u2019d folded something from one location to another.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Antony whispered. He now stood next to her. \u201cYou just folded that from where? My bathroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she responded. She wiped down the dagger very carefully. Santiago had given her the blade, and it was razor-sharp. She wiped until there wasn\u2019t a speck of blood on either edge or the point of the blade, then shoved it back into the space on her weapons harness. She stared at the hilt. The dagger had Santiago\u2019s signature, a small ruby embedded near the base of the hilt. She touched it, rubbed it, and was so glad she\u2019d taken the time to learn a skill that apparently she was really good at.</p> <p>But there was more, and she drew her shoulders back. She looked up at Antony. He stared at her hard.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t upset, are you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019d like to think that it will hit me later but I don\u2019t think it will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve trained a lot of Militia Warriors over the centuries, tens of thousands of them. I\u2019ve been with most of them after battle. Shit, Parisa, you\u2019re a goddamn warrior.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She smiled. \u201cEven though I almost threw up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, we\u2019ve all done that a few times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOver the centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He took her hands in his and held them aloft, glancing from one set of fingers to the other then back. \u201cYou\u2019re as calm as anything right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Is it because I downloaded your battle memories? Am I feeling what you feel?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so ... but I would never have thought this of you. You\u2019re a goddamn librarian.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cI know. With too big a chest to handle weapons with ease.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and then he drew her into his arms and hugged her. She released a sigh. Was this possible?</p><p>But as he kept his arms around her and she shifted her head, she caught sight of Fiona, who met her gaze. The woman\u2019s expression was ... blank. She had her arms around another of the blood slaves, a small woman whose stomach ... oh, God, she was pregnant. Maybe five or six months by the look of her. Tears streamed down her face.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cYes. Go,\u201d Antony said.</p><p>She looked up at him and he nodded, a frown between his brows. He shifted his gaze to Fiona and the woman. He drew in a stream of air. \u201cShit. She\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Parisa approached the pair and dropped to her knees in front of them. She had forgotten how beautiful Fiona\u2019s eyes were, slightly upturned and silvery blue, the color of Christmas ornaments. Her chestnut hair hung past her shoulders. \u201cYou found us,\u201d she said, but her cheeks had a sunken appearance and her complexion was very pale. She had been drained and revived how many days ago?</p><p>\u201cOf course we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened the first time? Why were they waiting for you? I wanted to tell you but I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d been drugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s okay. They knew we were coming because Commander Greaves has a voyeur-link with me but we figured it out and played him.\u201d</p><p>Fiona nodded, her hand moving in slow motion up and down the woman\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Parisa glanced at her. \u201cHow long has she been in the facility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days.\u201d She hugged her closer, kissed the top of her head. The woman burrowed her face into her neck. Her tears hadn\u2019t stopped.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me, Fiona, whether or not you\u2019re ascended? You said you were from Boston\u2014was that Mortal Earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was taken from Mortal Earth, and the best I can figure is that we\u2019re all partially ascended. We can survive on Second Earth, but none of the blood slaves has ever had vampire fangs.\u201d She looked around. \u201cI was kind of hoping that there was another woman already here, waiting for us. She was Tibetan and she wore a bracelet with her name printed in English letters\u2014Dohna? Did you find her in Toulouse?\u201d</p><p>Parisa\u2019s shoulders sagged. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but she died that day. She was gone by the time we got there. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Fiona looked beyond Parisa\u2019s shoulder, but not at anything in particular. \u201cI lost so many over the years,\u201d she murmured. \u201cHundreds over the decades.\u201d She blinked then glanced around. \u201cSo where exactly are we? What is this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadame Endelle\u2019s palace?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou mean the palace of the Supreme High Administrator?\u201d</p><p>Parisa nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, that is something.\u201d She looked around once more, still stroking the woman\u2019s arm. \u201cShe\u2019s not here then?\u201d</p><p>Parisa turned and ran her gaze through the room as well. \u201cNo, but you won\u2019t mistake her when she arrives. She\u2019s very tall, imposing, and...\u201d She struggled for the right word. \u201c... fashion-challenged.\u201d</p><p>Fiona didn\u2019t smile, she just nodded. \u201cCan you tell me something? What are these men exactly? They ... well, they\u2019re all so big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarriors of the Blood.\u201d</p><p>Once again her eyes widened. \u201cYou mean, the Warriors of the Blood, the ones known as Guardians of Ascension of Second Earth, came to get us out of that place?\u201d</p><p>At this point, Parisa realized that the pregnant woman had finally grown quiet. She was watching Parisa carefully from red-rimmed eyes and a swollen nose.</p><p>Parisa couldn\u2019t help but smile, though, at Fiona\u2019s astonishment. Maybe Fiona could be awestruck, but Parisa\u2019s introduction to the warriors, especially Medichi, had been so, well, earthy, that she couldn\u2019t summon the same kind of hero worship. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t the warriors have come for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve known for decades that they were all that stood between Greaves and a takeover not just of Second Earth but of Mortal Earth as well. Knowing that they took the time to rescue us\u2014that\u2019s something. I won\u2019t soon forget this.\u201d</p><p>Parisa thought of Jean-Pierre and of his certainty that this woman was his breh. She wondered what Fiona would say to that if she knew. She\u2019d probably be stunned.</p><p>Still, it was hardly something she needed to share immediately, and she did want to tell Fiona about the Warriors of the Blood. \u201cThey\u2019re good men. Honorable. They didn\u2019t know, none of us knew, that Greaves was doing this, enslaving women to provide dying blood for his death vampires. Although it certainly makes sense. But though there have been rumors for decades, until you somehow escaped the basement that day and came to me while I sat beneath the tamarind tree, Greaves and Rith had kept his operation a secret.\u201d</p><p>Fiona nodded, tears in her eyes. \u201cThank you, Parisa. Thank you for coming for me. I would have died soon. I know that now. I really had lost all hope. But why were you there in that garden, held prisoner in that house? When I saw you, I thought you were Rith\u2019s wife or something.\u201d</p><p>At that, Parisa laughed. \u201cOh, God no. He abducted me from Warrior Medichi\u2019s villa three months ago. I was as much a captive as you. I just wasn\u2019t being used as a blood slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blood slave.\u201d Her gaze grew unfocused again. And once more she looked around. She frowned slightly.</p><p>Parisa turned to see what she was looking at. Ah, Jean-Pierre, and he didn\u2019t look happy. His arms were crossed over his chest, his brows low on his forehead.</p><p>Fiona glanced at Parisa then back to Jean-Pierre. She asked very quietly, \u201cDo you know why that warrior is staring at me? He looks angry.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he was angry, and yes, Parisa knew why he stared at Fiona, but she wasn\u2019t about to start explaining the breh-hedden to the recently freed captive.</p><p>However, there was one truth she could relay. \u201cWe have all been so worried about you and the other women, especially when we found that your Dohna had not survived. Warrior Jean-Pierre took it especially hard. He was there when Rith folded you out of the back bedroom in France. He\u2019s been furious since that he couldn\u2019t prevent it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were we just now, that house I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you believe outside the capital of New Zealand Two?\u201d</p><p>For some reason Fiona laughed. \u201cHow strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long had you been in Burma? In that house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean all these years, all these decades, that\u2019s all you\u2019ve ever known?\u201d She was shocked.</p><p>Fiona nodded. \u201cWe were allowed exercise in the garden until, well, three months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiona, how on earth did you survive? I felt like I was going mad.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head back and forth. \u201cI don\u2019t know. For a long time I held out hope that I would see my family again, my husband, my two children. The day I ... begged for your help would have been my daughter\u2019s birthday. I went crazy. I knocked one of the medical technicians out cold and escaped to the garden and there you were. They put me through death and resurrection right after as a punishment. It was too soon, only two weeks, it was hard to survive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I watched. I didn\u2019t expect you to come back from that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou saw me?\u201d Fiona asked. \u201cOh, yes, now I remember. You were there. I felt you.\u201d</p><p>Parisa nodded. \u201cHow did you find the strength to come back?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI truly had made up my mind to die, but at the point of death I think I met an angel, albeit a rather strange one. His name was James. He encouraged me to keep going.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJames? His name was James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Parisa felt a shiver cross her shoulders. \u201cAlison knows someone called James. He encouraged her in a very similar way.\u201d Was it possible it was the same man, the same ascender?</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Alison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlison is only recently ascended. She\u2019s bonded with, um\u2014\u201d Parisa glanced around. Behind her, sitting on one of the terraces with Luken, was Kerrick. \u201cThere. Do you see the black-haired warrior? Alison is his ... breh. That\u2019s another word for a special mate. More than a wife. A man can be a breh as well. Alison is ... very powerful in this world. She\u2019s also ... oh, there she is.\u201d She materialized next to Kerrick and soon after put her hand on her stomach and winced.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s very pregnant.\u201d</p><p>At that, the young woman beside Fiona lifted her tear-stained face. Alison was beside Kerrick, a hand on his shoulder. He stood up and put his arms around her. He appeared to be whispering to her, and Alison patted his arm and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so tender with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d Parisa said. \u201cShe\u2019s not doing very well right now with her pregnancy. The doctor assures her she\u2019s fine, but you can see she\u2019s suffering. She always has her hand to her stomach. She\u2019s a healer ... of the mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf the mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she was a therapist on Mortal Earth.\u201d</p> <p>Alison closed her eyes and appeared to be trying to relax. After a moment, she patted Kerrick and crossed the thirty feet or so in Parisa\u2019s direction. Parisa rose, weaving a little; she had been too long on her knees. The marble was hard.</p><p>Parisa introduced Alison to Fiona. Fiona introduced Kaitlyn, of Lake City, Florida, Mortal Earth. With Alison so close, Parisa drew back and gave her space to work. She asked questions of both Fiona and Kaitlyn, how they were feeling in general. There was something so kind in her tone that both women relaxed.</p><p>A minute later she called the healer Horace over, which was Parisa\u2019s cue to return to Antony. There would be plenty of time later to get to know Fiona and perhaps all the women.</p><p>Jean-Pierre drew close. \u201cHow is she doing?\u201d His arms were still crossed over his chest, the lean corded muscles straining. His hands made fists, released, then made fists again. He still scowled.</p><p>\u201cShe seems very calm. She was really surprised to learn that the Warriors of the Blood had come for them, and it\u2019s obvious to me that she\u2019s been a huge support to the other women. Also, she just told me that from the time she was taken from Mortal Earth she\u2019d only known the Burma house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Christ,\u201d Antony muttered.</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d Parisa said.</p><p>Jean-Pierre responded with a low growl from deep within his throat.</p> <p>The truth changes everything</p><p>But freedom comes through application.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Endelle never allowed anyone within her private sanctuary, her meditation room, that place where she hunted Greaves in the darkening.</p><p>Not even Thorne, her second-in-command, the man she trusted the most.</p><p>But here she was sitting on the edge of her chaise-longue staring at two men; one fucking unfamiliar to her, short, with gray hair, gray hair! And the other man she intended to slaughter with a quick snap of her wrist and a powerful roll of a hand-blast\u2014Leto, the traitorous motherfuckingsonofabitch.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate. Leto deserved to die so she flicked her most powerful hand-blast, not caring in this moment that according to Alison, he was a spy. A spy for whom?</p><p>\u201cDie, asshole,\u201d she cried.</p><p>He flinched but for some reason, the stream of power that should have fried his ass hit the space around him and split into a number of elegant fireworks: blue, green, violet sparkles, really beautiful.</p><p>That Leto\u2019s eyebrows climbed his handsome forehead and his mouth opened in a big round O meant he\u2019d expected to take the hit, maybe even to die.</p><p>Which meant ...</p><p>She shifted her gaze to the short man to Leto\u2019s left and scowled. She rose to her full six-foot-five height, plus her five-inch stilettos, and stared down at the fucking bastard who had just robbed her of a very satisfying kill. \u201cWho the fuck are you and why did you just protect this traitor and how the hell did you get into my inner sanctuary and why, if you have so much power, do you have gray hair?\u201d</p><p>The man looked very strange\u2014or at least his expression became quite odd, for a short man. His eyelids grew heavy as he stared at her chest then slowly lifted his gaze, up and up, to meet hers. Damn he was short\u2014five foot seven if he was an inch. \u201cOh, I haven\u2019t been into your inner sanctuary ... yet.\u201d</p><p>She could not mistake his meaning.</p><p>Her mouth fell open, flat open, almost to the floor. \u201cYou have got to be kidding me, Shorty. The day you see my inner sanctum is the day I mop the floor with your face\u2014with one hand tied behind my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see both your hands tied behind your back. Then I\u2019d have a good long look at your inner sanctum.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. This asshole was either really confident or really stupid. He smiled, and something in that smile made her uneasy. Well, she didn\u2019t think he was stupid, which meant ...</p><p>She looked at him again. She pushed against his mind, wanting, needing to understand who the hell he was and why he had enough power to invade her space, bringing Leto of all assholes with him, and how he\u2019d been able to deflect a hand-blast like that. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d</p><p>Well, fuck! James at last! \u201cAlison\u2019s James? Fuck. The one she dreamed about all those months ago? The one she still talks to mind-to-mind occasionally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a yes and another yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re from fucking Sixth Earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the hell do you have gray hair? No one has gray hair, not even on Second.\u201d She knew there were much more important matters to be discussed but really, gray hair?</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThe only way the Council would permit me to intervene as I have\u2014and yes, I only have a few moments left in this interview\u2014was if I appeared as harmless as possible. And no, I did not design the appearance I currently display. It was designed for me.\u201d Shorty seemed a little bitter.</p><p>She nodded as though his explanation made perfect sense. Oh, hell, since he was from Sixth, he could probably appear in the guise of a troll or an asteroid if he wanted to. But right now she had one fucking question he\u2019d better answer. \u201cWho the hell has held up my ascension? I should be in Fourth by now, at the very least. Maybe even Fifth. Why have I been stuck in this God-forsaken, shit-eating dimension for all these millennia?\u201d</p><p>That smile appeared again, the one that looked both bemused and pleased as hell. \u201cI have a message for you from Braulio.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have heard right. Braulio was the most powerful Warrior of the Blood ever to battle on Second Earth. He was a legend in his time and she had seen him die, struck down, sliced up by a death vampire. That had been five thousand years ago and Endelle had killed the vampire afterward, but Braulio was still dead.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get your facts straight, Shorty. Braulio died. I watched him die.\u201d</p><p>James shook his head but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me he\u2019s alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>At that, her knees gave way and she fell straight down, not onto the chaise-longue, but straight on her ass on the cold marble floor. \u201cHe\u2019s dead. That bastard is dead. I saw him die.\u201d Shit, her eyes grew stinging hot.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dead.\u201d James ground his teeth.</p><p>\u201cI watched him die.\u201d If there\u2019d ever been a man for her, he\u2019d been the one. But when he\u2019d died, she\u2019d given up the hope that Second Earth could ever hold any joy for her, any real pleasure. She\u2019d wised up, then she\u2019d toughened up. But Braulio alive? Shit. Her head wagged back and forth.</p><p>\u201cLuchianne pulled him into Third and healed him. It was against the rules but she did it anyway. She\u2019s only done it one other time ... for me. So I know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>She remained sitting on the floor, the marble cold through her linen gown. \u201cSweet Jesus, Braulio alive.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to think about him, not about him. He was the finest warrior who had ever lived and she\u2019d grieved his death thousands of years ago. If she could admit the truth to herself, there was a small slice of her heart that still hurt. So, yeah, shit!</p><p>She stared at James for a long hard moment. \u201cLet\u2019s say I believe you. What the hell is this message he has for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere it is, word for word. Hang in there ... I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean, I\u2019m coming? You mean like the second coming of Christ?\u201d She laughed at her joke, but James\u2019s blue eyes looked serious as hell.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming back for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen? When the fuck when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear the time that Alison assembles her team and opens the pathway to the third dimension, he\u2019s coming back for you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been right, the second coming of Christ. She laughed, and yeah, her voice sounded bitter.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t believe him, but she didn\u2019t fucking believe him. You didn\u2019t get to be nine thousand years old without understanding a lot about life and all this dimensional shit. Politics had always been, would always be, the order of the day\u2014who could gain as much power as possible first so he, or sometimes she, could piss on everyone else. When Owen Stannett had stood in her office a few days ago and made his little speech about \u201ctaking it deep,\u201d she knew exactly what he meant. She might hate the bastard, but she sure as hell understood something of what he\u2019d endured over the centuries. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So fuck her but she was just a little fucking skeptical.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Shorty.\u201d She used a little old-fashioned levitation to gain her feet since there was nothing pretty about trying to create leverage with a stiletto.</p><p>She planted her hands on her hips and stared down at James again. \u201cNo disrespect intended, but I\u2019ll believe the whole Braulio thing when I see him. Right now we have other fish-ass to fry. When Alison first told me about you and ... him\u201d\u2014she jerked her thumb at Leto\u2014\u201cI thought maybe we were going to see some real action, get some real help. Hah. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed but according to the future streams we\u2019ve got one assfucking coming any minute now and I ain\u2019t got the troops to pull off a win here.

When has a pregnant woman ever been fit to beat down the gates of Hades?\u201d</p> <p>The expression that overcame James\u2019s face made her frown. She didn\u2019t understand what she was seeing. His light blue eyes seemed full of clouds. He smiled but it wasn\u2019t a smile. He looked lit up with a thousand lightning strikes. She almost thought she was looking at some bizarre version of ... affection ... but that was just stupid. He also didn\u2019t look like he was going to give an answer to what was for her a really serious question.</p><p>What-the-fuck-ever.</p><p>The clouds disappeared and the blue of James\u2019s eyes returned, but he shifted his gaze downward to the marble floor at his feet. He blinked several times. His attention seemed focused elsewhere. Maybe he was thinking or maybe someone from Sixth was shouting into his head. She\u2019d like to shout. She\u2019d like to shout at this Council he referred to until she was as hoarse as a nymph servicing Zeus himself.</p><p>Finally, he met her gaze again. \u201cI can\u2019t give you a definitive answer. What I can tell you is that the Seers of Sixth still predict that Alison opens the pathway to Third\u2014but other futures, darker possibilities, have been predicted as well. This is a delicate time in the history of the dimensional worlds, and the hour of fulfillment draws near. You must be careful, Madame Endelle. I beg above all things that you will be careful. Some of our Seers have also foreseen the demise of Second Earth, a fall to the Commander that will last longer than a hundred thousand years.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward. \u201cThen help us, goddammit! Give us what we need to get rid of this bastard forever!\u201d</p> <p>She felt the heat in her face. If she felt even a little more than she did right now, she was certain she would pop some blood vessels in her eyes.</p><p>James appeared to grow an inch or two, or maybe he was just lifting up on his heels. His nostrils flared. \u201cDon\u2019t think for a moment I haven\u2019t considered it, not just for Second but for Third as well. The Council, for all its preternatural power, is weak, ineffectual. They can move mountains but they will not help the human soul.\u201d</p><p>Endelle closed her eyes. A great wind filled the room, emanating from the Sixth dweller himself. She took a peek and found Leto crumpled on the floor, shielding his head and face with both arms. More of that lightning had appeared in James\u2019s eyes, but he finally closed them. He grew calmer and the wind eased.</p><p>Sweet Jesus, Mary Mother of God, and all the Disciples thrown in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be disciplined for most of what I\u2019ve just said to you. I beg your pardon. I allowed my frustrations to speak.\u201d He gestured to Leto. \u201cI want him kept alive, and that means that when the time comes you will offer your protection. For now, he goes back, but not without relaying to you the information he came to give.\u201d He turned to Leto. \u201cTell her what you told me then return to the Commander\u2019s Estrella Mountain compound. If you fear for your life at any moment, I have given you a trace back to this room, and no one will be able to follow you. But for God\u2019s sake, man, don\u2019t use it unless you are about to die.\u201d</p><p>The light blue eyes were now a strange brown color and flashing wildly. He lifted an arm. The wind swirled once more through the room; thunder sounded as he vanished. Her hearing disappeared for a moment until her eardrums released a nice pop. Wow.</p> <p>\u201cWhat an exit,\u201d she cried.</p><p>She blinked a few times then turned her attention to Leto. He was a former Warrior of the Blood who had defected a century ago. His turning had put a hole in her heart, but now it would appear she really had been wrong about him all this time. Her first inkling had come when Alison fought him in an arena battle. Once Alison had subdued him, he had allowed her to dive into his mind. There she\u2019d found this supposed truth about him: that he\u2019d been serving as a spy for decades and he answered to James. If Leto was coming forward now, it put him in severe jeopardy. If Greaves ever found that he\u2019d communicated with Endelle, he was toast.</p><p>He rose to his feet, a little unsteady, but he crossed the small rotunda and offered her his hand. She took it.</p><p>In her stilettos she was still taller than Leto so that she looked down at him. His gaze flew over her hair. From her peripheral she could see that it writhed.</p><p>She rolled her eyes and calmed the hell down. Her hair settled down as well. \u201cUsually I can control it but I\u2019m upset right now. So, Warrior, are you telling me you didn\u2019t desert me?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and tears filled his eyes. \u201cI would never have done so without cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames approached me. Greaves is very powerful, and the Sixth Dimension Council needed access.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlison told me but I never stopped being mad about it. I didn\u2019t even believe it. Fuck. All right. Whatever. So what is it he wanted you to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, James voyeured the extraction in New Zealand, so I know the first group has been brought safely here to your palace. But what you need to know is that Greaves has twenty-one additional death and resurrection facilities around the world. Rith heads them all. Essentially, Rith runs the organization. Also, Fiona was his first successful experiment during a time well before proper sterilization methods were employed or before electricity was used to revive the heart. Because of her ability to recover, she became his guinea pig.</p><p>\u201cMore generally, Sixth brought me on board because the Council needed to know the breadth of his power as well as the nature of his plans. Greaves apparently has some fourth dimensional abilities, one of which allows him to shield his operations from Sixth Earth. But in order to intervene, Sixth needs incontrovertible proof. I\u2019ve been transmitting evidence for years.\u201d He looked weary, painfully weary. He had intense blue eyes but they were shadowed now. He was just short of Medichi\u2019s height, and his shoulders were as broad as Kerrick\u2019s. He had long black hair, which he still wore in the cadroen. All these years she thought he\u2019d kept wearing it as a fuck-you to her and to the Warriors of the Blood. Now she thought it might have a different meaning altogether.</p><p>\u201cBut Sixth won\u2019t help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what they plan to do. James has let a few things slip over the years. Things are not well in the Upper Dimension. Apparently, if Greaves gains a foothold here and succeeds in dominating Second and Mortal Earth, he creates a domino effect that moves upward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that even fucking possible?\u201d She moved in a circle now, around Leto. She pulled at her hair. \u201cAnd how about we add just a little more pressure to this situation?\u201d She shook her fist at the ceiling, \u201cThanks for nothing, assholes!\u201d</p><p>Leto chuckled. \u201cYou really think that\u2019s going to help?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWell, it helps me.\u201d</p><p>Goddammit.</p><p>Fiona knew she should feel something other than what she did. She should be ecstatic, right? She should feel relieved, right? Happy, delirious, exhilarated? Right?</p><p>All she felt was numb, even cold.</p><p>Of course her blood hadn\u2019t entirely regenerated since the recent drain. There was always a lag time.</p><p>Still. She\u2019d been rescued, taken out of the hands of that quiet monster, Rith, out of the service of the self-styled Commander, out of continued blood slavery.</p><p>The healer, Horace, had his hand on Kaitlyn\u2019s head; Alison held her hands. She was in shock and not doing well. Her abduction was only part of the reason she was listing in the direction of death. Her husband and young son had been murdered in front of her by death vampires. She had been next in line to drain, as well, and Rith hadn\u2019t withheld the truth; she would lose the baby once she completed her first D&amp;R.</p><p>It was all too much. She honestly didn\u2019t know, despite the efforts of the healers, whether the woman would make it, but it didn\u2019t look good. The one thing Fiona had gotten really good at was predicting with fair accuracy the length of a woman\u2019s life as a blood slave.</p><p>She rose to her feet and moved to stand at the far terrace, far away from the other blood slaves and from the warriors. Looking back into the rotunda, she caught glimpses of other enormous round rooms, all sparsely furnished but made of beautiful white marble, streaked with gold, very much like a palace. Why were the spaces so empty? What did that mean?</p><p>Sconces lit each rotunda at four-foot intervals.</p><p>At least there was fresh air flowing in from the open walls, but because it was night, there was just an impression of blackness beyond.</p><p>September in Phoenix. She expected it to be hotter, but as she drew closer to the opening she felt the cool air blowing down from the ceiling, creating a shield between the heat and the comfortable indoors.</p><p>She passed through the shield into the starry night. She couldn\u2019t see very much, just open land for what seemed like miles, dark clumps, maybe cactus. In the distance there was the glitter of buildings, perhaps the center of this dimension\u2019s Metro Phoenix.</p><p>Rith had kept the women informed over the decades: where they were, what was happening in each dimension, how many dimensions there were. He\u2019d at least provided them with books to read. She had wanted to marvel at all that she learned, but because she\u2019d been a prisoner and her blood drained from her body every month, she fell short of being able to work up enthusiasm for things she believed she would never see, never experience. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now here she was looking at the Sonoran Desert and thousands of stars overhead. Rith had allowed television once a month for half an hour, selected at random. Last month, the slaves saw a really weird cartoon featuring a character called SpongeBob; the previous month, half an hour in the middle of a movie starring a very handsome young man\u2014On the Waterfront. She would like to see more movies, complete movies and definitely more television.</p><p>She heard a soft scrape of marble underfoot just behind her. She turned and hunched, her hands outstretched, ready to fight ... but it was the warrior, the one called Jean-Pierre, the one who seemed so angry, the one who had brought her to the palace. Yes, she remembered now. She\u2019d been dizzy with drugs, but now she remembered.</p><p>He held up his hands as if in surrender. \u201cI would not harm you,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He had a beautiful French accent.</p><p>She lowered her hands and straightened. \u201cNo, of course not. I\u2019m not quite myself. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She wanted coffee suddenly, a very strong cup of coffee with milk, maybe even cream. She shifted to stand beside him so that she could see his face. The light from the rotunda revealed the most beautiful eyes, not gray, not green, but a blend. He had thick dark lashes as well that enhanced the color of his eyes. His lips were very unusual. The lower was full and sensual and the upper came to exotic points. She had the strangest urge to run a finger over his lips, and for some reason the thought lit her body in a way she had not experienced in a very, very long time.</p><p>Oh, God. She desired this man, this warrior. She began to ache very low and a blush warmed her cheeks.</p><p>His nostrils flared and his lips parted. \u201cMon Dieu,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>She returned to stand by the balustrade, afraid of what she was feeling. More than anything, such a reaction seemed completely inappropriate. She shifted her gaze back to the desert, the dark sky, and the stars. The air was very dry, which was so different from both Burma and New Zealand.</p><p>\u201cFiona,\u201d he said very softly, his voice a caress. He had moved closer. She could feel the heat of his body behind her. \u201cI have something for you. At least, I am almost certain it belongs to you.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to him. The light from the rotunda cast his face in shadow. His hand was outstretched, and as he turned so that the light would cross his arm, something small and gold glinted in his palm. She drew in a soft breath. He held the one thing, the only thing she\u2019d been able to keep, all these years, from her life in Boston in the late 1800s. She couldn\u2019t withhold a small cry.</p><p>Her gold locket.</p><p>She knew where she\u2019d hidden it\u2014behind the armoire, on the carpet. But she had been drugged when she left that house. When she awoke on the cot in the unfamiliar house, her first thought had been that she would never see her locket again. She had wept.</p><p>Now as if by some extraordinary miracle, the warrior called Jean-Pierre, who had a lovely French accent, held her only cherished possession.</p> <p>She took it from him with trembling fingers. \u201cMerci,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She opened the locket and there they were, portraits of her lost family, long since dead after so many decades: husband, daughter, son.</p><p>For a reason she could not explain, she drew close to Jean-Pierre, shifting to stand in the shadow of his shoulder. She flattened the locket on her palm and held it slanted toward the light so that he could see.</p><p>\u201cMy husband. He gave this to me the day before I was abducted. Our eleventh anniversary. These were my children. My son Peter\u2014oh, that\u2019s your name, Pierre, isn\u2019t it? And this was my daughter, Carolyn.\u201d Her heart felt as if a stone had formed at the very base. She hurt.</p><p>\u201cI always regretted that I did not have a family,\u201d he said. \u201cI was married once, but it was not a good marriage. Then the revolution came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe French Revolution?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, smiling faintly. \u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very old then.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed and the gleam in his eyes, the humor, eased something in her chest, made the stone in her heart not quite so heavy. He turned back to look into the rotunda. \u201cDo you see the warrior there, with hair just past his shoulders, dark brown hair, his eyebrows slashed over his eyes? Yes?\u201d</p><p>Fiona saw him. \u201cOui,\u201d she said.</p><p>He met her gaze and smiled. \u201cThank you for saying oui.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as well. She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved the French language. My grandfather was French, but I\u2019m not fluent, unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>He held her gaze for a very long time, and for some reason a desire for coffee once more drifted through her. A very strange sensation. He seemed to give himself a little shake then said, \u201cThat man is Warrior Marcus. He is four thousand years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre shrugged. \u201cWarrior Medichi, standing with his arms around Parisa, is out of Italy in the 700s. Warrior Thorne, who has his fist wrapped around a tumbler of vodka, is two thousand years old. I am the youngest of them all.\u201d</p><p>She felt her palm folding around the locket and glanced at her fist, the gold chain dangling down. The stone felt heavy again. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do now?\u201d she asked. She looked at the marble and saw splashes of water, single drops one after the next. It couldn\u2019t be raining. She hadn\u2019t seen a cloud in the sky. Oh, the drops were her tears. When had she started to weep?</p><p>She felt his arm slide around her shoulders. He pulled her close to his chest and she let him, though she couldn\u2019t say why. It just felt so right.</p><p>He smelled so wonderful, as though he had spilled some coffee on the leather of his weapons harness or on his skin. She was tall for a woman, and her nose nestled against his neck. How odd that she trusted him like this, without knowing him. But then he\u2019d carried her away from that house of torture, away from Rith, and death, and slavery. Why wouldn\u2019t she trust him?</p><p>And he had brought her the thing she cherished most in the world\u2014her locket.</p><p>She wept anew.</p><p>Jean-Pierre held heaven in his arms. His heart pounded in his ears. All he heard was thump, thump, thump. Desire flowed over his body, waves one after the other, washing over him, receding, only to crash again.</p><p>Was he holding her too tightly?</p><p>Was she falling out of his arms because he wasn\u2019t holding her tightly enough?</p><p>He could not tell.</p><p>He was lost in the sensation of her nearness, her quiet sobs, the grief she had lived with for over a century.</p><p>He heard voices behind him, gentle voices, the kind that belonged to healers. He wasn\u2019t surprised when Alison addressed him. \u201cJean-Pierre, Horace and I think the women should go to the hospital for a day or so. I\u2019ve contacted Colonel Seriffe and he\u2019s going to send several squads of Militia Warriors to guard them in case Rith tries to reacquire them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBon,\u201d he murmured. But he did not want to let the woman go.</p><p>Alison put a hand on Fiona\u2019s back. \u201cWe think you should go as well, Fiona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, Fiona withdrew from him and moved back inside. She did not look back, which was just as well. She must still be in shock. Both Horace and Alison followed behind her. He did not wait too long before returning to the rotunda as well.</p><p>His gaze, however, remained fixed on the back of Fiona\u2019s head. He watched her like a hawk after prey, except that she was not prey. She was the woman meant for him, his breh. Already the bonds were forming, tightening. He could feel them, and for a moment he could not breathe.</p><p>She returned to Kaitlyn, the young one pregnant with child. She helped her to her feet but the woman collapsed. They were both surrounded very quickly, healers anxious to help. Within less than a minute, a medical team had the pregnant woman on a gurney and was rolling her in the direction of the east entrance, where a long, long drive led to the valley floor below.</p><p>He did not attempt to follow. He remained in the center of the rotunda, alone, bereft, and angry, such a strange combination of emotions. But above all he did not wish to be with the woman Fiona, he did not wish for this entanglement and bonding. Whatever the breh-hedden might be, he knew in the depth of his soul that this was not the right path for him. He loved the company of women, a lot of women, and he was a warrior. Why did he need anything else?</p><p>Fiona would have a new life here, but that did not mean he had to be part of it. He was a Warrior of the Blood, and his duties would always keep him at the Borderlands, battling death vampires. Fiona\u2019s path lay elsewhere.</p><p>The difficulty seemed to be, as he breathed in through flared nostrils, he could scent her on his skin, the sweet smell of croissants, the heady aroma of a boulangerie.</p><p>But the scent would fade. In time, as she left his warrior world, he could forget her as well.</p><p>Medichi had his arm around Parisa\u2019s shoulders. He watched the last of the women being transported to the hospital, not by folding, but by ambulance. He felt peaceful and full, like he\u2019d feasted at a banquet, an odd sensation, but it felt right.</p><p>They\u2019d brought the women home. They\u2019d done some good. Six women and a baby would survive now because of Parisa.</p><p>The healers departed.</p><p>Kerrick had his arm around Alison as they dematerialized together. Then Marcus and Havily. Havily had apparently taken a break from her nightly darkening work with Endelle to meet the survivors and offer what comfort she could.</p><p>One by one, the warriors folded away, heading with Thorne to the Blood and Bite for a drink before taking up arms at the Borderlands again.</p><p>Endelle never did emerge from her meditation room. She hadn\u2019t stopped working in the darkening long enough to come and see the women.</p><p>Jean-Pierre was the only warrior left in the rotunda. He stood off to the side, his expression blank, eyes hollow, lost. He looked like a man with nowhere to go. He\u2019d brought his breh back to safety, and now she was headed to the hospital.</p><p>Medichi whispered to Parisa, \u201cShall we try to comfort him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d</p><p>He let his arm slide off her shoulder, but not without his fingers catching and pressing her arm. He followed her to the Frenchman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJean-Pierre,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He turned toward her, his brow furrowed, eyes full of pain. \u201cCherie?\u201d he murmured. He didn\u2019t appear to have heard her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said again, but before he could stop her, she slid an arm around his neck and hugged him.</p> <p>Both of his arms found her back.</p><p>Medichi felt the deep growl form in his throat, an ancient response he tried hard to control. Earlier, at the villa, he\u2019d almost gone mad when Jean-Pierre had dared to hug Parisa, but something in the expression of the warrior\u2019s eyes, so full of pain as though he\u2019d had his heart ripped from his chest, stopped him. He didn\u2019t like that another man was touching his woman but the part of him that could think, that could recognize his warrior brother was hurting\u2014well, that man crossed his arms over his chest, and hid his clenched fists beneath those arms.</p><p>Jean-Pierre met his gaze. He began to smile as though he realized what he was doing. Maybe it was something that he saw on Medichi\u2019s face, but Jean-Pierre flipped him off with Parisa still in his arms.</p><p>It was so Jean-Pierre. Medichi wasn\u2019t surprised that a moment later, he released Parisa, then without a word lifted his arm and vanished.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Parisa cried. \u201cI wish you boys would give a girl a warning. That just creeps me out. One minute he\u2019s hugging me and the next, poof, he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p> <p>She turned to face Medichi but he still had his arms crossed. She looked at his arms, then up at his face, and rolled her eyes. \u201cAre you kidding me? You\u2019re mad because I hugged Jean-Pierre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh ... yeah. New dimension here. Vampires. Warrior, caught in the breh-hedden.\u201d</p><p>But Parisa shook her head, chuckled, then walked toward him in a way that meant if he didn\u2019t unfold his stubborn arms she was going to bang her head against them. What do you know, his arms opened like automatic sliding doors. He wrapped her up and a wave of something very close to his earlier sense of peace flowed through his chest. He couldn\u2019t believe he was feeling like this\u2014almost ... happy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you\u201d were the first words that left his lips.</p><p>She wiggled to free herself enough to look up at him. \u201cWe brought them home, Antony.\u201d Then she smiled even though tears flooded her eyes. \u201cWe brought them home, out of slavery, out of certain death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. You put the pressure on, you kept your window open, you made sure it happened. Yeah, I\u2019m really proud of you.\u201d</p> <p>When his phone buzzed, he almost didn\u2019t answer it. But what the hell. \u201cGive.\u201d</p><p>Thorne\u2019s voice rasped through the line. \u201cCome over to the Cave and bring Parisa with you. Endelle\u2019s here with news.\u201d The line went dead.</p><p>Medichi scowled at the phone. What the hell was going on now, and why did Thorne have to be barking orders at this time of night? Besides, with Parisa tucked under his arm, he\u2019d started getting a certain idea about just what they should be doing next ... to celebrate their hard-won victory.</p><p>So, shit.</p><p>\u201cThorne wants us at the Cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEndelle\u2019s there. Apparently she has some kind of announcement to make.\u201d</p><p>Parisa pulled away from him and looked around the rotunda. \u201cShe\u2019s not here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, I know. But that\u2019s Endelle for you.\u201d</p><p>The heat of an argument</p><p>Brings truth rushing to the surface.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean there are twenty-one more facilities like the one we just raided?\u201d Thorne\u2019s voice held a dangerous edge.</p><p>Parisa stared at him then shifted her gaze back to Endelle. The woman\u2019s hair seemed strange, as though she\u2019d been in a wind tunnel. She didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>She planted her hands on her hips. \u201cWhy the fuck are you arguing with me. Let\u2019s just say that my source is irrefutable and if any of you are guessing who it is don\u2019t say the name out loud and for shit\u2019s sake shield that thought.\u201d</p><p>Parisa didn\u2019t know who they were talking about. She glanced at Antony, who stood beside her. He met her gaze but shook his head. Maybe he would tell her later or maybe it just wasn\u2019t important.</p><p>\u201cI want to take charge of this,\u201d Parisa said. She took a step forward almost without realizing that she\u2019d just done either of these things: spoken aloud or moved toward Madame Endelle.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Endelle cried. Her upper lip curled.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Parisa returned. She planted her own hands on her hips so that she mirrored Her Supremeness. She still wore her makeshift version of battle gear, the buckled female weapons harness, the dagger with the ruby embedded in the hilt, black cargo pants. She could even mount her wings if she needed to.</p><p>Endelle looked her up and down. \u201cYou playing at warrior or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I am. And in case you don\u2019t know, I\u2019m entering the Female Militia Warrior Training Camps as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Endelle laughed. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck not?\u201d Parisa cried. She had mimicked Endelle\u2019s speech pattern without even thinking about it.</p><p>For the first time, Endelle narrowed her gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She glanced around at the men. When her gaze landed on Antony, she added, \u201cYou may want to think twice. Your man doesn\u2019t look very happy about this decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it or he won\u2019t,\u201d Parisa responded. No, Antony wasn\u2019t happy about it, but right now she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Parisa had a mission.</p><p>\u201cTough words, ascender. But this won\u2019t be a fancy book-reading in an air-conditioned back room. Are you sure you\u2019ve got the guts for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth? I don\u2019t know, but I know it\u2019s the path I want to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened in New Zealand anyway?\u201d Endelle shifted her gaze to Thorne.</p><p>Parisa could see that there was an exchange. She knew Endelle shared a mind-link with Thorne though whether he could share images with her, Parisa didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Endelle turned wide eyes back to Parisa. \u201cYou stuck Rith with your blade? More than once?\u201d</p><p>Parisa\u2019s cheeks grew warm. \u201cI confess I lost control and did more damage to the cot he fell on than to the man. Rith dematerialized. But all the more reason I should enter a training program. I have a lot to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d She glanced around. \u201cWell, I guess nothing needs to be decided right this minute. Let me give it some thought, ascender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Parisa stood with her left arm slung behind her back, the way she had seen Antony stand when addressing Madame Endelle. It was a warrior pose.</p><p>Endelle looked her up and down once more. Her brows rose as she said, \u201cWell, damn, ascender. Damn.\u201d</p><p>Medichi was just about ready to bust two pairs of balls.</p><p>Kerrick and Marcus stood in identical stances\u2014arms folded across chests, grins spread over both faces as they stared back at him. Under different circumstances it would have been welcomed that both of them understood right now what he was going through. But those smiles made him want to clock them both. If they\u2019d been closer, the hell he would have restrained the impulse.</p><p>He was just pissed off with a capital P.</p><p>Goddammit.</p><p>Parisa needed to be taught a lesson. A big one. He resented everything about her attitude right now, that she was going to take charge of finding the remaining D&amp;R slaves, that she was going to become a warrior, that she was heading to the Female Militia Warrior Training Camps to train for battle. As though he had no say in the matter, as though he wasn\u2019t important to her, as though he could eat shit and die for all she cared. This wasn\u2019t a relationship. This was every man for himself\u2014or woman in this case.</p><p>Inaccessible? Try moved-to-outer-space-and-good-luck, asshole!</p><p>What the hell was she thinking, training camps? The women there were butch as hell. They\u2019d eat her alive.</p><p>\u201cMedichi,\u201d Thorne cried. \u201cListen up!\u201d Medichi blinked at him and ignored the way Marcus elbowed Kerrick and their fucking grins broadened.</p><p>\u201cYes, boss,\u201d he said. He glanced around. Where the hell had Endelle gone?</p><p>\u201cTake Parisa back to the villa. You\u2019re still on guardian duty until Endelle says otherwise. Given the fact that Rith still seems to be captivated by our latest ascender, we\u2019re keeping her on emergency level. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Even though Medichi wanted to argue, he said, \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His gaze skated over the rest of the group. \u201cWell done, assholes. Let\u2019s have a drink and a toast, then we\u2019ll get the hell out of here. Time to take out more pretty-boys.\u201d</p><p>Medichi\u2019s thighs, heavy with muscle, shimmied. His arms ached from holding himself together. His throat was tight for all the words he\u2019d jammed down to keep from spewing everywhere. He didn\u2019t want to yell at Parisa, but boy did she have a tongue-lashing coming.</p><p>Santiago moved to the back of the bar along with Zach. Together they pulled out a crowd of glasses. Zach opened the small fridge, and a bottle of Dom Perignon appeared. A pop followed.</p><p>\u201cHow nice,\u201d Parisa said. She left his side without even looking at him, as though she\u2019d forgotten he was here.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t been on guardian duty the fuck if he would have stayed in this room. All right, he would have drunk the toast with the boys then to hell with this female. Inaccessible. No fucking shit.</p><p>When the glasses were passed around, Luken held his aloft. \u201cTo Parisa, who kicked major butt today.\u201d</p><p>All the voices joined together, except for Medichi\u2019s. He drank and fumed. He ignored Marcus and Kerrick. He sure as hell didn\u2019t look at Parisa, though she turned back at him and smiled.</p><p>Then she frowned. Good.</p><p>He drained his glass and slapped it on the bar. \u201cWe need to get back,\u201d he stated.</p><p>She faced him now, her back to the warriors, a question in her eyes. One by one the men folded out of the Cave, heading to the Borderlands. Back to making war. Each time, a little breeze flowed in his direction, moving wisps of her hair forward around her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glanced behind her and when the last of them left\u2014Marcus offering her a salute\u2014she turned back and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you even have to ask should give you some kind of clue, Madame Warrior.\u201d</p><p>Her pretty arched brows rose. \u201cYou\u2019re angry that I want to train as a warrior?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even have the smallest clue what you\u2019ll be up against.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Okay, he hadn\u2019t expected that. \u201cThe Female Militia Training Camps are like Mortal Earth boot camp on crack. The women are hard-core. Simply put, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He blinked and let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t be going. You shouldn\u2019t even be thinking about a career in the military.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would have agreed with you yesterday.\u201d</p><p>He threw up his arms. \u201cYou saw a handful of seconds of military action and you think you can be a warrior? Look at you.\u201d He gestured with a hand up and down her body, his gaze pausing more than once on the size of her chest.</p><p>\u201cSo women with big boobs can\u2019t serve?\u201d Now she scowled.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were looking at my chest, though. Admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like a goddamn warrior.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, her lips pursed. \u201cWhat do I look like, Antony? A vampire? An ascender? A woman who has to mount her wings at least once every ten days or she goes insane? A woman who just spent the last three months in captivity? A woman who before her ascension was hiding in a library because life had kicked her around too much? And exactly how many of those things make it bad or wrong for me to decide making war in a world at war is the right thing for me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t thought this through and not once did you ask, What do you think, Antony?\u201d</p><p>At that, she released a small sigh. She even frowned a little. \u201cWhat do you think, Antony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking patronize me. You don\u2019t give a good goddamn what I think. You already told Madame Endelle what you plan to do. That you didn\u2019t give me a second\u2019s thought summed it up for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give you a second\u2019s thought? All I thought was\u2014I want to do what Antony does. I want to lay it on the line every day or night of my life so long as Rith lives, so long as Greaves lives. I want to battle beside my man. I want him to be proud of me. I was such a mouse when I arrived here, when Havily and Marcus found me in my courtyard, naked and in full-mount and Crace arrived? There wasn\u2019t a damn thing I could do to stay alive in that situation. So, yeah, I did think of you, that I wanted to be just like you.\u201d</p><p>Shit. By the end of this speech, her eyes had filled with tears and she put three fingers against her lips in true Parisa fashion.</p><p>He took a step toward her but she lifted her other hand, palm flat out in his direction. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She lifted that hand a little higher, then vanished. He still couldn\u2019t believe she already had the ability to fold.</p><p>He traced her back to the villa. Thank God she\u2019d had enough sense to go there and not anywhere else.</p> <p>By the time his battle sandals touched down on the hardwood floor of his villa foyer, she was headed to the south rooms on a quick march. Now she was pissed. Fine.</p><p>He followed after her. By the time she\u2019d passed through the formal living room and he was just about to catch up with her, she turned around and shook a finger at him. He stopped dead in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want a long-term relationship with me,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou\u2019ve told me you don\u2019t. Just remember that.\u201d</p><p>Had he said those words to her? \u201cYou don\u2019t, either. You don\u2019t want the breh-hedden. You\u2019re inaccessible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like I used to be but you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t want to be bonded to you. I don\u2019t want to be this close to anyone. But what\u2019s worse, what is killing me, is that I really, really don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d Again, her fingers found her lips and her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Ah, shit. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on her forehead. \u201cNo. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Just how far down this road were they anyway?</p><p>Oh ... God.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you, either,\u201d he said. And that was the truth, apparently for both of them.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said flapping her arms once up and down. \u201cSo what do we do? I didn\u2019t want this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Antony, what are we going to do? Everything is happening so fast and I\u2019m still so raw about Rith and being held captive. I\u2019m exhilarated that we brought the women home but now I\u2019m horrified that there are twenty-one other facilities like Fiona\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He moved close to her and put his arms around her. \u201cHey,\u201d he whispered against the top of her head. Even though they were fighting, that sweet scent of tangerines got to him all over again. \u201cEase down, Warrior.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. Her arms slipped around his waist, finding a place beneath the center back strap of the weapons harness.</p><p>\u201cYou smell so good,\u201d she whispered against his chest.</p><p>Though desire rippled through him, he didn\u2019t act on it. Was this their first fight? Probably wouldn\u2019t be the last. Did he want to live without her? Could he bear her being gone day and night for weeks while she trained at the local camps?</p><p>Did she really want to battle as a warrior?</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cHow about I hold you until you figure it out.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled once, a bounce against his chest. \u201cThat could be a millennium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>How strange that he could look down the years, decades, centuries and see himself holding her like this. What was it about Parisa that fit so well? Was it just the call of the breh-hedden, something outside them both forcing them together, or were they truly a good fit for this dimension, this world, this war?</p><p>He drew back and looked down at her.</p><p>She looked up. \u201cYou smell like sage.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need more of an invitation than that. He dipped and caught her lips in a kiss that deepened swiftly. Before the thought had formed, his tongue was in her mouth and searching out every crevice as though he had never kissed her before.</p><p>She withdrew her arms from around his waist and slid them up his chest to encircle his neck. Her weapons harness and dagger collided with his. There just wasn\u2019t a lot of intimacy when three daggers and a lot of leather separated skin from skin.</p><p>\u201cAntony,\u201d she murmured, meeting his gaze. \u201cI\u2019d like to go home, I don\u2019t mean permanently, I mean right now. I\u2019d like to be with you in my home, the one I\u2019ve lived in for the past several years, on Mortal Earth.\u201d</p><p>He had spent a lot of hours in her home. It was a unique house with a central courtyard, a private space that no one in the neighboring houses or the street could see into.</p><p>Everything about her house spoke of who she was: the muted hues of gold, maroon, and purple, the varying floors of carpet, wood, and tile, the heavy tapestry drapes in an olive green that flanked almost every window. In some ways, her house had a similar feeling to his own. And there wasn\u2019t a room or hallway that didn\u2019t have books in it, or on shelves, stacked on tables, locked away in glass cabinets as prized possessions. There had even been some left on her nightstand, a reminder that she\u2019d had a life before her ascension.</p><p>Her love of books was just one more thing that bound him to her, whether he liked it or not.</p><p>\u201cYou know that I took care of your place.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou told me again and again, remember? I know you couldn\u2019t hear me when I\u2019d voyeur you but I heard everything you said to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. At least, I thought that was the way it was for you. I hoped it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. You told me you went to my Peoria home every Monday and made sure all the utilities were paid for, the mail collected. You said Endelle kept the house cloaked in mist to keep death vampires away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the water\u2019s still turned on?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou have a good-sized shower over there, though not as big as mine.\u201d</p><p>Her amethyst eyes darkened. \u201cAntony, no one\u2019s is as big as yours.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. She was so his kind of woman. His brother warriors might call him a gentleman but when it came to women he bedded, he\u2019d always preferred everything to be open, erotic, even experimental. That she\u2019d engaged in long-distance sex with him for three months still pleased the hell out of him, and when she\u2019d agreed to use her voyeur window on them last time, he\u2019d known bedtime between them would be just right.</p><p>He also loved never knowing what direction things would take.</p><p>\u201cMy bed is only a queen and you\u2019re definitely king-sized.\u201d</p><p>He met her gaze, his lids at half-mast. \u201cKing-sized, huh?\u201d</p><p>An answering rush of tangerine scent, softened with a bouquet that was just her, tingled his nostrils. King-sized indeed.</p><p>She writhed against him, all of him. \u201cGod, yes,\u201d she whispered against his lips, which made his hips buck into her. \u201cFold me now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. He thought the thought and the moment he felt the bricks of the courtyard beneath his feet, he kissed her hard. Small cries of approval drifted out of her throat and into his mouth. He wanted her to keep crying like that, louder and louder, until she was screaming against his lips and he could swallow her orgasms down.</p><p>He pulled back just a little. \u201cI need this off.\u201d He touched her weapons harness and folded it off so that a split-second later, her pale flesh was a beacon in the night. His right hand caressed one of her full breasts. He was a big man and he had big hands. They barely fit around her, she was that big. Oh, yeah. He rubbed his thumb over her nipple and she cried out. He kissed her again.</p><p>He felt her hands give a tug on his harness. She drew back. \u201cAnd I need this off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was about to fold it away, but she stopped him. \u201cAllow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, but he smiled. For some reason, this skill set had so far proved challenging.</p><p>She closed her eyes and he felt his harness give way, but it ended up hooked over his left shoulder.</p> <p>She giggled as she manually pulled it off him and dropped it on the pavers next to the chaise longue. She looked down at it and laughed some more. \u201cI\u2019ll get better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did just fine,\u201d he said, his voice husky. He moved into her again and once more put his hand on her breast. He caught the nape of her neck with his palm and met her gaze as he slowly slid his hand over her breast, across, in a wide circle down, around, and up, a lot of beautiful territory to cover. She moaned.</p><p>He thumbed her nipple again, and her lips parted. He leaned into her and caught her mouth, driving his tongue deep. She whimpered and pressed her breast into his hand, grinding against his palm. The peaked nipple was a firm bead against his skin, and he needed more of it.</p><p>He drew back, dipped low, then caught her breast in his mouth and tongued her nipple, rubbing up and down in a sudden swift motion that brought little cries from her mouth. The rush of tangerine-and-woman scent rose like a cloud around him, which of course worked on his body like soft stroking fingers so that beneath his kilt he was hard as a rock. His knees felt rubbery the more he suckled.</p><p>He needed more.</p> <p>He was breathing hard when he pulled back. She jerked forward as though she\u2019d lost that small bit of balance. Her eyes had darkened, even in the dim lights of the courtyard lamps.</p><p>He shoved a muscled thigh between her legs and stroked her. He wrapped his arm around her waist and lifted her onto his thigh. He held her tight against his chest. With his free hand he rubbed the side of her breast. Then he kissed her. He drove his tongue into her mouth over and over, letting her feel in that one pulsing movement what he wanted to do between her legs\u2014tongue, cock, or fingers\u2014to work her until she was screaming.</p><p>He drew back just enough to say, \u201cFirst my tongue, then my cock.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, all the way down.</p><p>With his thigh still holding her up\u2014even her feet were off the pavers\u2014he walked her backward, then with an arm behind her shoulders and one on her buttocks, he laid her out on the chaise-longue, just shallow enough so that her hips came to the edge.</p><p>Oh, Antony, yes, yes.</p> <p>I love you inside my head.</p><p>I love you inside me any way you can get there.</p><p>He chuckled, and the throaty sound rolled around the small courtyard.</p><p>With his knees on the hard pavers, he looked into her eyes, those beautiful amethyst eyes, and for a moment his desire became suspended in something more, something he couldn\u2019t explain, but he\u2019d experienced it many centuries before with his wife.</p><p>Almost like, shit ... almost like love.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t go there.</p><p>He kissed her lightly. He felt disoriented, as if he\u2019d been reading a book then suddenly lost his place on the page.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>She touched his face. \u201cI think you\u2019re remembering other things. Come back to me, Antony. Save this time for me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He looked at her and drew back. He let his gaze drift down her body, her extraordinary breasts, her belly button. He put a hand on her cargoes and folded them away.</p><p>The sight of her flat, smooth abdomen, her legs spread and waiting for him, the nest of her dark hair, sent a shiver down his body. A certain amount of pain accompanied the sight of her since he was holding back. He wanted to wait for her. He wanted to see ecstasy flow over her face and force more gasps, cries, and moans from her mouth before he came.</p><p>He calmed himself down and, with a thought, folded a towel from his bathroom into his hand. His kilt was long but not long enough to really maneuver and at the same time protect his knees.</p><p>He stretched the towel and settled his knees. Hey, a little preparation went a long way to getting his woman where he needed her to be. Still, he laughed at himself. God, he loved sex, and he really loved this moment.</p><p>As he situated his knees, he looked up the length of her body. She was propped up on her elbows, her face aglow, and it wasn\u2019t the landscaping lights. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou. You\u2019re so beautiful, Antony. I know I should say handsome, but I think you\u2019re beautiful. Your cheekbones are sculpted. Sometimes my chest aches when I look at you and your long warrior hair.\u201d She sat up the rest of the way and ran her fingers from the top of his head down the entire length of his hair as though awestruck. \u201cI never thought long hair on a man could be so erotic.\u201d A heady wave of tangerine pounded his senses but before he knew what she was about to do, she had launched herself off the chaise longue and onto him so that, even in his kneeling position, she now had her legs wrapped around his waist.</p><p>She kissed him hard and her tongue, so feminine, was a driving pulse in his mouth. He groaned and held her against him, her exquisite breasts against the flat plane of his chest. He squeezed and squeezed, his biceps flexing and releasing as he embraced her. He held her in a tight grip as though trying to press her into his body so that he could carry her around with him day and night.</p><p>His tongue dueled with hers, an erotic battle that lasted several minutes until one of his hands was planted on her ass and pushing her hips in pulses against his hard-as-nails cock.</p><p>Sweet Jesus.</p><p>\u201cI know you wanted this here,\u201d she said, panting against his lips. \u201cBut I think I want you upstairs in my shower. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Okay? Hell, she could have said, I want you to set your feet on fire, and right now he would have agreed to it.</p><p>So much for the careful towel on the pavers, but truth? He loved it.</p><p>He gained his feet with his woman still wrapped around his body, her heels digging into his ass through the kilt. He thought the thought and carried her through nether-space into the master bedroom shower upstairs, a large walk-in shower, a good eight feet deep. He could make it work.</p><p>She unhooked her legs and dropped her feet to the floor. She stepped away from him a little and looked down at his kilt and battle sandals, his shin guards\u2014and yeah, he still wore his silver-studded black leather wrist guards.</p><p>He was ready to fold off the rest of his clothes but she stopped him. \u201cLet me practice.\u201d</p><p>He smiled because he loved the excited glitter in her eyes. They fit in this way. He was powerful and had known many of his powers from almost the day of his ascension. She was the same.</p><p>She worked at removing one piece of clothing at a time. She got his battle sandals off just fine. He nodded his approval. Even the shin guards came off. She put her hand under his kilt until she touched his flight briefs, snug Calvin Kleins, and she thought the thought.</p><p>\u201cNot fucking bad,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>But she looked past his shoulder and laughed. When he turned around he saw them hanging from a nozzle.</p><p>He laughed and kissed her nose. \u201cStill, not bad.\u201d Besides, it was incredibly sexy to have a naked woman undressing him like this.</p><p>\u201cNow the kilt,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded and again closed her eyes to concentrate.</p><p>But the kilt ended up just below his knees, which knocked him off balance. He dropped to his ass on the cold tile. He laughed up at her. She joined him for a split second, then her gaze fell down the line of his body and her laughter faded. In its stead was a ferocious darkening of her eye and a wave of tangerine that once again took his breath away.</p><p>He leaned back on his elbows and spread his legs a little more by lifting one knee and shaking the kilt to his ankles. He was fully erect, his cock stretched out on his abdomen. He wanted her to take a good long look.</p><p>Parisa had been laughing at her stupidity but now she wondered if just maybe she was some kind of genius. God, Antony looked gorgeous spread out on the floor like that, leaning up on his elbows so that his stomach had small ripples near his belly button. She\u2019d like to put her tongue there because at the same place was the crown of his cock and she wanted her tongue on him, all the way down.</p><p>Damn, he was king-sized. Yes ... he ... was.</p><p>When she had said she wanted to be in the shower, she had meant standing up, the water on, his body pushing into hers, all that good stuff. But honestly, this was going to be better. A very specific image popped into her head.</p><p>\u201cMore tangerine,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>She shivered in response because his sage scent swirled around her, licking at her body from her nose to her toes.</p><p>But as her gaze fell to what waited for her down low, her tongue tingled in anticipation.</p><p>She knelt. She could have practiced her folding technique a little more, but right now she wanted the pleasure of stripping his kilt off. She took her time, easing it past his ankles and feet, rubbing his shins with her hands, his hair teasing her palms.</p><p>She laid the kilt out between his legs so that she could stretch out as well. She settled onto her hip and smiled, her heart rate escalating. She wasn\u2019t sure where all this boldness was coming from but after all, they\u2019d been making love together, even if it was a long-distance affair, for over three months.</p><p>She\u2019d also voyeured him so she knew the things he would like. Her mouth actually watered as her gaze roved the heavy sac of his testicles and the firm length of his cock. She reclined so that her head rested on his leg. Sage rolled.</p><p>\u201cAntony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d That one word was a husky drawl that filled the shower space.</p><p>\u201cWill you do something for me?\u201d Very lightly she drifted the backs of her fingers over his sac.</p><p>His back arched and he groaned. \u201cSweetheart, right now if you asked me to launch into outer space, I\u2019d give it a try.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him, met his gaze, and her heart squeezed. Yes, he was so beautiful and some of his hair hung down both sides of his chest. He was in every way a treat waiting to happen. \u201cTouch yourself while I tend to you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back on his left elbow and said, \u201cIs that what you want? You want to watch my hand move over my cock?\u201d</p><p>She drew a deep breath. Desire played over her body. Shivers traced up and down as his hand moved lower and lower, teasing her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded. His fingers took his crown in his hand. He stroked lightly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Antony. I want your hand moving over your cock while I tend to you. Will that make you happy?\u201d</p><p>He smiled then he sighed. \u201cJust having you here, with me, and very naked, makes me happy. But if this is what you want, I\u2019m in.\u201d</p> <p>He took his thick stalk in his fist and worked himself up and down, caressing the crown with his thumb on each upward pass.</p><p>She turned her head into his leg and shifted forward to get closer. Her tongue touched his inner thigh, and he groaned. She licked him over and over, first on the inside of one thigh, then the other. She kept moving forward and inward with each pass, until her tongue played with the rippled skin of his sac. She sucked the skin in and he groaned. Her tongue found the testicles, and she rolled and played with them. The sound of his hand working over his flesh filled the short distance between her head and his hand.</p><p>His breathing grew rough.</p><p>Parisa, he sent. Take my mind right now.</p><p>She drew back and looked at him. \u201cYou want me to enter your mind?\u201d The thought troubled her. Whatever sex was, however intimate it was to be enjoying his naked body, somehow the thought of being in his mind changed things.</p> <p>He sat up. \u201cAre you afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t that mean going one more mile down this road toward the breh-hedden?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot necessarily. Remember, with the breh-hedden all three things have to happen at once.\u201d He smiled and waggled his fingers over his cock. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even close to the kind of sex we\u2019d need to be having to take the ritual all the way.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and nodded. Then her body betrayed her because somehow the thought of being inside Antony\u2019s mind made her clench. \u201cOh,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He leaned close to her, his cock barely a kiss away, as he cupped her face with his hand. \u201cI know you haven\u2019t done mind-penetration before but it\u2019s fantastic during sex. I want to do it to you as well, just not right now. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to. \u201cI really want to.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded then leaned back on his left elbow and once more touched himself, deft fingers that knew what they were doing.</p><p>She let her head rest on his thigh and wiggled to get as close as she needed to be, to do what she wanted to do to him. She drew the sac and one of his testicles into her mouth and tongued him gently. At the same time, she closed her eyes and concentrated.</p><p>She pushed against his mind. She could feel his shields, so powerful, protecting his mind. Even in your shields you\u2019re so well muscled. Do I push, or do you let them fall?</p><p>Try pushing.</p><p>She felt the seductive intent behind those words. He wanted her to push against him. She did, and he groaned aloud. So damn sexy.</p><p>She could hear the swift strokes now, the perfect rhythm of his hand, and she realized this was going to bring him off, which in turn set all the nerves of her body on fire. Moisture dampened the well of her body. She slung a leg over his, her hips rocking against him.</p><p>Ready? she asked.</p><p>God, yes.</p> <p>She pushed until the shields crashed around her. She had barely dipped into his mind when the upper half of his body bowed and lifted off the tile.</p><p>Lift up and look at me, he sent. He was breathing hard when she left the cradle of his body, releasing his sac and testicles so that she could look at him.</p><p>On a quick downward stroke of his hand, while her mind was falling farther inside his head, she leaned forward and licked a combination of his fingers and cock.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he shouted. She watched him erupt, his come spurting all over his chest, his face twisted in ecstasy.</p><p>His pleasure exploded over her mind. She had thought she might take some time to explore his memories, but all that sensation brought her body into a tight state of readiness. Need filled her, his body on her, in her, any way she could get him. She hadn\u2019t expected this. She rolled on her back then her side.</p><p>She was in agony. Antony, help me. Oh, God.</p><p>Her body knotted up in about a hundred different ways.</p><p>Help me, she sent, but he was already in her mind, she could feel him, which only further drew her into knot after knot.</p><p>I\u2019m here. Look at me. Open your eyes and look at me. She felt hands on her arms. He was pulling her up his body.</p><p>\u201cParisa,\u201d he said aloud.</p><p>She opened her eyes. She was on top of him, face-to-face, but she was inside his head as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. I know what you need.\u201d He turned his head.</p><p>Her eyes bulged. He was offering his neck, and she knew this was exactly what she needed. Oh, God, she really was a vampire now, wasn\u2019t she? Her heart pounded in her chest. Her fangs emerged. Saliva dripped in her mouth. All the knots relaxed.</p><p>She was panting and she was instantly addicted to being within his mind. She never wanted to be anywhere else, but her body was on fire.</p><p>She knew other things she should do first\u2014like lick the vein and urge it forth\u2014but she was too far gone. Some kind of cavewoman need had taken her over.</p><p>Yes, that\u2019s it, he sent. Take me. Take me hard.</p><p>She struck quick, like lightning, and began sucking at his neck as though she\u2019d been dying of thirst for about a decade. She pulled in deep draws, savoring the sage taste of him.</p><p>Her internal muscles spasmed again and again. She ground her hips against him and found him ... hard.</p><p>Antony, I need you.</p><p>I\u2019m ready. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done to me, but I\u2019m ready again. Take me, Parisa. Take all of me.</p><p>He held her tight around the shoulders, anchoring her against his neck. He groaned as she sucked.</p><p>With his other hand, he dipped low and cradled her entire pelvis\u2014yes, he had big hands. He lifted her up, positioned her over his cock, then impaled her in a single hard thrust. She was so wet for him, so tight, so ready.</p><p>She screamed around the seal on his neck, but kept her fangs buried and continued to pull. As soon as he\u2019d pushed himself in, though, her hips began to work. Her body felt so strangely powerful\u2014maybe it was Antony\u2019s blood\u2014but she rode him. She rode his cock hard and fast, his arm a vise around her shoulders, his free hand cradling the back of her head and keeping her pinned to his neck.</p><p>She drank and drank.</p><p>The orgasm began to build, like a huge tidal wave in the distance. She felt the pressure coming, coming. His hips suddenly took over. He moved the hand from the back of her head to her buttocks to hold her in place as he thrust deep, hitting the end of her and it hurt and it felt wonderful and hurt and the sensations got mixed up together until he was driving so fast, so very fast, hitting just that spot and suddenly the orgasm barreled down on her with the force of a tsunami.</p><p>She released his neck, arched her back, and screamed. She screamed and screamed as he stretched the orgasm out. Between her screams she heard his low grunting noises, spitting the sounds from behind clenched teeth.</p><p>The orgasm receded but it was like wave-sets at the ocean: The next one came and still Antony pumped into her, hard, grunting, animal, vampire.</p><p>Parisa. Oh, God, Parisa. I\u2019m coming again and oh ... shiiiiit.</p><p>A third orgasm pounded on her, rushing through her as he jerked inside her and pumped and jerked and filled her with his seed.</p><p>Then she saw stars, dozens of them, spinning and spinning, a full galaxy in motion, then they all winked out.</p><p>When she woke up, she was lying on something very soft, a bed, but she couldn\u2019t quite make her eyes open. But she was smiling. Why? She was giggling. Why? Soft little things dotted her nose, her cheeks, her lips, her chin. Ah ... kisses.</p><p>\u201cParisa? Parisa?\u201d</p><p>She heard Antony\u2019s voice from a great distance.</p><p>She giggled again. She was so happy. Was she on some kind of drug?</p><p>Oh, yes, Antony\u2019s blood and his cock and his lips and his tongue and his massive pecs and the fine hairs between his pecs, and his muscled thighs and the way he walked like a tremendous thoroughbred stallion, all quivering muscles, and she had been inside his mind when he came and he had been inside hers.</p><p>\u201cParisa, Parisa.\u201d</p><p>More soft little moist touches now, just on her lips again and again, then a delicate swipe of something wetter.</p><p>She parted her lips and she felt ... Antony\u2019s tongue.</p><p>She giggled and woke up the rest of the way, her eyes opening. He was over her now, kissing her. She was in his bed in the villa. He\u2019d brought her back.</p><p>She was still connected to his mind. She leaned up and kissed him. Did I pass out?</p><p>He smiled and nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt was ... unbelievable. We have to do it again only this time ... oh, Antony, I didn\u2019t know it could be like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little worried.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou ought to be pleased. You made a woman faint with pleasure.\u201d His neck was bloody and a little torn up from her efforts. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Well, that was the first time she\u2019d asked him that. He was always asking her if she was okay, but this time she\u2019d asked him.</p><p>But he just smiled again and kissed her. \u201cI\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p><p>He was a vampire, of course he\u2019d heal, and fast.</p><p>She touched his neck. \u201cWell, now there are two things I need to work at.\u201d</p><p>After getting both of them cleaned up in the shower, Antony took Parisa back to his bed and held her against him, his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>He\u2019d come close to asking her to complete the breh-hedden, which required that each of them take blood, during intercourse, with a full exchange of deep-mind engagement.</p><p>What had stopped him? The sex had been mind-blowing, but sex was ... well, it was just sex except that he\u2019d been inside her mind. He\u2019d picked up this memory, then that one. He\u2019d lived much of her time in captivity, seen her despair, watched her watching him stroke himself morning after morning. He\u2019d felt the depth of her feeling for him. She was in love with him, but how much in love with him? How far gone was she?</p><p>He knew that feeling. He\u2019d had that same one thirteen centuries ago. He couldn\u2019t go through it again. He couldn\u2019t. If he completed the breh-hedden, if he went the distance with her, if he fell that far in love with her, what happened if she died ... no, not if she died, but when? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He couldn\u2019t go through it again.</p><p>Her voice cut into the tangle of his thoughts. \u201cDo you really think taking the warrior training is a bad idea?\u201d Her fingers tugged at the hairs on his arms.</p><p>How did he answer that?</p> <p>He wanted to shout and rail, to tell her to stay away from the camps, to stay in the villa, to hide here with him. They would hide together, forever, live like hermits.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t want to lose her. \u201cYou should take the training if that\u2019s what you want to do. Become a warrior.\u201d</p><p>He stared up at the ceiling, the words of his wife\u2019s poem running through his mind. Love rises on wings of fire ...</p><p>She shifted in his arms so that she could look at him. She leaned up on her elbow. \u201cYou sang a very different tune before the sex.\u201d She smiled, but it dimmed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>His gaze was still fixed on the coffered beams overhead, the ceiling like a chessboard. \u201cEverything. Nothing. The hell if I know what to do.\u201d</p> <p>She turned and followed his gaze, dropping back down on the bed, setting her head into the well of his shoulder. \u201cTell me what it says.\u201d</p><p>He pointed straight up. He took his time and translated each line for her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s beautiful and it does, doesn\u2019t it? Love rising like that, like wings of fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even tense. \u201cI know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to train as a warrior. What chance does love have between us so long as there is a Rith, a Greaves, and a war? We\u2019ve already been separated once.\u201d</p><p>He turned into her until he was on his side. She faced him on her side as well. \u201cI\u2019m already in love with you, maybe not all the way, but almost,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t go any farther. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>She traced his lips with her finger. \u201cI know. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She looked as serious as he felt, her brow puckered slightly. \u201cHow do the others do it? Havily and Marcus? Alison and Kerrick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He leaned forward and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, you know, as much as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go back to the guest room tonight. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll talk to Endelle about the training camps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He expected her to pull away, to draw out of his arms, to make good on her word. Instead, she snuggled closer.</p><p>Just a little longer, she whispered through his mind.</p> <p>Yes.</p><p>But after maybe only a minute, he felt her sigh and begin to rise up. She leaned over to kiss him, a soft press against his lips.</p><p>His head slid against his pillow, pulling on his hair. He watched her leave. He worked to keep his arms immobile. He wanted to reach for her, grab her, drag her back down to the bed, but what good would that do?</p><p>This was for the best.</p><p>Really.</p><p>The lesson ignored twice then thrice,</p><p>Creates chaos in the lives of many.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Parisa stood on one side of Fiona\u2019s hospital bed and Havily on the other.</p><p>Fiona had the bed raised in a full-sitting position. \u201cI want to get out of here. I\u2019m not sick. Just drained.\u201d</p><p>Parisa smiled. \u201cWas that a joke?\u201d</p><p>Fiona glanced at her, arched her brown eyebrows as if in question, then smiled. She even chuckled softly. \u201cYes, I guess it was.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI slept well last night, and no drugs in my system anymore.\u201d</p><p>She wore a gold locket around her neck, the one Jean-Pierre had given her. Apparently, he\u2019d found it in Toulouse behind an armoire but how he\u2019d found it, Parisa couldn\u2019t imagine. Didn\u2019t matter. Fiona was safe.</p><p>Havily turned away from the bed and drew a chair forward. She sat down. \u201cSo, we\u2019re actually here for a reason, not just to pay a social call. We\u2019ve been talking about the D and R refugees, for want of a better word. I hate using the word slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut slave is accurate, believe me. Even though we had daily exercise and a healthy diet, full of iron, naturally.\u201d</p><p>Parisa didn\u2019t leave her post by the bed. She had an uneasy sensation about Fiona. The woman had an aura of dry brittle leaves. \u201cThis must be so disorienting for you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose it must seem that way.\u201d She lowered her gaze to stare at her clasped hands. The thumbs touched, rolled against each other. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be here. Let me at least say that. I am glad to be alive and to no longer be in that place or under Rith\u2019s command.\u201d</p><p>Parisa glanced at the doorway. The hospital was buzzing with activity. Antony was talking with Colonel Seriffe, and several of the Warriors of the Blood were here. She had seen Alison pass by once or twice as well.</p><p>Outside the building, a number of Militia Warriors could be seen through the street-side window, patrolling the hospital grounds.</p><p>Parisa had felt uneasy all morning. She had slept in the guest room, alone, the bed cool after Antony\u2019s warm presence. As tall as he was, as muscled, the man created a lot of heat. She had awakened more than once, forgetting where she was, reaching across the bed and patting cold sheets.</p><p>She would get used to it. She had to. They\u2019d decided together that this was for the best.</p><p>Earlier, they\u2019d met with Endelle, and she\u2019d agreed to permit Parisa to enter the Female Warrior Training Camps. It seemed strange to have settled on that course, but of everything she\u2019d been through in the past year and a half, warrior training was the one thing that felt completely right to her.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Fiona asked.</p><p>Parisa glanced at Havily. \u201cWell,\u201d Havily began, \u201cit may be early in the process here, but the bottom line is that we\u2019ve learned there are twenty-one other D and R facilities around the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Fiona said her clasped hands coming loose. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, what?\u201d Parisa asked.</p><p>Fiona looked up at her. \u201cI want to help get them out, all of them. Whatever it takes. But I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019re going to do that and not cause even more problems. Even if we break up the D and R program, what happens next? Greaves will want to set up more of them, and in the meantime where will all the death vampires get their blood?\u201d</p><p>Havily met Parisa\u2019s gaze. \u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Havily said. \u201cIf we disturb all twenty-one nests at once, two things will happen. More mortals will be abducted to replace them, and a lot more women will die. She\u2019s absolutely right. We have to battle this more extensively.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Parisa asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d Havily said, staring hard at Parisa. She shifted her gaze to Fiona. \u201cThe three of us have one thing in common. We\u2019ve all been abducted. We all know what it feels like to be helpless, in the grip of someone more powerful. And the reason this hospital is crawling with Militia Warriors is because we are all still in danger. Rith will want his slaves back as well.\u201d She glanced at Parisa. \u201cSo, are you headed to the camps?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMedichi\u2019s here talking with Colonel Seriffe about security at the training camps for me. No one really knows what to do, but I\u2019m determined to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are the camps?\u201d Fiona asked.</p><p>\u201cWarrior training. I\u2019m becoming a warrior.\u201d She laughed. \u201cIt feels so strange to say that out loud.\u201d</p><p>Havily rose from the chair. \u201cDid you know that Endelle wanted Alison to go the camps, to train as a warrior, when she first ascended?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Parisa said. \u201cDo you mean Alison didn\u2019t want to be trained?\u201d</p><p>Havily shook her head. \u201cYou know what she is ... a healer. She couldn\u2019t even kill her opponent in the arena battle and it was supposed to be a battle to the death. The warrior was intent on killing her, but Alison ... you won\u2019t believe this ... cut off his arm then reversed a pocket of time so that he got his arm back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Fiona cried. \u201cIs that possible in this dimension?\u201d</p><p>Parisa glanced at her. \u201cI had wings on Mortal Earth. That was supposed to be impossible as well.\u201d</p><p>Fiona turned to Havily. \u201cWhat of you? What is your power that makes you a target?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have two actually. My blood has special properties and tends to act like dying blood in some respects. It made Crace maniacal. He was a High-Administrator-turned-death-vampire who wanted my blood more than anything. He was the one who orchestrated my abduction.</p><p>\u201cIn addition, I work with Endelle in the darkening. Yeah, I know ... well, it\u2019s a nether-space thing, a place that exists between dimensions. When she and I do darkening work, we hunt for Greaves all night because he uses that time to travel around the world to ship death vampires to this area, to Phoenix Two. You know how the Warriors of the Blood battle all night? Greaves has been building an army of death vampires throughout the world by turning High Administrators and in addition making one of their tasks the creation of more death vampires through the taking of dying blood.\u201d</p><p>Fiona leaned her head against the mattress. She covered her face with her hand. \u201cAnd he supplies the High Administrators with our blood, with the blood we died for every month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Havily said. \u201cBut yours no more.\u201d</p><p>Fiona\u2019s hand shot out and grabbed Havily\u2019s arm. \u201cBut Rith will acquire more women to meet the demand. And if not, the death vampires must feed. I\u2019ve heard that to go without dying blood creates unbearable abdominal cramps.\u201d</p><p>Parisa turned and settled a hip on the bed. She took Fiona\u2019s free hand and held it tightly in hers. \u201cThat is not your responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cYour job is to get well quickly and to serve on our committee to free the rest of the slaves.\u201d</p><p>Fiona shook her head. \u201cThey will feed on mortals because they\u2019re weak. There has to be a better way. Something more permanent. The blood is packaged and distributed all around the world. What if we followed that trail and eliminated the source that needed the blood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou mean the death vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you aware that Greaves has an antidote and that more ascenders partake of dying blood than we know of? It\u2019s rumored that a third of COPASS uses dying blood and the antidote.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCOPASS?\u201d Fiona asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Committee to Oversee the Process of Ascension to Second Earth. No one checked the acronym, which is probably also an indication of the intelligence level involved. It\u2019s all political.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does COPASS have to do with anything if they just oversee the ascension process?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver the decades, the governing body gained more and more power. It now has the ability to establish all kinds of laws. The one that hinders Endelle the most is that she is not allowed access to her own Seers Fortress at the Superstition Mountains without the permission of that Fortress\u2019s High Administrator.\u201d</p><p>Fiona frowned. \u201cBut I know for a fact that Commander Greaves uses Seer information to plot his course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Havily asked.</p><p>A blush suffused Fiona\u2019s cheeks. \u201cI can hear telepathic conversations.\u201d She whispered the words.</p><p>Parisa glanced at Havily. Havily returned her stare and into her mind, sent, Is she lying?</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie about something like this,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cAnd I only mentioned it because I trust you both.\u201d</p><p>Parisa laughed, then Havily. \u201cCan you communicate telepathically? I\u2019m just learning to do it myself.\u201d</p><p>Fiona shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you discover you could do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerally I can hear everyone\u2019s thoughts, though I\u2019ve learned to block the noise really well. The first time I met Greaves and Rith all those decades ago, it was like hearing a symphony in full orchestral mode. I thought I would go mad.\u201d She shuddered at the memory.</p><p>\u201cYou must know way too much about everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I\u2019d like to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jean-Pierre?\u201d Havily asked.</p><p>Fiona smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t know French. He blends his French and English together in his thoughts. Besides, the minute I know I\u2019m hearing thoughts instead of spoken words, I close my mind down.\u201d</p><p>Parisa blew air from her cheeks. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a good thing where Jean-Pierre is concerned.\u201d</p><p>Havily laughed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I missing?\u201d</p><p>Havily said, \u201cWell, he\u2019s a man and he\u2019s a warrior.\u201d</p><p>Fiona laughed, first a little then a lot. \u201cYou\u2019re so right. I forgot what it used to be like when I would listen in accidentally. Men do think about sex a lot.\u201d After the shared amusement subsided, she said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t that way before I was abducted, on Mortal Earth, I mean. I couldn\u2019t hear everyone\u2019s thoughts until I arrived on Second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did you survive?\u201d Havily asked. \u201c Mortals can\u2019t, you know.\u201d She jerked her thumb at Parisa. \u201cExcept this one, but she\u2019s the only exception ... ever.\u201d</p><p>Fiona shrugged. \u201cThe first thing Greaves did to me was ascend me. I know that\u2019s not the right phrase but he has the power to bestow immortality though he withholds the fangs, thank God. Vampire fangs would have been too much to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if the D and R process wasn\u2019t enough all by itself. You know, Fiona, what we don\u2019t understand is how you lived as long as you did.\u201d</p><p>She stared down once more at clasped hands. \u201cI really don\u2019t know, but the worst of it was that I got really good at reading the women. I knew how long each one would last to the year, often to the month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Havily whispered. She put her hand on Fiona\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been through it one way or another, because we\u2019re ascended and this is a world at war. My fianc\u00e9 was killed by death vampires and he was a powerful Militia Warrior. Later Crace, who used to be High Administrator of Chicago Two, turned and got a taste of my blood and abducted me. He drained me, not to death like you, but he kept me drugged and chained to a wall. Sometimes I have nightmares, but Marcus is there for me now and it helps.\u201d</p><p>Fiona grabbed her hand, the one on her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re sisters then, in this kind of suffering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd power,\u201d Parisa said.</p><p>Another feminine voice flowed from the doorway. \u201cAnd compassion.\u201d Alison moved forward, her gaze fixed on Fiona. \u201cYou have compassion for the other women. I\u2019ve been talking to them this morning. You were the hub, the counselor, the comforter. You got most of them through longer than they would have survived otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Parisa turned toward her. Alison had spoken evenly enough, but now her hand was on her stomach and her nostrils flared. Was she in pain all the time? \u201cHow\u2019s the baby?\u201d</p><p>Alison took in a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m actually here for a sonogram in a little while, but I thought I\u2019d check in with our latest arrivals.\u201d After a moment, she seemed to relax, and she moved forward to put a hand over Fiona\u2019s hand, which still held Havily\u2019s. She smiled. \u201cI like this. A real sisterhood. When I ascended I was alone except for Endelle. Believe me, that was no picnic.\u201d</p><p>Parisa and Havily burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Fiona asked.</p><p>Havily chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear she\u2019s fashion-challenged.\u201d</p><p>All the ladies shouted their laughter this time.</p><p>\u201cTo say the least,\u201d Havily said.</p><p>Alison broke the spell and hissed as she once more pressed her hand to her belly. She stepped away from the bed then cursed, a very long string of words hooked together that made Parisa stare. She had never heard her talk like this, but Havily didn\u2019t seem especially surprised.</p><p>Alison closed her eyes and breathed, her hand at the top of her belly as though trying to press the pain away.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cEnough of this. I\u2019m going to track the doctor down right now.\u201d</p><p>She turned and hurried from the room. She headed to the right so that Parisa watched her pass in front of the glass windows that ran the length of the bedroom wall. Long vertical blinds ran the width of the window, but right now they were kept open just enough.</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope she\u2019s okay,\u201d Havily cried.</p><p>When Parisa glanced at her, she was dabbing careful fingers beneath her eyes. After a moment, she turned back in Fiona\u2019s direction and said, \u201cHer sonogram will take a while so how about we focus on you. I suspect you have a lot of questions about Second Earth and about Endelle\u2019s administration, so if you feel up to it, fire away.\u201d</p><p>Fiona blinked. \u201cWell, who makes the best coffee in this dimension? All I\u2019ve had for over a hundred years is tea. I\u2019m sick of tea. I used to have coffee every morning in Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarbucks,\u201d Parisa and Havily said in unison.</p><p>Parisa thought the lightness of her tone and of the question was the best sign yet that Fiona would adjust.</p><p>For the next hour, both she and Fiona pelted Havily with dozens of questions on all sorts of subjects\u2014about Endelle\u2019s administration, about the Warriors of the Blood, and about the organization of Territories. Spectacle became a lively discussion as well as horticulture, which was one of the highest art forms on Second Earth.</p><p>When another half hour had passed, Havily glanced in the direction of the hallway windows. She looked down at her watch then back to the windows. \u201cI really thought Alison would be done by now.\u201d</p><p>Kerrick suddenly appeared in the doorway, a crease between his brows. \u201cHey, Hav. Just to give you a heads-up, Alison\u2019s headed this way and she\u2019s crying.\u201d He looked really worried.</p><p>Parisa knew that the bonding of the breh-hedden allowed Kerrick to know Alison\u2019s external sensations, anything she touched or anything that touched her, but it didn\u2019t translate into emotional understanding. No doubt he could feel the tears on her face.</p><p>But this so wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>\u201cWhy weren\u2019t you with her?\u201d Havily asked.</p><p>\u201cShe was supposed to wait because I was out at the Militia Warrior Training Camps. Shit. I wanted to be here for her.\u201d</p><p>He was just short of Antony\u2019s height. He had dark arched brows over striking emerald eyes. He was built, too, and looked especially yummy in his battle kilt and weapons harness.</p><p>His expression shifted, a lift of the arched brows and widening of his eyes as he looked up the hall. He took a few steps so that Parisa could only see him through the hall window if she leaned backward, her gaze partially obscured by the blinds.</p><p>Alison came into view and the next second he took her in his arms, though her belly made it an awkward angle. Parisa felt tears touch her eyes. Alison\u2019s chest rose and fell in what had to be a series of sobs.</p><p>Fiona whispered, \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>But it was Kerrick\u2019s face she could see.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be all bad. Look. Kerrick is smiling.\u201d His laughter suddenly boomed up the hall. He pulled away from her and laughed some more, then he hugged her and laughed again.</p><p>Havily said, \u201cMaybe she\u2019s having twins. She looks big enough to be having more than one. She\u2019s only seven months and she\u2019s huge.\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around her shoulders and turned her in the direction of Fiona\u2019s door. Havily now stood at the end of bed.</p><p>The next moment, Alison appeared, wiping tears from her cheeks and grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Havily cried. \u201cTell us right now or I\u2019m going to throw my shoe at you this time, Lissy.\u201d</p><p>That made Alison laugh. \u201cOh, that was so bad of me but I\u2019ve already promised Kerrick I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d She compressed her lips and tried to restrain what was a combination of a new smile and the beginning of a fresh bout of tears. Her relief was obvious.</p><p>Kerrick tightened his arm around her shoulders and met Havily\u2019s gaze. \u201cWell, first, nothing\u2019s wrong ... at all. But you\u2019re not going to believe this. The baby has wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWings?\u201d Havily cried. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cApparently, it is,\u201d Alison said. \u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s been so much discomfort. The baby\u2019s healthy and she\u2019s right on schedule, but apparently the release of the wings has caused an increase in amniotic fluid in order to create more space and that\u2019s been the problem all this time. Well, that and the movement. Essentially, the flying.\u201d She wiped her eyes. \u201cThe baby has wings. I can\u2019t believe it. I just can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Parisa stared at Alison\u2019s stomach. She tried to picture the fetus within, twirling, tumbling, practicing with wings. She couldn\u2019t imagine a finer beginning for any human\u2014ascender\u2014vampire\u2014whatever.</p><p>Havily turned toward the couple a little more. \u201cBut does this mean you have two more months of this kind of agony?\u201d</p> <p>Alison stood up straighter and wiped a little more at her cheeks. She folded tissues into her hand and wiped some more. \u201cNo. The good news is that the doctor thinks I can begin communicating telepathically with the baby to get her to start bringing her wings in and hopefully keeping them in. It\u2019s a rare phenomenon for a Second Earth baby but there\u2019s anecdotal evidence that says it occurs in the Upper Dimension all the time.\u201d She drew a card from the pocket of her slacks. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman whose specialty is telepathy and infants. Her name is Tazianne. Now, why does that name sound familiar?\u201d</p><p>Havily gave a brisk shake of her head. \u201cOh, I know why. She\u2019s the talented horticulturalist who designed the magnolia centerpiece on Medichi\u2019s foyer table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, I remember now. Well, looks like she has more than one gift. Anyway, I\u2019m going to give her a call ASAP and get Helena to calm the hell down.\u201d She chuckled. Kerrick hugged her again and kissed her forehead. They looked at each other for a long moment. Parisa knew they were communicating telepathically, and it was a beautiful thing to see the love on their faces, one for the other.</p><p>Parisa\u2019s heart hurt looking at them. She thought of Antony and of having spent the night in the guest room. For a sudden hard moment she longed to have exactly that kind of relationship with him.</p><p>Fiona didn\u2019t know whether it was Parisa sitting on the side of the bed next to her, or that Havily and Alison and even Warrior Kerrick were in her room with her, but somehow she started to relax. Tears touched her eyes. The sight of Warrior Kerrick so tender with his breh was so normal that she felt maybe, maybe, everything was going to be okay.</p> <p>The disaster that had been her life for over a century, the suffering she had endured, began to fall back into the past. She could take a step forward now, maybe two. She knew this sensation, but it took her a moment to realize that what she felt was hope, that her life even after so many horrendous decades, could start making sense again, could be something she could manage, perhaps even direct, even enjoy. What would that be like, to be able to direct her steps, to order them, to choose her path, to decide when she arose and when she went to bed, to never again be at the mercy of monthly needles, tubes, bags, and the presence of Rith and his medical staff?</p><p>She drew air into her nostrils and she smelled coffee. \u201cOh, what I wouldn\u2019t give for a cup of coffee right now. When I kept my house in Boston, I had my housekeeper bring me a cup first thing. It was decadent, I know, but it was so lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can certainly get you some coffee,\u201d Parisa said.</p><p>Fiona looked past Alison through the long window onto the hall. The blinds made it a little difficult to see, but she couldn\u2019t mistake the man who came into view: Warrior Jean-Pierre. Her fingers moved to the gold locket.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>She really shouldn\u2019t do it, but for someone reason she had to know his thoughts. Did he ever think of her?</p> <p>She lowered her shields, just a little. At first, all she could hear were the thoughts of the women closest to her. Havily wondering if she should purchase the new Ralph Lauren skirt she saw online and Parisa trying to figure out how to save all the D&amp;R slaves. Alison needing Kerrick to take her home. Fiona pushed past all these thoughts, shutting them down.</p><p>Her telepathy moved into the hallway and as she let Jean-Pierre\u2019s mind flow over her, his eyes lifted to meet hers. She is so beautiful, belle. Mon dieu, I cannot breathe. Sex. All I can think is sex, wanting to be inside her now. How lovely she is, her lips parting. I want to kiss her. \u00c7a suffice! No more.</p><p>He tore his gaze away and started walking up the hall. Jean-Pierre, she sent, panicked for some reason. Don\u2019t go. Please don\u2019t go! You calm me. Stay with me. She had no hope that he would hear her. No one ever heard her telepathic messages.</p><p>But he froze, his back stiff where she could see it through the blinds. Oh, God, had he heard her? She hadn\u2019t meant for him to hear.</p><p>Did you really speak to me, Fiona, into my head? I am here, if you want me. I will stay, if you need me. Did you really speak to me?</p><p>Yes, she whispered.</p><p>He turned around and started moving again, slowly, until he appeared in the doorway facing her. His eyes were wide, stunned. So he had heard her. She wasn\u2019t imagining it.</p><p>\u201cAllo, Kerrick,\u201d he said, as the warrior turned in his direction. The word sounded like Kareek. He didn\u2019t meet Fiona\u2019s gaze. \u201cThe nurses have been talking. Congratulations to you both. Having wings, quite extraordinary.\u201d Oh, the way his accent caressed that last word.</p> <p>Both Kerrick and Alison shared the news with him in turns, but Fiona couldn\u2019t exactly hear them. Instead, she felt strange ripples pass over her, like icy bits of water that left her shivering yet not cold, more like ... desire ... oh, dear.</p><p>After the happy parents finished explaining their latest news, Jean-Pierre moved up beside Kerrick. He met Fiona\u2019s gaze. \u201cI was wondering if I could get you something?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She met his gaze and for just a moment saw no one else. But she nodded and said the only thing she could think of. \u201cA really hot cup of coffee with sugar and cream, but just little of each. All right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and the heavens seemed to part. He had the most beautiful smile. His eyes seemed to dance with life. His hair was wavy and in parts curly, almost unkempt, but it gave him such a look. Most of his hair was light brown but there was an outer layer of sunny-blond streaks that made her think of summers at the beach. Charming, she thought. The man radiated charm in every way.</p><p>\u201cMais oui. But yes, of course. I will bring you coffee.\u201d Then he smiled, inclined his head, lifted his arm, and vanished.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Fiona said, but she wasn\u2019t certain if her reaction was to his sudden dematerialization or to him.</p><p>She became acutely aware that all three women, and one powerful warrior, were watching her, their expressions wary, thoughtful, although Havily smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Fiona asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Havily said, but her smile flowed into a grin. \u201cHe\u2019s very handsome.\u201d</p><p>Fiona shrugged. \u201cThey all are, even the Militia Warriors.\u201d Her fingers plucked at the thin blanket on her bed.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Alison said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take off. Again, welcome home, Fiona. If you need me for anything...\u201d</p><p>Fiona smiled and nodded. \u201cThank you, Alison. You\u2019ve been so very kind.\u201d</p><p>Alison gave a little wave before she turned away. When she reached Kerrick, he gathered her closer still and kissed her flush on the lips. Together they vanished, still kissing.</p><p>Fiona gasped\u2014not because of the fold, but because Kerrick had been kissing her when they left. The tenderness brought tears to her eyes. Her husband had been tender like that, so kind, so protective. He hadn\u2019t wanted her to go shopping that day, all by herself. They\u2019d had many disagreements over her independent spirit, but she had felt it absurd not to do her shopping alone. The streets of Boston, in their part of town, had been perfectly safe. That is, until she\u2019d come across what she now knew to be a pair of death vampires, two glorious creatures shrouded in mist that only she\u2019d been able to see.</p><p>Her natural confidence, which she now considered her supreme stupidity, had caused her to approach them. Despite all the strange looks various passersby gave her\u2014she must have appeared to be speaking to the air like a madwoman\u2014she had carried on a conversation with the monsters. But how could she have known what they really were? A few moments later, before she knew what was happening, she met Rith for the first time.</p><p>She blinked and forced the memories away.</p><p>Havily\u2019s voice broke through her thoughts. \u201cAlison has suffered for weeks. I\u2019m just so glad she has some answers now.\u201d</p><p>She glanced from one woman to the next. \u201cDo either of you have children?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Parisa shook her head, but Havily couldn\u2019t quite hide a sudden stricken look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve caused you pain,\u201d Fiona said quietly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>Havily smiled and shook her head. \u201cIt was a long time ago. I guess all this trouble with Alison\u2019s pregnancy has brought it back to me.\u201d She turned to face Fiona. \u201cI had three little girls when I was a young wife on Mortal Earth. They died of scarlet fever, my husband as well, but that was at the turn of the last century. Like I said, it was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Fiona looked away and suddenly her heart hurt, maybe because Havily would understand. \u201cI don\u2019t know when my children died. I know nothing about them or their lives, how they grew up, if they grew up, whether they married, had children, grandchildren. They were ten and eight when I was taken from Boston. There is something hideous in not knowing, and of course after all these years neither of them would still be living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could find out for you,\u201d Parisa said.</p><p>Fiona sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, probably one minute out of two since I arrived at Madame Endelle\u2019s palace. Now I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll have to live it all over again.\u201d</p><p>Havily moved to the side of the bed opposite Parisa and put her hand on Fiona\u2019s, giving her a reassuring squeeze. \u201cNothing has to be done today. Look, Jean-Pierre is back.\u201d</p><p>Fiona turned toward the doorway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And there he was, holding a steaming brown ceramic mug in his hand.</p><p>She felt dizzy suddenly, such a strange reaction. Well, he was terribly handsome, and he seemed to always be looking at her, focused on her, which added to her dizziness.</p><p>Where had he found such a nice mug in the hospital?</p><p>\u201cI went home,\u201d he said as though having read her thoughts. He went home. That translated into a quick dematerialization, but it also meant he\u2019d made an effort. \u201cIt took no time at all. There is also a very nice coffeehouse in Sedona. They were very obliging. I hope the cream and sugar is to your taste.\u201d</p> <p>She drew in a deep breath. Havily\u2019s hand slid away from Fiona\u2019s and Jean-Pierre took her place beside the bed. Fiona\u2019s gaze fell as it so often did to the shape of his lips, the two soft peaks, the full lower lip. Her breathing pattern changed, and she forced her heart to please slow down.</p><p>He handed her the mug, handle first, supporting it from the bottom. \u201cCareful. It is quite hot.\u201d</p><p>She nodded but then she caught the scent of the coffee in the mug\u2014and then the smell of him. It was so very wonderful, very male, and was that just a hint of coffee coming from him?</p><p>She now held the mug in her right hand. He was about to pull away when she caught his hand and drew it to her nose. She took an unladylike sniff then buried her nose in his skin. \u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou smell like coffee. Did you spill some on yourself?\u201d She looked up at him. His lips parted and the scent of him began to roll in heavy waves so that she was surrounded by his scent. The smell of fresh-roasted coffee beans flooded the space.</p><p>She released his hand with a gasp.</p> <p>\u201cI must go,\u201d he said, his voice barely a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d She felt suddenly desperate to keep him near.</p><p>\u201cActually, Jean-Pierre,\u201d Parisa said. \u201cWe were hoping that you would stay with Fiona for a little while. I need to speak with Antony, and Havily needs to get back to the admin offices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBien s\u00fbr,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. He sounded strange, like he was in shock.</p><p>Fiona didn\u2019t know what prompted her but she lowered her shields and at the same moment shut out the mental exclamations emanating from both Parisa and Havily as they left the room. She focused on Jean-Pierre\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>Elle sais. Maintenant, elle sais. She knows. She knows. I can see it in her eyes. I ache for her. I must leave but I cannot make my feet move. I want my mouth on her, on her lips, her breasts, between her legs, sucking ...</p> <p>She drew back and realized her mug-holding wrist was growing lax. She righted the mug before she tipped the steaming contents on her lap. She drew the brown ceramic to her lips. She shored up the shields of her mind. Had she even said good-bye to Havily and Parisa? No. Had she really taken the warrior\u2019s hand and pressed it to her face to smell him? Yes.</p><p>She shook her head then sipped her coffee. She didn\u2019t understand what was happening. After a moment, she asked, \u201cJean-Pierre, what\u2019s going on? I ... I\u2019ll confess I just read your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did? But how? I did not feel you in my head.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him over the rim. She sipped the coffee, careful not to burn her tongue. Oh, how to explain? She met his gaze and thought she would drown in the sight of him. He was so beautiful and his eyes were the color of the ocean and his smell an aphrodisiac.</p><p>Desire flowed over her now as though some floodgate had been released in her, something she had not felt for a man in decades. The blood tonic she had been forced to drink following each drain had always resulted in a powerful orgasm, but this was different.</p><p>From the time she could remember, even as a child, the eldest of eight siblings, she had been a woman of decision. When she saw what she wanted or what needed to be done, she took action. That she had been enslaved for over a hundred years was a circumstance she viewed as a terrible inconvenient breach in her life.</p><p>She understood that she would need some form of healing and therapy; that was a given. And as soon as the doctors released her from the hospital, she would get all that set up\u2014not just for herself but for the other slaves as well.</p><p>But this was a new world and a new life. She desired this thoughtful warrior who had given her back a precious locket and asked, Can I bring you something?</p> <p>Yes, she would begin her new life now, and she would begin by taking something she wanted.</p><p>She set the mug on the table beside her. She knew what she had to do. \u201cYou should shut the blinds,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd close the door.\u201d She watched his face. His sensual lips were now set in a grim, determined line, even the points flattened ... a little.</p><p>\u201cI should not,\u201d he said, lowering his head, his gazing falling to her lips. Had he read her mind?</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She heard the blinds close from across the room. The warrior had not even moved. So much power in this dimension. When the door closed as well, she leaned back on the pillows. \u201cWill you kiss me now, Warrior? Will you let me thank you for carrying me out of that terrible place?\u201d Her breaths were high in her chest. She had not felt the touch of a man in decades, not in over a century, not in this way since the night of her eleventh anniversary.</p><p>\u201cI should not kiss you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think I cannot help myself.\u201d His voice was hoarse and his gaze was fixed to her lips, but he moved very slowly, a kind of lingering fall as he lowered himself to her, planting his hands on the raised bed to either side of her pillow, his hips suspended just above the side of the bed.</p><p>She saw only his mouth but coffee swirled around her in decadent enticement, until she was dizzy and so warm and wet between her legs that she was ready for sex without even having touched him. How strange was this? How mysterious? How extraordinary?</p><p>As she closed her eyes, his lips met hers, and his breath was all coffee and sweetness with an undertaste of maleness that clenched her deep within and made her gasp. She hadn\u2019t made love in so long yet here she was, remembering the how of it, as though it had been yesterday.</p><p>But there was something more, something she didn\u2019t understand while he kissed her. She felt a pressure on her mind and knew it was Jean-Pierre\u2019s touch. Yet it was more than simple telepathy, because no words formed; he was just there and very present. It was so strange, yet wholly erotic. So erotic that she felt very close with just his lips pressed in a gentle kiss. Her breasts ached and her lips felt swollen and needy. Internally, very deep, she felt movement within, her body trying to pull at something that wasn\u2019t there yet, getting ready, so very ready.</p><p>Then she realized that she was a touch away from the pinnacle of pleasure. And all he\u2019d done was press those sensual lips against her mouth.</p><p>The moment his tongue touched her lips she grabbed his arms above her, opened her eyes, met his and held on. She cried out, stunned because of what was happening to her. The orgasm was a quick ride over her tender flesh, and a pulsing inside that went on and on. She panted against his mouth.</p><p>He drew back, just a few inches. His eyes flared, \u201cAre you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cMon dieu,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>When the spasms ceased she lay back against the bed, staring up at him. Her hands still gripped his arms. She couldn\u2019t seem to let go of him. She didn\u2019t want to let go. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and smiled that beautiful smile of his. \u201cWell, I am French\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jean-Pierre savored the hands still gripping his arms, the swollen lips, the flush on Fiona\u2019s cheeks, the startled surprise in her eyes. So his woman, who was not his woman, had just fallen into le petit mort, the little death, a beautiful climax. Mon dieu.</p><p>She was lovely, a great beauty with hair like dark rich wood, deep brown with glints of auburn. It hung almost to her elbows in elegant waves. But her eyes, a silver-blue like fine silk, now glittered with passion. Her nose was straight, very pretty, her cheeks round, high, and lovely. Her jaw was a smooth line.</p><p>Her complexion was very light, almost porcelain, but then she had been badly used, her blood taken from her, her life nearly stolen from her just a few days ago. There would be more color soon, although the blush on her cheeks just now was exquisite.</p><p>He smiled down at her. He wanted to kiss her again, but it seemed redundant.</p><p>She smiled in return, her row of even teeth returning. His heart swelled in his chest. Finally, she released his arms and he drew back. But he didn\u2019t move very far away.</p><p>Her gaze shifted to the window suddenly and she frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He turned to look outside as well.</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw something, a shimmering out there on the lawn.\u201d</p><p>A shape materialized. At first, Jean-Pierre couldn\u2019t make it out but after a moment, he realized he was looking at the back of Medichi, in kilted battle gear. Yes, Medichi, although what was he doing out on the lawn? He\u2019d just been in the hallway talking to Colonel Seriffe, but hadn\u2019t he been wearing jeans?</p><p>The hairs on his neck lifted and he rose upright.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Fiona asked. \u201cYou seem tense all of a sudden. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>He could not keep his gaze from the sight of Medichi on the lawn. Oui, something was wrong.</p><p>He glanced at Fiona. \u201cPlease excuse me. I need to speak to one of my warrior brothers. This is not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He did not want to leave her. The urge to remain beside her, to have his sword in his hand as he watched over her, was profound. But he had to go.</p><p>He took a deep breath and forced himself to move.</p><p>Once in the hall, the hairs rose again: Medichi was still in the hall talking to Seriffe, and yes, he wore his jeans. So what was that on the lawn? Jean-Pierre called sharply, \u201cMedichi, where is your woman?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat? Parisa? I\u2019m not sure. He looked around. I think she was headed toward the lobby with Havily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind her at once. Something is wrong. I saw you just now on the front lawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI do not know what I was looking at, because here you are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Medichi looked the opposite direction. \u201cHologram,\u201d he cried. He did not say a word to Colonel Seriffe but began to run.</p><p>Jean-Pierre, his instincts burning, hurried back to Fiona\u2019s bedside. He moved between her bed and the window.</p><p>And yes, he folded his sword into his hand and stared at what must be an imposter\u2014or a dreaded hologram\u2014out on the lawn.</p> <p>Parisa left the hospital by the front sliders because she saw Antony halfway down the greenbelt, his hands on his hips. He had changed into kilted battle gear and looked around as if trying to figure something out.</p><p>\u201cAntony,\u201d she called to him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He turned to face her and waved her forward.</p><p>Strange.</p><p>She had an appointment in half an hour with the officer in charge of the Militia Warrior Training Camps, Female Division, and she didn\u2019t want to be late. She decided to work on her folding skills instead of just walking to Antony\u2019s position.</p> <p>But as she thought the thought and entered nether-space, she could have sworn she heard Antony behind her crying out, \u201cNoooo!\u201d</p><p>As she touched down, another thought skidded through her mind\u2014where were the scars on Antony\u2019s back?</p><p>She blinked at \u201cAntony,\u201d who wasn\u2019t smiling and who looked odd. The hairs on the nape of her neck rose. No. Oh, no.</p><p>She lifted her arm to fold, but she wasn\u2019t fast enough. \u201cAntony\u201d smiled and put his hand on her shoulder before she could think the thought. The image of her warrior dissolved before her eyes. Rith appeared, smiling, a dark light in his eye.</p><p>He had deceived her again and just like that she was flying through nether-space, at his mercy. She had no time to respond and she felt like such a fool as she landed hard, stumbled, and fell to a hard, dusty terra-cotta floor.</p><p>She tried to rise but couldn\u2019t. A powerful field held her pinned down.</p> <p>The air barely moved through the stuffy, dark building. She looked around. A single torch burned at the far end. The walls were also terra-cotta in color and carved with symbols she didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>She felt a slight breeze, but Rith was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cParisa.\u201d Antony\u2019s voice drew her to lift her head up. The field barely allowed her to do that. She could hardly see him from her position on the floor. But there he was, standing with his hands pushing at an unseen barrier.</p><p>\u201cDid you trace after me?\u201d she asked. Dust got in her nose, and she sneezed.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, what have I done?\u201d she cried.</p><p>And where was Rith?</p><p>Medichi\u2019s instincts had overrun his good sense. A vampire, capable of appearing in the form of any other Second Earth ascender, would have more plans in place than just taking Parisa away again.</p> <p>So he\u2019d followed a trace that in previous encounters had been blocked. And now he was trapped. He stood in the middle of what looked like some kind of religious shrine. And just like Parisa, he was boxed in by a preternatural field.</p><p>Air movement made him automatically flex his wrist as he attempted to draw his sword into his hand, but\u2014surprise\u2014it didn\u2019t work. In the distance, in an adjoining room perhaps, he heard the rattle of a cart. At that moment, he knew fear, the kind that drew his stomach into a knot.</p><p>The air in the chamber was stifling\u2014the smell of a room that hadn\u2019t had a window opened in years. He glanced around. Centuries maybe.</p><p>A single torch burned at the far end of the space. An opening led to another part of whatever hell this was.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t move,\u201d Parisa called out, but she coughed again and dust billowed up around her.</p><p>\u201cLie still.\u201d Was that the best he could do? Tell his woman to lie still?</p><p>He spent the next several minutes testing the shield around him. He\u2019d seen this kind of shielding before. Alison had been able to create it during her one-on-one arena battle with Leto. This was not one of Medichi\u2019s gifts, but apparently Rith excelled at it.</p><p>He mentally pushed against every boundary but found the composition impenetrable.</p><p>A man appeared at the open doorway near the torch. He was pushing a cart that carried medical equipment. He wore a mask and green scrubs.</p><p>Medichi felt his heart give way as he recognized the tubing. \u201cNo,\u201d he shouted, but the man, with dark skin and Asian features, ignored him.</p><p>The cart stopped beside Parisa.</p><p>Medichi battled the field, punching at it, throwing himself against the invisible wall. He aimed high, he aimed low. He levitated but the swift movement caused him to hit his head on the top of the shield and he fell onto the floor ... hard.</p><p>The man knelt beside Parisa, waved his hand, then propped her up to a reclining position. The field seemed designed to restrain Parisa exclusively, because the man had no trouble reaching her. He could do whatever the hell he wanted. He had control over her, but she couldn\u2019t move, even if he shifted her position.</p><p>He elevated Parisa\u2019s arm and strapped it down to a flat board. He inserted a needle attached to the tubing, and immediately the blood started to flow.</p><p>Medichi shouted but got no reaction at all.</p><p>Parisa stared at her arm for a long moment. She tried to wiggle, to move, but couldn\u2019t do anything. Her beautiful creamy complexion was covered in orange dust. Her dark hair had a fine coating as well.</p><p>After a moment, as the first bag filled up and the man clamped the tube in order to change out the bags, tears began to stream down her face. \u201cNo,\u201d she cried. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Only then did her gaze turn to Medichi.</p><p>In a terrible hard flash, he traveled back thirteen centuries, only this time the blood was draining from between his woman\u2019s legs because she\u2019d been raped.</p><p>Medichi blinked, trying to clear the images but couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t meet Parisa\u2019s gaze because he didn\u2019t even see her. He just saw his wife\u2019s pleading expression as life drained out of her, the white cotton gown torn, bloodstained, her breasts bared to the room.</p><p>How the hell was he back here again, after all this time?</p><p>He sank to the floor, his knees bent, his arms clasped around his legs.</p><p>How the fuck had he ended up here ... again?</p><p>He closed his eyes and drew a long deep breath through his nostrils. He\u2019d failed Parisa as he\u2019d failed his wife and even though his mind understood that life couldn\u2019t always be controlled, what stupidity of his had brought him back here? This couldn\u2019t be an accident that he sat on this floor powerless to help the woman he loved.</p><p>Death is a mirror.</p><p>\u2014Collected Proverbs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Parisa had been counting. The med tech was on the third bag. How many bags of blood could the human body supply? Already she was feeling funny, a little faint, light-headed, even ... happy. She had heard euphoria was a sign of blood loss.</p><p>The roll of another set of wheels on terra-cotta sounded behind her. She craned her neck to look. A second cart approached. This time a woman arrived wearing blue scrubs and a mask, yelling in a foreign tongue. The med tech sat back on his heels and flipped her off.</p><p>The rattling of her cart got really loud, and the next thing Parisa knew her other arm was being strapped down to another board. But a bag of blood, not her own, hung from the side of the cart. The needle punctured her arm. The blood flowed ... into her. Thank God.</p><p>She looked from one arm to the next, her mind refusing to make sense of what was happening to her. Only when a third technician entered with a defibrillator did the pieces of the puzzle finally fit.</p><p>Images raced through her head of seeing Fiona drained, filled, shocked. Drained, filled, shocked. A century of death and resurrection. A century of seeing other women come and go, giving blood one last time and unable to make the journey back.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be happening. Even though she knew that death vampires hunted mortals and ascenders alike, she had thought herself safe because she was ascended. Wrong.</p><p>What had brought her here to this place? Because she\u2019d seen Antony on the stretch of lawn in front of the hospital? Because she\u2019d trusted him? Because she\u2019d been too quick to act?</p><p>She blinked. She\u2019d started to feel so safe and in control of her life. She\u2019d started to believe that all would be well. She\u2019d been laughing with the other women, powerful women, in Fiona\u2019s hospital room. She\u2019d plotted her course. She would go to the training camps and become a warrior, make a difference in the war.</p><p>She stared at Antony, sitting on the floor with his arms clasped around his knees, his jeans now dusty. What had he said to her? You keep yourself apart.</p><p>She\u2019d started to change that, she really had, or thought she had. But as her mind drifted over her decision to enter the training camps she realized she would be learning skills but probably not encouraging friendships. Her body would become tough and she\u2019d learn martial arts and the ability to defend herself, to make use of the sword and dagger and the ability to attack the enemy. She\u2019d learn major flight skills as well.</p><p>But that was all external activity and skill-acquiring.</p><p>It came to her in the strangest flash that all she\u2019d be doing is switching one controlled world for another. The new world just involved making war. The previous one involved reading and shelving books, keeping her world tight and controlled. But there was something very tight and orderly about a library, not unlike the military.</p><p>She would have no real friends, no real connections, not even a true relationship with Antony.</p><p>Air movement off to her right, just beyond the first tech, brought her gaze to ... Rith. He smiled. \u201cThis is where you always belonged. Keeping you like a beloved pet in Burma sickened me every day. Now you no longer fill the future streams. Your ribbon has disappeared.\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou must thank me, you know. The Commander suggested you be removed from this world ... permanently. Dear Parisa, there was a time when I wished for that as well but then a new plan occurred to me, a more complete plan.\u201d He waved his hand over the medical equipment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want this,\u201d she screamed. She tried to lift even one of her arms but both were secured in place. \u201cI\u2019d rather be dead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugged. \u201cI believe that is your choice. Didn\u2019t Fiona tell you it\u2019s a matter of will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you hate me so much?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause he favored you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe? As in Commander Greaves? The one who wants me dead?\u201d She couldn\u2019t have heard him right. He was making no sense.</p> <p>Rith nodded. \u201cHe forged a link with you, remember?\u201d</p><p>Enlightenment dawned. Rith was jealous. \u201cYou call that favoring me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else? I\u2019d seen you in the future streams and I told him you needed to be destroyed, but he wouldn\u2019t have it. He wanted to make use of you. Only now, after his voyeur-link proved ineffectual and you succeeded in taking some of my blood donors, has he has decided you must die.</p><p>\u201cBut your service here is a much more fitting plan. Your blood will command an excellent price on the market.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>A black brow rose. \u201cI keep forgetting that you aren\u2019t well versed in our world yet. The drinking of dying blood always relates back to the mortal or ascender whose blood is being imbibed. You\u2019re very powerful, you\u2019re the mortal-with-wings, as you will always be known, and your blood will have exceptional qualities that in turn will enhance the powers of the recipient. The more powerful that recipient, the greater the benefits of the donor blood. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Since her heart had started to sink, she could only dip her chin. Oh, God.</p><p>He laughed again, a hollow sound in the dim light. He was standing with his hands clasped behind his back, his expression calm, almost disinterested. \u201cBut I suppose none of this was truly your fault. You could not help the level of your power, and unfortunately Commander Greaves\u2019s flaw is his desire to flaunt his victories. He truly enjoyed having possession of you and letting all his allies know.</p><p>\u201cI am not encumbered by such a flaw. My purpose in life is but to serve him.\u201d He looked away from her as he spoke, as though talking only to himself. He sighed. \u201cLife can be cruel in a great variety of ways. His will must be my will, in all things.\u201d He shifted his gaze back to her, his stare cold and quite indifferent.</p><p>His logic was so perverted, his intentions so vile, that a new kind of horror gripped her chest making it hard to breathe. Rith had no intention of letting her live for very long, despite his claim that he intended to profit from her blood. His purpose was deeper, more nefarious. He wanted to punish her because she had been \u201cfavored.\u201d No doubt when he was satisfied, he would simply let her die.</p><p>\u201cWhat of Warrior Medichi?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>His gaze flicked in Antony\u2019s direction, then returned to her. \u201cHe will be executed at the hour Greaves wishes. It will not be long.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his arm and vanished.</p><p>Dizziness drifted through her mind yet she felt strangely relaxed, even sleepy. What bag was the tech filling now? Four? Five?</p><p>Medichi had remained silent. There was no point in shouting at a man who had him locked in a preternatural cage of energy.</p><p>He had to figure this out.</p><p>He sat on the floor, his arms still slung around his knees, his eyes closed.</p><p>When Rith had appeared, all he\u2019d wanted to do was rage at him but what good would that have done? Rith held all the cards and right now Medichi needed to think.</p><p>He sent a telepathic cry for help out to Endelle. If anyone could hear him, she could. But his thoughts hit a shield and bounced back to him, a lumbering sensation that rolled through his head. Another shield, another dome of mist or two, Rith\u2019s specialty.</p> <p>He had no hope of finding Endelle or one of his warrior brothers or of being found, not shielded like this, not caught below the mist. So how the hell was he supposed to get out of here, Parisa with him?</p><p>He doubted that even a telepathic link would work in this environment.</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at Parisa. She lay quietly now, her eyes closed. He scooted closer, to the point that the field stopped him. He was only three feet away from her, three feet and completely impotent.</p><p>The blood leaving her arm filled the bag swiftly. The blood entering her body moved at maybe a third of the pace, enough room to allow for death. Of course. She had to die in order to produce dying blood. Then be brought back to life to sustain Greaves\u2019s operation. All twenty-one facilities around the world did indeed have to be found and destroyed.</p><p>But that was a job for the future.</p><p>He rose to his feet and started to pace what amounted to his cell.</p><p>Antony, Parisa sent out to him. He paced to the end of the narrow shield and pressed himself against the unyielding boundary.</p><p>I\u2019m here, he sent. I\u2019m trying to figure this out. There has to be a way.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, she said. She opened her eyes, barely.</p><p>For what? he cried within her mind\u2014too strongly, because she winced.</p><p>I was reckless and stubborn. I thought I understood what I could do on Second Earth to help, to make a difference, to become a warrior like you. I was fooling myself.</p><p>You wanted to serve in the Militia. It\u2019s an honorable goal. Now he was defending her choices?</p><p>But I hadn\u2019t changed anything, not really. I hadn\u2019t changed. Her voice drifted away. What did she mean?</p><p>He felt panicky. He could feel her leaving him. Parisa, he called to her. His heart thumped in his chest. Oh, God. Oh, God. The techs were moving around now in choreographed precision. They\u2019d done this before.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to her!\u201d he shouted. He already knew but the feeling of impotence crawled over every inch of his skin like a sudden burning. Shouting was all he could do.</p><p>The techs ignored him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold the rage back. He paced the small five-foot length of the shielded box in which he was trapped. He roared at the ceiling at the knowledge that his woman was being drained for her dying blood so that she could feed a thousand addicted death vampires and that she might or might not make it back to him.</p><p>That last thought brought him to the dusty brick floor. His knees banged hard but the physical pain was the least of what he was feeling. He lifted his hands to the heavens and roared long and loud.</p><p>He felt her die.</p><p>He felt her die.</p><p>The roaring changed to a keening sound and he wrapped his arms around his chest and rocked back and forth. What had he done? What had he done?</p><p>Even if she made it back, what could he do for her? For himself?</p><p>He was trapped. They were both trapped.</p><p>And there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do.</p><p>Medichi came to an awareness that his pattern of keeping a safe emotional distance from the rest of the world, and of using brute strength to get a job done, wasn\u2019t enough in this situation. He thought it a poetic piece of irony that he was separated from Parisa by two powerful force fields.</p><p>He\u2019d lived unto himself, not making connections for thirteen centuries for fear of getting too close to anyone again and risking the pain of loss should they die. When he ascended and experienced his initial onset of power, he felt invincible as he exacted his revenge.</p><p>Invited into the Warriors of the Blood soon after, he\u2019d taken on the new mantle. He had felt born again, a new creature birthed in blood and power. He was good at making war, at fighting and killing death vampires, and the rest of the warriors were the same. They were a band of brothers, eight strong.</p><p>But with all that power, here he stood, trapped and separated from Parisa, unable to help her or himself. He served as her Guardian of Ascension. He was supposed to protect her, but he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t protect her because he\u2019d kept his distance. When he spoke of completing the breh-hedden it had never been about caring for her. No, he\u2019d spoken in practical terms, that the natural bonding that occurred would make it possible to know where she was at all times, to feel what she felt, and to come to her aid with a mere whispered thought. Both Kerrick and Marcus could do this as a result of completing the breh-hedden with their mates.</p><p>But he had never wanted the connection and maybe for that reason she had so easily separated herself from him, moved to the guest room where she\u2019d spent the night.</p><p>Now he was paying for it, paying for all the ways he\u2019d held back from her. Would she have been more inclined to complete the breh-hedden if he had just opened his heart to her, really opened his heart, loved her, made her feel safe, that he would never leave her, walk out on her as her fianc\u00e9 once had?</p><p>The defibrillator wound up, a scream in the dim torchlight. The female tech called out. Hands flew back. There was a loud thump, then another and another. His stomach turned.</p><p>Live, he shouted within Parisa\u2019s mind. Live, dammit. What would he do if she died? How could he live without her?</p><p>The defibrillator cried shrilly again. Another shout. Another thump. Parisa\u2019s body jerked against the dusty floor. Another dusty cloud drifted around her.</p><p>Live, he sent. Live, live, live, live. The chant grew in his mind, expanded and grew until at last her chest rose, she drew a breath, and one of the techs put a stethoscope over her heart.</p><p>When the pair leaned back and started tending once more to their equipment, when he saw Parisa\u2019s chest rise and fall in the dim light even if her eyes didn\u2019t open, only then did he draw a breath of his own.</p><p>He released a heavy groan. He rocked some more.</p><p>Parisa opened her eyes. Her chest hurt. She felt as though she\u2019d had big rocks thrown at her rib cage, one after the other, for about a year. She saw the green scrubs of the male tech. He was packing up. His job was done.</p><p>She shifted her head to the other side. The woman, with her sour black eyes and furrowed brow, met her gaze for a split second then looked away. She, too, was packing up her supplies, impatient to be going.</p><p>So, she\u2019d made it back.</p><p>She felt ill. Her chest really hurt and she was so dizzy. She wanted to sleep but something was left undone.</p><p>Her gaze moved around the room.</p><p>There. Opposite her. Antony, she whispered softly in her mind. She couldn\u2019t have opened her mouth to speak if she\u2019d wanted to.</p><p>I\u2019m here, he sent.</p><p>She had trouble seeing him. She squinted. Antony\u2019s dark eyes glittered in the dim torchlight. He looked angry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sleep, he sent.</p><p>Her eyes closed. Yes.</p><p>When Parisa awoke the second time, she had no way of knowing how long she had slept. The room was now pitch black, the torchlight having gone out. She thought it fitting. Why waste light on slaves?</p> <p>She sighed. She listened hard. She heard Medichi breathing, long and regular. He was asleep. She had a moment of panic and almost spoke aloud to wake him then she thought better of it. Time to think, to make sense of her new reality, to let him rest, to figure this out. She had to get out of here. She couldn\u2019t let this be the end and she didn\u2019t want Antony to die because she\u2019d allowed Rith to trick her ... again.</p><p>From the first time she\u2019d mounted her wings, from the time she\u2019d felt that strange tingling in a V down her back, her life had been an odd series of experiences, like scattered glass pieces. She\u2019d kept trying to put those bits together into a picture, but before she had time to finish, something would knock all the pieces out of the frame. She\u2019d have to begin again, just like now.</p><p>This time, the glass pieces had arranged themselves according to Rith\u2019s orchestrated pattern and she\u2019d become something horrible, something she had never thought she would be\u2014a blood slave.</p><p>The question was, what could she do about it?</p><p>Her analytical mind kicked into high gear. She was flat on her back, on a filthy, dusty floor, in a room without light of any kind. She had no idea where she was, which part of the world she was in, or even whether she was on Mortal or Second Earth.</p> <p>At least both arms were free now, free to move the few inches up. She touched the field. For some reason, of all the things that had happened to her, feeling this field, which kept her imprisoned again, sent fury writhing through her, compressing her chest, swelling her neck, causing her throat to seize, especially since she wanted to scream but she wouldn\u2019t, not when Antony needed his sleep.</p><p>After a long moment, when her heart had calmed back down, she drew deep calming breaths. It was time to think, not to freak out.</p><p>She had power, a lot of power, that much she understood. She had thrown a hand-blast at Endelle before she had even ascended, without even knowing what a hand-blast was. She had sent the Supreme High Administrator of all Second Earth flying over and behind her desk. She had done that.</p><p>All her life she had felt powerless. Now she had an abundance of it yet was still trapped. What on earth did this mean?</p><p>Something needed to change, something she didn\u2019t understand, not yet.</p><p>She drew more deep breaths, one after the other. From what she understood, Alison had also ascended with a phenomenal amount of power, and she had created similar restraining energy fields during her arena battle with Leto.</p> <p>Huh. Parisa began pushing at the field over her. She held her palm flat and released a small pulse of energy, a tiny hand-blast. Thank God she hadn\u2019t gone full-bore because the energy caught on the field and traveled like lightning in a thousand directions at once above her, leaving her covered with small burns. She could smell singed fabric as well.</p><p>Okay, no hand-blasts.</p><p>She breathed some more, one breath then another.</p><p>She recalled being in Fiona\u2019s hospital room with Havily and Alison. A sisterhood.</p><p>Never had Parisa felt as close to other women as in that moment. Their sufferings, their shared power, their difficulty with mate-bonding had given them much in common.</p><p>As a child, she had never stayed in one place long enough to develop friendships, real friendships. She had always been the outsider, never quite fitting in, always the object of jealousy in the friendship twosomes that dominated schoolyards. Having boyfriends during those years had been equally impossible.</p><p>Her life had been colored, shaped, pummeled by her early experiences and her parents had been just flighty enough that they hadn\u2019t recognized or understood her suffering, or that her development was being warped. They had shared a love of moving around and experiencing new places but she had been left to tag along without either of her parents recognizing there might be repercussions.</p><p>She had fallen into a pattern of survival that had always required that she remain ... aloof. And yes, inaccessible.</p> <p>She felt defensive suddenly because the person she\u2019d grown up to be wasn\u2019t her fault. She wanted to wrap her arms around her chest but the field wouldn\u2019t allow it. In this hateful captivity, she couldn\u2019t even comfort herself.</p><p>There had to be some reason why she was stuck here. Something she needed to learn. She was convinced that even the worst situations could provide some opportunities for self-knowledge and growth.</p><p>God help her.</p><p>Tears trickled down the sides of her face. She had done her best, she truly had, to make the most of her life. She felt she had succeeded admirably in terms of her career. On Mortal Earth, she had loved being a librarian. Now, here she was in another dimension with plenty of power but apparently not the ability to access it in a way that would allow her to free herself or Antony.</p><p>Again her thoughts returned to Fiona\u2019s hospital room and to that feeling of belonging. Then she\u2019d seen Antony\u2014who was really Rith\u2014on the greenbelt.</p><p>Being grouped around the bed, she\u2019d felt like she belonged.</p><p>But running then folding to Antony had been so rash, so separate from the group, so foolish.</p><p>She knew better. That\u2019s what popped into her head. She knew the level of Rith\u2019s power. Why had she run out onto the lawn, folding to the false Antony, without so much as a whisper of anxiety?</p><p>At the very least, at the very least, she should have looked around, even asked Havily to accompany her outside. Militia Warriors had surrounded the building, protecting those inside, but she had hurried out, separated herself from the group, without a single thought. She had been so used to making decisions on her own behalf for so long, that it hadn\u2019t even occurred to her in that split-second before she folded to Antony that she ought to be careful about leaving the security of the building.</p><p>Her body stilled as her thoughts heated up, as the truth of what she was thinking sank into her bones. Maybe independence was a wonderful attribute, but what had her level of independence, her extreme of independence actually won her?</p><p>She rocked her head back and forth. What had it won her? Well, it was pretty obvious, since she was trapped beneath a field of energy with no way out and that she\u2019d ended up in Rith\u2019s clutches again.</p><p>Her situation suddenly seemed fully of irony. That which she had relied on for so long was in this moment her complete undoing, and not just hers, but the undoing of the man trapped in a separate field opposite her. He had followed her to try and save her and now he was trapped as well and destined to be executed on Greaves\u2019s whim.</p><p>Holy shit. This was all her fault.</p><p>If she had it to do over again, what would she do? She would have paused. At the very least she would have waited to see why Antony was out there. She would have contacted him telepathically. She would have consulted with ascenders who had been on Second Earth a helluva lot longer than her own sweet self.</p><p>Her thoughts took a leap, an important one. Could she turn to the group now? Could she consult with others, say, with Endelle, to help her get out of this fix? Did she have enough power to do that?</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Air whooshed into her lungs. She opened her voyeur\u2019s window and thought of Endelle. The next moment there she was in one of the palace rotundas, surrounded by all the Warriors of the Blood.</p><p>She was about to attempt a communication with Endelle when she heard Thorne cry out, \u201cWe have to assemble the army at once, Endelle. For fuck\u2019s sake, we don\u2019t have a choice. Greaves has just folded another five thousand Militia Warriors and another hundred death vampires to the South Rim.\u201d</p><p>Parisa faltered and her window wavered, a preternatural form of stumbling. Greaves was attacking? The South Rim was at the Grand Canyon. He was bringing an army to Arizona to attack Endelle\u2019s forces? She wasn\u2019t sure, but she thought her situation may have just gotten worse.</p><p>Oh, whatever.</p><p>And here she was with one of their best warriors locked up behind an impenetrable field.</p><p>Parisa moved her window close to Madame Endelle.</p><p>Hey, boss lady, she sent. She wasn\u2019t about to try for subtlety. Parisa here. Are you registering this telepathy?</p><p>Endelle turned to face her off her left shoulder. She stared straight into Parisa\u2019s window and in that moment the Supreme High Administrator opened her own voyeur\u2019s window and met her face to face. It was the weirdest sensation, like two lap-tops facing each other.</p><p>Well, what do you know. She\u2019d done it.</p><p>Endelle turned to the warriors. \u201cI\u2019ve got Parisa in my voyeur window. Hang tight, men.\u201d</p><p>Parisa heard the shouting and whoops of excitement behind Endelle, but Her Supremeness called out, \u201cShut the fuck up! Let me talk to her.\u201d She turned back to Parisa, Okay, so where the hell are you, ascender?</p><p>Trapped in some kind of temple beneath an energy field. Antony is with me trapped under a separate field.</p><p>I\u2019m going to pan back. Don\u2019t fucking move.</p><p>Endelle did just as she said. Parisa watched her window move away from her.</p><p>It\u2019s pitch black, the Supreme High Administrator shouted, which of course was like knives through Parisa\u2019s head, but hey, she\u2019d made contact. Endelle could shout all she wanted. I can\u2019t see a fucking thing.</p><p>No shit, Parisa responded. Can you get a fix on me, on Antony? Can you fold us the hell out of here?</p><p>Endelle closed her eyes but after a moment opened them. No can do.</p><p>Can you tell me how to get out of these fields then?</p><p>Endelle shook her head. Not my power. Let me bring Alison in. \u201cKerrick,\u201d she called out. \u201cGet Alison over here, on the double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>Parisa panned back and watched Kerrick whip his phone to his ear. She looked from one warrior to the next. They looked wrecked, stunned, and a little confused probably because she\u2019d made contact and because, oh, yeah, Greaves was planning what sounded like a major offensive at the Grand Canyon. She also recognized Colonel Seriffe, head of the Militia Warriors.</p><p>Thorne drew a little closer. \u201cWhat the hell is going on, Endelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParisa and Medichi are trapped somewhere beneath energy fields, the kind Alison created in the arena battle. So, yeah, they\u2019re alive.\u201d More shouting went up, quieter, but Endelle scowled at her warriors. \u201cCelebrate later. We\u2019re in trouble here. Energy fields. Got it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The boys settled down.</p><p>Parisa saw a shimmering beside Endelle, then Alison came into view. A few seconds of explanation and Endelle put her hand on Alison\u2019s forehead, which allowed the powerful ascender to see Parisa, window-to-window. She made eye contact with Parisa.</p><p>An energy field? Alison sent.</p> <p>Yep. I\u2019m flat on the floor. I can\u2019t even lift my arms up. How do I get out of this? I haven\u2019t tried to work with energy fields before but I thought maybe since I could throw a hand-blast and dematerialize ...</p><p>Right, Alison sent. She took a deep breath. The first time I erected a field, I just thought the thought. And you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not unlike folding or throwing a hand-blast, just another aspect of power.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t very helpful. Alison looked behind her. Parisa panned back to see what Alison was seeing. The warriors were talking.</p><p>Oh, dear God, Alison murmured inside Parisa\u2019s head.</p><p>What? What\u2019s going on?</p> <p>Have you heard this stuff about Greaves and his army?</p><p>Yes, that he\u2019s gathering his troops at the Grand Canyon.</p><p>He\u2019s challenged Endelle to a battle. Thorne just said that Stannett checked in earlier and said unless there was some kind of miracle, she\u2019d lose today.</p><p>Parisa\u2019s heart sank. She needed her own miracle to stay alive and to keep Antony alive, but she needed to let Endelle and Alison go right now so that they could work on this much bigger issue. She searched through her mind and had a thought. Alison, I know you need to leave, but is there a chance you could download your \u201cfield\u201d abilities straight into my head? I can take it. I know I can because I\u2019ve had Endelle in my head and Antony as well. Will you do that for me?</p><p>Alison turned back to look at her.</p><p>Endelle butted in. Of course she\u2019ll do it but hurry the fuck up. Get yourself out of that hellhole and would you please fucking complete the breh-hedden?</p> <p>Alison didn\u2019t miss a beat. Ignore her, Parisa. Just take your situation one step at a time, okay? Are you ready?</p><p>Yes. Do it.</p><p>The images of the arena battle from seven months ago began to flow through Parisa\u2019s mind. She knew enough about taking someone else\u2019s memories to keep her shields down. She saw the battle with Leto in an instant replay: the cutting off of his arm, the reversal of the time-pocket, Leto\u2019s counterattack, then Alison erecting the energy field, effectively trapping the warrior on the black mats of the battle zone.</p><p>It was over in seconds.</p><p>Parisa blinked into the pitch black for one, two, three seconds. She smiled. Thanks, Alison. I think I\u2019ve got it. Tell the warriors I\u2019ll do my best to bring Antony home.</p><p>You go, girl.</p><p>Parisa closed her voyeur\u2019s window.</p><p>You go, girl. Was there a sweeter, more sisterly thing Alison could have said?</p> <p>Parisa closed her eyes and let Alison\u2019s memories flow once more, feeling exactly how Alison had built the field. But could it be done in reverse and with someone else\u2019s energy creation?</p><p>She turned her hand palm up and held her hand against the field. Removing a field meant taking the energy in, not releasing it. But it was Rith\u2019s energy. Could you take someone else\u2019s energy into your body?</p><p>She almost thought the thought, but held back. Maybe some sort of \u201cground\u201d would help. She planted the fingertips of her left hand onto the terra-cotta bricks next to her just in case the energy needed someplace else to go.</p><p>She thought the thought and as though she\u2019d opened a valve, the energy started flowing into her hand in a terrible numbing sensation. Just as she\u2019d expected, it traveled up her arm, across her shoulder, her chest, to her opposite shoulder, down her left arm, and began to flow through her fingertips and into the bricks.</p><p>It took only a matter of seconds but by the time she was done she was panting and her chest hurt. Too much energy, too soon after being brought back to life with those fucking defibrillator paddles.</p><p>She reached up a weary hand\u2014and no more field. The sudden relief eased the physical pain.</p><p>But she still couldn\u2019t see a damn thing despite her preternatural vision. Apparently the eyes needed some light to work with.</p><p>She crawled on her knees in the direction of Antony\u2019s strong, even breathing. At least the warrior had gotten some sleep.</p><p>When she reached the field around him, she groaned. It was much larger than hers\u2014more a jail cell than a coffin. She thought maybe a different pathway would help, so she stood up, put her left hand on the field, and kicked off her shoes.</p><p>She refused to think about how uncomfortable this was going to be. Instead, she just let the energy flow. She tensed then relaxed and realized her decision had been a good one. The energy moved straight down her left side, missing her heart altogether.</p><p>When the last of it was gone she called Antony\u2019s name.</p><p>I searched for you</p><p>In the wilderness</p><p>I called your name at the darkest hour</p><p>I broke every promise</p><p>And shattered the unknown</p><p>I called your name when my heart was open</p><p>And you were there, Beloved,</p><p>You were there.</p><p>\u2014Collected Poems, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Medichi awoke to the sweetest sound in the world\u2014Parisa speaking his name.</p><p>\u201cParisa? You sound so close, but I can\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to startle you.\u201d</p><p>She was closer now, closer than she should be, like really close. Was he dreaming? He sat up then gained his feet. He put his hands out in front of him. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here. I ... well, how do I say this ... I contacted Endelle through our mutual voyeur windows. She brought in Alison, who sent me a nice little download all about energy fields. They\u2019re gone. The fields are gone.\u201d</p><p>Relief washed through him like a flash flood during a monsoon storm. His knees buckled but he caught himself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding\u201d came out of his mouth. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s fantastic.\u201d He grabbed for her and the next moment she was in his arms and flat against his chest, stuck to him like a wet autumn leaf. A series of sobs bounced her beautiful breasts against his. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You did great. It\u2019s okay. I can\u2019t believe it. You\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and cried but after a moment she took a deep breath. She pulled back but only far enough so that her hair brushed his chin. His nose started itching, and a second later he sneezed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m covered in that awful dust. Antony, what do we do now?\u201d</p><p>Just as the words left her mouth, a distant light flicked on and Rith\u2019s voice echoed across the room. \u201cReady for the next round, my dear?\u201d The rattling of wheels sounded at the same time.</p><p>The field was gone. Was it possible he could fold? Would it be this simple?</p><p>One thing was for sure, he wasn\u2019t going to wait around to find out.</p><p>Medichi clutched her close. Just as Rith appeared in the doorway, he thought the thought. The next moment he was holding Parisa in his arms at the foot of his own bed.</p><p>Holy shit, they\u2019d done it!</p><p>\u201cDid we actually make it out?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. We did.\u201d He looked down at her, still clutching her hard against him, afraid she would vanish straight out of his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat if he follows your trace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried that once before, and I almost had his head. Remember, he\u2019s not a warrior. He\u2019d never be that foolish to come here again although I\u2019d love for him to try.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him. \u201cAntony, we did it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, still stunned. \u201cBut how did you come up with using the voyeur window?\u201d</p><p>At that her expression softened. \u201cI figured something out: I don\u2019t have to go my own path alone anymore. I got us into this mess by chasing Rith\u2019s illusion outside the hospital because all my life I\u2019ve acted independent of everyone. I had to let that thinking go, to think differently. And the moment I had that thought, I remembered that Endelle also had a voyeur\u2019s window. And now here we are.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her hard on the lips and she responded with a low cry in her throat as she threw her arms around his neck. His hand drifted low and caught her buttocks in his hand. He pressed her hard against him.</p><p>After a moment, she drew back. \u201cOh, God, I almost forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the frown? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d He had the worst feeling.</p><p>\u201cGreaves is mounting an attack. He\u2019s been amassing his forces on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Oh, shit. I\u2019ve got to get over there.\u201d</p><p>She grew very still as he pushed her away. He reached for his phone then caught sight of Parisa\u2019s expression. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d She put her fist between her breasts. \u201cAntony, be careful right now. Be careful of the choice you make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so sure you were on the lawn that I rushed into harm\u2019s way without knowing it. I realize there\u2019s a battle taking shape, but don\u2019t rush. I\u2019m here with you now. Take a moment to think what it is you really need to do, what perhaps you and I need to do ... together.\u201d</p><p>He lowered the phone to his side and stared at her. \u201cSomething has changed for you, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, a very soft warm smile. \u201cYes, it has. I\u2019m willing to do things I wasn\u2019t so willing to do a few hours ago.\u201d</p><p>He knew she referred to the breh-hedden. A shiver crossed over his shoulders. \u201cParisa,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cJust think about it, then make your call. I\u2019m going to take a shower, here, in your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He lifted the phone and thumbed. \u201cHey, Jeannie, can you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatching you through to Thorne.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they were in deep shit for Jeannie not even to greet him.</p><p>\u201cGive,\u201d Thorne\u2019s gravel voice barked at him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re out.\u201d</p><p>A long silence, then, \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Parisa who stood next to the shower attempting, not altogether successfully, to fold off her clothes. Her shirt hung off one arm. Not bad for a beginner. The terra-cotta dust clung to her hair, her arms, her pants. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cParisa used Alison\u2019s memories about field construction and somehow disrupted the fields.\u201d</p><p>Thorne whistled. \u201cThat\u2019s one boatload of power but can you hold on for a second?\u201d</p><p>Medichi frowned. \u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>Thorne\u2019s phone went dead. What the fuck? After a moment he came back online. \u201cWe have a sitch over here at the palace but Endelle said she wants the two of you to take some recoup time then check back in, maybe an hour or two. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>Two minutes ago, Medichi would have argued with Thorne. But two minutes ago, Parisa had seemed so very different. Willing.</p><p>\u201cWe can do that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParisa told me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not gonna bust my balls about this order?\u201d</p><p>Medichi smiled. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, fuck me. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d The line went dead.</p><p>He glanced in the direction of the bathroom. steam billowed from the shower.</p><p>He swallowed because right now his woman had to be naked. Her pants were hanging from the mirror frame, the empty mirror frame. Jesus, he really needed to get that replaced.</p><p>When the steam started carrying a light whiff of tangerine, his body responded. He started to pace.</p> <p>He glanced at the ceiling, looked into the bathroom, and maybe it wouldn\u2019t make a damn bit of difference but he created a shallow dome of mist inside both rooms.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so pretty, Antony. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen your mist before. You know, it has almost a golden hue.\u201d</p><p>For whatever reason the very feminine tone of her voice, and the compliment she\u2019d just delivered, brought a rush of affection, even love, flowing through his chest in a warm wave. He put his hand between his pecs and worked at breathing for a good long minute.</p><p>He understood something in this moment\u2014he loved this woman. He loved her. He loved her. He loved being with her and he especially loved that even though she\u2019d just been through one helluva trauma, she could take her shower and say nice things about his mist.</p><p>His heart swelled, pushing his ribs and chest out and out until the whole damn thing broke, a breach in a dam, and love poured from him, a rushing river full of life.</p><p>He was dizzy and struggled to keep his balance, then he fell. He fell onto the Oriental rug. He rolled onto his back, his cheeks rising, his lips curved. He must have looked like an idiot and he knew terra-cotta dust was getting on his fine antique carpet but who the hell cared?</p><p>Love had come to him, had found him, had battered the walls of his heart and his life and had pushed through despite his unwillingness to open himself. He had felt protected, and maybe a little self-righteous being part of the Warriors of the Blood. He\u2019d committed to them, to his brothers, and he\u2019d pretended that this made him all that a man ever really needed to be; powerful, in control, master of his world, a warrior.</p><p>His gaze became focused on the coffer beams overhead, the ones burned with his wife\u2019s poem. Directly above him, the final phrase, Love rises on wings of fire.</p> <p>Understanding spilled over his mind and body. He knew what needed to be done. He understood the greater meanings of the breh-hedden for him and for Parisa. He understood the purpose, at least in part, of the shared royle wings.</p><p>\u201cAntony?\u201d</p><p>He looked over at the opening to the bathroom. Parisa stood in the doorway, naked, water pouring from her long wet hair. Her usual dark brown waves looked black. The shower had stopped running.</p><p>He leaned up on an elbow. He couldn\u2019t help it. He was a man and his woman had the most beautiful breasts. They were large and peaked from the water and the cool air of the room.</p><p>Oh. God.</p><p>But why was she standing there like that. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI felt you.\u201d She put a hand over her heart. \u201cHere, as though you were speaking to me. Were you? Were you trying to say something?\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet, still feeling off kilter, his mind uneven. He drew close and tried to keep his body calm as he approached so much femaleness. He took her hands in his, then bent down and placed a kiss on each.</p><p>His heart started to ache. He lifted his head and met her gaze. \u201cI love you, Parisa.\u201d His voice had sunk low. He was almost whispering. \u201cI love you so much. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get to have one more minute together.\u201d He swallowed hard. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m having trouble breathing.\u201d</p><p>Her amethyst eyes glittered in the soft light of the room. She rose on her tiptoes and kissed him. His heart constricted a little more. \u201cYou love me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said. \u201cI do.\u201d His voice sounded laced now with rocks and thorns. \u201cI love you. I love you. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Antony.\u201d He still had hold of her hands so once more she rose and kissed him. This time her lips lingered and his heart tightened a little more.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how this happened,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m grateful, so grateful. I never thought I\u2019d feel gratitude for the breh-hedden, but I do. I could never have reached for you otherwise, never drawn this close to you without the demands of that myth beating the stubbornness out of me.\u201d He smiled. \u201cSome myth, huh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Her gaze moved back and forth over his as though searching for the truth. Didn\u2019t she believe him?</p><p>\u201cParisa, when I watched you die earlier, and I was unable to do anything about it, I wanted to die, too. The sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWait. But you came to me when I was near death, perhaps even when I was clinically dead. I heard your voice in my head, Live, live. You repeated it over and over.\u201d</p><p>He had.</p><p>\u201cYou brought me back. I know that now. There was a part of me that wanted to die as well and I remembered what Rith said, that coming back is an act of will. So, what happened? What changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came to me.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not given my heart in all these centuries because I didn\u2019t believe I had a heart to give. I buried my heart in my wife\u2019s and son\u2019s graves. When I met Thorne, and learned I had a permanent place in the Warriors of the Blood, I was done with everything else forever.</p><p>\u201cWhen the breh-hedden struck I was enraged because I\u2019d felt the first shattering of the walls I\u2019d built around myself. Truth? I\u2019d convinced myself there were no walls, I\u2019d become a more sensible man. I was a vampire, I had powers, I knew how to make war, so war I would make and everything else could go to hell. I was in good company, too, until Alison arrived and turned Kerrick\u2019s life upside down. Although I think I was even more affected by Havily. I\u2019d already been experiencing affection for her, even at times inappropriate desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really.\u201d Parisa\u2019s eyes darkened.</p><p>His heart gave a little cry of joy. \u201cJealous?\u201d he asked. He slid his arms around her back and pulled her close, even though he was still dust-laden and she was wet. She\u2019d end up muddy but he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cYou just stay away from Havily Morgan, vampire.\u201d She kissed him again, only this one involved a lot of tongue and hard probing until his lips parted and she could force her way into his mouth. He groaned to see his woman intent on staking her claim.</p><p>She put her hand on his shoulder. He felt the vibration of a clothing-fold, but her powers in this area were still clearly lacking. His shirt was now plastered over his face. He was laughing as he sent, Try it again.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d The vibration began and yes, his shirt was off but now his cargoes were caught around his ankles. He fell backward, pulling her with him.</p><p>She was a laughing, muddy mess as she saw what she\u2019d done. He didn\u2019t care. She was in exactly the position he wanted her as he said, \u201cComplete the breh-hedden with me, Parisa, here and now.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose and her body stilled on top of his. He thought the thought and got rid of his pants and steel-toed boots, even his socks.</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there\u2019s something I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d he asked softly. He didn\u2019t want to spook her.</p><p>She smiled, a very soft smile, and put her hand on his cheek. He turned into her hand and put a kiss in the center of her palm. She wiggled her hips against his in response. He groaned.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said, breathless. \u201cThe sex is always great with you. But something has troubled me for days now, since I learned we had the same kind of wings, royle wings. I know that something extraordinary happens when the final link of a breh-hedden settles into place but, Antony I have this feeling\u201d\u2014she leaned sideways slightly to put her fist between her breasts\u2014\u201cright here. I\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><p>He sat up and drew her onto his lap. They were naked and a mess, but whatever this was it had to be settled first. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about our wings?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the same heavy sensation as well. This could be an extension of the breh-hedden, I just don\u2019t know. What I do know is that I don\u2019t care. I want this with you more than anything in the world. I want the added responsibility, and I want the increase in powers. I want you in my life now and forever, no matter what comes, no matter what difficulties emerge, no matter what powers come to us as a couple. I want this because I want you.\u201d</p><p>Tears shimmered in her eyes. \u201cI was so proud of my independence.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut not until I collided with your warrior world did I start to understand that I\u2019d built walls, just like yours, to hold the pain of the world at bay.</p><p>\u201cI never got close to anyone because it hurt too much to leave people behind and to go through the pain of starting over. Now here I am and when you were asleep in that strange place, I awoke trapped but I found my way out by realizing that if I was going to have any hope of living and of getting us both out of there, I would have to find some way of reaching out for help.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when it dawned on me that I might be able to reach Endelle with my voyeur\u2019s window because she has a window as well. When it worked, when I contacted her, I was so not surprised. Our waging an effective war will only work if we join forces. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAfter we brought Fiona and the rest of the blood slaves home, I\u2019d been so puffed up in my new abilities that I\u2019d missed the whole point\u2014we\u2019d brought them home as a unit.\u201d She kissed him. \u201cDo you see? My independence had become an excuse not to get close to anyone. That was why I fell for Rith\u2019s deception\u2014it never occurred to me to question what I was looking at, or to seek counsel from anyone else, or to even contact you mind-to-mind. It was just me, acting alone.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed against him. \u201cNow I\u2019m here. With you. And there\u2019s nowhere else I want to be.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on the back of her neck. \u201cYou still want to be a Militia Warrior?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cTruth? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right path for me or not.\u201d Then she smiled. \u201cI think I need to seek counsel on that one, you know, not make the decision all by myself.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. He kissed her. \u201cSo you think you love me?\u201d The question had just slipped out and his chest seized. What if she didn\u2019t or wasn\u2019t sure? Shit, he should have kept his trap shut.</p><p>But she stroked his cheek. \u201cOh, God. I\u2019m sooo in love with you. I\u2019m bewitched. If you weren\u2019t a good vampire, I\u2019d say you had enthralled me. I think about you all the time, I crave your body, and when I see you my heart aches. How is that even possible? Antony, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Relief was another dam breaking and spilling. But he pressed on: \u201cWill you complete the breh-hedden with me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes. Right here, right now.\u201d She glanced down at her naked breasts and grimaced. \u201cIs that mud?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d He laughed. \u201cWe made mud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we fire up the shower again and take care of business.\u201d</p><p>Shivers rained down his body and his cock responded, hardening, twitching, seeking.</p><p>\u201cSage,\u201d she murmured. She groaned and fell on him, kissing him as she once more forced her tongue into his mouth.</p><p>Her hips were connected low, just in the right place. If he shifted just a little, moved her up then down, he could impale her on him. If the tangerine scent flooding the room meant what it always had before, she\u2019d be ready for him.</p><p>But like hell he was going to do this on the floor covered with mud.</p> <p>He surrounded her with his arms, holding her against him, then with a good old-fashioned piece of levitation he rose up. With her feet dangling off the floor and her arms around his neck, he smiled down into her beautiful face and carried her into the shower.</p><p>He hit the lever and got all eight heads to blasting on them both. She took soap and worked over his body. He turned his back to her and had the pleasure of her hands soaping him from head to foot. It felt cleansing, even healing.</p><p>But when he turned to face her and she started lathering her own chest, he grabbed the bar of soap and growled, \u201cMy turn.\u201d</p><p>She giggled but the resulting wave of tangerine told him exactly how happy she was about his possession of the soap.</p><p>Okay, he was a man, so sue him. He lathered up, let the soap drop to the floor, and put his hands on her extraordinary breasts. She arched her back and his mind spun. His gaze narrowed to the sight of the foamy bubbles drifting over the swell of her skin and parting at the peaked nipple to flow down either side. Oh, God. He pushed her back just a little so that one of the nozzles could aim over her chest and get rid of the soap and the mud and make her skin ready for his mouth.</p><p>Two seconds later he bent low, and with one hand supporting her behind her back, the other holding her very large breast, he took the peaked tip into his mouth and sucked.</p><p>Parisa cried out and clenched deep between her legs. Oh, God. She ached just about everywhere, all around her heart and chest, her nipple, her labia, and in the deep well of her. She hadn\u2019t felt this way before with Medichi and she realized that the decision to let go of independence and embrace love had changed her body\u2019s reactions to the man she\u2019d chosen to be her breh ... or was it the man the breh-hedden had chosen to be her breh. Somehow, none of it mattered, only that she belonged to this man with her entire body, heart, and soul.</p><p>For that reason, each sensation felt doubled, tripled in intensity. Her body cried out to be filled.</p> <p>He cradled and suckled her breast and brought little gasps from her throat. She smoothed her hand over his head, the hair beneath her fingers fine and silky, if a little dusty still. He was a feast for her heart, her mind, her hands, her body. And she loved him.</p><p>\u201cHow about we get cleaned up and move to your bed. I want to be in your bed, Antony, when we go all the way.\u201d He looked up at her, lips sliding away from her breast. A gasp caught in her throat at the sight of her flesh leaving his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo, you want to go all the way?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She giggled. For a moment, they were like teenagers again. \u201cBut you have terra-cotta dust in your hair and I could use one more shampoo.\u201d</p><p>Getting clean took a lot longer than it should have. Parisa kept getting lost in Antony\u2019s arms, primarily because he couldn\u2019t keep his hands off her.</p><p>She finally escaped him and left the shower. If he wanted her he\u2019d have to get the cr\u00e8me rinse out of his hair.</p><p>She dried off, wrapped her hair in a towel, then moved to the bed. She practiced more of her folding as she worked to get the comforter peeled back to a thick bundle at the end of the bed. She almost broke a sweat. She wasn\u2019t sure why this particular power was giving her grief. How the hell could she open a voyeur window, download shield-creation abilities, then destroy a shield, but not be able to fold a stupid comforter off a bed?</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>Just as she\u2019d gotten the top sheet separated from the bottom sheet\u2014even if it did hang over one of the bedposts\u2014Antony came up behind her and encircled her in his arms. \u201cI think you\u2019re getting better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she cried. But she turned in his arms and wrapped her arms around his waist. \u201cSo where were we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraight to the point. I like that about you.\u201d</p><p>She looked down, down his chest and beautiful pecs, down the indentation of his belly button, down the erotic narrow line of hairs that drew her eye lower and lower. He was a hard ridge against her abdomen, and as she leaned back she could see the crown of his cock. Her lips tingled.</p><p>\u201cSee something you like?\u201d His voice was once more at the bottom of the sea.</p><p>She drew back just enough to drift her hand up the length of him. He gasped and hissed.</p><p>Then he stepped away from her. \u201cWe\u2019d better get down to business or my feet won\u2019t have the power to move in about five more seconds.\u201d</p><p>She pivoted on one foot then launched into the air, turning mid-flight so that when she landed on the mattress, she was on her back. Thank goodness she had been quick about it, because he was on top of her at vampire speed, pinning her flat to the bed before she could take a breath.</p><p>Time slowed and she took a moment to register everything, the cool of the sheet behind her back, the heat of his body ready to take her, his long wet hair dragging over her warm breasts, the smile that suffused his oh-so-handsome face with love and laughter.</p><p>Her heart tightened as she reached out to drag her fingers over his high, strong cheekbones. Was she truly going to do this? Was she going to seal her fate with a warrior-vampire?</p><p>\u201cAre we really doing this, Antony?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cScared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little but then I look at you and there\u2019s nothing I want more. But what will happen to us? This will change us, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged as much as he could propped on his forearms. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Kerrick is the same, and so is Marcus, but they both seem better focused as men, as warriors. As for the women, maybe you can answer that better than I can. What I do know is that their powers are stronger and they\u2019ve each made more of a difference in the war. They also have a constant awareness of where the other is physically.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She could see that and accept it. \u201cSo we do all three things at once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBody, blood, deep-mind engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we start?\u201d</p><p>He smiled again. \u201cLike this.\u201d He lowered himself slowly onto her and kissed her.</p><p>Parisa forgot about her worries over this new thing happening to her. She gave herself to the kiss, to Antony\u2019s beautiful, sensual lips, to the love she could feel in every drift.</p><p>I love you whispered through her mind, confirming what she could already feel.</p><p>I love you, too, she sent.</p><p>The weight of him was like heaven. She had always been uncomfortable with her height but not right now, not with Antony stretched out on top of her, his lean muscular thighs pressing into hers, his thick pecs stroking her breasts. Her fingers played with the grooves, swells, and planes of his back.</p><p>She shivered when the tips of her fingers found the apertures of his wing-locks moist.</p><p>He groaned as his lips plucked at hers. His tongue slid inside and he searched through her mouth. She sucked his tongue as his hips rocked against hers. He was so hard and so big. She slid a hand low and wiggled her fingers beneath his hip. He lifted slightly, giving her room.</p><p>She released a heavy sigh as her hand found him and stroked him and loved him. He drew back and looked into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she whispered against his lips. She drew back and met his gaze. \u201cYour eyes. You have a light in your eyes that I adore. I love you Antony, with all my heart. I think I have from the moment I first voyeured you.\u201d</p><p>Medichi\u2019s chest expanded ... again. Her fingers had closed around him, touching him, loving him. He never thought to be undone in this way again. How magical this was, lying against her beautiful body, seeing the admiration in her eyes, knowing he was loved, knowing that his heart had been pierced wide open so he could love again.</p><p>He wanted to show her what he felt.</p><p>He slid a knee between her thighs and pushed. She opened for him, letting her legs fall wide and his hips slide between. Was there a more vulnerable position for a woman? More open? More trusting? That she trusted him so much pierced him once more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He guided himself down low and thrust against her opening. She drew up her knees as her body rolled upward in a slow wave of desire.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Such an excellent word. No better in the English language.</p> <p>He pressed into her, just a little. So wet. So ready for him.</p><p>He closed his eyes, savoring. Everything would change from this moment on. But he was ready. He pushed a little more.</p><p>Her fingers dug into his shoulders and she whimpered. He leaned down, kissed her closed eyelids, then drew back. She smiled and looked up at him. \u201cI want to be in your mind as I do this,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded. His gaze met beautiful amethyst. He settled his mind against hers and gave a little shove.</p><p>She smiled as she released her shields so that they fell in one quick tumble. He poured over her mind in a swift, flowing stream. She cried out and even though he had only a couple of inches buried inside her, he felt her clench.</p> <p>He grunted in response. He was hard as a rock, his balls pulled up tight.</p><p>Shit, he could come in a heartbeat.</p><p>He took a few settling breaths ... then, as he made his way into her body, he began a journey through her mind. She had only lived twenty-nine years, so young, but he saw her life and for the first time truly understood her pain.</p><p>He saw the release of her wings for the first time, the panic followed by wonder. He let all the love and compassion he felt for her flow through his mind and layered it over hers. He kissed her and found that her face was wet.</p><p>\u201cSo much love,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAntony, you make me feel so full in every possible way. Antony, my Antony.\u201d</p><p>He drew his hips back and pushed and pushed. She cried out and clung to him. She dug her nails into his back. \u201cYes, yes.\u201d Her hands slid lower and she grabbed his ass hard, pushing as he pushed. A sound like a cry and a groan came out of her.</p> <p>Antony, Antony, Antony, swept through her thoughts, which he felt and heard at the same time since he was within her mind. He felt how much she savored him deep. I could keep you here forever.</p><p>I want to stay here forever.</p><p>Her eyes opened. To look into her eyes yet be within her mind was a wondrous thing. He kissed her again hard and began to rock into her, pushing, driving, thrusting.</p><p>Her cries filled the space between them and he drank them down his throat one after the other.</p><p>My turn, she whispered within his mind. Let me in.</p><p>Yes. Oh, such an excellent word.</p><p>Parisa didn\u2019t want to take her hands away from the firm yet erotically movable flesh of his gorgeous ass. But she did, putting her hands on his face as she looked into his eyes. Such beautiful dark brown eyes, almost black in the dimness of the waning afternoon, but always full of that wonderful light.</p><p>She had never thought she could love someone so much.</p> <p>She was inaccessible no more.</p><p>He smiled and reminded her of what they were doing with a firm thrust of himself deep into her. Her eyes fluttered as she clenched unbidden, as she felt the supreme hard length of him, as pleasure rippled over her abdomen and sent delicious shivers down her thighs.</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d swept out of her lips. He kissed her and took the rest of her breath into his mouth. His sage scent, roughened with a note that was all male, sent more shivers over her body. His presence was a delectable weight in her mind.</p><p>Focus.</p><p>Yes, she must focus.</p><p>Withdraw from my mind, she sent, and I\u2019ll follow.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Yes, oh, yes.</p><p>She felt him begin to pull back and what might have ended in emptiness became a sense of complete penetration as she surged into his head. She felt herself crash over his mind like an enormous ocean wave. She pounded hard then spread out to see, to absorb, to embrace all that he was in his memories.</p><p>His body responded. He moved into her harder now and grunted. He no longer kissed her, his head was turned away. He was sweating.</p><p>So good, he sent. So damn good.</p><p>It was her turn to take the ride. She knew she was crying out, her body almost spasming with pleasure as she began to catch glimpses of former battles, former times at the Blood and Bite, even making love with her in the turret room. She wanted to pause and savor but she pressed on, back and back through time, back and back through centuries.</p><p>She became lost in the purity of moving through his thoughts, his memories, his experiences, and at the same time feeling his body push into hers. Alternating waves of cold and heat washed through her. Pleasure built on pleasure.</p><p>She was panting.</p><p>Her mind was flushed with endorphins. She was overwhelmed, overcome. His memories were too much, too wonderful, too horrible. She cried out, uncertain how to continue.</p><p>I\u2019m here. And just like that the confusion dissipated. It was as though in the middle of his mind, he appeared right in front of her. She couldn\u2019t see him but she felt him. She calmed, grew still, rested within his mind.</p><p>You okay?</p><p>She could hear herself as she laughed. How many times have you asked me that? Yes, I\u2019m okay. We\u2019re close, though, aren\u2019t we?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>She drew in a deep breath. Give me your wrist, she sent.</p><p>He unhinged his elbow. The moment she felt his skin beneath her mouth her fangs emerged. She didn\u2019t think. She struck. As his blood touched her lips and moved into her mouth she cried out and began to suckle. Any pleasure she had been feeling was a fraction of this. She was engaged with him in all three ways\u2014mind, blood, and a cock buried as far as it could go.</p><p>She drank and drank and for a moment knew nothing else but that in this way she had taken possession of him, bringing into her body all that he was, his life force, that which flowed through his heart, that which gave him life.</p><p>She tasted sage and earth, man and fire. She tasted life.</p><p>She rolled her head, offering what she could give as well.</p><p>He groaned long and low and his tongue raked up her neck over and over until her vein pounded. She felt the tips of his fangs first. She cried out even before he struck. He sank his fangs and her hips jerked, her mind seized, and her whole body shivered.</p><p>Oh, dear God, what had they done, what had they begun, by engaging like this? She felt something coming, something enormous, but how on earth was she going to be able to handle more?</p><p>Antony tasted the sweet succulent flavor of tangerines in the blood that slid down his throat. He also tasted Parisa, a flavor of woman and life and energy, tremendous energy. He felt her doubt, as well, but he let that go, at least for now.</p><p>For now, he drank and drank and though he could feel all the other sensations at once, that she was stroking his mind, and suckling his wrist, that she\u2019d taken a thick rope of his hair in her free hand and that her hips were jerking against his and pulling his cock in deep, the forefront of his mind was focused on what he took from her neck.</p><p>He loved her so much. That she was willing to give of herself like this pounded him within his mind and her energy became his energy. He felt determined and almost wild. His hips became a dedicated surge and pullback, surge and pullback, a heavy piston working the well of her body, working her pleasure, pumping and pumping.</p><p>He felt his release building and suddenly he could feel hers as well. He felt what it felt for her to have his shaft buried inside her. He trembled because the dual sensation of pleasure was too much, too much.</p><p>She pulled on his hair and he felt the texture of his own hair in her hand.</p><p>He tasted the flavor of his own blood in her mouth.</p><p>Yes, it was too much, too much, yet not enough.</p><p>Antony, what\u2019s happening?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t respond. He felt a wave of energy begin to flow through him, up from his feet, to his knees, his hips, his chest. The apertures along his back began to flood with moisture. He could feel her wing-locks as well, wet, so wet.</p><p>Then he understood. He had to get them both off the bed.</p><p>He slung one arm under her hips and the other securely around her shoulders so that he could continue to drink.</p><p>We\u2019re off the bed.</p><p>Yes, let it come now, all of it.</p><p>My wings. Oh, God, they\u2019re coming.</p><p>Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>As her wings mounted his did as well, a simultaneous release that launched the other release. He withdrew his fangs from her neck and cried out. She screamed and he felt her pleasure, the lightning of ecstasy that streaked over her most tender flesh and flew up the well of her body and gripped him\u2014and as she gripped him, he pumped into her that other fluid of life, that which had the power to create life. He pumped and pumped. His wings stretched and reached, wafted to keep them both floating in the air.</p><p>Oh, God, oh, God, oh God.</p><p>Pleasure continued to flow in waves, deep pulsing waves, and he orgasmed a second time, heavily, his hips working her body. He felt her pleasure again as once more she screamed, her mouth no longer connected to his wrist, her arms holding him, her legs wrapped around his legs.</p><p>But if he felt her pleasure, what was she feeling?</p><p>Parisa screamed at the ceiling at the beautiful coffer beams that went in and out of focus. Orgasm had her in a powerful grip and it kept rolling through her. When her wings had released, she had climaxed as though there had never been an orgasm before in the entire course of the world. She had felt Antony\u2019s release at the same time. When her wings came forth and his at the same time, she felt not only all those delicious sensations that had always characterized her wing-mounts, but all of his as well. The combination of experiences had been overwhelming.</p><p>And now she felt the pleasure building again. Even though Antony had already orgasmed more than once, already filled her full to overflowing, because they were involved in deep-mind engagement, and because his experiences were her experiences, she could tell he was going to climax again.</p><p>The exquisite pressure kept building and building. The release came. She threw her head back and screamed as the pleasure flowed\u2014and then she felt it, a tremendous wave of energy that began at her feet, up through her hips, her chest, her shoulders, until it seemed to pass through the very top of her head.</p><p>At the same time she felt Antony\u2019s pleasure, the pull of her well along his pulsing cock, the extreme pleasure of his orgasm as he once more spent his seed, the heady rush through his abdomen, chest, and head, pleasure upon pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Panting, sweaty, her wings wafting, slowly, his wings sustaining them in the air, his hips quieting, at last the sexual pleasure began to dim but was replaced by something new, a kind of warm exhilaration, a different kind of ecstasy.</p><p>She opened her eyes and met Antony\u2019s gaze. His eyes were full of light, even more than usual. But her gaze was drawn away by colors playing over his shoulder. His wings flapped very gently, very steadily to hold them aloft, several feet above the bed.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cYour wings are on fire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd so are yours.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head to the side and saw the expanse of her wing, and Antony\u2019s. Swirls of energy rose off both. The colors dazzled\u2014gold, amethyst, blue, and green.</p><p>She shifted to meet his gaze once more. He seemed different. His hair danced around his shoulders as though the energy they had created blew it around like a soft breeze.</p><p>He was smiling. She was still in his mind and she knew his thoughts\u2014he\u2019d never been so happy.</p><p>Me, too. He nodded and smiled.</p> <p>But the energy transformed suddenly. Antony winced, his back arched, and she felt him struggle. She knew, however, that she had to hold him in place.</p><p>She took the jolt next. It made her want to pull away but she forced herself to remain. Then she realized that this time he had kept her from moving, from disconnecting.</p><p>The click happened right there, chest-to-chest, a deep bond and joining. She stared into his eyes. He returned it.</p><p>The next moment, Parisa arched and cried out. \u201cThe pain. Oh, God the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. In your mind. So deep. The voyeur-link.\u201d She knew he felt her pain because they were connected. \u201cIs this what you\u2019ve been experiencing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, tears tracking down her cheeks. \u201cI can feel the link straining, almost trembling.\u201d She arched again. Once more she cried out, then opened her eyes to look at him.</p> <p>The pain stopped, an ending so sudden that she gasped. \u201cOh, my God. The breh-hedden just broke my link with Greaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI can feel it, too. He\u2019s gone. The bastard is gone.\u201d</p><p>Another unexpected benefit of the bonding experience.</p><p>She was ready to embrace him, to speak of love, to explore what this bonding might mean for both of them, even to make love again. But a sudden, terrible understanding arose: Something bad was about to happen to Endelle, to Thorne, to all the Warriors of the Blood, to Colonel Seriffe and his contingent of Militia Warriors.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel that?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe danger, to everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. What do we do?\u201d It was not an expression of doubt but a concern about strategy.</p><p>She flowed through Antony\u2019s mind and picked up on the drift of his thoughts. He was riffling through all the books and articles he had read, and all the anecdotes he had ever heard about royle wings.</p><p>She began to peruse his memories at the same time, an amazing download of material. He then released all those thoughts and looked into her eyes once more.</p> <p>He smiled.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>So they both knew what needed to be done. But dear God, it seemed quite impossible.</p><p>Worse, if this failed, they would both be dead along with all those they loved, within the next hour.</p><p>Would this be it, then? Would their lives and their love be over so very soon?</p><p>\u201cHow about you open your voyeur\u2019s window and have a look.\u201d</p><p>Parisa nodded. She took a deep breath and thought of Endelle. The window opened and Her Supremeness came into view. She was dressed in a light blue flight suit, at full-mount. \u201cHer wings are dark blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has the power to change the colors of the feathers at will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where is she?\u201d</p><p>Parisa panned back. \u201cAt the Grand Canyon ... and she\u2019s not alone.\u201d</p><p>There is some anecdotal evidence from ancient times to suggest that royle wings form the basis of the concept of the modern-day spectacle. However, more recent historical records do not corroborate oral traditions.</p><p>\u2014From Treatise on Ascension, by Philippe Reynard</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>The Ascension Liberation Army.</p><p>Greaves.</p><p>What a fucking poser.</p><p>Endelle stood on the rim of the Grand Canyon, at one of the narrower points. A late-afternoon glow had settled on the land, bringing all the sharp and rolling contours of the canyon into beautiful relief. It wouldn\u2019t be long before dusk descended. What the hell was Greaves up to?</p><p>A mile below, the river was hardly visible, a distant blue-green line. On Mortal Earth, because of all the dams, the river looked mossy green. But rushing all the way to the Sea of Cortez, untrammeled by dams as it was on Second Earth, it looked a little different.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>What didn\u2019t look different was Greaves.</p><p>She extended her vision\u2014in her case real Third Earth shit\u2014and she could see him, plain as fucking day, seated on a dais, lounging, sipping a cup of tea, the saucer in one hand and in the other, his white delicate teacup with pinkie held high. Well, weren\u2019t we just so damn pretty this afternoon?</p><p>If she could put metaphysical fingers around his throat and squeeze, she would. But that was Fourth Dimension shit and she wasn\u2019t there yet.</p><p>All this, an army of Militia Warriors and death vampires spread out on the opposing rim, and for what? Why couldn\u2019t some men just let people raise their babies, their crops, a few farm animals for sustenance, and live? Why did it always come down to some asshole needing to take over the world?</p><p>Jesus H. Christ.</p><p>So Greaves had announced to the world today that he was saving Second Earth from the tyranny of an oppressive administration that must be stopped. That\u2019s what Greaves had called her Phoenix Two operation in which her primary function was to keep death vampires from making it down to Mortal Earth and, yeah, to prevent assholes like Greaves from taking over the world. Other than that, her allied High Administrators ran their Territories however the hell they wanted to. Yeah, real fucking tyrannical.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Starting this morning, he had mounted a massive television and Internet propaganda campaign against her administration. He\u2019d used every hideous photograph he could find of her, that showed her enraged\u2014imagine that, pictures of her enraged. At least her clothes looked sweet. She particularly liked the one of her in a banana python floor-length evening gown, knees lowered and wide so that it stretched the skin out, her back arched, and her arm lifted high in a one-fingered salute. Okay, so maybe she didn\u2019t exactly look like the ruler of Second Earth. More like the ruler of Second Earth gone wild. She was even showing some fang in that photo.</p><p>Okay, really ... whatever.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ads were being shown around the world, in every Territory and every language. Marcus\u2019s team had been monitoring global broadcasting around the clock. He\u2019d been cursing nonstop for the past several hours. So ... fuck.</p><p>And today, Greaves had a hundred television crews, also from around the world, already filming him and his army. Remote-controlled video air-bots zoomed back and forth, from her army to his. If one of those damn things even got close to her, she was throwing a fucking hand-blast.</p><p>Ascension Liberation Army.</p><p>My ass.</p><p>That lying fucking bastard.</p><p>Greaves was just one big lie from the top of his bald head to the tidy break in the cuffs of his fine wool suits.</p><p>She flapped the great breadth of her wings, a rich cerulean blue for the battle, and rose into the air a slow couple of feet at a time. Her flight suit was a lighter shade of blue. On principle, though, she wore a leopard headband and a pair of leopard-print flight slippers. Hey, a woman had her standards.</p><p>And the fuck she was going to take that pansy-ass bastard Greaves seriously. Especially since beyond the assembled Militia Warriors serving on his side were communications tents with satellite dishes. He was up to something.</p><p>The question was, how much of this was for show and just how serious was he about challenging her administration today?</p><p>Still. She was thong-climbing-her-ass pissed.</p><p>On the other hand, one of the advantages of living so long was that the phrase Now I\u2019ve seen everything had been her mantra for millennia already. If she flat-out panicked every time some little flyspeck of a prick flexed his muscles, she\u2019d have stroked out a helluva long time before this. Not that a vampire could stroke out, but still.</p><p>Besides, something had shifted within her since Shorty showed up in her life. Maybe it was his speaking of Braulio, or maybe it was learning that Leto, one of her dearest friends from olden times, hadn\u2019t been a traitor after all, or maybe it was just knowing that the Upper Dimension hadn\u2019t completely buried its head up its ass all these centuries, but she\u2019d gained a little confidence. There must be a way out of this morass.</p><p>Also, she had one ace up her sleeve that no one knew about. She had no idea if she could count on Parisa and Medichi coming through for her, but from the moment she\u2019d learned that they both had royle wings, well she\u2019d sort of had a hard-on. She was the only ascender on the face of the planet who had actually seen what royle wings could do. Luchianne had had royle wings, and on more than one occasion she\u2019d used them.</p><p>Talk about spectacle.</p><p>What a sight those times had been. But whether she could call such an untried pair into battle\u2014well, who the fuck knew. She was just employing a little bit of faith that even though she was a profane bitch, the Creator might somehow help her inadequate troops stand against a sociopath and an army that outnumbered hers three-to-one.</p><p>As she rose higher and pulled back somewhat on her preternatural vision, she could see the breadth of Greaves\u2019s assembled forces. His ALA was all in black with the occasional maroon slash of color for effect. Black leather kilts were the order of the day on both sides, but just to keep things simple Greaves\u2019s army wore maroon leather weapons harnesses, which she thought was a nice touch although some contrasting embroidery would\u2019ve livened things up a bit. If she got out of this alive, she\u2019d tell Stannett to give Greaves a few pointers.</p><p>She rose up even higher. Off to the southwest she saw something else, something in flight, something massive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo fucking way,\u201d she murmured as it came into focus. Just like that, she was worried. What people might dislike in war, they doted on when it came to display.</p><p>She drew her wings in slightly and floated back to the ground. Colonel Seriffe and Thorne flanked her. She turned to face them both, her back to the canyon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe what the little peach has done.\u201d</p> <p>The men spoke in unison. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t fucking take the cake. Tell you what, boys. Fly up about forty feet and take a gander off to the southwest. I want you to see this for yourself. Tell me what you think.\u201d</p><p>The men stepped several feet apart. They\u2019d already mounted their wings; now they unfolded them from close-mount into full-mount and in an almost choreographed movement flew straight up and out to hover above the maw of the canyon.</p><p>Thorne\u2019s voice pierced her head through their shared mind-link. Are you fucking kidding me?</p><p>Nope. Looks like Greaves has thought of everything.</p> <p>So that no matter what happens today, he can\u2019t lose. No wonder he chose dusk. I thought it was because the canyon just looked prettier at this hour.</p><p>She rose into the air again and flew behind the men. At your rear, she sent. It was the proper form of flight protocol address, but it always made her laugh.</p><p>Thorne dipped a wing and shifted so that he could meet her gaze. \u201cWhen do you think the fireworks will begin?\u201d he said, his voice gravelly but loud.</p><p>\u201cAny fucking time.\u201d</p><p>But as Seriffe turned to her, she saw the sudden raw state of his emotions and recoiled. He had three small boys and a wife. He adored his family and here he was facing the end of it all. If he died today, what would become of Carolyn and the little ones?</p><p>Aw, shit.</p> <p>Almost on cue, yep, fireworks launched into the air and all the little video-bots floated into a variety of static positions to best capture a sky suddenly full of splashes of blue and green, purple, yellow\u2014and every color under the sun.</p><p>She ordered the men back to the ground and followed suit. With her leopard flats on the soil again, she once more stretched her vision across the maw of the canyon. There he was. He even met her gaze and lifted his cup to her.</p><p>Goddamn fucking poser.</p><p>Greaves preferred a win\u2013win, which was exactly what he had this afternoon. The fireworks were charming\u2014not the most complicated designs and patterns he might have chosen, but he\u2019d made this decision at the last minute so naturally there would be compromises.</p><p>Still, how could one ever go wrong with fireworks?</p><p>He sipped the last bit of tea. As squadrons of geese, swans, and ducks, as well as their magnificently costumed handlers, moved into position exactly between the rims of the canyon, he gestured for his aide to take the cup and saucer.</p><p>The young vampire didn\u2019t look at him as he hurried to his side, bowed, then performed the task.</p><p>As the servant moved away, Greaves rose to his feet\u2014the prearranged signal. All his generals moved back into the ranks, all with the exception of Leto, his second-in-command, who took up the position on Greaves\u2019s far right. He kept Leto close, as always. Something wasn\u2019t right with his favorite defector but he hadn\u2019t had the time to pursue it yet.</p> <p>He loved how swiftly the men moved, each disappearing into the ranks, barking orders until both divisions thrummed with battle energy, all to the pounding of the fireworks and the great flashes in the sky.</p><p>As he faced south, away from the canyon, he watched his death vampires rise into the air, a long glorious line of matched killers, stark white complexions with a faint bluish hue to the skin, huge glossy black wings and the fierce presence of muscled warriors. The promise? With the Coming Order, he would provide dying blood for all.</p><p>The sun was now almost set.</p><p>Let the fun begin.</p><p>Endelle shook her head.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Fireworks were now blasting from both sides of Greaves\u2019s forces, so that the sky above the canyon was full of light and sparkle. Yeah ... spectacle.</p><p>The squadrons of fowl drew opposite and very near to Endelle\u2019s forces. Their corresponding handlers wore enormous gowns, men and women alike. The costumes hung down into the air at twice their height. Each wore a massive headpiece; their wings were at least warrior-sized to support the weighty attire.</p><p>Endelle shook her head and exchanged a roll of the eyes with Thorne. Whatever she thought of Greaves, this whole fucking presentation was goddamn brilliant.</p><p>For the next fifteen minutes, the spectacle parade passed, performing to music blasted from a new set of air-bots, heavy orchestral music, which she recognized as Holst\u2019s The Planets.</p><p>Jesus H. Christ.</p><p>Well, this might just be a little payback for her last spectacle event at the Ambassadors Reception at White Lake. Despite the incendiary bombs that had disrupted the fireworks display, killed eleven people, and burned out a number of famous public gardens, the ensuing press had resulted in a staggering response of support for Endelle\u2019s administration. Both sympathy and accolades had flowed in from around the world.</p><p>Maybe tonight\u2019s little display would twist the world around Greaves\u2019s pinkie. Fuck. What the hell was she supposed to do to combat this? And just how many of her male and female warriors were going to fall to their deaths in the canyon tonight?</p><p>And\u2014God forbid\u2014would she lose any of her Warriors of the Blood?</p><p>She scowled up at the series of firework dragons that now flowed east over a dusky sky, above the final act of a thousand snowy white swans, moving in elegant wave-like patterns below.</p><p>She sent a message to Thorne. Get Medichi on the com.</p><p>Medichi stood with his arms wrapped around Parisa, waiting, his gaze fixed to the skies as several new dragons appeared, all moving toward their position at the farthest left flank of Endelle\u2019s forces. The swans were almost opposite them now.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d Parisa murmured.</p><p>Dread filled him. His face had that tight, drawn sensation he got so rarely. The last time he\u2019d felt this way was the moment he realized that he hadn\u2019t been looking at Parisa at all, but a hologram.</p><p>His gaze fell to the army on the opposite rim, so far away yet so damn close. Once in flight, the far side of the canyon was only a few wing-flaps away. Though the Grand Canyon seemed to separate the two armies, it was nothing but an illusion.</p><p>He felt his phone vibrate and he released his right arm to fish out the black card. Must be showtime.</p><p>He thumbed the surface. Though he felt Parisa try to pull away, he didn\u2019t want space; he met her gaze and tugged her back against him. She smiled, turning into him and falling against his chest. She was feeling it, too. So, not good.</p><p>\u201cGive,\u201d he said, his voice quieter than he had meant it to be.</p><p>A bunch of gravel came on line, \u201cSo you\u2019re here.\u201d The music blasted from both sides of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cYep. North end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEndelle wants a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey asshole,\u201d Her Supremeness said.</p><p>Damn that made him smile and shake his head. \u201cWhere do you need us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she drawled as, the music faded out, \u201cthat depends. You complete the breh-hedden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He gave Parisa\u2019s shoulders a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cAnything notable happen?\u201d</p><p>Now, there was a question. He could have answered that about a dozen different ways. Instead, he told her what he knew she needed to hear. \u201cOur wings flamed\u2014gold, amethyst, blue, green.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure, but he thought he heard her murmur, Thank God. \u201cGood\u201d snapped through the line. \u201cI want the pair of you to mount up and do what you need to do. The truth is, I haven\u2019t seen this done in millennia so your guess is as good as mine. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Medichi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s all up to you right now.\u201d Then she laughed. \u201cBut no pressure.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Parisa asked. When she drew back this time, he let her.</p><p>\u201cShowtime and we mount our wings.\u201d</p><p>Parisa gave him a grim set of her lips then moved several feet away. He waited as she mounted her incredible, impossible wings, so massive for her body, all cream with beautiful bands of black, amethyst, and gold. Because of the wind eddies, she drew the wings into close-mount.</p><p>He smiled at her. His wings emerged in a sudden burst of power. He, too drew them in close.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>He took her hand. \u201cWe wait.\u201d But for what he wasn\u2019t sure. Oh, God, how would either of them know what to do?</p><p>He glanced at his woman once more.</p><p>Worse, what if he lost her tonight after having just barely begun his life with her?</p><p>Jean-Pierre headed one thousand Militia Warriors at the southernmost flank of Endelle\u2019s army. His heart thrummed in his chest, heavy now, almost painful.</p><p>The enemy was in the air across the canyon on the south rim.</p><p>Merde.</p><p>He lifted his sword and at the same moment mounted his wings. He heard the responding mounting of wings behind him, like a great wind.</p><p>This was his job to perform right now, as despised as it was. The enemy was better prepared in every sense. Camera crews were filming every moment of what Greaves most certainly intended to be a complete rout.</p><p>But, as was always said among the warriors, fuck that.</p><p>Very precise.</p><p>The enemy breached the side of the canyon and hit the open air. The distance might still be great but wings moved the body swiftly, so swiftly.</p><p>He opened his mouth and, with his sword lifted high, let out a roar. The Militia Warriors behind him echoed it. He flapped his wings in long downward thrusts and rose into the air. He did not need to turn around to see if he was being followed. The anger and the power and the energy of Seriffe\u2019s men pushed at him from behind.</p><p>He breached the North Rim wall and was over the canyon now, pulsing forward in slow, exact movements. From his peripheral vision to the left he saw that his warrior brothers had done no less. Closest to him was Luken, the most physically powerful of the brothers, plowing the air, moving forward just as he did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All that he was as a warrior moved in him now, flooded his veins. The surface of his skin flushed hot. He was ready.</p><p>Leading the charge opposite him was a long, terrible row of death vampires. They began to break away in fours, some flying higher and higher, others lower. The ranks behind him would do the same, higher and lower to form a multiple-layered front line, offset so that if anyone fell into the canyon below, other battling pairs and groups would not be impacted.</p><p>But battle was chaotic and always the worst happened.</p> <p>His peripherals closed down.</p><p>All he saw were eight death vampires in tight formation aimed at him. He would have expected no less.</p><p>On they flew, three hundred yards, two hundred, one hundred. He struck parachute-mount and hung in the air, his heart now hammering. Thirty feet. He did not wait but drew both daggers swiftly from his weapons harness and let each fly. The blades struck home. Two death vampires clutched necks, spun, and fell from the sky, tumbling down and down.</p><p>The remaining six were on him. He slashed, spun, levitated at lightning speed, whirled, cut, and the entire time kept his senses fixed on the location of each pretty-boy.</p><p>A battle haze consumed him now, the rage of serving for over two centuries, of facing an enemy that drank women to death. He became more animal than man, more flexing muscle and growling instinct.</p> <p>He sent vampire after vampire into the abyss below, again, again, again.</p><p>Every few seconds, his peripherals registered the battle around him and down the line. Militia Warriors on both sides of the canyon fell in fading screams to the rocks and river below.</p><p>But when he heard his name called out, and recognized Luken\u2019s voice, he flew high in the air and slaughtered within seconds the warriors who dared to follow. He stretched his preternatural vision and saw Luken tumbling to his death, one of his wings sliced through.</p><p>One glance at the battle showed Greaves\u2019s numbers overwhelming the Militia Warriors.</p><p>He had a choice to make: to stay and support the Militia Warriors all around him, or to save Luken. But there was only one choice he could make.</p><p>He pulled his wings into close-mount, which made a rocket of his body. He headed to the bottom of the canyon. Within seconds he landed below Luken\u2019s falling body. He sent a hand-blast upward beneath him, slowing the warrior\u2019s fall.</p> <p>Luken still hit the earth hard. He was stunned, shaking, and part of his left wing hung at a painful angle.</p><p>Jean-Pierre wanted to fold him to safety, but neither pair of wings would handle the trip.</p><p>Only at that moment did he see that Luken\u2019s weapons harness had been sliced high in the abdomen as well and that blood poured from him.</p><p>He looked up. Greaves\u2019s forces had pushed Endelle\u2019s army a third of the way back to the North Rim. Yes, there were times when numbers mattered.</p><p>He took the warrior\u2019s hand in a tight grip.</p><p>Luken\u2019s face was pale. \u201cGo, my brother. Save all that you can.\u201d</p><p>It was a death sentence for Luken since his wounds made him open to attack. Yet Jean-Pierre had to return to the more vulnerable Militia Warriors.</p><p>Jean-Pierre nodded when a sudden breeze, very warm and strangely soothing, came from the east portion of the canyon.</p> <p>\u201cDo you feel that?\u201d Luken cried. He blinked several times, a hand pressed to his stomach.</p><p>\u201cOui,\u201d Jean-Pierre responded. \u201cBut what is it? I do not understand and it is getting much stronger.\u201d</p><p>Luken cried, \u201cHoly shit. Jean-Pierre, lengthen your vision. Do you see them? Do you see them flying? Together? Their wings are on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedichi and Parisa. Oh, my God. They did it.\u201d His teeth chattered now and he was pale, so pale.</p><p>Jean-Pierre kept his hand around Luken\u2019s. He engaged his vision and stretched. \u201cOui,\u201d he cried. The breeze had strengthened to a strong wind, heavy pulses of great power. \u201cI see them. Then it is true, not a myth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a myth,\u201d Luken said, his voice quieter.</p><p>Peace descended on Jean-Pierre, the likes of which he had never known. He watched above as every battle ceased, the opponents falling back and back toward each respective rim, divided now by what could only be called a benevolent wind\u2014one that brought peace, great peace.</p><p>He kept his vision long and sharp as Medichi and Parisa passed overhead. They were but an enormous elongated shape of flames: brilliant gold, amethyst that leaped in rolling flares, an underbelly of blues and greens, and a tail perhaps half a mile long of deep purple and burnished gold.</p><p>So beautiful.</p><p>Parisa flew beside Antony, separated only by the span of each of their wings but bound by the breh-hedden and the phenomenon that was their royle wings.</p><p>The colors spun out in front of her, above her, beside her, and below her. She could not imagine what she and Antony looked like as they flew through the canyon and parted enemy from enemy, driving both sides back, Greaves\u2019s forces to the South Rim and Endelle\u2019s to the North.</p><p>Her heart was unbearably full, full to overflowing, of heat, of exhilaration, of peace. Yes, so much peace.</p><p>The moment they had launched off the North Rim, the process had begun. With each few seconds the sensation grew, so that she was fulfilling the myth as she flew beside Antony. Even she could sense the power that forged a wedge between the armies.</p><p>By the time they completed the run, the entire distance through the ranks, which had to be at least five miles in length, she was breathing hard. She wasn\u2019t certain how to stop the flames and the wind, but when Antony dipped his wing once in her direction, she met his gaze and slowed as he did. The flames diminished more with each gradual cessation of forward speed.</p><p>After less than a minute, she hung in parachute position in front of him, her wings cupped at the apex. She was jostled back and forth in gentle motions by the early-evening breezes.</p><p>He nodded to her and sent, Let\u2019s find Endelle.</p><p>He launched the opposite direction\u2014but at a much slower pace, so that eventually her breathing calmed down. All along the banks, Militia Warriors from Endelle\u2019s ranks cheered them with loud shouts and fists thrust through the air one after the other, thousands of grateful voices rising to the stars above.</p><p>Parisa had seen so many warriors fall as they flew through the midair front lines, down into the now black abyss of the canyon below. The memory would haunt her for years to come, softened by the knowledge that many warriors had lived because of what she and Antony had done today.</p><p>As she plowed air beside Antony in search of Endelle, Marcus took up a wing position on her left flank; Thorne took up Antony\u2019s opposing wing flank. By the time they reached Endelle, other Warriors of the Blood had met them in the air, all shouting their victory\u2014Zacharius, Kerrick, and Santiago. They, too, fell in formation behind Thorne and Marcus. Luken, however, was nowhere to be seen, nor Jean-Pierre.</p><p>Antony called out in a strong voice, \u201cBanking left?\u201d</p><p>Parisa followed suit, dipping her left wing slightly then straightening to fly forward.</p><p>Within a few flaps she was drawing her wings in, slowing then popping her parachute configuration right beside Antony, to land six feet from Her Supremeness.</p><p>But Endelle merely nodded to her then to each of the warriors. Colonel Seriffe was on her left and Thorne, now landed, moved to stand at her right.</p><p>She was somber as she said, \u201cLuken\u2019s been hurt. He\u2019s in the canyon below. Jean-Pierre is with him and apparently saved his life. I\u2019ve already sent Horace to him.\u201d</p><p>And with those simple words, whatever peace and exhilaration had defined the last fifteen minutes of Parisa\u2019s life dissipated. An evening breeze carried moans from every quarter, and a terrible hush had settled over the Militia Warriors who were alive and uninjured.</p><p>\u201cThe losses have been unacceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we thank Warrior Medichi and ascender Lovejoy for having the courage to work together this evening and create something I have not seen since Luchianne flew the air currents of Second Earth. May you be blessed by the use of your gifts in service to our great society.\u201d She paused and swallowed hard. \u201cAnd now, let us tend to the wounded and to those we lost today.\u201d</p><p>I have only one regret in my life\u2014that I turned my only son over to the system of fostering prevalent among the ancient tribes of Europe, Mortal Earth, so long ago, for nothing but destruction has followed that decision. Will I ever be forgiven for bowing to the custom of the day against my every proper maternal instinct?</p><p>Perhaps. But I will never forgive myself.</p><p>God help me. Effetne!</p><p>\u2014Memoirs, Beatrice of Fourth</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Five days after the battle, Endelle stood on the North Rim where so many of her Militia Warriors had died, where Luken had once again almost died. She was sobered and alone.</p><p>She had been in memorial services for four days now.</p><p>The loss of over a thousand men and women had pared something away from her, some laxity in her attitude toward Darian Greaves.</p><p>The enemy had suddenly become her enemy, despised of old, yes, but now she felt something more, something deeper, something she had never known in all these millennia. She wanted revenge, deep, abiding, permanent revenge.</p><p>And she had the power to set anything in motion she wanted to.</p><p>She felt the air stir beside her, but she already knew the signature.</p><p>\u201cHello, Shorty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Endelle.\u201d</p><p>She was both surprised and not when he slipped his hand into hers. She felt his Sixth power flow through her, and her chin came up. For a moment, she couldn\u2019t breathe. A moment later, she felt ... comforted.</p><p>In any other circumstance, she would have made a joke, teased him about his height, how his hand was actually smaller than hers\u2014that sort of absurd hilarity.</p><p>But it would take some time for her sense of humor to return.</p><p>Instead, she spoke of recent events. \u201cGreaves has been running his extremely well-edited footage of the battle, calling it an enormous victory for the ALA. Of course none of those clips shows Medichi and Parisa\u2019s affect on the battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you expect something different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never believed it would come to this. I thought I had time to keep building and working. I never thought he would attack.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>James didn\u2019t say anything, just stood beside her staring out at the quiet battlefield. But his comforting stream of power continued to pulse through her hand and up her arm.</p><p>As she stared out at empty airspace to the rim opposite, nothing looked changed. Of course, the environmental teams had already been through repairing horticultural battle damage. Second Earth\u2019s version of tree-huggers. Whatever.</p><p>\u201cHe attacked because of the future streams,\u201d James said. \u201cYou need better Seer information.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must make a change. You know what I\u2019m referring to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will break Thorne\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it will.\u201d</p><p>Endelle had been avoiding this moment for over a century, from the time she\u2019d first seen Thorne\u2019s woman hidden deep within his mind. She hadn\u2019t meant to invade such a private space, but the memory had glowed bright, the way the ribbons of the future streams were said to glow.</p> <p>So she had pushed her way into the memory and seen what she was never meant to see.</p><p>Thorne\u2019s woman was a Seer with third, perhaps even fourth dimension capacity, well beyond anything she had ever known before, and Thorne had been protecting her from Second Earth involvement all this time.</p><p>But dear God, what would it do to Thorne if she used his woman as a pawn in this terrible game of war?</p><p>Greaves sat down in a chair covered in crushed purple velvet. He repressed a shudder. The vampire opposite him had the fashion and decorating taste of a pimp from a few decades past. Greaves deeply disliked him, the way he lounged so casually, several lines of cocaine splayed out in precise order on a glass coffee table in front of him. All he needed was two half-naked women draped over his shoulders to complete the absurd portrait.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always hated my hedonistic inclinations,\u201d Casimir said. He smiled. He had large, beautiful teeth, the body of a god, the appetites of Lucifer. His booted foot swung up and back. His snug white pants concealed none of his considerable assets. If Greaves had been otherwise inclined, he would have thought Casimir was trying to seduce him.</p><p>\u201cNot your hedonism. You of all men should know that I share your proclivities.\u201d He waved a hand around the room. \u201cBut I do find your outward expression quite ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>The vampire leaned his shoulders more deeply into the black leather of the couch. \u201cWhat do you want, Darian? I take it this isn\u2019t a social call ... unless you want it to be.\u201d</p><p>Greaves ignored the invitation. He swung many ways but he drew the line at sex with the Prince of Darkness. Even a sociopath had his standards.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>The moment had come.</p><p>He had been dreading this interview for a good number of centuries. He had believed he would never be required to make the request because his plans had been going so very well. But then, he had hoped against hope that the Upper Dimension would not become involved, that his seizure of smaller realms would have lulled it into believing that his ambitions were negligible\u2014until too late, of course.</p><p>However, now that three of the Warriors of the Blood had completed the breh-hedden and increased their powers exponentially because of the women involved, the handwriting had simply appeared on the wall in a way he could no longer ignore. If he\u2019d had any doubts on that score, they were settled by the fact that the most recent bonding had resulted in the loss of his voyeur-link with Parisa. Then there were the wings the happy pair shared. Not to split metaphors too heavily, but the use of royle wings had been the nail in his coffin.</p><p>God, what a show that had been, and such a peaceful sensation. Talk about spectacle. It really was too bad that he hadn\u2019t been able to use the footage in his propaganda campaigns, but the energy the couple used showed up on film only as strange flashes of light.</p><p>It had been no accident that his minions had failed to kill them all. Forces were at work, some based in destiny and accompanying misfortune, some in the fulfillment of myth, some by the hand of an Upper ascender. It was because of the latter that he\u2019d orchestrated this unfortunate meeting.</p> <p>He had no choice now but to speak words that brought bile rising from his stomach. \u201cIt would seem I need your help.\u201d</p><p>The large white teeth made another appearance. \u201cThe cost will be high.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>Casimir glanced at his well-manicured nails, buffed to a gleam. \u201cI saw your mother recently in one of my visits home.\u201d Casimir was a Fourth ascender.</p><p>\u201cAnd how fares the great philosopher of Fourth Earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeatrice is lovely as always. She has not aged a day.\u201d He laughed at his little immortal joke. \u201cShe is as sanctimonious as ever, though, quite judgmental\u2014I despise her for that\u2014but beautiful. You have her eyes, you know. Sometimes it is most unsettling to see you, my friend, and at the same moment to recognize Beatrice\u2019s large round eyes. Yes, very unsettling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she still building things?\u201d Beatrice had always had a passion for architecture.</p><p>He waved a hand, a sensual, delicate motion. \u201cHer latest project is some sort of rehabilitation center surrounded by a lake. The lake is supposed to have healing properties, and the inmates are baptized in it. Can you imagine? I\u2019ve dubbed it the lake of fire.\u201d He chuckled, but the sound had resonance and floated around the room until it settled on Greaves\u2019s shoulders, a heavy weight.</p><p>The time to negotiate had begun. \u201cSo tell me your price.\u201d</p><p>Casimir\u2019s teeth gleamed once more in the dim, dim light. \u201cOh, I think you know what I\u2019ll require, at least at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Greaves felt his mind slide around loosely. How stupid he had been. He had thought perhaps wealth, or an endless supply of mortal women, or the right to half his kingdom, but he should have known better. Casimir always went to the heart of things. He preferred to draw blood at the outset.</p><p>\u201cSo you want Julianna.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI have gazed upon her, so yes, of course.\u201d</p><p>That was a lie. Casimir may have actually seen Julianna, true, but her beauty was not what drew him. Greaves\u2019s unfortunate attachment to Eldon Crace\u2019s former wife was what Casimir had noticed.</p><p>Greaves sighed. His left hand twitched, but he didn\u2019t bring forth his claw. There would be no point. A Fourth ascender had advanced powers and would not be intimidated by anything so vulgar.</p><p>The question in life was always the same: What are you willing to do to get the things you want?</p><p>Oh, damn.</p><p>Rith trembled on his chaise longue in the underground cavern of his St. Louis Two blood donor facility. He pulled himself out of the future streams, sweating and nauseous.</p><p>Not only had his plans with Parisa failed, but his future had taken a terrible turn.</p><p>He had been such a fool from beginning to end where Parisa Lovejoy had been concerned. She had been the cause of this new horror. He should have gone with his instincts and killed her at the outset. Even if he had secured her death later\u2014while he had her in his control at his temple, say\u2014his future might not look so bleak.</p><p>Instead, like a complete novice, he\u2019d ignored the rising level of her powers and assumed his energy fields would keep both of his prisoners trapped so that they couldn\u2019t dematerialize. By the time he\u2019d lit the torch at the end of the room, they were gone.</p><p>Now the ribbon of light belonging to Parisa had combined with Warrior Medichi\u2019s ribbon to forge an impenetrable prophetic signature, which he could no longer read. The couple had completed the breh-hedden. Whatever their futures might be, whatever roles they might play in the war, were now lost to him, lost to most of the Seers of Second Earth.</p><p>Still, Fiona, the one who had been the Commander\u2019s first blood slave experiment, had risen to prominence in the future streams, a glowing light that he had been unable to resist reading.</p><p>He had picked up her ribbon of an intense silver-blue and ridden her prophecies. What he had found there made him rise from his chaise longue and head into the makeshift lavatory. He threw up into the bucket of water.</p><p>He had seen his death in glorious Technicolor at the hands of Fiona. Then he had seen his death at the hands of the Warrior Jean-Pierre. After that, he had seen Greaves himself, his beloved Commander, plunge a blade straight through his heart.</p><p>How was he to forge a life from the future streams when his own death had been foretold in three different ways?</p><p>A week after the battle at the Grand Canyon, Fiona sat in a large conference room at Madame Endelle\u2019s administrative headquarters. The wall of windows to the east gave a view onto an expansive stretch of desert. It never failed to surprise her, since all she\u2019d known for most of her hundred-plus years on Second Earth was a green garden and a large tamarind tree. Her eyes welcomed the change, surprisingly. But she supposed that from the moment of her rescue, when she was brought to Madame Endelle\u2019s palace, which overlooked miles of the same Sonoran Desert, she would always think of vast blue skies, clumps of cactus and creosote, and tall stately saguaros, as the representation of her freedom.</p><p>Alison sat beside her. She looked very pregnant but very relaxed now. Each time she tensed up, she closed her eyes, calmed her body, and ran a soothing hand over her swollen abdomen. She was communicating telepathically with the infant now, getting better every day at helping Helena draw in her temporary wings and keep her sloshy amniotic haven from spasming.</p><p>Fiona had loved being pregnant, carrying her children\u2014lovely Carolyn with her soft honey-brown curls and Peter who came out charging forward, ready to take on the world.</p><p>Fiona smiled at the blond beauty. Fiona was tall but still two inches shy of six-foot Alison. Height was a good thing when a woman was attached to a Warrior of the Blood\u2014better kissing distance.</p><p>Parisa had made an effort to discover on Fiona\u2019s behalf the basic events of her family\u2019s lives. Her husband, Terence, had remarried five years after Fiona\u2019s disappearance. He\u2019d had a second family to whom he had been utterly devoted. She could smile at the thought. Terence had been a good man, a wonderful loving husband and an excellent father, his hand neither too heavy nor too light. Of course he would have married again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her adored children had not fared so well. Her son had died in a trolley accident at the age of twenty-five while pursuing a law degree. Her daughter, Carolyn, had drowned while out yachting two years later, but her body had never been recovered.</p><p>Fiona had shed a few tears that neither of her children had been able to live their lives, that each had died relatively young, neither having married or borne children. But in truth she had already grieved her losses for so many decades that a few days after receiving the news, her sadness had dimmed appreciably. More than anything, she needed time to recover and to gain a solid footing in this new world. That the fate of the blood slaves in the remaining twenty-one facilities weighed on her mind gave a strong indication in just what direction her first service to Madame Endelle\u2019s administration would go.</p><p>Alison opened her eyes. \u201cSorry about that but it\u2019s getting better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you. There is nothing so wonderful as carrying one\u2019s children.\u201d</p><p>She felt a thousand years older than the therapist beside her, and perhaps in terms of experience and suffering she was. But the woman had a gift. There were moments when Alison reached out to Fiona, put a hand on her arm or her shoulder, and oh, such peace would flow, and some of that deep sense of being so very old would lighten, even disappear. She could even breathe more easily for a time.</p><p>She lived with tension constantly\u2014that she would be taken again, spirited away, used for another century. She believed the sensation would go away in time, but how much of it? A decade? Two decades? She was a relatively wise woman, but damaged in her spirit. Who wouldn\u2019t be after an ordeal that had lasted longer than a century?</p><p>\u201cNow. Let\u2019s talk about your future,\u201d Alison said. \u201cFor the moment, Madame Endelle would like you and the other women to stay at the palace, at least for the next few weeks for security purposes, while you get your bearings. She\u2019d also like you to consider taking charge of the remaining captives. We can see that each has turned to you for leadership and guidance since you\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll need counseling, a lot of it. I will as well. I want to be up-front about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Fiona\u2019s gaze fell to Alison\u2019s belly once more, but she looked away, her gaze skating back to the window. Fiona was still young because she was partially ascended. She could remarry in this dimension. Vampires took husbands, or wives as the case may be. They had weddings and bore children\u2014Twolings. The thought appealed to her. She had always loved being married, having a family to look after.</p><p>The memory of Jean-Pierre, the night of her rescue, was suddenly within her mind, the full glory of him in his leather kilt, heavy sandals, and shin guards; the silver studs of his leather wrist guards, the brace of leather over his chest. She recalled her desire for him, which returned to her in a quick flush that almost brought a gasp from her lips. A sudden craving for coffee burst in her mouth and she swallowed hard.</p><p>It was the strangest thing and yet she\u2019d already been told all about the infamous and troubling breh-hedden.</p><p>She shuddered. That couldn\u2019t be her fate. Yet she had to admit that even a thought of the powerful French warrior sent shivers in places she\u2019d ignored for, yes, longer than a century. These were modern times and sex had certainly transformed into a strange yet wonderful public conversation.</p><p>But in her day, the days of her marriage, it had been intensely private, a thing never discussed even between husband and wife. Fortunately, her husband had been generous in their marriage bed, and she had enjoyed what most women of her day were taught was a painful duty to be endured.</p> <p>And Jean-Pierre had already proven to her, albeit unwittingly, that even his kiss could bring her to a place of ecstasy. Again she suppressed a gasp. What would lovemaking be like if just a kiss ignited her?</p><p>Alison frowned. \u201cYou seem distressed. Will the palace be all right with you? The security there is unequaled and we want you off the enemy\u2019s radar, especially since it would seem you are Warrior Jean-Pierre\u2019s breh.\u201d</p><p>The breh-hedden. Even though she could be intrigued by the concept of sex with the warrior, she knew she was no more ready to be anyone\u2019s breh than she was to take up a sword and battle Commander Greaves all by herself.</p><p>She met Alison\u2019s worried gaze. \u201cThe palace will be fine, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. For a moment there, you seemed upset, and that is not what I want.\u201d She began to talk about completing the ascension ceremonies for each woman to make sure they would become fully acclimated to this larger world; it was thought this would be done after a few weeks of rest. She talked about several counselors she knew and trusted. She even spoke about possible vocational training, all sensible things.</p><p>Laughter sounded from down the hall and for a reason she couldn\u2019t explain, a sudden chill traveled over Fiona\u2019s shoulders, as if she were getting a virus. She could hear a woman\u2019s voice. Two voices. Parisa, perhaps? Laughter again. No, not Parisa. Havily. Yes, Havily, the one who worked in the darkening with Madame Endelle, the one bonded to Warrior Marcus.</p><p>Now she could hear Colonel Seriffe\u2019s booming masculine voice. She liked the colonel very much. He headed the Militia Warriors in Metro Phoenix. He was a tough, commanding man but there was always a warm light in his eye, as though he lived with a constant sense of hope no matter how bad things got. Yes, she liked him very much.</p><p>He was laughing now, and as she listened to his words, she realized he was bragging about his little boy, who had walked at nine months.</p> <p>\u201cDo you hear him?\u201d Alison said, smiling. \u201cHe adores his children, and his wife can do no wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, he\u2019s the perfect husband.\u201d</p><p>Alison laughed. \u201cYou are more right than you know. He is one of those rare men who combine great strength at work with compassion and love at home. I\u2019m afraid I tend to hold him up as a model too often to Kerrick. I have only to mention Colonel Seriffe and Kerrick bristles. Although, to be honest, sometimes I do it just to watch him pace a little, scowl, and glare at me. I can be very bad sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Fiona laughed and something inside her started to relax as well. She and Alison had both turned slightly toward the doorway to listen. Havily\u2019s excited chatter rose above even the colonel\u2019s voice. It was so great to be hearing what would have been normal conversation when she was a young mother. Is he walking? Cutting teeth? Picking the wrong things up and throwing them? Havily\u2019s three little girls had died before her ascension.</p><p>So much sadness in life.</p><p>Yet so much joy.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go chat with the colonel? It sounds like he may have brought his entire family in today. Would you like to meet them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>Alison rose, all stately six feet of her.</p><p>Fiona heard another woman\u2019s laughter, and that earlier chill once more caught her across the shoulders. What was that? Maybe she was getting sick. Then she remembered\u2014ascenders never got sick.</p><p>\u201cYes, he brought his wife. She\u2019s a joy. I think you\u2019ll really like her. In some ways, oddly, you remind me of her. Probably because your eye color is very similar, a lovely silver-blue.\u201d</p><p>Fiona heard the rippling laughter and was transported back more than a hundred years. Her mother had had a laugh just like that. How strange.</p><p>Sadness crept in at the reminder of something so familiar to her, yet something she had lost when she\u2019d been abducted. She felt an urgent need to remain where she was, maybe crawl under the conference table and stay there, oh, for a year, maybe a decade. She wasn\u2019t stable yet. Her knees shook as she stood. For all her strength all those decades, of being killed and brought back to life month after month, for some reason coming to a place of safety at long last had robbed her of her staying ability; she felt almost unequal to meeting the colonel and his family.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t about to give in to such weakness. She\u2019d always squared up to life, even when it was hard.</p><p>She moved next to Alison down the hallway. Colonel Seriffe came into view first. His wife was somewhere behind him, as was Havily. He had a little boy in his arms, dimpled fists, light brown hair in soft curls at the nape of his neck. So adorable. The sight of him, of a child thriving in this world, filled her heart with ... joy.</p><p>But at the same time, a sense of knowing began a slow march down her spine. Again she had an impulse to run away and hide, but she didn\u2019t know why. What was it about the presence of this family that threatened to undo her?</p><p>Still, she stayed the course. She straightened her shoulders and took a couple of deep breaths. She focused on the child, the little boy, the one seated on the colonel\u2019s left arm.</p><p>Suddenly, she felt as though she knew that little boy, but that was impossible. Yet the feeling remained.</p><p>Behind the colonel, Havily spoke to Seriffe\u2019s wife. She could hear them chattering as Havily gestured in small wild movements with her hands, but the colonel\u2019s broad shoulders and six-five frame hid most of his wife.</p><p>Two older children moved up next to their father, both with Seriffe\u2019s dark hair and eyes. The toddler in his arms turned in Alison\u2019s direction and held his arms out to her. He looked achingly familiar to Fiona. Surely she had seen this child before, somewhere. But she\u2019d been in Metro Phoenix Two barely a week. Alison took him easily and started speaking softly to him. He put his little hands on her face, and Alison kissed his fingers.</p><p>Her mind swam with images from long ago. Her daughter had looked just like this child, from the large silvery blue eyes, to the light curly brown hair, to the sweetest smile in the world.</p><p>Her gaze slid from the little boy, to Seriffe, then his wife joined him. Fiona met her eyes. She knew this woman. She knew her. She couldn\u2019t place her but another set of chills chased down her back, and this time her shoulders and arms as well, until her fingertips hummed with unsuspected power, even recognition. She knew her, but how? Had she been a blood slave who had escaped at one time, maybe decades ago? But that was impossible. Fiona would have remembered if any of the slaves had escaped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Weirdest of all, tears started spilling from Fiona\u2019s eyes and the woman\u2019s eyes at almost exactly at the same moment. Fiona wept and the woman wept. But why? Fiona gave a little cry and the woman shook her head back and forth. She put her hands to her mouth and cried out behind her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Carolyn?\u201d Seriffe asked. \u201cDarling, what\u2019s wrong? This is ... Fiona. Oh ... dear ... God. You have the same eyes. I didn\u2019t see it before.\u201d</p><p>Havily drew up beside the young mother. \u201cWhat is it, Carolyn? What\u2019s happening? Fiona, are you all right? Why are you crying? Why are you both crying? What did I miss?\u201d</p> <p>Alison just looked from one woman to the next then echoed Seriffe. \u201cOh, dear God. It can\u2019t be!\u201d</p><p>The young mother, Carolyn, the one with the silvery blue eyes, finally said, \u201cMother? Is that you? After all these decades, you didn\u2019t die? You ascended? Oh, God, Mother is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarolyn? Carolyn Gaines of Boston?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t drown in a yachting accident?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I ascended in 1913.\u201d She gestured with a graceful hand to the toddler in Alison\u2019s arms, to the older boys beside the colonel, then to Seriffe himself. \u201cThis is my family. The colonel and I ... we married a few years ago.\u201d</p><p>Fiona\u2019s gaze hadn\u2019t left Carolyn\u2019s beautiful silvery eyes, her light honey-brown hair, the slight angel-kiss in her chin. \u201cMy daughter,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDearest Creator in heaven ... my daughter.\u201d</p><p>She lost all sensation in her feet and before she understood what was happening, she fell into a black abyss of shock and disbelief and something more, something wonderful, something, yes, very much like ... joy.</p><p>Parisa Lovejoy, newly appointed Guardian of Ascension, tried on the ceremonial royle robe. It had been designed for her based on portraits of Luchianne, done by historical artists about five hundred years earlier. The renditions had been created as a combination of Endelle\u2019s descriptions and anecdotal evidence provided by scholar Philippe Reynard.</p><p>Despite all that she had been through with Antony, especially the role she had played beside him during the recent Grand Canyon battle, she felt ridiculous wearing the floor-length garments. Viewing herself in the mirror, she looked like something out of ancient Rome. Who are you, what are you doing wearing such elegant robes, how can you be this person, this woman?</p><p>She felt panicky. To go from librarian, to the bonded breh of a Warrior of the Blood, to a Guardian of Ascension, to an ambassador of Second Earth with royle wings was all way too much. To say the least, she felt inadequate.</p> <p>The outer garment was deep purple with a soft but very large curled collar. Heavy wide sleeves were embroidered all around the bell-like cuffs with an intricate pattern of swirls meant to represent wind.</p><p>She turned to the side and lowered the outer robe to her waist. The shimmery gold silk of the under-robe felt right to her, though. It was cut in a T down her back, similar to her weapons harness, and was intended for wing release.</p><p>She let the outer garment fall in a purple puddle to the floor. Beneath all the gold silk was a fine mesh that secured the fabric of the skirt to her soft leggings. It had felt so strange when she\u2019d first put the garment on, but she understood the purpose. When she was in flight, the mesh would keep the gown close to her body. Nothing had been left to chance.</p><p>Antony appeared behind her in the mirror. She turned to him. He wore a similar getup, leggings and all, but he looked magnificent. His hair was pulled back tight in the cadroen, which of course showed off his high strong cheekbones and his overall beauty. Her lips parted as she looked at him. And he was all hers? What miracle had brought so much man, so much warrior into her life, to savor, to love, to enjoy forever, God willing.</p><p>The gods had smiled on her. There could be no other answer.</p><p>Antony smiled. Her heart ached at the sight. She put her hand on his cheek. \u201cI love you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He put his hands on her arms and drew a deep breath. He released it slowly. \u201cWhy are you fretting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I would be a warrior. I was going to enter the training program.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still want to. My heart yearns for that, to be a warrior like you. But I think what I\u2019ve come to realize is that every ascender is a warrior, no matter the occupation.\u201d</p><p>Antony kissed her. \u201cSo much wisdom for one so young. And remember, nothing is fixed. Right now we both have this job to do, but it\u2019s conceivable you could enter the program later.\u201d</p><p>Her spirits lifted. \u201cThat\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it? I keep forgetting that the ascended life has the potential for immortality.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the purple linen pooled around her feet. \u201cHow am I worthy of any of this?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe aren\u2019t. Neither of us. No ascender can be, and the minute you think you\u2019re worthy, you\u2019re in trouble. Besides, I think you need some perspective about what\u2019s going to happen. Madame Endelle is sending us on a one-hundred-day tour of one hundred Territories. By the time we return I have no doubt we will both want to burn these robes, and we\u2019ll have a whole new set of really bad words to describe Her Supremeness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, you are so right. We should plan a bonfire ceremony before we even leave. Why don\u2019t you hire a contractor to build a pyre near the pool?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and pulled her into his arms.</p><p>Parisa now stood on the purple robes but she didn\u2019t care. She pressed her nose into his neck and sniffed long and loud. He smelled sooo good, sage and earth and man all in one. Certain unfortunate thoughts began swirling through her mind. She felt him tense.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThe scent of tangerines is so thick in my brain right now I can hardly think.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his hips against her and let her feel his response, but she already had. One of the results of the breh-hedden was the strange way in which she could feel his physical body, in an external sense. She could feel what her hips felt like pressing back at him, the pleasure she gave. She could feel from his perspective what it was like to have her large breasts smashed against his chest. She could feel his body respond, his cock thicken, lengthen, harden.</p><p>Shivers chased over her body in response, and in further response, his own body quivered. It was such a hot, dangerous back-and-forth. Oh, yeah.</p><p>She drew back and looked up at him, but didn\u2019t break contact. \u201cSo how much time do we have?\u201d</p><p>He growled. \u201cWe are not due at the palace for Endelle\u2019s costume approval for half an hour.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, he quivered. She started to fold off the clothes but he stopped her and laughed. \u201cAllow me, please.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. They so did not have time for her to practice more of her folding skills, which still sucked.</p><p>Within a split second she was flush against him flesh-to-flesh. She sighed and melted into his arms. The breh-hedden lit her up, and he was fire on her skin. The apertures down her back wept, and her fingers felt the ridges of his wing-locks. She flicked them gently and he writhed heavily against her. He turned her in the direction of the bed. She heard the swish of the comforter and top sheet. The next moment she was flat on her back and he was entering her, all those weighty inches of him, pushing into her, making her back arch, her wing-locks seep and make a mess of their bed. The silk sheets would have to go. Silk didn\u2019t like moisture. Maybe a terry-cloth sheet ... at least for times like these.</p><p>An hour after the meeting with Endelle, Medichi had his woman under the curve of his arm. He stood on the lip of the Grand Canyon, in about the same spot he\u2019d been more than two weeks ago when he\u2019d chased a rogue death vampire down, down, down to the raging river below, when he\u2019d flipped him into the water then hauled him onto the rock that had broken him, when he\u2019d pierced the bastard\u2019s mind and taken the one piece of information he\u2019d needed to find Parisa.</p><p>Now he was back, to look, to remember, to ponder.</p><p>Parisa shuddered. \u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201d</p><p>The recent battle was still fresh, for both of them.</p><p>But so was the miracle that had followed, their miracle, which had emerged because they\u2019d each had the courage to swallow their fears and to complete the breh-hedden.</p><p>\u201cWe were born here,\u201d he said, not looking at her. His mind was fixed in the distance, the vastness of the canyon, the beauty, the impossibility of it all, the breadth of time that had carved out the abyss, and his wings that could breach it all.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe were born here, that part of you and me that became an us. You\u2019re right, we were.\u201d</p><p>He felt how solemn she was. He knew her mind now, all of her intricacies, her fears, her shames, her triumphs, her loves, and just how much she admired him. He thrived on that, her respect for him, her willingness to stand beside him because she believed in him.</p><p>He held her closer. Fear rode him for a brief arctic moment. A shiver passed through him. Bad things were coming, terrible things for the Warriors of the Blood, for those women bonded to them. He knew it in the hard hateful way that he had started knowing things.</p><p>But at the same time, peace descended.</p><p>This was life, ascended life, good, bad, indifferent, terrifying.</p><p>But it was also grand, huge, magnificent, full of unbelievable joys and, yes, on occasion triumphs.</p><p>He let these pleasures flow through him. He looked at Parisa, and she turned from admiring the beauty in front of her to meeting his gaze. Her smile reached her beautiful amethyst eyes, so much the color of the banding on their shared wings.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He drew her into his arms. He kissed her, his tongue plunging and savoring. He loved all the connections he had to her, his tongue, his cock, his fingers, his arms wrapped around her, his body pressed to her, his wings, tip-to-tip, his fangs, but mostly his mind. God, yes his mind.</p><p>He felt her chest rise and fall in a deeply drawn breath and sigh. He felt her pleasure that he held her.</p><p>He pulled back from her then kissed her. \u201cI love you more than I can say.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Her smile, always her smile.</p><p>He stroked her cheek with his finger.

Of course he knew, and that knowledge delighted him. \u201cYou mean besides my fearsome body?\u201d</p><p>She giggled against him. \u201cYes, besides your fearsome body.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, then, without needing her to explain the desire of her heart, he stepped away from her. With an incredibly quicksilver movement he had not known before the breh-hedden, very much a third dimension ability, he released his wings as swift as lightning. She followed suit equally fast.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s fly,\u201d he cried.</p><p>Yes, Antony, she laid over his mind.</p> <p>Yes, he returned.</p><p>A most perfect word. </p>  </body></html>"]
