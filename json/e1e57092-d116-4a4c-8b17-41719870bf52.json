He and his monstrous army attacked the royal palace, slaughtered the beloved king and queen of Elden and sought to do the same to Nicolai, the crown prince, as well as his three siblings, Breena, Dayn and Micah.</p><p>The sorcerer succeeded in all but the latter. He had not counted on a king\u2019s hunger for retribution and a mother\u2019s love for her children.</p><p>Just before expelling his final breath, the king used his power to fill his offspring with an unbreakable need for vengeance, ensuring they would fight for eternity to claim their due. At the same time, the queen used her power to send them away, saving them. For the time being.</p> <p>Only, the king and queen were weak, their minds fogged from pain, and their magic conflicting.</p><p>And so, the royals were now bound to destroy the man who had slain their parents, yet they were also cast out of the palace, each flung to different kingdoms within the realm with only one link to the Royal House of Elden: a timepiece, given to them by their parents.</p><p>Nicolai, the Dark Seducer as his people called him, had been in bed, but not alone. He was never alone. He was a man known for the violence of his temper as well as the deliciousness of his touch; and after his youngest brother\u2019s birthday celebration, he\u2019d adjourned to his private chamber to sate himself on his newest conquest.</p><p>That\u2019s when the dual natures of the enchantments struck him.</p><p>When he next opened his eyes, he\u2019d found himself in another bed\u2014and not with his chosen partner. He was naked still, only now he was chained, a slave to the very desires he\u2019d evoked in his lover. Desires that had mingled with the magic and sent him straight to the Sex Market, where he was quickly sold to a princess of Delfina, his will no longer his own, his pleasure no longer his own, his timepiece stolen and his memories wiped from his mind.</p> <p>But two things could not be taken from him, no matter how fervently the princess tried. The cold rage in his chest and the blistering need for vengeance in his veins.</p><p>The first, he would unleash. The second, he would savor. First with the princess, and then with a sorcerer he could not quite remember, but a sorcerer he knew he despised all the same.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>He had only to escape....</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>\u201cI NEED YOU, JANE.\u201d</p> <p>Frowning, Jane Parker placed the note on her kitchen countertop. She studied the scarred, leather-bound book resting inside an unadorned box, surrounded by a sea of black velvet. A few minutes ago, she\u2019d returned from her five-mile jog. This package had been waiting on her porch.</p><p>There\u2019d been no return address. No explanation as to why the thing had been left for her, and no hint as to who \u201cI\u201d was. Or why Jane was needed. Why would anyone need her? She was twenty-seven years old and had only recently regained the use of her legs. She had no family, no friends, no job. Not anymore. Her little cabin in Smallest Town Ever, Oklahoma, was secluded, barely a blip in the neighboring expanse of lush green trees and wide-open, blue sky.</p><p>She should have tossed the thing. Of course, curiosity far outweighed caution. As always.</p><p>She carefully lifted the book. At the moment of contact, she saw her hands covered in blood and gasped, dropping the heavy tome on the counter. But when she lifted her hands to the light, they were scrubbed clean, her nails neat and painted a pretty morning rose.</p><p>You have an overactive imagination, and too much oxygen pumping through your veins from the run. That\u2019s all.</p><p>Cold hard logic\u2014her best and only friend.</p><p>The book\u2019s binding creaked as she opened to the middle, where a tattered pink ribbon rested. The scent of dust and musk wafted up, layered with something else. Something...mouthwatering and slightly familiar. Her frowned deepened.</p><p>She shifted in her seat, a twinge of pain shooting through her legs, and sniffed. Oh, yes. Her mouth definitely watered as she caught the slightest trace of sandalwood. Goose bumps broke out over her skin, her senses tingling, her blood heating. How embarrassing. And, okay, how interesting. Since the car accident that ruined her life eleven months ago, she had experienced arousal only at night, in her dreams. To react like this in daylight, because of a book...odd.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t allow herself to ponder why. There wasn\u2019t an answer that would satisfy her. Instead, she concentrated on the pages in front of her. They were yellowed and brittle, delicate. And beaded with blood? Small dots of dried crimson marred the edges.</p><p>Gently she brushed her fingertips along the handwritten text, her gaze catching on several words. Chains. Vampire. Belonged. Soul. More goose bumps, more tingling.</p><p>Some blushing.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. At last the sandalwood cologne made sense. For the past few months, she\u2019d dreamed of a vampire male in chains and woken to the fragrance clinging to her skin. And yes, he\u2019s the one who had aroused her. She\u2019d told no one. So, how had anyone known to give her this...journal?</p><p>She\u2019d worked in quantum physics for years, as well as what was considered fringe science, sometimes studying creatures of \u201cmyth\u201d and \u201clegend.\u201d She\u2019d conducted controlled interviews with actual blood drinkers and even dissected the corpses brought to her lab.</p><p>She knew that vampires, shape-shifters and other creatures of the night existed, even though her coworkers on the quantum physics side of the equation had not been privy to the truth. So, maybe someone had found out and this was a simple joke. Maybe her dreams had no connection. Except, forever had seemed to pass since she\u2019d had any contact with those coworkers. And besides, who would do such a thing? None of them had cared enough about her to do anything.</p><p>Let this go, Parker. Before it\u2019s too late.</p><p>The command from her self-preservation instincts made no sense. Too late for what?</p><p>Her instincts offered no reply. Well, the scientist in her needed to know what was going on.</p><p>Jane cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m reading a few passages, and that\u2019s that.\u201d She\u2019d been alone since leaving the hospital several months ago, and sometimes the sound of her voice was better than silence. \u201c\u2018Chains circled the vampire\u2019s neck, wrists and ankles. Because his shirt and pants had been stripped away, and a loincloth was his only apparel, there was nothing to protect his already savaged skin. The links cut him deeply, to the bone, before healing\u2014and slicing open again. He did not care. What was pain when your will, your very soul, no longer belonged to you?\u2019\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together as a wave of dizziness crashed through her. A moment passed, then another, her heartbeat speeding up and hammering wildly against her ribs.</p><p>Raw images tore through her. This man\u2014this vampire\u2014bound, helpless. Hungry. His lush lips were pulled taut, his teeth sharp, white. He was surprisingly tanned, temptingly muscled, with dark, mussed hair and a face so eerily beautiful he would haunt her nighttime fantasies for years to come.</p><p>What she\u2019d just read, she\u2019d already seen. Many times. How? She didn\u2019t know. What she did know was that in her dreams, she felt compassion for this man, even anger. And yet, there was always that low simmer of arousal in the background. Now, the arousal took center stage.</p><p>The more she breathed, the more the sandalwood scent clung to her, and the more her reality altered, as if this, her home, was nothing more than a mirage. As if the vampire\u2019s cage was real. As if she needed to stand up and walk\u2014no, run\u2014until she reached him. Anything to be with him, now and forever.</p><p>Okay. Enough of that. She slapped the book closed, even though so many questions were left dangling, and strode away.</p><p>Such a strong reaction coupled with her dreams utterly nixed the idea of a joke. Not that she\u2019d placed much hope in that direction. However, the remaining possibilities upset her, and she refused to contemplate them.</p><p>She showered, dressed in a T-shirt and jeans and ate a nutritious breakfast. Unbidden, she found her gaze returning to the leather binding, over and over again. She wondered if the enslaved vampire were real\u2014and okay. If she could help him. A few times, she even opened to the middle of the book before she realized she\u2019d moved. Always she darted off before the story could snare her. And perhaps that\u2019s why the stupid thing had been given to her. To hook her, to send her racing back to work. Well, she didn\u2019t need to work. Money was not a problem for her. More than that, she no longer loved the sciences. Why would she? There was never a solution, only more problems.</p><p>Because when one puzzle piece slid into place, there were always twenty more needed. And in the end, nothing you did, nothing that had been solved or unraveled, would save the ones you loved. There would always be some dumb guy throwing back a few cold ones at the local bar, getting into his car and hitting yours. Or something equally tragic.</p><p>Life was random.</p><p>Jane craved monotony.</p><p>But when midnight rolled around, her mind still hadn\u2019t settled in regards to the vampire. Giving up, she returned to the kitchen, grabbed the book and stalked to bed. Just a few more passages, damn it, then she\u2019d start craving monotony again.</p><p>Jane\u2019s oversize T-shirt bunched at her waist as she propped the book on her upraised legs, opened to the middle of the story, where the bookmark was still set, and returned her attention to the pages. For several seconds, the words appeared to be written in a language she did not understand. Then, a blink later, they were written in English again.</p><p>O-kay. Very weird, and surely\u2014hopefully\u2014an I-just-need-sleep mistake on her part.</p><p>She found her place. \u201c\u2018They called him Nicolai.\u2019\u201d Nicolai. A strong, luscious name. The syllables rolled through her mind, a caress. Her nipples beaded, aching for a hot, wet kiss, and every inch of her skin flushed. She thought back. She\u2019d never interviewed a vampire named Nicolai, and the one in her dream had never spoken to her. He had never acknowledged her in any way. \u201c\u2018He did not know his past or if he had a future. He knew only his present. His hated, torturous present. He was a slave, locked away like an animal.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Just like before, a wave of dizziness slammed through her. This time, Jane pressed on, even as her chest constricted. \u201c\u2018He was kept clean and oiled. Always. Just in case Princess Laila had need of him in her bed. And the princess did have need of him. Often. Her cruel, twisted desires left him beaten and bruised. Not that he ever accepted defeat. The man was wild, nearly uncontrollable, and so filled with hate anyone who looked at him saw their death in his eyes.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dizziness intensified. Hell, so did the desire. To tame a man like that, to have all of his vigor focused on you, pounding into you...his participation willing... Jane shivered.</p><p>Lose the ADD, Parker. She cleared her throat. \u201c\u2018He was hard, merciless. A warrior at heart. A man used to absolute control. At least, he thought he was. Even with his lack of memory, he was patently aware that every order directed his way scraped his nerves raw.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Another shiver rocked her. She grit her teeth. He needed her compassion, not her desire. He\u2019s that real to you? Yeah, he was. \u201c\u2018At least he would have a few days\u2019 reprieve,\u2019\u201d she read on, \u201c\u2018forgotten by one and all. The entire palace was frothing over Princess Odette\u2019s return from the grave and\u2014\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The rest of the page was blank. \u201cAnd what?\u201d Jane flipped to the next, but quickly realized the story had ended on an unfinished cliff-hanger. Great.</p><p>Thankfully\u2014or not\u2014she discovered more writing toward the end and blinked, shook her head. The words didn\u2019t change. \u201c\u2018You, Jane Parker,\u2019\u201d she recited hollowly. \u201c\u2018You are Odette. Come to me, I command you. Save me, I beg you. Please, Jane. I need you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Her name was in the book. How was her name in the book? And written by the same hand as the rest? On the same aged, stained pages, with the same smudged ink?</p><p>I need you.</p><p>Her attention returned to the part directed to her. She reread \u201cYou are Odette\u201d until the urge to scream was at last overshadowed by curiosity. Her mind swirled. There were so many paths to take with this. Forged, genuine, dream, reality.</p> <p>Come to me.</p><p>Save me.</p><p>Please.</p><p>I command you.</p><p>Something inside her responded to that command more than anything else in the book. The urge to run\u2014here, there, anywhere\u2014beat through her. As long as she found him, saved him, nothing else mattered. And she could save him, just as soon as she reached him.</p><p>I. Command. You.</p> <p>Yes. She wanted to obey. So damn badly. She felt as if an invisible cord had been wound around her neck, and was now tugging at her.</p><p>Trembling, Jane closed the book. She wasn\u2019t searching for anyone. Not tonight. She needed to regroup. In the morning, after a few coffee IVs, her head would be clear and she could reason this out. She hoped.</p><p>After placing the tome on her nightstand, she flopped into her bed and closed her eyes, trying to force her brain to quiet. An unsuccessful endeavor. If Nicolai\u2019s story was true, he was as trapped by those chains as surely as she had once been trapped by her body\u2019s infirmities.</p><p>The compassion grew...spread...</p><p>While he was kept in a cage, she had been bound to a hospital bed, her bones broken, her muscles torn, her mind hazed by medication, all because a drunk driver had slammed into her car. And while she had been\u2014was\u2014tormented by the loss of her family, since her mother, father and sister had been in the car with her, Nicolai was tormented by a sadistic woman\u2019s unwanted touch. She felt a wave of regret, a crackle of fury.</p><p>I need you.</p><p>Jane inhaled deeply, exhaled slowly and shifted to her side, clutching her pillow close. As close as she suddenly wanted to clutch Nicolai, to comfort him. To be with him. Uh, not going there. She didn\u2019t know the man. Therefore, she wasn\u2019t going to imagine sleeping with him.</p><p>But that\u2019s exactly what she did. His plight was forgotten as she imagined him climbing on top of her, his silver eyes bright with desire, his pupils blown. His lips were plump and red from kissing her entire body, still moist with her flavor. She licked at him, tasting him, tasting herself, eager for anything and everything he would give her.</p> <p>He growled his approval, flashing his fangs.</p><p>His big, muscled body surrounded her, his skin hot, little beads of sweat forming, causing them to rub and glide together, straining toward release. God, he felt good. So damn good. Long and thick. A perfect fit, stretching her just right. Rocking, rocking, faster and faster, taking her to the edge of sensation before slowing...slowing...tormenting.</p><p>She clawed at him, her nails scouring his back. He groaned. She raised her knees, squeezing his hips. Yes. Yes, more. Faster, faster still. Never enough, almost enough. More, please more.</p><p>Nicolai\u2019s tongue thrust into her mouth, rolling with hers before he bit down, drawing blood, sucking. A sharp sting, and then, finally, oh, God, finally, she tumbled over.</p><p>Ripples of satisfaction swept through her entire body, little stars winking behind her eyes. Her inner muscles clenched and unclenched, liquid heat pooling between her legs. She rode the tide for endless seconds, minutes, before sagging against the mattress, boneless, unable to catch her breath.</p><p>An orgasm, she mused dazedly. A freaking orgasm from a fantasy man, and she hadn\u2019t even needed to touch herself.</p><p>\u201cNicolai...mine...\u201d she whispered, and she was smiling as she at last drifted off to sleep.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>\u201cPRINCESS. PRINCESS, you must wake up.\u201d</p><p>Jane blinked open her eyes. Muted sunlight pushed into the bedroom\u2014an unfamiliar bedroom, she realized with confusion. Her room was plain, with white walls and brown carpet, the only furniture an unadorned bed. Now, a lacy pink canopy was draped overhead. To her right was an intricately carved nightstand, a bejeweled goblet perched on top. Beyond that, a plush, glittery carpet led to arched double doors framing a spacious closet bursting with a rainbow of velvets, satins and silks.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>She jolted upright. Dizziness hit her\u2014familiar, but not comforting\u2014and she moaned.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, princess?\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to focus and take stock. A girl stood beside her bed. A girl she had never encountered before. Short, plump, with a freckled nose and frizzy red hair, wearing a coarse brown dress that appeared uncomfortably snug.</p><p>Jane scrambled backward, hitting the headboard. \u201cWho are you? What are you doing here?\u201d Even as she spoke, her eyes widened. She knew five different languages, but she wasn\u2019t speaking any of them. And yet, she understood every word that left her mouth.</p><p>No emotion crossed the girl\u2019s features, as if she were used to strange people yelling at her. \u201cI am Rhoslyn, once personal servant to your mother but now personal servant to you. If you agree to keep me,\u201d she added, unsure now. She, too, spoke in that weird, lyrical language of flowing syllables. \u201cThe queen has bid me to rouse you and escort you to her study.\u201d</p><p>Servant? Mother? Jane\u2019s mother was dead, along with her father and her sister. The latter two had been killed on impact, the drunk driver having slammed his car into their side of the vehicle. Her mom, though...she had died right before Jane\u2019s eyes, her life dripping out of her and onto Jane, their car propped against a tree, their seat belts holding them in place, the metal doors and roof smashed so completely they\u2019d had to be pried out. But, by then, it had been too late. She\u2019d already taken her last, pained breath.</p><p>She\u2019d died the very day she was told her cancer was gone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare tease me about my mother,\u201d Jane growled, and Rhoslyn flinched.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, princess, but I do not understand. I tease you not about your mother\u2019s summons.\u201d How frightened she sounded now. Tears even beaded in her dark eyes. \u201cAnd I swear to you, I meant no offense. Please do not punish me.\u201d</p><p>Punish her? Was this some sort of joke?</p><p>The word joke was as familiar as the dizziness. But, really, joke still didn\u2019t fit. Nervous breakdown, perhaps? No, couldn\u2019t be. Breakdowns were a form of hysteria, and she was not hysterical. Plus, there was the language thing. Come on. You\u2019re a scientist. You can reason this out.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I? How did I get here?\u201d Her last memory was of reading the book and\u2014the book! Where was the book? Her heart thundered uncontrollably, a storm inside her chest, as she panned her surroundings once more. There! Her book rested on the vanity, so close, yet so far away.</p><p>Mine, every cell in her body screamed, surprising her. Equally surprising, the absolute rightness of the claim. But then, she\u2019d practically made love to the thing. And, oh, damn. Her blood heated and her skin tingled, her body readying for absolute, utter possession.</p><p>I need you, Jane. The text. She remembered the text. Come to me. Save me.</p><p>Consider this logically. She\u2019d fallen asleep, dreamed of a vampire\u2019s decadent touch and, like Alice in Wonderland, had woken up in a strange, new world. And she was awake. This was not a dream. So, where was she? How had she gotten here? What if...?</p><p>She cut off the thought before it could veer into a direction she didn\u2019t like. There had to be a rational explanation. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>As Jane scooted from the soft confines of the feather-lined mattress, the \u201cservant\u201d said, \u201cYou are in...Delfina.\u201d She spoke with a question in her tone, as if she couldn\u2019t quite grasp the fact that Jane didn\u2019t already know the answer. \u201cA kingdom without time or age.\u201d</p><p>Delfina? She\u2019d...heard of it, she realized with a start. Not the name, but the \u201ckingdom without time.\u201d A few of the beings she\u2019d interviewed had mentioned another realm, a magical realm, with differing kingdoms outside the notice of humans. At the time, she hadn\u2019t known whether to believe them or not. They\u2019d been prisoners, locked away for the good of mankind. They would have said anything to gain their freedom. Even offer to escort her into their world.</p><p>What if...?</p><p>What if she\u2019d crossed the threshold from her world and into the other? Jane finally allowed the thought to reach its conclusion, and her stomach churned with sickness.</p><p>Before the car accident changed her life so radically, she\u2019d studied more than the creatures of myth. She\u2019d studied the manipulation of macroscopic energy, attempting the \u201cimpossible\u201d on a daily basis. Like the molecular transfer of an object from one location\u2014one world\u2014to another, and she had succeeded. Not with life-forms, of course, not yet, but with plastic and other materials. That\u2019s why she\u2019d been deemed an acceptable risk for interacting with the captured beings, both dead and alive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What if she\u2019d somehow transferred herself? But how would she have done so, she wondered next, when the necessary tools were not in her cabin? Latent effects of her contact with the previously transferred materials, perhaps?</p><p>No. There were too many variables. Namely, her new, royal identity.</p><p>\u201cRhoslyn,\u201d she said, keeping her narrowed gaze on the girl as she settled her weight on her legs. Her knees knocked together, and her muscles knotted, but thankfully the dizziness did not return.</p> <p>\u201cYes, princess?\u201d</p><p>She gave herself a quick once-over, blinked with another dose of surprise and had to look again. She wore a lovely pink gown she hadn\u2019t purchased herself and had never before seen. The material bagged around her reed-thin body, dancing at her ankles.</p><p>Who the hell had dressed her?</p><p>Doesn\u2019t matter. She focused on the here and now. \u201cWhat do I look like?\u201d</p><p>Rhoslyn reached out, and Jane pursed her lips as she darted away. \u201cPlease, princess, you have been unwell. Allow me to assist you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay where you are,\u201d Jane told her. Until she figured out what was going on, she would trust no one. And without trust, there would be no touching.</p><p>The girl froze in place. \u201cWh-whatever you command, princess. Did you wish me to fetch something for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, uh, I just want to grab something from over there.\u201d Jane lumbered forward. The carpet fibers were as soft as they appeared and caressed her bare feet, tickling the sensitive areas between her toes. She moved slowly, allowing the tension to drain from her abused legs. By the time she swiped up the book and turned, she felt normal. Still the girl had not moved, her arm extended toward the bed, shaking now. \u201cAt ease,\u201d she found herself saying.</p><p>With a sigh of relief, Rhoslyn dropped her arm to her side. \u201cYou asked what you look like. Beautiful, princess. As always.\u201d Said automatically, with no real feeling.</p><p>Half of Jane\u2019s attention remained on her while the other half focused on the book. She frowned. The dark leather was unmarred. She flipped to the middle. There was no bookmark, and the pages were new, fresh. Blank. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my book,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\u2019s my book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess Odette,\u201d Rhoslyn replied smoothly. \u201cTo my knowledge, you did not arrive with a book. Now, would you like\u2014?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait. What did you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPr-princess Odette? That is your title and name. Yes? Did you wish me to call you something else? Or, perhaps I can summon the healer, and have her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, that\u2019s okay.\u201d Princess Odette, returned from the grave. Jane had read those very words. She\u2019d also read, \u201cYou, Jane Parker. You are Odette.\u201d</p><p>She twisted and leaned into the vanity, watching her reflection in the mirror. The moment she came into view, she stiffened. Light brown hair flowed over one shoulder. Her hair. Familiar. Her dark eyes were glassy, crescent-moon bruises underneath. Also familiar.</p><p>She reached out. Her fingertips pressed into the glass. Cool, solid. Real. If she lifted her gown, she would see the scars that marred her stomach and legs. She knew it.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t morphed into Princess Odette overnight, then. Or, hell, maybe she and the princess looked alike.</p><p>\u201cHow did I get here?\u201d she croaked, swinging back around to face the girl.</p><p>I need you, Jane.</p> <p>Nicolai. She sucked in a breath as his name suddenly filled her mind. Nicolai the enslaved vampire, chained, abused. Nicolai the lover, sliding into her body, her legs parting to welcome him, then squeezing to hold him captive.</p><p>Come to me.</p><p>Come to him, as if he knew her. As if she knew him. But she\u2019d never met him. At least, not to her knowledge.</p><p>Such a thing was possible, she supposed. Paradox theory suggested\u2014damn it. No. She wasn\u2019t going to hypothesize about paradox theory until she had more information. Otherwise, she\u2019d be lost in her head for days.</p><p>Rhoslyn paled. \u201cYesterday evening a palace guard found you lying on the steps outside. He carried you here, to your bedchamber. You\u2019ll be happy to note it is in the same condition you left it.\u201d</p><p>Falling asleep at home, waking up...here. Princess Odette, returned from the grave, she thought again. Alice in her Wonderland.</p><p>\u201cI hope you do not mind, but I bathed and changed you,\u201d Rhoslyn added.</p><p>White-hot heat in her cheeks. Plenty of strangers had bathed and changed her over the past eleven months, and she was relieved Rhoslyn had done so, rather than some sweating, panting guy. Still. Mortifying. \u201cWhere\u2019s my shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s being washed. I must admit, I have never seen its like. There was strange writing on it.\u201d</p><p>She closed the book and clutched it to her chest. \u201cI want it back.\u201d Just then, it was her only link to home.</p><p>\u201cOf course. After I escort you to your mother, I\u2014oh, I\u2019m sorry. I did not mean to mention her again. I will take you to...the study below and fetch the garment for you.\u201d Before Jane could comment, Rhoslyn added through gnashed teeth, \u201cI am so happy\u2014as are all your people\u2014that you have come back to us. We missed you greatly.\u201d</p><p>A lie, no question. \u201cWh-where was I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister, Princess Laila, witnessed your fall from the cliffs what seems an eternity ago. After you were stabbed and drained by your new slave. Though your body was never found, it was assumed you were dead, as no one has ever survived such a drop before. We should have known that you, the darling of Delfina, would find a way.\u201d She flashed a stiff smile that lasted a single second, no more.</p><p>Princess Laila. That name, too, reverberated in Jane\u2019s head, followed on the heels of \u201ccruel, twisted desires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicolai,\u201d she said. Was he here? Real?</p><p>The servant chewed on her bottom lip, suddenly nervous. \u201cYou wish me to bring the slave, Nicolai, to you?\u201d</p><p>Jane\u2019s blood quickened and warmed, her skin tingling just as before. The girl knew who he was. That meant he was here, that he was as real as she was.</p><p>Her mind fizzed and crackled like her favorite candy. The book. The characters. The story, coming to life before her eyes...Jane now a part of it, deeply integrated, though she was someone other than herself. Finally. A puzzle piece slid into place.</p><p>The book could have been the catalyst. Maybe, when she\u2019d read aloud, she\u2019d somehow opened a doorway from her world into this one. Maybe Nicolai had somehow sent the book to her, and she was his only hope for freedom.</p><p>\u201cNicolai,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI want you to take me to him.\u201d She had to see him, and was too impatient to wait. Would he know her? Was she right about the events that had unfolded?</p><p>Rhoslyn gulped. \u201cBut he\u2019s the one who stabbed you, and your moth\u2014I mean, er, the queen does not like to be kept waiting. She visited you once already, but you were sound asleep and could not be roused. Her impatience grows, and as you know, her temper...\u201d Her cheeks flushed as she realized what she was saying. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I meant no disrespect to the queen.\u201d</p><p>Nicolai had stabbed Odette, the woman Jane was supposed to be? Talk about a plot twist Jane hadn\u2019t seen coming. Damn. What if he tried to do the same to Jane?</p><p>He won\u2019t, some deep, secret part of her said. He needs you. He said so.</p><p>\u201cA few minutes more won\u2019t hurt the queen.\u201d Whoever the queen was, whatever she was supposed to mean to her, Jane didn\u2019t care. Although, the fact that the woman was in charge, her word law and she apparently had a temper, unsettled her.</p><p>\u201cYour sister\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She, too, was dead. Although, according to the book, Odette might just have a sister. That other princess. But again, Jane didn\u2019t care. \u201cTake me to Nicolai. Now.\u201d Time to find another puzzle piece.</p><p>A breath shuddered through the girl, the seconds ticking by in tension-filled silence. Then, \u201cWhatever you wish, princess. This way.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>THEY CALLED HIM NICOLAI. He didn\u2019t know if that was his real name. He didn\u2019t know anything about himself, really. Whenever he attempted to remember, his head throbbed with unbearable pain and his mind shut down. All he knew was that he was a vampire, and the females here were witches. That, and he despised this kingdom and its people\u2014and he would destroy them. One day. Soon. Just as he\u2019d destroyed one of their precious princesses.</p><p>Anticipation rushed through him. His captors thought him weak, ineffective. They kept him on the razor edge of hunger, giving him a drop of blood in the morning and a drop of blood at night. That was all. He was teased and tormented constantly. Especially by the Princess Laila. So highborn, but look at you now. At my feet, mine to do with as I wish.</p><p>Highborn? He would find out.</p><p>They assumed, just because he was chained and starved, he could not harm them. They had no idea of the power that swirled inside him. Power that was caged, like him, but still there, ready to burst free at any moment.</p><p>Soon, he thought again, grinning darkly.</p><p>They\u2019d had their healer bind his powers, as well as wipe his memory, and they made no secret of those facts. Why they\u2019d done the latter, however, they\u2019d never said. What did they not want him to remember? Again, he would find out. What they didn\u2019t know was that the witch had lacked Nicolai\u2019s inner strength, and already a few of his abilities had seeped through that mental cage, allowing him to summon a woman who could set him free.</p><p>A woman who had at last arrived. Urgency and relief rushed through him, driving him to pace, back and forth, back and forth, his bare feet pounding into the cold concrete, his chains rattling. Even his guards were shocked by the miracle of Princess Odette\u2019s appearance. Or rather, the girl they assumed was Princess Odette.</p><p>The real Odette was dead. He\u2019d made sure of it. He had drained her, stabbed her, then shoved her over the cliffs outside this palace. Excessively violent, perhaps, but an enemy was an enemy, and his temper had been roused. And, as he\u2019d known, not even the most powerful of witches could recover from that.</p><p>Hurry, female. I need you.</p><p>Nicolai had spent countless days, weeks, years\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure\u2014with Odette before he\u2019d killed her. She was the one who had purchased him at the Sex Market, after all. She\u2019d been a cruel girl, with a taste for delivering pain, unable to reach her climax until her unwilling partner screamed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had never climaxed with Nicolai.</p><p>Remaining silent had been a source of pride for him. No matter the instruments used on him, no matter how many males and females the bitch had allowed to touch and use him, he had only ever smiled.</p><p>When Odette took him outside the palace, threatening to throw him over the cliffs if he continued to defy her, he was finally given an opportunity to strike. She\u2019d made the mistake of leaving his muzzle behind. She\u2019d also made the mistake of stepping within his reach, chained though he\u2019d been. He\u2019d fallen on her, pinned her and sunk his fangs into her neck. Starved as he\u2019d been, he\u2019d drained her in minutes. And after that last, life-ending gulp, he\u2019d stabbed her with her own dagger, just to be sure, and shoved her over the precipice.</p> <p>Too late had the guard realized what had happened, and Nicolai had turned on him, ready for another snack. They\u2019d fought like animals. More beastlike than most, Nicolai had won. The guard had never stood a chance, really. When provoked or hungry, vampires became frenzied and ravenous\u2014unpredictable, uncontrollable predators who scented prey.</p><p>As he\u2019d drained his second victim, Princess Laila had swooped in. Having coveted her older sister\u2019s right to the throne, as well as her possessions, including Nicolai himself, she had watched Odette, waiting for the perfect time to act.</p><p>Nicolai had inadvertently given it to her. She and her guards had moved faster than his gaze could track, unfettered magic giving them strength and speed, and though his first meal in weeks had rallied him, the chains had slowed him down. He\u2019d been overpowered with embarrassing ease.</p><p>Footsteps suddenly sounded, followed by the waft of something sweet in the air, both catching his attention. Nicolai stiffened and stilled, his ears twitching, his mouth watering. Absolute hunger bathed him, his stomach twisting. Must...taste...female...</p><p>The desire did not spring from his mind, but from deep inside him. An instinct, a need.</p> <p>Usually those footsteps heralded the arrival of Laila\u2019s servants, sent to drag him up the stairs and into her bedroom. This time, a plump redhead rounded the corner. He inhaled deeply, growled. Not her. She was not the source of that sweetness.</p><p>Nicolai stopped breathing, hoping his head would clear, if only for a moment. He was so damn hungry for the one responsible...had to see her. He rooted his feet in the center of his cage, his pallet behind him, thick bars in front of him, waiting. Who would next enter the dungeon?</p><p>And then, he saw her. The summoned female. His \u201cOdette.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in another breath. Her. She was responsible. A second growl rose, this one straight from his soul. Must taste female.</p><p>She did not smell like the real Odette. To everyone else, she would. She would smell of too-strong floral perfume mixed with the raw ooze of a putrid wound\u2014evidence of her rotting heart. But to him...oh, to him... He inhaled again, unable to stop himself. Mistake. The sweetness, thicker now, almost tangible, fogged his mind. Must. Taste. His fangs and gums actually ached with the need to sample her. Must taste.</p><p>He studied her, his blood practically on fire. Anyone who looked at her would see the mask his shifted glamour had created. The mystical illusion of being someone else. Hair as dark as the Abyss, eyes of vivid emerald, skin as pale as cream. But that was where the gift of her father\u2019s famed beauty ended, and the cruelty of her mother\u2019s ugliness revealed itself. Odette was tall yet thickly built, her cheeks puffed from excess, her jaw squared with jowls. Her dark brows were substantial, and nearly connected in the center. Her nose was long with a definite hook.</p> <p>What Nicolai saw, however, was the woman his summoning had chosen. The one from his dreams. Dreams in which she stood off to the side, watching him, never speaking. Dreams he had not understood. Until now. All along, his magic had known what he needed.</p><p>She was just as tall as Odette, but reed slender, with hair the color of a honeycomb. Her eyes were seductively uptilted, a shade darker than her hair, and filled with haunting secrets. Her skin was slightly bronzed and radiant, as if the sun was hidden underneath. Her cheeks were perfectly sculpted, her chin stubborn and yet delicate.</p><p>Delicate, yes. That\u2019s what she was. Amorously delicate, utterly fragile and delightfully feminine. Almost...breakable. Would he kill her when he drank from her? And he would drink from her. He would not be able to resist that scent for long.</p><p>The protector in him rose up\u2014a part of him he had not known existed, not for some stranger\u2014demanding that he sweep her away from this and save her from the horror to come. Horror he would be responsible for. Not only from his dark embrace, but also from the evil of those around her. The people of Delfina wouldn\u2019t savor her blood if they learned the truth of her identity. They would spill it and kill her. Painfully.</p><p>Do you want your freedom or the girl out of harm\u2019s way? You can\u2019t have both.</p><p>He hardened his heart. He wanted his freedom.</p><p>Their gazes locked a second later, a shock of awareness blasting him. Perhaps she felt it, too, for she gasped, stumbled. She righted herself and stopped at the bars, her amber eyes wide, her lush, pink mouth open, revealing straight white teeth. She held a book.</p><p>Taste her...</p> <p>He wished he could see her tongue. Wished he could capture that tongue with his own. His desire surprised him. How long since he\u2019d experienced true, willing arousal?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re real,\u201d she whispered, gripping the metal with her free hand. She squeezed so tightly her knuckles bleached of color. \u201cYou\u2019re really here. And you look exactly as I dreamed.\u201d</p><p>He nodded stiffly\u2014and that wasn\u2019t the only stiff thing about him. His cock filled, lengthening, thickening. \u201cI am real, yes.\u201d She\u2019d dreamed of him, as he\u2019d dreamed of her? He liked the idea.</p><p>He motioned to the servant with a tilt of his chin. Get rid of her.</p><p>Her attention whipped to the girl, and she uttered another gasp, as though startled to find they weren\u2019t alone. \u201cYou may go, Rhoslyn. And thank you for bringing me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for you, princess.\u201d Expression softening with her relief, Rhoslyn curtsied. She raced around the corner and pounded up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou are confused,\u201d Nicolai said. How harsh his voice was, pushing through his teeth and slicing up his tone.</p><p>A shiver slid down her slight frame as she faced him. \u201cYes. One minute I was at home, reading a book\u2014about you! The next I was here. How am I here? Where is here? At first, I thought I was hallucinating or that this was a joke, but that isn\u2019t right. I know that isn\u2019t right. I\u2019m calm. I see, I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hallucination, and no joke.\u201d His frown deepened, his fangs cutting into his bottom lip. Just a taste, one little taste. \u201cYou were reading a book about me? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fell to his teeth, and she gulped. \u201cYes. Written by you, I think.\u201d Her voice was as soft and delicate as her features. \u201cOr at least, part of it was. But no, this isn\u2019t it. This one is blank. Or maybe this is it, but the writing just hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d</p><p>To his knowledge, he had not written a book, and had not sent a book to anyone. That did not mean anything, however. The memory of doing so could be buried with all the rest of his past.</p><p>He closed his eyes for a moment, enjoying the scent of her\u2014and felt the ache in his gums intensify. He was walking toward her, determined to grab her, bite her.</p><p>When he realized what he was doing, he forced himself to stop. He would scare her, and she would scream. Guards would rush inside to save her.</p><p>He could cover her mouth with one hand, of course, and tilt her back with the other, giving himself a wide playing field. He could lick...finally, blessedly taste...</p><p>Concentrate. \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d Again, his tone was harsh, demanding. \u201cHave you met me before? Besides in your dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Disappointing. \u201cI will explain everything. Later,\u201d he lied. The less she knew, now and in the future, the better it would be for her. \u201cRight now, we must hurry.\u201d Ever since he\u2019d woken up in the slave market\u2014weeks, months, years ago?\u2014he\u2019d been driven by more than a need to feed and escape. He\u2019d been driven by an urge to reach the kingdom of Elden.</p><p>He must get there. And soon. More than that, he must slay the new king. He didn\u2019t know why, he just knew that even thinking of the man filled him with rage. And every day that this man lived, a piece of Nicolai died. The knowledge was separate from his memories, springing from the same place as his need to taste this woman.</p><p>Taste. How many times would he think the word?</p><p>Countless. Until he got what he wanted, he was sure.</p><p>\u201cGive me your arm.\u201d He licked his lips at the thought of touching her, of knowing the texture of her skin. \u201cI will mark you.\u201d A little nip of her wrist, and he would stop. He would make himself stop. For now.</p><p>She shook her head, honeycomb hair dancing over her shoulders. \u201cNo. Explain now. Afterward, we\u2019ll talk about the marking thing, whatever that is.\u201d</p><p>Surely the female was not as stubborn as she seemed. \u201cWe might be separated.\u201d Before she freed him. \u201cI want to know where you are at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m not sure how I feel about someone knowing where I am at all times. But again, we\u2019ll discuss it. After.\u201d</p><p>All right, she was more stubborn than she seemed. \u201cAs you can see, I have been enslaved. Tortured.\u201d Uttering the words enraged him further. He should never have allowed himself to be placed in this situation. He should have been stronger. He was stronger. But he had no idea how he\u2019d ended up in the Sex Market. \u201cI don\u2019t even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014know if your name is really Nicolai. Blah, blah, blah. I know. I told you, I read a few passages of the book. I just don\u2019t understand this.\u201d She motioned to the prison, to him, to her gown. \u201c\u2018Jane, I need you,\u2019 you said. How did you know to write to me when we\u2019ve never met?\u201d Desperation wafted from her. \u201cUnless I came here before, but returned home to a time before we\u2019d met, and my dreams were echoes of what was to be. That would mean history is now looping, but of course, that creates a paradox, and\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Jane. Her name was Jane. Somehow familiar, causing his arousal to ramp up...up. Maybe because the syllable was as soft and lyrical as her strange\u2014though slight\u2014accent. Focus. If she had asked anyone else these questions... \u201cWhat have you mentioned to the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She laughed without humor. \u201cI don\u2019t know them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s good.\u201d But she knew him, even though they had only seen each other in their dreams? As he had claimed to know her in that book? Something more was going on here. \u201cWhere are you from, Jane?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOklahoma.\u201d</p><p>Oklahoma was not part of this magical realm. \u201cYou are human, then? Not a witch?\u201d</p><p>A sweep of dark lashes, momentarily hiding undiluted shock. And pride. \u201cI was right. I crossed over, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane. I asked you a question.\u201d And he was used to getting answers immediately. He felt it in his bones.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m human, and no, I\u2019m not a witch. But you, you\u2019re a vampire.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. He knew this realm coexisted alongside the mortal world\u2014a world mostly ignorant of what surrounded them.</p><p>Crossing over, as she had mentioned, happened more often than it should. How and why, though, no one knew. One moment you would be talking to a shifter or fighting an ogre, and the next moment a human would be in his place. And if not a human, a useless, bendable object.</p><p>Disappointment nearly felled Nicolai. Why had his magic chosen this woman? What good was a human here? Even so luscious a human? If Jane were asked to perform a ritual, as Odette had often been asked, she would be unable. She would fail. Everyone would know she was not who she claimed to be, before he could get what he wanted.</p><p>He had to act faster than planned.</p><p>\u201cListen. I summoned you here, and I am the one who protects you.\u201d A small truth meant to pacify her. \u201cTrust no one else. Only me.\u201d A lie meant to save him. For once she set him free, he truly planned to leave. This palace\u2014and her. As unstable as his abilities were, he could not remove the mask that made her Odette while they were together without the possibility of sending her home. Plus, he needed her able to travel freely through this palace as only a princess could. What a princess couldn\u2019t do was travel unfettered outside these walls.</p><p>The moment she let him go, Jane would have nothing but her wits to shield her.</p> <p>Guilt filled him. Before the emotion had time to settle, develop roots and grow, he ground it into powder and scattered every speck. He could not soften. No matter how desperately he craved this woman\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cSo, you wield some type of magic?\u201d she said. \u201cAll right. I can roll with the idea of a magical vampire. But really, a lot of people assume science is magic, so are we talking about planar, natural, runic, divine or metaphysical, because I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane.\u201d She was a babbler. He found the trait...charming. He frowned. Charming? Truly? The need to taste her must be clouding his judgment.</p><p>Abashed, she smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Curiosity and puzzles are my downfall. At least, they used to be. I thought I\u2019d come to hate them, but, well, as you can see, that\u2019s no longer the case.\u201d</p><p>That smile...had he ever seen so open and innocent a sight? Another spark of guilt ignited in his chest, but again, he quickly ground and scattered it. Easier done this time, as the force of his arousal intensified, becoming his sole focus.</p><p>No. Only escape mattered, he told himself.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d she asked. \u201cI mean, how did you know to summon me?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d wanted a female susceptible to the lure of a vampire, one untainted by the evil of the Queen of Hearts, one who was not afraid of blood, who would understand his plight. He told her none of that. He knew women\u2014or, at least, thought he did\u2014and knew it would not please her. \u201cOrder my release. Now. Hurry.\u201d</p> <p>Frustration suddenly radiated from her. \u201cHow?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cSummon the guard,\u201d he said. \u201cTell them to unchain me, that you wish to take me to your bedchamber. Then, tell them to bring the healer to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe healer?\u201d Her concerned gaze swept over him. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>No. But the healer had bound his memories and powers, and so the healer could easily free them. And, he mused darkly, he wanted to kill the bitch. \u201cI do not hear you calling for the guard, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen your ears are working perfectly, Nicolai. So, the guards will do what I tell them?\u201d She snapped her fingers. \u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn their minds, you are the princess Odette. Oldest daughter of their queen, and soon to be their ruler.\u201d Nicolai finally allowed himself to stride the rest of the way to the bars, his chains rattling. Closing in... \u201cThey will do anything you tell them to do.\u201d</p><p>She released the metal and backed away before he could touch her. As if he were dirty, unworthy. He probably was. \u201cYes, but why do they believe I\u2019m Odette?\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked below his eye. Her continued questioning irritated him, yes, but her distance irritated him more. When close to her, the scent of her was nearly overpowering and so delectable he was probably drooling. \u201cBecause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause why?\u201d</p><p>Stubborn baggage. \u201cBecause my...vampire magic made them,\u201d he said flatly. To tell her more was to, perhaps, send her running. Humans were so easily frightened by what they did not understand.</p><p>For the moment, he needed this woman on his side, and calm. Although, to be honest, she\u2019d handled things very well so far.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she insisted.</p><p>He shook the bars. \u201cDo as I told you, Jane. We must hurry.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cYou\u2019re cute when you\u2019re ordering me around, you know that?\u201d The color in her cheeks brightened, and her breath became shallow. \u201cAnd you...you smell like sandalwood.\u201d</p><p>She liked his scent as much as he liked hers, he realized. It aroused her. Her nipples were pearling beneath her robe, begging for a touch, a kiss. Did her belly quiver? Was she already moist between her legs?</p><p>His hands fisted at his sides. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here or how they captured me, but I do know that I don\u2019t belong here. I know that if I stay, I will be tortured again and again. Tell me you are not like them, Jane. Tell me you do not like to watch a man be tortured.\u201d</p><p>Her dark gaze fell to the metal linked around his neck, then dipped lower, perhaps following the beads of dried blood that rode the ropes of his stomach before stopping at his tented loincloth.</p><p>Another shiver from her. \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said on a broken wisp of air. \u201cBut what happens if they realize I\u2019m not truly Odette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t find out.\u201d This lie did not leave him smoothly. \u201cAll right? All you need to know to aid the illusion is that you bought me at the Sex Market. You own me. Demand my release, and escort me to your\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sound of footsteps echoed, and Nicolai pressed his lips together. Jane tensed. An audience, exactly what they did not need right now. Then Laila rounded the corner, a scowl marring her already ugly face. She was as short and squat as her mother, her cheeks just as padded as Odette\u2019s, and her jowls just as noticeable.</p><p>Without the hooked nose, however, she was the \u201cbeauty\u201d of the family. The length of her dark hair was coiled on top of her head, ringlets hanging at her temples. She wore an opulent gown of bright green velvet to match her eyes, though there was nothing in this kingdom or any other that could make her attractive. The evil of her soul was simply too dark.</p><p>A silver timepiece hung from a chain around her neck. She was never without it, and the sight of it never failed to twist Nicolai\u2019s stomach with rage. Why?</p><p>She ground to a halt when she spotted Jane, hurriedly smoothing her features into a doting expression. \u201cWhat are you doing here, sister dear? And in your nightgown, no less.\u201d An anxious laugh. \u201cYou should be resting. We don\u2019t want you getting sick, do we? You\u2019ve already suffered so much.\u201d</p><p>Her voice never failed to disgust him, either. He\u2019d heard it over him, under him, behind him, her warm breath trekking over his skin. Now, so close to escape, he had to bite his tongue to hold his curses inside.</p><p>Soon, he would destroy her.</p><p>Jane gulped, looked at him.</p><p>Do what I told you, Jane, he projected at her, a part of him resenting the need to do so. He\u2019d never had to beg for anything in his life. He\u2019d always\u2014a sharp ache erupted in his temples, cutting off his thoughts. A memory, dead and gone before it had a chance to live.</p><p>\u201cYou are Princess Laila. My sister. Yes.\u201d Jane breathed deeply, squared her shoulders, and faced her \u201csister.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s mine. I own him.\u201d What she lacked in conviction she made up for with determination.</p><p>Good girl.</p><p>Laila gritted her too-white teeth, and shifted from one sandaled foot to the other. \u201cYes, but you were gone, darling. I took over his care. He\u2019s mine now.\u201d She stroked the timepiece. \u201cIn situations such as this, Mother always sides with the one in possession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. He\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdette, be reasonable.\u201d How patient Laila appeared. A falsehood. \u201cHe attempted to slay you once, and nearly succeeded. He is too much for you to handle and I have grown used to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said he\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Good girl, he thought again. So badly Nicolai wished he could unleash the torrent of power inside him, now rather than later. He would crush Laila, smile when she screamed, laugh when she died, then raze this palace brick by brick and dance atop the rubble.</p><p>Soon. The word was a constant inside him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what powers he could wield, or if they\u2019d be strong enough to do everything he wanted to this kingdom. Absolute, total destruction. But he wasn\u2019t worried. Were his powers not too weak, he would raise his army and they would march\u2014</p><p>Another ache tore through his head, another memory destroyed. He hissed from the pain, clearing his mind before he shut down completely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Both women flicked him a glance before refocusing on each other. But Laila\u2019s attention quickly returned to him, to his erection\u2014still pulsing with need of Jane\u2014and her mouth hung open with shock. \u201cYou\u2019re aroused.\u201d</p><p>Silent, he reached under his loincloth and stroked his length up and down, taunting her with what he\u2019d never willingly offered her.</p><p>Laila gave a strangled choke, her eyes widening as she faced her sister. \u201cHow did you arouse him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d Jane blushed as becomingly as she smiled. So innocent and sweet, sunlight and moonlight twined together. Taste...</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Laila snapped, all pretense of love and patience vanishing. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Mother\u2019s on a rampage and demands a word with you. She mourned your death for days, and was ecstatic by your return. But that happiness will not save you from a whipping if you continue to defy her.\u201d</p><p>A mother, mourning her child for days. How sweet, Nicolai mentally sneered. But then, the Queen of Hearts was known as a brutal tyrant, an unforgiving bitch and a power hungry murderer. Nicolai\u2019s own mother had\u2014</p><p>He clenched his jaw against the pain.</p><p>\u201cI heard you were on your way down here,\u201d Laila went on, \u201cand came to get you. You don\u2019t want to keep your queen waiting, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Damn this. Jane was letting Laila direct her, proving she had not the strength of will to lead. His one and only chance for escape was withering with every second that passed.</p><p>\u201cLaila, no. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour poor, addled mind hasn\u2019t yet recovered from your fall, has it, darling? But you like having skin on your back, I know you do. Guards,\u201d Laila called.</p><p>Jane twisted her fingers together, clearly agitated. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014 There\u2019s no need. I don\u2019t want to be whipped, but I really need to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Two armed guards swung around the corner and stopped behind Princess Laila. They kept their gazes straight ahead as they awaited orders.</p><p>If they touched Jane, Nicolai would execute them. He would cut their throats, and spit on their remains. The ferocity of the thought should have surprised him. Jane was here for one purpose, and one purpose only, whether she acted like it or not, and remaining untouched by the citizens of Delfina was not it. Surprised, Nicolai wasn\u2019t. Nothing would stop him from attacking these men in cold blood. Jane was his. His savior, his to handle. Only his. No one else was allowed.</p><p>Until he left her.</p><p>He bit his tongue so hard he tasted his own blood.</p><p>\u201cMuzzle the prisoner and cart him to my chamber,\u201d Laila commanded, and he relaxed somewhat. The men weren\u2019t here for Jane, then. \u201cMy sister and I will visit with the queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nicolai growled before he could stop himself.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Astonished, Laila leveled her attention on him. She wrapped her fat little fingers around the timepiece hanging from her neck and squeezed. \u201cYou dare issue commands, slave? To me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdette stays.\u201d Jane might have fooled the servants and her sister, but she would not find the Queen of Hearts so gullible. She had groomed Odette in her image, and no one knew her better. Jane and her odd speech would be found out. Killed before Nicolai could use her.</p> <p>Heart...hardening.</p><p>Softening...</p><p>Laila floundered. \u201cYou\u2019ll try and kill her again. That\u2019s why you want her here. I know it. That\u2019s why you\u2019re pretending to desire her.\u201d</p><p>He flicked his tongue over his fangs. \u201cI need inside her. That\u2019s why I want her here.\u201d</p><p>Once again, Jane blushed.</p><p>\u201cYou...you\u2019re lying,\u201d Laila stammered. \u201cYou hate her. You wouldn\u2019t want to bed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI crave her.\u201d</p><p>A pause, heavy with tension. Motions clipped, Laila closed the distance between her and her sister and wrapped an arm around Jane\u2019s waist. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him. He\u2019ll say anything to gain a second chance to harm you. Come now. I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jane jumped from Laila\u2019s embrace and glared up at the guards. \u201cTake Nicolai to my chamber, but don\u2019t muzzle him. And tell M-Mother that I\u2019m in need of rest. I\u2019ll speak to her later.\u201d</p><p>Laila paled as the men leaped into action. Seconds later, hinges were squeaking as the door to Nicolai\u2019s cage swung open. There were more footsteps, then a key was inserted into the metal base that pinned him to the wall.</p><p>His relief was palpable.</p><p>\u201cBut...but, Odette. You are placing yourself in danger,\u201d Laila said, desperate.</p><p>\u201cHe. Is. Mine. Nothing more needs to be said.\u201d</p><p>Wrong words. The claim\u2014he is mine\u2014affected him, giving birth to a savage animal inside him. Hers, he was hers, and he would have her before he left her, no matter the consequences. Over and over again. In every way imaginable. He would drink her, and possess her body.</p><p>There would be no stopping him, no reasoning with him. Not now.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>THE GUARDS FORCED NICOLAI onto the bed, the feathered mattress dipping and puffing under his weight. They anchored the metal links curling around his neck to a steel hook in the wall, just above the headboard, then removed the chains from his ankle and wrists\u2014only to cuff him to the bedposts.</p><p>Odette had brought slaves here before, Jane realized. The posts were scarred, the deep grooves evidence of their resistance. A lot of resistance. How many times had Nicolai suffered this kind of indignity with the princess?</p><p>At least he didn\u2019t try and bite the guards, and they didn\u2019t try to hurt him, and Jane didn\u2019t have to side with a \u201cslave,\u201d fueling suspicion. Already she felt as if she had a neon sign blinking over her head: Imposter.</p><p>Thank God Laila hadn\u2019t realized the truth. And wasn\u2019t the other princess a shocker? Short, squat and foaming-at-the-mouth-rabies mean. Seriously. If the Wicked Witch of the West had slept with Hannibal Lecter, and the two of them had a baby, that child\u2019s name would be Laila.</p><p>Pay attention to what\u2019s happening around you, Parker!</p><p>Right. Jane focused. She watched, flabbergasted, as one of the guards cleaned Nicolai from head to toe and the other oiled him.</p><p>She placed the book on the nightstand, considered protesting what was being done to him, but wasn\u2019t sure \u201cOdette\u201d would do such a thing. Therefore, she held her tongue. Through it all, Nicolai remained silent, his expression blank, but his gaze, oh, his gaze was glued to her. His pupils were huge, his irises still sparkling with...desire.</p><p>For her, or for her blood? His fangs were sharp and long, revealing the depths of his hunger.</p><p>Just then, he was the poster child for bondage, blood and a badass fetish. He was chained, yes, but he would be in control. He was strong, in body and in mind, and he exuded something, pheromones, perhaps, that drew slavelike desires from her. Every cell in her body ached, frantic to know his touch. He was the most physically perfect being she\u2019d ever encountered.</p><p>Seeing such a proud, strong man bound like that, lying atop a bed of pink lace and ruffles, being readied for her use, should have caused her stomach to churn with sickness. But she only wanted him more.</p><p>Her mind had pictured him before she\u2019d ever met him, yes, but her mind had not done him justice. He was tall, at least six foot four, with wide muscled shoulders, a stomach roped and corded, and skin as smooth as cream mixed with coffee. He had shoulder-length hair as dark as midnight, and eyes the color of moonlight glinting off snow, silvery yet threaded with gold.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see her death in those eyes, as the book had promised. She saw her seduction. How many times had she had to stop herself from reaching out, letting him \u201cmark\u201d her, whatever that meant, just to feel his skin against hers? Too many. That\u2019s why she\u2019d jumped away from him when he\u2019d reached for her. She\u2019d feared her reaction, afraid of an increase in the desire she felt. Already being near him was becoming a need as necessary as breathing.</p><p>The same force that had brought her here had to be responsible for what she was feeling.</p><p>Though he was cut and bruised, with dried blood caked along his arms and legs, he had not a single scar. In fact, he did not have a flaw, period. The closest thing to an imperfection he had was the thin trail of dark hair traveling from his navel to the waist of his loincloth\u2014and that wasn\u2019t an imperfection so much as a roadway to heaven.</p><p>Speaking of the final destination of that naughty roadway...down in the cell, he\u2019d been aroused by her, and he hadn\u2019t tried to hide it. He\u2019d boasted about it, drawing attention to his groin. With very good reason. Besides her dreams and single fantasy about him, she had been with only one man. And that man could not compare. She doubted any man could. \u201cBig\u201d was an understatement in Nicolai\u2019s case.</p><p>When he\u2019d touched himself, running his fingers up and down his length, her body had ached. She\u2019d forgotten her circumstances and imagined dropping to her knees. Tonguing him, drinking him in.</p><p>Mind, stop dipping your toes in the gutter pool!</p><p>Finally the guards finished and strode toward the door. Her shouted command, \u201cLeave the key,\u201d stopped both men.</p><p>The shorter of the two faced her and bowed. \u201cYou have the key to these restraints, princess.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Odette would have known that. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, swallowing, \u201cthe fall...from the cliffs\u2014you heard about the cliffs, right?\u2014must have caused me to forget. You can, uh, leave us.\u201d She waved toward the door, as princessy as possible. God, acting like someone other than who she was\u2014like someone she\u2019d never met\u2014was not fun.</p><p>The door shut with a soft clink.</p><p>She rounded on her \u201cprisoner,\u201d closing the distance between them, stopping only when the edge of the bed forced her. Again, she wanted to touch him, but she couldn\u2019t allow herself the luxury. Those teeth... He could take her jugular as a souvenir.</p><p>\u201cThe key is in the drawer of the nightstand,\u201d Nicolai said, breaking the silence first. \u201cUse it.\u201d</p><p>Even his voice was a delight. A sensual feast of tones and nuances. Raspy, husky, a wisp of smoke. She shivered, licked her lips. \u201cYou might have summoned me or whatever, but you are not in charge. So listen up. I\u2019ll get the key\u2014after you tell me more about what\u2019s going on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou and your \u2018afters.\u2019\u201d He glared at her, the long length of his lashes fused together and shielding the uniqueness of his dual-colored irises. \u201cThis is blackmail.\u201d As irritated as he appeared, he also seemed...proud.</p><p>Why proud? In and out she breathed, luxuriating in the scent of sandalwood. Far stronger now than when she\u2019d dreamed or read the book. \u201cYes, it\u2019s blackmail, and I won\u2019t back down.\u201d</p><p>Cruel of her, but she suspected the moment she released him, he\u2019d feed first, then race out the door, leaving her behind without giving her a single answer. He had the look of a cornered panther, ready to bite and bolt. Plus, he hadn\u2019t wanted to talk to her in the dungeon and wouldn\u2019t have, if she hadn\u2019t pressed him. Therefore, she would continue to press him.</p> <p>\u201cApparently, I\u2019m risking a whipping by being here with you,\u201d she added. \u201cYou kind of owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand,\u201d he gritted.</p><p>She\u2019d graduated high school at the age of fifteen. Acquired her master\u2019s at eighteen. Then, while working toward her doctorate, she\u2019d joined a highly classified branch of the government to research unexplainable abilities and phenomenon, as well as find ways to accomplish the unexplainable. The only reason she\u2019d quit and changed the focus of her studies to health sciences was to move back home and help her mother, who had just been diagnosed with breast cancer.</p><p>\u201cI think I can keep up,\u201d she said dryly. She anchored her hands on her hips, the material pulling tight over her chest.</p><p>His gaze lowered to her breasts, and his lips stretched taut over his teeth. \u201cVery well. We\u2019ll talk. After you straddle me.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked at the sensual request, even as her body responded to him, readying for penetration. \u201cWhat...why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get what you want, I get what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackmail?\u201d she parroted, not nearly as controlled as she sounded. Blood rushed through her veins at an alarming rate.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Tempting. So tempting. And probably meant to cow her. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not caving.\u201d One of them had to keep things on a business level.</p><p>\u201cAre you wet?\u201d</p> <p>Breath caught in her throat. Clearly that someone was not Nicolai. Really, what kind of question was that? \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t even know you, of course I\u2019m not... I can\u2019t be...what you asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane. I saw the way you looked at my cock. You can be. So. Are you wet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, blushing. She\u2019d done that a lot today. And just as clearly, she wasn\u2019t that someone, either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hard for you.\u201d</p><p>I know. I sooo know. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Oh, God, that mattered. She wanted to introduce herself to that hardness properly. Meaning, a nice, firm handshake. \u201cI mean, uh, are you planning to hurt me like you hurt the real Odette?\u201d</p><p>A beat of silence. \u201cOdette, I hated. Jane, I crave.\u201d</p><p>Such sweet, intoxicating words, all the more potent because she couldn\u2019t accuse him of only lusting for what was available. Laila, too, had wanted him in a bad, bad way, but he hadn\u2019t wanted the princess at all. So, logically, Jane had to believe he was as attracted to her as she was to him. Yeah, logically. And not just because she was trembling and desperately wanted it to be true.</p><p>He could simply be trying to soften her up.</p> <p>Oh, great. The upsetting thought poked its way from an ugly place inside her. A place that never wanted her to be happy. A place that felt she didn\u2019t deserve to be happy. They\u2019d been butting heads for months; more and more, she won the battles. Today, she might not.</p><p>\u201cIf I hurt you, you would not help me,\u201d he said in a silky tone. \u201cI want you to help me, and I am not a foolish man.\u201d</p><p>No, he was a sexy one. \u201cYou\u2019re a violent man. I know you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His honesty deflated her upcoming argument before she could start.</p><p>\u201cDo you fear me, little Jane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. What if you bite me? Or do that marking thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll like it, the bite and the marking, but I won\u2019t do either until you beg. You have my word. Now. Straddle me,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019m also capable of giving pleasure. Giving and taking. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do here and now. Give and take pleasure while we talk.\u201d</p><p>Beg... Sweet heaven, she just might. Because deep inside, at the core of her femininity, she wanted to be with him. As if she\u2019d been born for him, and him alone. Or bespelled. But even the thought of magic couldn\u2019t dull her desire for this man. The desire was somehow as familiar as his scent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking off my robe. Or my panties. We just met. That would be, uh, tacky.\u201d Idiot. \u201cI\u2019m trusting you to keep your word. And I\u2019m only doing this for answers,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care why. Just want to feel you.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, unsure, she climbed on top of him, placing a knee on each side of his waist. Her robe hiked up, revealing the length of her thighs. Just as slowly, she lowered her body until her female core brushed his erection. She gasped at the contact. He moaned.</p><p>This was better than her fantasy. He was hot, so hot. Hard, so hard.</p><p>\u201cTalk,\u201d she said, flattening her palms on his chest. Before she did what she\u2019d said she wouldn\u2019t and stripped out of her panties.</p><p>He arched up, pressing more firmly against her. They moaned in unison, his heart drumming as erratically as hers. She liked that.</p><p>A moment passed. \u201cYou said you enjoy puzzles,\u201d he mentioned huskily. His gaze settled on her neck.</p><p>Her pulse fluttered, as though happy to have gained his notice. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe fit together very nicely, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d God. How moronic she sounded. Yes this, and yes that. It was just, he\u2019d fried her circuits. She was on top of him, poised over his cock. And she ached. Ached like a drug addict in need of a fix. Why else would she have practically thrown herself at a vampire?</p><p>He waited. When she said no more, he arched his hips again. \u201cWhat did you want to know, Jane?\u201d</p><p>She rubbed against him. An accident, she told herself, and just once, but enough to leave her sweating. \u201cI want...to know...about you. About why you summoned me to free you?\u201d There. She\u2019d found her voice, without panting like she was climbing a mountain. Or a well-endowed man.</p><p>\u201cYou never said,\u201d she continued. \u201cDo I look like Princess Odette or something?\u201d If so, Odette and Laila must have been an odd sight. The blond giant and the brunette toddler. Jealous? \u201cI mean, you told me that, in everyone else\u2019s mind, I\u2019m their princess.\u201d She rubbed again, harder, but slow, so slow, and impossible to label as accidental. Need drove her. \u201cBut when I looked at myself in the mirror, I saw, well, myself.\u201d</p><p>Little beads of perspiration formed on his brow as he met her, moving with her. \u201cYou look nothing like her. Yes, keep doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how does your magic work?\u201d The tip of his erection brushed her most sensitive spot, and she moaned. \u201cWhy does everyone assume I\u2019m her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I summoned you, I also shifted my ability to cast illusions to you, projecting Odette\u2019s image.\u201d His chains rattled as he attempted to lower his arms. When he realized he couldn\u2019t, he scowled. \u201cTo everyone around you, with the exception of me, you look and sound like her. But gods, you smell divine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d He\u2019d spoken of intrinsic power. So very, very good...uh, interesting. Getting answers had never been this wonderfully agonizing in class. \u201cCan you remove the illusion?\u201d</p><p>The leather of his loincloth was soft between her legs, a startling contrast to his erection, creating a dizzying friction. Her heart hammered against her ribs with so much force, she feared the bones would crack.</p><p>She needed to slow down, or she would explode before the conversation ended.</p><p>\u201cNo, I cannot. Not while we\u2019re together. My power...they did something to me. Bound my abilities in some way, as surely as they bound my body.\u201d He licked his lips, revealing and hiding his fangs. So sharp, so deadly. \u201cDo you like this, Jane? Do I please you?\u201d</p><p>So much it scared her. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLean down. Kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Another urge to obey... She stilled instead. Yes. She wanted to kiss him. Yet she knew that if she leaned down, if she kissed the breath out of his lungs as she wanted him to do to her, they would have sex. They wouldn\u2019t be able to help themselves. Look how close she was to begging for it already!</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have sex with him. They were strangers. Worse, he was a vampire, a drinker of blood, and she\u2019d studied his kind for research. Oh, God. Talk about a mood killer. If he ever found out, the mood wasn\u2019t the only thing that would be killed.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t find out, she assured herself before she could panic. Wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d tell him, and who else knew? No one. Although he might wonder why she knew more about his physiology than she should. Like the fact that he was alive, and not dead, with the same basic organ alignment as a human.</p><p>Besides, she would return home at some point. She hoped. More than that, they were in danger and under a time crunch. She needed answers from him, not pleasure. Not kisses.</p><p>Reluctantly she crawled off him and stood beside the bed. Her knees almost buckled. Amazing that she was able to maintain her balance, since her muscles had the consistency of Jell-O.</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look at him. She would cave. He was just so damn beautiful, those eyes so hungry. For her. Plain Jane, as the kids at school had once called her. Already she was tempted to fling herself back on top of him, rubbing her way to ecstasy. The scent of him clung to her. Sandalwood. Delicious. Every time she inhaled, she smelled him, weakening her resolve.</p><p>\u201cCan someone else remove the illusion?\u201d she asked, keeping her profile to him. \u201cWhile we\u2019re together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t concentrating. I was only...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking of me. And sex.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks heated as she nodded.</p><p>He uttered a low growl. \u201cIf you will not take pleasure from me, at least sit beside me. I would rather have part of you than none of you.\u201d</p> <p>Said the spider to the fly. A born seducer, this one. Nicolai knew just how to lure, how to tempt. Against her better judgment, she sat. Her fingers brushed his ribs, and the heat of him had her shivering all over again.</p><p>\u201cThe answer to your question is yes,\u201d he said, gruffer still. \u201cIf someone\u2019s power is greater than mine, my illusion can be broken. But do not go around asking for such a thing. You do not want the witches here knowing what was done to you.\u201d</p><p>She waited, tense and silent, for him to go on. He didn\u2019t. Finally she gasped out, \u201cYou can\u2019t leave it at that. What happens if they discover the truth?\u201d</p><p>Another round of silence.</p><p>Her heartbeat increased in speed. \u201cWhat if your magic fails while I\u2019m here?\u201d Again, she waited. He didn\u2019t rush to assure her all would be well. Still no need to panic. Not yet.</p> <p>\u201cFeed me,\u201d he said, his fangs extending over his bottom lip, \u201cand I\u2019ll strengthen. No one will be stronger than me.\u201d There, at the end, his words were slurred.</p><p>One half of her trembled in pleasure, the other half shuddered in fear. The vampires in the lab had fed from bags of plasma. She\u2019d never been bitten. Had never wanted to be bitten. Until now. If anyone could make her enjoy something like that, it was this man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it. Now let\u2019s backtrack a little. If you can make anyone look like the princess, why did you summon me specifically?\u201d Why place her in such danger? Not that he\u2019d truly wanted her, and her alone. She recalled his disdain when he\u2019d learned she was merely a human, recalled his surprise. \u201cI asked before, but you never answered.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her, forcing her fingers to press into his skin. A silent command\u2014and an unrelinquishing demand\u2014for contact. \u201cI did not summon you specifically.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d realized that as she\u2019d spoken, but hearing him confirm it depressed her. She had to remain on equal footing with him, and even though he was chained, he kept leaping to the next level without her.</p><p>\u201cWho did you mean to summon, then?\u201d she asked, tracing an X next to his navel. She blinked. His navel? Damn it! Her willpower sucked. She\u2019d told herself not to touch him so, of course, the first thing she did was claim his belly button as her personal property.</p> <p>\u201cJane?\u201d</p><p>His deep voice startled her, and she jerked her spine ramrod straight. An instant later, her gaze met Nicolai\u2019s. A mistake. Liquid silver eyes, smoldering with passion. Languid expression masking a sea of desires. \u201cYes?\u201d Danger, Jane Parker, danger.</p><p>\u201cI lost you, even though I\u2019m having this conversation only because you wished it. We could be doing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said before he could finish. No reason to discover if what he thought they could be doing meshed with her own desires, and every reason not to. She stuffed her hands under her butt, her weight pinning them in place. Hopefully. \u201cI\u2019ll pay attention from now on.\u201d</p><p>He flicked his tongue over one of his fangs, and she couldn\u2019t help but imagine that tongue flicking between her legs. \u201cI summoned whoever would save me.\u201d</p><p>Oh, dear God. Her bones melted. Climbing on top of him a second time might actually be a good idea, she mused. She\u2019d be able to hear him better. Yeah, yeah, because she was having trouble hearing him and... Damn it, she thought again. You knew better than to look at him!</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cSo I release you, and then what happens?\u201d Good. Back on track.</p><p>\u201cI am...not sure.\u201d</p> <p>The truth or a lie? That hesitation... \u201cWill I go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I do not know. Do you have a man waiting for you?\u201d he asked, the words grated, as if pushed through a grinder.</p><p>\u201cNo. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have straddled you. Fidelity is important.\u201d She had nothing and no one except the routine she\u2019d developed. Wake up at six-thirty in the morning and jog five miles. Take a shower, dress, fix breakfast. Read for a few hours, usually something on macroparticles, sometimes a romance, fix lunch. Read for a few hours more, shop online for anything she needed, walk the treadmill to release the knots in her muscles. Bathe, fix dinner. Watch TV, sleep. Exciting.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to work because one, she\u2019d made so much money through her research, she could never spend it all; and two, she\u2019d made so much money in the car accident settlement, she could never spend it all. Only problem was, she wanted something money couldn\u2019t buy. Her family. A second chance.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not in danger there,\u201d she added softly. \u201cSo tell me. What will you do when you\u2019re free?\u201d</p><p>Absolute determination cloaked her features. \u201cKill my tormentors.\u201d Flat, cold. A vow. \u201cAfter that, I will journey to Elden.\u201d</p><p>The \u201ckill my tormentors\u201d part shouldn\u2019t have cranked her engine, but it did. A lot. All that ferocity... He would protect what was his, and fight for what he wanted. Always. Anyone who tormented him or those he loved would suffer. And with him, a woman would never have to worry about anything. Well, except her panties. Those might be ripped a few times.</p><p>\u201cIf I summon the healer and she does her thing, and then I let you go, but I don\u2019t instantly go home, will you take me with you?\u201d</p><p>She was not staying here; she knew that much. Nicolai might plan to kill everyone, but he was only one man. Or vampire, whatever. There would be survivors. Survivors looking to punish the person who had unleashed the big bad vamp.</p><p>And the longer she resided in this palace, the more danger she would be in, he\u2019d said. Yet, she couldn\u2019t strike out on her own. She knew nothing about this land. This magical land, where spells could be cast, memories erased and powerful vampires enslaved.</p><p>He opened his mouth, closed it. Then he relaxed, his body sagging against the mattress. His expression softened, heated. \u201cWhat would you do to stay with me?\u201d he asked, his voice once more like smoke, curling around her, trying to lure her back in.</p><p>Her hand itched to reach out, the urge to touch him springing to new life. She wanted to learn the texture of his skin\u2014she hadn\u2019t paid enough attention before. She wanted to rediscover the warmth of his body. Was already reaching toward him...</p><p>She jumped back to her feet and backed away from him. Sitting next to him had been a mistake. She couldn\u2019t concentrate, and she couldn\u2019t keep her dumb hands to herself.</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d he said, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, the gold flecks brightening, bursting through the silver. \u201cForget it. Have I answered your questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Wait, no, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late. You said yes. There\u2019s no changing your mind. Now summon the healer.\u201d He lifted the arm closest to her as best he could, the cuff rubbing against the iron poster. \u201cAnd remove the chains.\u201d</p><p>Damn him. He\u2019d never promised to take her with him. \u201cAll right. Chains first. Healer second. But you\u2019ll owe me. Big time. And don\u2019t feed from me. I didn\u2019t beg you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trusting you. If you go back on your word, I never will again. Once out of my trust circle, always out of my trust circle.\u201d She turned and bent over the nightstand, pulling out the top drawer. Sure enough, a long, thin key rested atop a bed of crimson velvet. \u201cLookie there. So simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdette!\u201d Hinges squeaked a second before her bedroom door slammed against the wall.</p><p>Gasping, Jane spun. A short, obese woman with ruddy cheeks huffed and puffed in the now open entryway. She wore a navy-blue-and-gold robe, the material far too tight for her rotund frame. She had jet-black hair peppered with silver, the strands slicked back and greased.</p><p>The city without time had managed to take its toll.</p><p>\u201cYou dare defy me, girl?\u201d</p><p>The queen, she thought with dread and just a little panic. Her \u201cmother.\u201d The gal with the whip. Don\u2019t forget you\u2019re supposed to be Odette.</p><p>Fear pumped through Jane\u2019s veins at an alarming rate, joining the dread and panic. Danger, danger, danger, her mind shouted, and it was not the succulent kind Nicolai offered. If this world was anything like her own had once been, this woman, this queen, had absolute power over every one and thing in her kingdom. Including Jane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Jane\u2019s gaze fell to Nicolai. His expression was now blank, his features smoothed out. Yet, he couldn\u2019t hide the coiled tension in his biceps and stomach. He practically vibrated. As stealthily as possible, she tossed the key at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disrespect you, M-Mother. Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you did. You, my successor, the one my people look to as an example, have made me appear the fool.\u201d At least she hadn\u2019t noticed the key. \u201cRather than seek out your doting mother, you sought out a slave.\u201d As the queen spoke, two guards filed in beside her.</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t recognize them; they were taller and meaner-looking than the others.</p><p>\u201cNow, you\u2019ll be punished.\u201d</p><p>The men continued to advance.</p><p>\u201cBut...I... You can\u2019t do this! Stop. Don\u2019t you dare touch me. Let go!\u201d</p><p>A snarl left Nicolai. One that promised pain. Lots and lots of pain. No one but Jane seemed to notice. The guards snagged her by the arms and began dragging her out of the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d Nicolai snapped. \u201cNo touching.\u201d</p><p>Again, he was ignored.</p><p>\u201cStop! Let go!\u201d She struggled, kicking and screaming, but they never loosened their hold.</p><p>Behind her, she heard Nicolai jerking against his chains. \u201cMine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do anything I wish,\u201d the queen said, so superior Jane wanted to slap her. \u201cPerhaps your little bump on the head made you forget. But no worries, my pet. I will remind you\u2014and ensure you never forget again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>SHE NEVER CRIED, NEVER even gasped as the whip flayed her delicate skin.</p><p>Nicolai was chained to Odette\u2019s bed. He hadn\u2019t marked Jane as he\u2019d wanted, but he was somehow attuned to her in a way he doubted he had ever been attuned to another. He should not have been able to focus on her, especially since he\u2019d been fighting sizzling desire for her\u2014her body, her blood\u2014and all other thoughts had become fogged and insignificant in comparison.</p> <p>Now, he felt fury. So much fury, and every bit of it was leveled on the guards.</p><p>They had dragged Jane along the opulent corridor filled with portraits of the queen and her daughters, down the winding stairs with dark velvet carpeting, and to the extravagant banqueting hall. Though she was no longer in the bedroom, Nicolai saw her still. As if their minds were somehow connected. She struggled the entire way. Only when they bent her over the dining table, her face pressed into the polished wood, only when they stripped away the back of her gown, had she settled.</p><p>Panting, she twisted her head to gaze over at the queen. The Queen of Hearts, a woman known to dine on the still beating organ during the spells and incantations used in her never-ending quest for youth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d Jane pleaded. \u201cI meant no offense.\u201d</p><p>The queen raised one of her many chins, the ones beneath it jiggling. \u201cAnd yet it was offense that you gave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be more so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Jane said, her skin both pallid with fear and bright with exertion. \u201cGive me another chance.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps the queen replied. Nicolai would never know. He was too focused on Jane\u2019s back. Already she bore scars. More than he could possibly count. They twined from her spine to her rib cage, red and angry, badges of pain. They stretched past the robe\u2019s gaping material, perhaps even riding the length of her legs.</p><p>What the hell had been done to her?</p><p>His guilt sprang back to instant, shattering life, and he was unable to destroy it this time. He had placed her in this situation. This delicate, haunted woman with the tantalizing scent, who had offered him the only glimpse of sunlight in a darkened void. She had come to save him, had trusted him enough to straddle him while talking to him. To rub against him, ratcheting his desire to unequaled heights, even without climax. And her resistance...gods, he\u2019d wanted to quash it. Still did. Wanted her to know his bite, his kiss.</p> <p>His possession.</p><p>Perhaps she was merely a challenge he had to triumph above. He didn\u2019t care. Quite simply, she was his. That was not in question. Mine, his cells continued to scream. All mine.</p><p>He could not allow her to be whipped.</p><p>Nicolai looked at the key resting at his side. Jane had tossed it at him, and it had landed on the mattress. A brave gesture on her part, but useless. He could not bend enough to reach it with his mouth. He could not angle his hands to grab it. He could not do anything with it. Yet the fact that she\u2019d tried, that she\u2019d thought of him in the face of her own peril...affected him. He would escape. However necessary. He would save her.</p><p>Never before had he been left on his own outside of his cell, with no guards within sight or hearing distance. He jerked at his cuffs. The metal links scraped his already cut skin, digging deeper, deeper. He\u2019d pulled at them while straining toward Jane, but at the time he hadn\u2019t cared, hadn\u2019t felt any sting but that of passion. Now, he felt the pain. That didn\u2019t stop him, however.</p><p>Just as before, the latches held, both to him and to the bed. He gritted his teeth. His hate for Laila, her mother and even Delfina grew exponentially. Destroy...</p><p>He closed his eyes, concentrating on the power still swirling inside him. There it was, dark, so dark, churning, an untapped storm just waiting, desperate to be unleashed; and all he had to do was break through the glass cage that had been erected within him.</p><p>A glass cage with thin, riverlike cracks running through the center.</p> <p>Exploit. He banged against the mental glass, over and over again. Nothing. He clawed at it. Still nothing. Damn it!</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he heard the queen say, pulling Nicolai back to the present. To Jane and their connection. Somehow, enough of his magic had escaped to allow him to continue watching her despite the distance between them.</p><p>Leather whistled through air. The first blow landed. Jane squeezed her eyes shut and pressed her lips together. She grimaced, but not a sound did she make.</p><p>They had done it. They had whipped her.</p><p>Just like that, something inside of Nicolai broke. Not the glass cage, but something far more dangerous, roaring like a wild animal pushed beyond its limits.</p><p>From the first moment Nicolai had spotted Jane, his body had reacted to her. He had experienced lust, guilt and possessiveness in varying degrees. Now, the possessiveness simply took over.</p><p>Mine, he thought again.</p><p>This time, the word sprung from deep inside him, as unstoppable as an avalanche. He did not understand the fierceness accompanying the thought, and refused to ponder it now. Later. He would ponder later. Right now, more than before, he knew only that she was his\u2014his savior, his woman\u2014and nothing else mattered.</p><p>The guards had touched her, hurt her. They would die. Painfully. By the time he finished with them they would probably thank him for killing them.</p><p>All he had to do was free himself. And he would. Nothing would stop him. Not now, not anymore.</p><p>\u201cSoon\u201d had at last arrived.</p><p>Being a magical vampire, as Jane had called him, was not going to aid him; he admitted that now. Still his determination intensified, blending with the hate, the burn of that possessiveness. He would reach her by grit alone; he would save her. No matter what he had to do. His gaze strayed to the wrist cuffs and narrowed. Without his thumbs, his hands would slide right through.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to think about it. Goodbye, thumbs.</p><p>Biting his tongue against the pain he knew was to come, he slammed his hands, thumbs out, into the headboard. Crunch. The bones broke with that very first punch. He sucked in a breath, but, like Jane, he did not utter a sound. Punch, punch, punch. Each new blow caused even more damage, ripping tendon, tearing muscle, flattening bone.</p><p>By the time he finished, he was sweating, bleeding, his hands limp. But his top half was free. With a growl, he jolted upright. Heard the whistle of leather through air, a soft inhalation of breath. Another lash against Jane\u2019s delicate skin.</p><p>Skin he wanted to caress.</p><p>His hands were too mutilated to grab the key. In fact, his efforts sent the little piece of metal sliding to the floor with a clink. He would need it later, to remove the neck cuff, and so he would pick it up with his mouth\u2014after he\u2019d freed himself.</p><p>Through narrowed eyes, he peered down at his feet. At a different angle, those feet would glide straight through the metal rings. And all he had to do to achieve that different angle was break every bone that ran from his ankle to his toes.</p><p>Nicolai started kicking the footboard.</p><p>JANE CLOSED HER EYES to hide the tears trying so determinedly to form and spill. It wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d never experienced pain before. For God\u2019s sake, her spine had been broken, her legs unusable for months. Then there\u2019d been the surgeries. Surgery after surgery to pin her bones in their proper places. Then, of course, the rehabilitation.</p><p>So, this whipping? Not even a blip on her agony radar. And yet, the humiliation of being bent over a table, her clothing ripped away, her scars revealed to those who sought to harm her, her body bound with ties she couldn\u2019t see\u2014magic?\u2014nearly undid her. And for what? For failing to speak with a fat, ugly woman when summoned?</p><p>Poor Odette. Was this how she\u2019d lived? Always fearing the next punishment? And poor Nicolai. Jane could not blame him for doing everything within his power to save himself. She would have done the same.</p><p>In fact, she could blame only herself for this. Had she listened to Nicolai, had she freed him when he\u2019d wanted, they would have been far, far away from this dreadful place. Well, he would have been. He would have left her behind. And he still might, she thought. During their talk, she had not garnered a promise from him. Not to keep her with him, not to protect her. And now, it was too late. There was no way she\u2019d leave him bound after this. Not for any reason. She would free him the moment she was physically able, then take off on her own.</p><p>Dumb on her part, maybe. Probably. Okay, definitely. Allowing herself to be separated from the one person who knew who and what she was, the one person who could get her home...so damn foolish. But that still wasn\u2019t going to stop her.</p><p>And, wow. Jane Parker, considered a dummy. That was a first. She laughed without humor. A novelty in the face of pain. Nice.</p><p>\u201cThis amuses you?\u201d the queen demanded.</p><p>Jane refused to acknowledge her.</p><p>There was a squeak of outrage. \u201cClearly you are not hitting her hard enough. You.\u201d The queen snapped her fingers. \u201cTake over the whip. Your arms are stronger, as I can well attest.\u201d</p><p>Oh, gross.</p><p>A pause, then the whip continued to descend. Harder, so much harder. Over and over again, minutes ticking by. Still Jane did not utter a sound. She wanted to go home. Back to her boring life, where she was in control.</p><p>The whip stopped falling. Finally, a reprieve.</p><p>\u201cHave you at last learned your lesson, Odette?\u201d the queen asked, expectant. \u201cOr shall I have him remove the skin on your legs, as well?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to tell the bitch to go to hell\u2014no ignoring her this time\u2014but she stopped herself before a single word escaped. Did these people believe in hell, or even know what it was? Would she announce her humanity and lose the protection\u2014what little there was\u2014in being thought of as Princess Odette?</p><p>\u201cSilence will not\u2014\u201d</p><p>A roar echoed from the walls, harsh, guttural and a promise of pain.</p><p>Everyone in the room stilled. Jane forgot to breathe. That sound...she\u2019d never heard its like. There was an animal on the loose, a lion probably, there just had to be. And people were clearly on the menu.</p><p>Another roar, followed by the crash of furniture and the shattering of knickknacks. Screams of agony. Gasps, racing footsteps. Had her guards left? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me here,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d the queen snapped.

You, shield me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFree me,\u201d Jane demanded. \u201cNow.\u201d</p> <p>They paid her no heed.</p><p>One of the guards headed toward the entryway, where other guards were pouring inside to escape the beast, but he didn\u2019t make it outside the room. Not alive. There was a blur of movement, then blood was squirting, a headless body falling.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she spotted Nicolai. He was a mess, covered in blood, limping, his arms hanging at his sides. His fangs were bared in a fearsome, crimson scowl, and she knew.</p><p>He was the animal.</p><p>Thank God. Some of the tension drained from her. Somehow, some way, he\u2019d managed to escape. His plan to destroy the people who lived inside this palace was well under way.</p> <p>Before, she\u2019d thought there would be survivors. Now, not so much.</p><p>He barreled into another guard, his shoulder slamming into the man\u2019s middle and knocking him backward. The guard propelled into another, the one with the whip. The two fell to the floor. Nicolai slashed into the whipper\u2019s neck and shook, a wolf with his first meal in months. Screams...silence...death...</p><p>Just like that, Jane was freed from whatever had bound her. She straightened. Sharp lances of pain shot from her back, spiraling though the rest of her. She hardly noticed. Her gown sagged from her shoulders, momentarily exposing her breasts. Hurriedly she righted the material, holding it up.</p><p>Nicolai\u2019s silver-gold eyes landed on the queen, who was no longer shielded by a man. Blood\u2014and other things\u2014dripped from his mouth. His expression was so dark, so murderous, even Jane backed away from him. He was a terrifying sight. A warrior lost to bloodlust, his only goal the destruction of every one and every thing around him.</p><p>He advanced on the queen. \u201cDie. You die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you threaten me and my people this way?\u201d the bitch snapped. \u201cI allowed you to live after you tormented my eldest daughter, and now you think to spit on my mercy? Guards!\u201d</p> <p>No guards came. Perhaps they were too busy being dead.</p><p>\u201cShe...mine,\u201d Nicolai snarled, moving in front of Jane while still advancing on the queen. There was something wrong with his feet, his ankles twisted at an odd angle, yet his steps were measured, clipped with determination.</p><p>The queen lifted her mountain of chins. \u201cYou think to protect my daughter from me? The daughter you tried to slay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, then, slave. Come get me.\u201d</p><p>Jane\u2019s heart pounded with renewed force. Her legs shook. This was a showdown the queen couldn\u2019t hope to win. Right? Please be right.</p><p>Nicolai leaped.</p><p>Grinning, the queen stretched out one arm and ripples of power pulsated from her. The air around her shimmered, thickened. Nicolai slammed into a wall Jane couldn\u2019t see, ricocheting backward.</p> <p>Another roar ripped from his throat as he jumped to his feet. He pounded his injured fists into that invisible shield, his fangs flashing.</p><p>The queen laughed, smug. \u201cDo you see now? Even were you at your strongest, you could not touch me. I am beyond your reach.\u201d</p><p>Booted footsteps reverberated, and Jane watched, wide-eyed, as the second line of defense marched into the room. So. There were more guards, after all. This new contingent held swords and spears, and when they spotted the bloody Nicolai, they bolted into action.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jane threw herself in front of him, the action born of instinct rather than thought. As she well knew, even vampires could be killed, and she didn\u2019t want Nicolai to\u2014couldn\u2019t watch him\u2014experience that.</p><p>Strong arms banded around her waist and jerked her into a hard body. Instinct still drove her and, for a moment, she fought, kicking and elbowing.</p><p>\u201cMine. Be...still.\u201d</p><p>Nicolai. She relaxed, despite his raging animal nature. He was warm against her. Solid, sturdy despite his wounds. Even decadent. Her inhalations were coming so quickly, she scented the sandalwood she was already coming to love.</p><p>Okay, then. They would die together, she thought distantly. She\u2019d survived so much the past year. The car accident, injuries that would have killed most people. Injuries that should have killed her. Especially since she\u2019d yearned for death, and hadn\u2019t done anything to aid her own cause.</p><p>She\u2019d been so lost, wondering. Why her? What was so different, so special, about her that she could endure what others had not? Nothing, that\u2019s what.</p><p>And now that she wanted to live, she would finally die. Irony at its finest. She would not be allowed to know Nicolai better. She would not get to spend time with him, laugh with him or make love with him.</p><p>She should have kissed him earlier.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d Nicolai repeated against her ear. \u201cSafe.\u201d He had stretched out an arm, mimicking the queen, and the air around them had shimmered, forming a...shield? For them?</p><p>Her jaw dropped as the guards slammed into it and flew backward, just as Nicolai had done.</p><p>A gasp escaped her. \u201cHow did you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk,\u201d Nicolai said in that gravelly voice. His one-word sentences were as frustrating as they were welcome. He nudged her forward.</p><p>One step, two, she lumbered over the fallen, savaged bodies sprawled around her. Those who remained standing were pushed out of the way by the shield. Outside the dining room was a foyer. Spacious, with doorways in every direction. Exactly where was she supposed to go?</p><p>Laila raced down the staircase, dark hair flying behind her, the silver timepiece banging against her chest. When she spotted Jane and Nicolai, she ground to a halt.</p><p>Nicolai snarled at her. He released Jane as if he intended to pound up those steps and attack, but quickly changed his mind. His free arm banded around Jane once more, the other ensuring the shield never wavered. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>She was really starting to like that nickname.</p><p>The younger woman was breathing heavily, her green eyes glittering with jealousy and hate. \u201cYours? She isn\u2019t yours. Odette, he means to kill you. Fight him! Use your magic.\u201d</p><p>Jane flipped her off.</p><p>Shock replaced the anger, but only for a moment. When the princess regained her wits, she shouted, \u201cSomeone stop them. Now!\u201d but still the guards could not penetrate the shield. \u201cHe\u2019s bespelled Odette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need magic, princess,\u201d one of them said. \u201cCast a spell for us. Anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo magic,\u201d Laila gritted without hesitation and with the briefest flare of panic. Then to Nicolai, she said, \u201cYou think I\u2019d bind your vampire strength and abilities, and not bespell you to remain here forever? You might be able to leave the palace, but you\u2019ll be back. That, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>Another growl erupted from Nicolai\u2019s throat, so fervent even Jane\u2019s body vibrated.</p><p>\u201cYou can kill her if you want,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his hold. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>Apparently protecting her was more important than avenging himself. What had changed his mind, she didn\u2019t know, but his decision was a gift, better than a diamond and not something she\u2019d ever regift.</p><p>Yes, she really should have kissed him when she\u2019d had the chance. Once they were safe, she\u2019d remedy her mistake.</p><p>Laila raised her chin(s), reminding Jane of the queen. Smiling, she drew circles around the center of the timepiece with the tip of her index finger. \u201cGo ahead. Try. Fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk,\u201d Nicolai repeated.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Jane asked, tightening her hold on her robe.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak again, but guided her toward one of the doorways. He used his big, strong shoulders to nudge it open, careful not to jar her. Endorphins were swimming so potently through her veins, he could have poured salt into her slashed-up back and she wouldn\u2019t have felt it. Yet.</p><p>Silvery moonlight came into view. As did a large expanse of flatland, with robed men and women moving unhurriedly, happily, children dancing around them. Beyond that, Jane saw trees. Mile after mile of white trees, their leaves swaying, dancing together like drunken ghosts. The landscape was somehow familiar to her, as if she\u2019d been here before. How... Why...?</p><p>Jane could only gape, struggling to understand\u2014until Nicolai released her, and her thoughts took a nosedive. He was leaving her already? Disappointment rocked her. She\u2019d liked his touch, had wanted more. Perhaps forever, which made her as dumb now as she\u2019d been earlier. Thankfully, he didn\u2019t allow the separation for long. He moved beside her, clasped her hand as strongly as he was able, which wasn\u2019t much considering the damage he\u2019d sustained, and jerked her into the throng.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>A child spotted her, and dropped into a bow. Murmurs arose, and everyone else quickly followed suit. Jane\u2019s steps faltered.</p><p>\u201cUh, hi,\u201d she said, not knowing what else to say.</p><p>\u201cPrincess,\u201d they muttered. Not happily, but with fear.</p><p>\u201cEscape...faster...\u201d Nicolai said with a nudge.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d she muttered, leaping into a sprint.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>THEY TRAVELED FOR HOURS\u2014or so it seemed\u2014though they never managed to exit the forest. Nicolai suspected they were going in circles, his doom in the center. Just when he would think they\u2019d made progress, he would spy the glittering palace rooftop. A rooftop Delfina was famous for, the shingles comprised only of elf tears. No matter what he tried, he could not alter his path.</p><p>Fail. The word Laila had used. Go ahead. Try. Fail. She had used her magic on him as promised, he realized. But what spell had she used? Unless he figured it out, he could not fight its power. Even as the question and answer formed in his mind, a sharp lance of pain jetted through him. He gnashed his teeth.</p><p>At least the guards never caught his trail. Even when the magical shield around him evaporated in a puff of smoke. Magic he wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d wielded. He knew only that the queen had constructed a shield of her own, and he had instantly known how to do the same.</p><p>Now, though, he could not reconstruct it; the ability was gone as if it had never been. And its absence infuriated him. At all costs, he must protect Jane. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mine. The possessive claim was now so much a part of him, he wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d survived without her. So, yes, he would protect her. Even from himself. His hunger was completely sated, he\u2019d drained so many guards to reach her, and yet, he could still scent her. His female. So sweet. He still wanted to taste her. So damn badly.</p><p>She was injured, though, and needed to rest. Not that she had complained. She had not spoken a word since they\u2019d left the palace courtyard. She had remained behind him the entire time, accepting his every dictate, following his directives. Limping, he thought, and sometimes using his arm as a crutch.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t allowed himself to look at her, knowing he would have stopped long before now if she appeared fatigued in any way. He wanted her as far from the palace as possible. As far away from Laila and the queen\u2014who should be dead right now, already rotting in a grave.</p> <p>That they lived...</p><p>Worth it. Jane lived, too.</p><p>His ankles throbbed as he led her to a cave he\u2019d noticed each time he\u2019d unintentionally backtracked. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, voice gruffer than he\u2019d intended. \u201cWe\u2019ll be safe here.\u201d He was sure of it.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. You\u2019re back to your normal self.\u201d</p><p>Normal self? What did that mean? \u201cRest.\u201d Once they were strengthened, he could return to the palace, sneak inside, kill Laila and her mother and find the healer, as planned. Before he left, he would erect defenses so that Jane could stay here, safe.</p> <p>Once his memories had been returned, his powers restored, he would come back for her. They would travel to Elden together.</p><p>His hands tightened into fists. Elden. What awaited him in Elden, besides his desire to kill a king he had never met? At least, not to his knowledge. All he knew was that the man had slaughtered the former sovereigns, claiming the crown by brute force.</p><p>Nicolai had heard palace servants gossiping about the royal change. Yesterday, or a hundred years ago, he wasn\u2019t sure. Whatever time spell the witches had cast over the palace caused minutes to eke by for everyone inside, the days blending together, a blur you could never count.</p><p>Nicolai wondered if he\u2019d ever met the former sovereigns. Perhaps even guarded them. While he could not picture them, he could visualize their palace without problem. A towering monstrosity built more for withstanding attack than aesthetics. A lush green forest surrounded a lake, and that lake surrounded the structure. There was no discernable entryway other than the guard walkway\u2014a walkway he knew better than he knew the angles of his own face. He longed for that palace, that lake, that forest. Knew the land would smell of sea salt and pine. Thought he could hear the echo of his booted footsteps as he ran to...do something, hug someone, perhaps. Thought he could hear a woman\u2019s deep-throated chuckle and a man\u2019s gruff grunt of approval. A pang of love and homesickness, followed by a wave of hate, swept through him.</p><p>Love? Homesickness? Hate? Why? He must learn the answers. He must kill the new king.</p><p>A dull ache bloomed in his temples, and he ceased that line of thought. For now.</p> <p>Jane hobbled in front of him, and placed her hands on his shoulders. At the moment of contact, his fangs lengthened and his gums ached. Just a little taste...</p><p>No! Not yet. He soaked in her presence instead, distracting his unnecessary hunger with her electrifying beauty. Electrifying, because she had somehow brought him back to life.</p><p>That fall of honey-colored hair, framing a face as pure and unique as a snowflake, begged for a man\u2019s fingers. Her ocher eyes were no longer haunted, but determined. Her cheeks were rosy\u2014with desire, despite her weakened, abused condition\u2014a sheen of perspiration from the sultry night air making her glow. She\u2019d tied the fabric of her robe together and the knots on her shoulders teased him. With only a tug, they would unwind and he could\u2014</p><p>No, he thought again. He would not entertain such lustful thoughts until she was healed. Then... Oh, yes, then.</p><p>Seeing her whipped for his actions had not only broken something inside him, it had awoken something inside him. Not to mention that smile of hers... She shouldn\u2019t have smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cThe key,\u201d he said. \u201cFree my neck.\u201d He used his tongue to move that key from the side of his mouth to between his teeth.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d She unlocked the ring. The heavy binding tumbled to the ground with a thump. \u201cWe should probably get going. The sun will come out soon.\u201d Though she\u2019d hobbled, her voice was firm, strong. \u201cIf you guys have a sun. And if time has kicked back into gear for us. Someone mentioned Delfina is ageless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ageless. Those who reside in the palace age much slower. And yes, out here there is a sun, a day and a night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have to hide you, then. We don\u2019t want you bursting into flames.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cI am not a nightwalker.\u201d How had she known about nightwalkers and the way they burst into flames?</p><p>\u201cOh, well...\u201d She paled, swallowed. \u201cWell, in my world, vampires are considered a myth. In books and movies, you guys always burst into flames\u2014or glitter\u2014when you step into sunlight.\u201d</p><p>Glitter? \u201cI am, perhaps, more sensitive to the sun\u2019s rays than others in this realm, but I am nothing like the nightwalkers. At worst, I will burn and blister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Good.\u201d Her relief was palpable.</p><p>Such a strong reaction, when she\u2019d had no cause to worry. And yet, that worry pleased him. He liked her concern. Liked what it meant. Already she cared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d she said, nibbling on her bottom lip.</p><p>His stomach clenched at the sight of her teeth, doing what he wanted to do. \u201cSomething you enjoy.\u201d He placed his throbbing hands over hers, preventing her from drawing away.</p><p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d Her tongue emerged, swiping where she\u2019d bitten. \u201cWe\u2019ve been going in circles, which means Laila the harpy told the truth. You are cursed to remain in Delfina.\u201d</p><p>The sight of her tongue did far more damage to his control than the sight of her teeth. How easy it would be to lean down, lick, sample, savor. Not until she heals. Another reminder. Also, not until she begs. You promised. \u201cI know,\u201d he said more harshly than he\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her nose scrunched adorably, easing the sting of his self-directed anger. \u201cWell, you could have told me. I\u2019ve worried, expecting you to argue and trying to formulate my own argument for whichever direction you could have taken. Anyway, you might have been bespelled to think the most dangerous places are the safest, and the safest places the most dangerous. Actually, cancel that \u2018you might.\u2019 You were. You bypassed the water six times!\u201d</p><p>River? \u201cYou saw a river?\u201d The kingdom of Elden was surrounded by the lake, a lake that connected its northern shore to Delfina. That had always been a point of contention for him while rotting inside his cell. So close to his goal, yet so far away. Now, he was glad.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see. I heard the water.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t. The only landmark that had stood out to him was a dark, too dark, part of the forest that had made his skin crawl. Had he been alone, he would have braved that forest without hesitation. His mind had been centered upon Jane\u2019s protection, however, and he\u2019d opted to brave nothing. A mistake.</p><p>His swollen fingers intertwined with hers, squeezing. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were all scary alpha and in charge, and I didn\u2019t want to, you know, poke at the bear. Plus, I was kind of distracted by the scenery and maybe lost in my thoughts. So, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d she went on. Now who was all alpha and in charge? \u201cYou\u2019re going to lead us to the most dangerous place in this forest. And when you think you should turn left, you\u2019re going to turn right. You\u2019re going to do the opposite of everything you feel is correct.\u201d</p><p>Smart, his Jane. And so damned arousing he doubted he would ever get enough of her.</p><p>He wanted to keep her. In his bed, his arms, his fangs buried in her neck, his cock buried between her legs. Even though he was destined to wed the... Another sharp lance tore through his mind, and he grunted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jane asked, concerned all over again. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Her back was a mess of welts, and she asked if he was okay. He pressed his tongue to the roof of his mouth and nodded. \u201cYou are well enough to travel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, as if there was no doubt in her mind.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d</p><p>Though his body protested, he trudged forward once again, leaving the cave behind. He followed Jane\u2019s advice\u2014orders\u2014and did the opposite of what his \u201cinstincts\u201d demanded, even plunging into a patch of thorny clinging vines guarding the darker part of the forest. He expected to be scratched, but the leaves merely caressed him, tickling.</p><p>There were no thorns, he realized. Even though he saw them, they were not there. Laila\u2014or her healer\u2014was more powerful than he\u2019d ever suspected.</p><p>Male laughter cut through the night, springing from just ahead. Nicolai stopped, stiffened, and Jane bumped into him. Her breasts mashed into his back, and he had to press his lips together to halt his moan.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cHear what?\u201d</p><p>That answered that. Still he did not move forward, but stood there, waiting, listening. Jane\u2019s nipples hardened, rasping over his flesh as she breathed. Her scent enveloped him. Must taste female...soon.</p><p>This physical desire was new to him. Oh, he\u2019d had sex. And recently, too. Many times, but with Laila, or someone of her choosing as the princess watched and directed. Always chained to her bed, muzzled, her mouth and hands forcing him to respond to her, even though he hated her.</p><p>Sometimes, when even that failed to arouse him, she had used her witch magic to elicit an erection from him. Unlike her sister, she hadn\u2019t needed someone else\u2019s pain to spur her into orgasm. She had ridden him with abandon, while he had stared up at the face he despised, scowling, trying with every ounce of his strength to prevent her\u2014and himself\u2014from climaxing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sometimes she had, sometimes she hadn\u2019t. Sometimes he had, sometimes he hadn\u2019t. But each time, no matter the outcome, his hatred for them both had grown.</p><p>He did not remember ever being with another woman\u2014besides Odette\u2014though he was sure he\u2019d had many lovers throughout the years. Because, as Laila had writhed atop him, he\u2019d instinctively known what would bring her pleasure. Gliding his thumb along the bundle of nerves between her legs. Laving his tongue there. Kneading her breasts, plucking at her nipples. All the things he had refused to do, and now wanted to do to Jane.</p><p>He wanted to watch her expressive face as she reached her peak. Wanted to feel her inner walls clutch at him. Wanted to hear her cry out his name. Sweet heavens, even the thought delighted him.</p> <p>\u201cSeriously. What are we listening for?\u201d Jane asked. The warmth of her breath trekked down his spine. \u201cI don\u2019t hear anything.\u201d</p><p>Taste...</p><p>Distracted again, Nicki? The stray thought jolted him back to full awareness. Someone had once said that to him; he knew it. A woman. He wanted to know who, but now was not the time to try and access his memories. He had to remain alert.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said, leading Jane deeper into that dark part of the forest. More laughter echoed. Evil, promising retribution. Once again, he stilled. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>More laughter, blending with yet another man\u2019s. \u201cThat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I hear the rush of water now, but that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. The laughter must be another trick of Laila\u2019s, meant to send him fleeing. Nicolai kicked back into gear. Five minutes passed, an eternity. He remained on guard, without a weapon\u2014he should have grabbed a damned weapon\u2014but willing to shield Jane with his body.</p><p>Another five minutes eked by. Then another. He wasn\u2019t sure how much longer he could go on, but he felt like he should stop, so he did the opposite. He pushed onward. Another five minutes. Another.</p><p>\u201cWait. Nicolai. You have\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jane\u2019s words cut off when Nicolai felt the cool rush of water against his feet, droplets splashing up his calf. Brows knitting in confusion, he paused and looked down. He hadn\u2019t noticed the water, even though it had been directly in front of him.</p> <p>The rocks were slippery as he backtracked to the edge. Dangerous, he thought. This place is dangerous. He should\u2014</p><p>Stay. Finally.</p><p>\u201cYou did it,\u201d Jane said. \u201cYou found the source.\u201d She laughed, soft and carefree.</p><p>Without thought, Nicolai found himself whipping around to catch a glimpse of her. Her expression was lit up, brighter than the sun on its best morning. Her plump pink lips were curved at the corners, inviting him to lick, to finally taste. To devour. The hem of her robe was wet and plastered to her ankles.</p><p>She was safe. He could have her. Yes?</p><p>His chest constricted, and his stomach quivered. He reached out. A touch, until she healed, he\u2019d allow himself only a touch. Except, his knees gave out just before contact and he fell into the water. His chin resting on his sternum, he breathed quickly and shallowly, trying to fill his lungs but failing.</p><p>His energy was draining, absolute fatigue taking its place.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t. Not there. You\u2019ll drown.\u201d Jane latched onto his arm and managed to drag him to the shore.</p> <p>Once there, he just kind of fell the rest of the way, crashing into a mossy embankment. He tried to rise, but couldn\u2019t find the strength. He needed to forage for food. Jane must be starving. He needed to build a shelter. The bugs would eat his woman alive. He needed to stand guard. She must not be hurt.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cProtect,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d Gentle hands smoothed over his brow,</p><p>\u201cNo, I...\u201d Oblivion claimed him before he could utter another word.</p><p>NICOLAI...</p><p>The deep male voice that called to him was familiar. Always in his dreams, when his defenses were weakened, but it was stronger now than ever before. And...beloved?</p><p>Nicolai...time...save...</p><p>In the back of his mind, he heard the tick, tick, tick of a clock.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>An image flashed in his mind. Not of the speaker, but of huge, grotesque monsters crawling toward him. Each had eight legs, with sharp, deadly points. They were black and hairy, their eyes big and beady, their tails pointed and curling toward him. They were staring him down, as if he were a tasty snack. Bile rose in his throat, but he pressed on, ignoring them.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you? What can I do?\u201d</p><p>Nicolai...brother...heal yourself, and come. Time...save...</p><p>Brother? Nicolai tried to picture a brother. Nothing. He could not picture his mother, either. Nor his father. Even in his dreams, pain exploded through his head, shutting down his memories.</p><p>Tick, tick, tick.</p><p>Kill! an equally familiar male voice suddenly boomed. Deeper, harder.</p><p>Damn it. He had to find out who was speaking to him. Had to know. Had to, had to, had to. Life\u2014and death\u2014rested on his shoulders.</p><p>As he considered their identities, he thrashed, his hand connecting with something solid and warm.</p><p>He heard a gasp. For some reason, the female\u2019s pain only increased his agitation. Must protect...</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d she said, soothing him. \u201cI\u2019m here. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>Jane, he thought, stilling. His Jane. Such a sweet voice, such a pretty face. Such a commanding personality, worthy of a queen. She was nearby.</p><p>Heal yourself...time...save...</p><p>Yes, he thought. With Jane nearby, he could do anything. Heal himself, and even replenish the store of power he\u2019d burned through. He relaxed, willingly sinking back into oblivion. This time, he had a purpose.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>JANE SPENT TWO DAYS gathering supplies and making weapons. She never strayed far from the unconscious Nicolai, just in case he needed her or they had unexpected visitors, so those supplies were limited. However, she managed to find fruits and nuts to eat, as well as small, thin twigs and mint leaves. Those, she\u2019d turned into surprisingly efficient toothbrushes, which she used liberally on both of them.</p><p>Because they were near a stream, bathing her patient was easy. In fact, there\u2019d probably never been two cleaner people trapped in the wilderness. Nicolai was no longer oiled, his skin was scrubbed to a healthy pink shine, and yet, the scent of sandalwood was stronger than ever. Every time she breathed him in, she tingled, her blood heating, her mouth watering.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t helped that in bathing him, she\u2019d had to run her hands all over him. As dirty as he\u2019d been\u2014cough, cough\u2014she\u2019d had to bathe him a lot. Those muscles...so hard, thickly roped and laced with sinew. That trail of hair from his navel to his penis...always tempting her to wickedness.</p><p>And God, she was shame spiraling.</p><p>Nicolai might desire her, but he didn\u2019t need another woman lusting after him while he was helpless. What\u2019s more, he didn\u2019t need another grabby woman touching him without permission, and already Jane had pushed the boundaries of his trust by bathing him (so many times).</p><p>Hands off from now on, she decided. And one day, she\u2019d apologize for her behavior. Maybe. She wasn\u2019t sure she would sound sincere. Despite his past, she\u2019d liked touching him. Bad Jane. But, well, he\u2019d seemed to like being touched by her. He tossed and turned intermittently, only calming when she was within reach.</p><p>Sometimes he questioned a man who needed his help, sometimes he cursed Laila for the vile things she\u2019d done to him, and sometimes he fought ugly monsters, his arms and legs flailing. After the latter two, he always vowed retribution. Painful, slow retribution.</p><p>Something he was fully capable of delivering now. The swelling in his wrists and ankles was gone, his thumbs having snapped back into place, his feet having realigned right before her eyes. Even the abrasions on his skin were gone. It was quite an amazing process to witness.</p><p>The vampires she had studied had healed quickly, as well, but not that quickly. Nor had they slept this long in a single stretch. She worried about him.</p><p>Did he need blood? He\u2019d had so much at the palace, and overfeeding could cause as much damage as starvation. Perhaps more so, because overfeeding caused an insatiable need for more, more, more. Nothing else mattered ever again, and dead body after dead body was left in the wake.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t know that. She\u2019d almost given herself and her knowledge away with the whole \u201cbursting into flames\u201d thing. And while she hated herself for having experimented on his brethren, she wished she\u2019d done more, knew more. Anything to help Nicolai right now.</p><p>Jane sighed. She\u2019d give him another day. And then what? she wondered.</p><p>She would have to construct some kind of hamper and drag him through the forest and into a town, find a healer and get him checked out. If there was a town other than Delfina nearby.</p><p>The problem\u2014besides her lack of strength and direction\u2014was her face. Her magical face. As Odette, she simply couldn\u2019t lose herself in a crowd, as proven by the reaction of the people outside the palace. Word of her arrival might travel to Laila. Someone might attempt to capture Nicolai.</p><p>That someone would have to die by Jane\u2019s hand, and she wasn\u2019t quite ready to become a killer.</p><p>Another sigh slipped from her, this one weary. As a golden moon settled into a black velvet sky, she placed her handmade weapons\u2014twigs sharpened on rocks until becoming daggers and spears\u2014beside Nicolai. Then she lay next to him.</p><p>She\u2019d washed her robe about an hour ago, the still-wet material now draped over a nearby tree limb. Except for her panties, she was naked. By necessity. Of course. So she wasn\u2019t going to castigate herself over needing Nicolai\u2019s warmth. Well, not too badly. The baths had been frivolous; spooning wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Lying next to him provided a wealth of wondrous experiences. Peace, after so many months of fear and regret. Soul-deep contentment. Hope for a future she had once dreaded. He shouldn\u2019t affect her this quickly and this strongly, even with magic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After some thought, she\u2019d realized magic could not change a person\u2019s feelings. He had never welcomed his captors; and had they possessed the ability to force the issue, they would have.</p><p>Though she was exhausted, falling asleep proved difficult. Her back had scabbed, and those scabs pulled and reopened with her every movement. And her legs... Without her morning jogs and physical therapy, her legs were stiffening up more and more frequently, aching and throbbing. She could practically feel atrophy setting up camp in her muscles.</p><p>What she wouldn\u2019t give for a handful of painkillers.</p> <p>At least she didn\u2019t have to dread the approach of the sun. Their very first night here, she\u2019d constructed a big, leafy canopy above the small site. Nicolai had claimed he wouldn\u2019t burst into flame with ultraviolet contact, but she wasn\u2019t willing to risk it. Granted, the sun here was muted, always shaded by clouds, and not nearly as hot as she\u2019d experienced back home. But in her world, she had witnessed other vamps burning to ash. Maybe even one of his friends.</p><p>Stomach cramp. She wouldn\u2019t let herself go there.</p><p>Also, the canopy offered them camouflage from the enemy, hiding them from prying eyes. As proud as she was of her efforts, they\u2019d so far been unnecessary. Laila and her men had never even marched past.</p><p>Most likely they weren\u2019t even looking for the escapee, the princess expecting Nicolai to walk himself straight back to her bed.</p><p>Bed. Exactly where Jane wanted Nicolai. A soft mattress underneath him, Jane on top of him, her nails digging into his chest as she balanced. A tantalizing rush of desire poured through her, and she moaned.</p> <p>Nicolai was right beside her. He could wake up at any moment and realize what she yearned for. But...maybe another sex fantasy was in order. For his sake. After all, she had to be disturbing him, rolling around like this. And last time, she\u2019d fallen asleep the moment she\u2019d climaxed.</p><p>Yes, for Nicolai\u2019s sake, she thought dazedly, inhibitions crumbling as she imagined the hard thrust of him inside her....</p><p>A LOW MOAN CAUSED NICOLAI to jolt upright.</p><p>Out of habit, he cataloged his surroundings in an instant. The moon was high, golden, the stars bright, winking from their scattered perches. Ghost trees swayed against a cool, sultry breeze. A river rushed along a pebbled bank.</p><p>His brows drew together with confusion. He was enveloped by the sweetest scent of passion...fading...and the ripe scent of pain...intensifying. Who was in\u2014?</p><p>Another low, female moan sounded, broken and harsh. His attention whipped to the left, down. Jane. Jane lay beside him. And gods above, she was practically naked. Her only covering was a tiny scrap of white material between the apex of her thighs.</p> <p>He should remove it. With his teeth.</p><p>Instantly his fangs ached. A familiar sensation in her presence. For a moment, he could only drink in the sight of her, his gaze greedy. Her breasts were small, her nipples pink as berries and beaded deliciously. Her stomach hollowed, showcasing every single one of her ribs.</p><p>Clearly she had been hungry for a long time. He would feed her, he thought, delighted by the very idea. She would never lack for food again. Would eat from his hand. Only the very best morsels, too. She would close her eyes at the succulent taste, savor every nibble, groan in joy when he sampled the meal with her, and then directly from her.</p><p>While blood was the source of his life, he needed food, as well. Perhaps because he was not fully vampire. He had a witch for a mother, and\u2014</p><p>A witch for a mother?</p><p>Pain sliced through him, and he nearly pounded his fist into the ground. Not again. Frustration ate at him.</p><p>Then he spied the scars on Jane\u2019s abdomen, and thoughts of offering her the choicest of meats fled, right along with thoughts of his family. Hunger of a different nature asserted itself. He ached to commit murder. Those scars...Dark Abyss... He\u2019d known she had them, but not how many or how deeply they cut her.</p><p>From her navel down, she looked as if she\u2019d been sliced up and sewn back together by a blind weaver. Thick, red scars crisscrossed in every direction, badges of pain most in the world would probably never experience.</p> <p>How had she survived whatever had been done to her?</p><p>Whoever had hurt her would die, just as the guards who touched her had.</p><p>She deserved pampering. Not just the food from his table, but gowns of rich velvet and a bed of the finest goose feathers. Never would she work. She would relax, enjoy, perhaps spend her days naked, lounging in his bedroom, and her nights sweat soaked from passion.</p><p>He would feast from her body, her veins. Sample every part of her, dining between her legs at his leisure. Riding her hard and fast, letting her ride him slow and sweet. Taking her in every position imaginable, then perhaps inventing a few. His cock hardened, already aching.</p><p>She needs her rest. Needs to heal. Deep breath in, deep breath out. But gods, much more of her incredible scent and he would fall on her, perhaps drink too much of her blood. She was like the morning dew on the petals of a rose, fragile, and he must always be careful with her.</p><p>Trembling, he reached out to smooth that honey hair from her brow.... When he saw his hand, he stilled. Turned his palm up to the moonlight. Wiggled his thumb. Healed. He was completely healed; there was no pain.</p><p>How much time had passed?</p><p>How long had he left Jane unguarded?</p><p>He looked around with fresh eyes, astonished by what he found. Enough time had passed for her to construct a hut, weapons, wash her clothing and his body. He was the man, the warrior, yet she had taken care of him.</p><p>Mine. Worthy of being queen.</p><p>She\u2019d told him she did not have a man waiting for her, and he was glad. Had she, he would have killed the man. Not painfully, not unless the man had once hurt her, but he would have died all the same. After Nicolai found a way into her world. And he would have done so. No one but him would lay claim to this woman, not in any time or in any place.</p><p>And if you have someone waiting for you? Someone you\u2019ve forgotten? He frowned, not liking the thought. Fidelity was important. Jane had said as much. He didn\u2019t know a lot about himself, but that he, too, believed.</p><p>But...he wanted Jane. And right then, he could not even conceive the idea of wanting anyone else, of being with anyone else. Ever. Truly, every cell in his body burned for Jane, only Jane. Somehow, she was already a part of him. Somehow, her essence was rooted so deeply inside him, he suspected they had always been destined to meet, to be together. But... If someone was waiting for him, what would he do? Despite his fearsome temper, he revered the law and never went back on his word. Right?</p><p>Perhaps. But... There was that awful, awful word again. The law, his honor, fidelity, none of those applied to this situation. If he didn\u2019t want another female, he wouldn\u2019t accept another female. He wouldn\u2019t cheat Jane. It was as simple as that.</p><p>While he thought himself somewhat decent in this matter, he did not think he fought honorably. He thought he won his battles through fair means or foul, and punished his enemies without a shred of mercy or remorse. Look at what he\u2019d done to the guards of the Queen of Hearts.</p><p>And many years ago, he had led his army through the Wolfyn realm, the moon hidden behind clouds, the citizens of one of the kingdoms sleeping peacefully in their beds. He and his men had razed the entire structure. He\u2019d hated to do it, but that hadn\u2019t stopped him. Anything to save his brother....</p><p>A sharp pain, his mind shutting down. The memory, lost. For the most part. Once, he\u2019d led an army. He\u2019d thought such a thing before, but now he knew. He had. He\u2019d led them. But...an army of what? Other vampires? Mercenaries? Or had he been royally sanctioned?</p><p>The answers were not forthcoming, and he gritted his teeth in renewed frustration.</p><p>He focused on the here and now. On Jane. He was willing to fight for her. He wanted her in his life, and she might very well protest. If so, they would verbally brawl and he would do anything to keep her.</p><p>At last he smoothed the hair from her cheek and...</p><p>She had a black eye.</p><p>Nicolai stiffened, rage blooming through him, stronger than ever before. Someone had hit her. Who had dared hit her?</p><p>The animal instinct roared to the surface, snarling, desperate for blood.</p><p>Calm, he had to remain calm. For now. Was she injured further? As tenderly as he was able, he rolled her to her back. There were no other bruises on her face. The long length of her lashes cast spiky shadows over her cheeks, and he traced them just to be sure. They were smooth, soft and warm. Her lips were puffy and red, as if she\u2019d chewed them from worry.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. She was beautiful...a priceless work of art.</p><p>There were several cuts on her hands, but those came from the making of the blades. He had borne those same cuts on multiple occasions. Another memory, and it came without pain. He did not pursue it. Jane was more important.</p><p>Bruises wrapped around her rib cage, stretching from her back, where she\u2019d been whipped. Thankfully, though, she possessed no other battle marks. So. How had she gotten the black eye?</p><p>She shifted in her sleep, and another pained groan left her.</p><p>Her back must agonize her in this position. He should have left her on her side. Could he never do the right thing where this woman was concerned? He eased back down and gently worked an arm under her shoulder. Then he lifted her until she was plastered to his side, her injuries free of all contact. She burrowed her head in the hollow of his neck and raised her top leg, fitting herself against him like the puzzle piece she\u2019d once praised.</p><p>She flattened her hand over his heart, as if measuring the erratic beat against her own. So trusting she was, so trustworthy. She hadn\u2019t left him when she\u2019d had the chance. So forgiving, too. He\u2019d allowed her to be whipped, yet still she\u2019d taken care of him. Had even, he mused, cleaned his teeth. His mouth tasted fresh, like mint.</p><p>She groaned again, but this time, oh, this time, there was no pain in her voice. Only pleasure. Such a decadent sound. Instantly his cock stood at attention, filling, hardening, readying. He bit his tongue, his fangs sinking deep into the tissue.</p><p>\u201cNicolai?\u201d Jane breathed sleepily.</p><p>\u201cAll is well, Jane. Go back to sleep.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You may sleep after you tell me who hit you,\u201d he interrupted before she could make a demand of her own.</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d Warm breath trekked over his chest, tickling his skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he shouted. \u201cMe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAccident. No worries. And I didn\u2019t mean to cuddle up to you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She was sorry? \u201cJane. I am sorry.\u201d Shame beat at him more stubbornly than any opponent ever had. \u201cName a punishment and I will render it against myself immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo punishment necessary, you silly man. I told you, it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>Even in this, she forgave him so easily. Her worth far surpassed his. \u201cI will never hurt you again, you have my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were out of it. You couldn\u2019t help yourself. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re finally awake. I\u2019ve been so worried.\u201d</p> <p>She was going to roll away from him, he thought, feeling her muscles bunch, preparing for movement. He tightened his hold on her. \u201cNo. I put you here.\u201d And here you will stay.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, and he couldn\u2019t decide if she was pleased or upset. \u201cAre you, uh, thirsty? For blood, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cNo.\u201d She was in no condition to feed him. But even the idea of tasting her had his fangs extending, moisture filling his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, you might be wondering about the number of times I bathed you, but I promise you I never touched you more than necessary. Okay, maybe I did, but not by much. And I cut up the hem of my gown to use as rags, so that you wouldn\u2019t have to endure skin-to-skin contact while you were out.\u201d</p><p>Endure? The thought of her delicate little hands on his body caused his testicles to draw up tight and his erection to throb, close to exploding. \u201cThank you for taking care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleas\u2014 I mean, you\u2019re welcome. So how are you feeling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBetter.\u201d Now that she was relaxing against him. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy legs hurt.\u201d</p><p>Her legs, not her back. It was the first complaint she had ever uttered, yet she\u2019d cast no blame his way. Determination consumed him, suddenly and completely, blending with a sense of urgency. \u201cHurt, from the walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom an old injury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCar accident.\u201d She paused. \u201cA car is a vehicle used for traveling along roads at high speeds. Anyway, two of them smashed together. I was inside one. My family, too. I survived. They didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He could not imagine what she described, but could identify with her pain. \u201cI will make you better.\u201d He eased her to the ground and sat up.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. Only time can. I only just started walking again a few months ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could not walk?\u201d When he turned and moved between her legs, a hot blush flooded her cheeks and she quickly covered her breasts and stomach. She also kept her gaze on the large emerald-and-white leaves forming a barrier between them and the sky.</p><p>\u201cNot for almost a year. So, hey, did I tell you that I washed my gown and that\u2019s why I\u2019m practically naked like this? The material wasn\u2019t dry, and I didn\u2019t want to wake you up if I accidentally rubbed against you and the gown was cold and wet. But I probably should have risked it,\u201d she babbled. \u201cMy scars, I know how ugly they are and as perfect as you are, you\u2019re probably used to perfect women, too. I mean, not that you had a choice with Laila, and not that she\u2019s perfect. But before her you probably\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s tackle this one issue at a time. You think I\u2019m upset by your nakedness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. After what Laila did, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not Laila.\u201d And every part of him knew it.</p><p>\u201cI know that, but you are a victim of sexual abuse and I...I just don\u2019t want to push the boundaries and upset you.\u201d Upset him? Him? \u201cI\u2019ve told you how much I crave you, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you needed me to save you. You might have been buttering my toast, so to speak.\u201d When he looked at her blankly, she added, \u201cYou know, softening me up so I\u2019d do what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, that had been the plan. From the first moment he\u2019d spied her, however, everything had changed. He\u2019d operated only on instinct. \u201cYou are also too smart for your own good and convince yourself of the silliest notions.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, just not enough to hide the fire inside them. \u201cAnything else you want to complain about, you lazy vampire?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. Even angry, the woman wasn\u2019t concerned with his new position. Her knees were poised at his hips, his erection lifting his loincloth and nearly brushing what was definitely the sweetest spot in this world or the other. Despite her insecurities, she trusted him completely.</p><p>She was uncomfortable about her nudity for reasons that had nothing to do with him, and that he couldn\u2019t allow. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve...climaxed recently,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, now I do,\u201d she replied cautiously.</p><p>\u201cThe last time was the morning of your arrival. Mere hours before, in fact. And not once, but twice. Yet, look at my cock, Jane.\u201d</p><p>A slight gurgle was her only response.</p><p>\u201cLook at my cock,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>This time, she obeyed. Slowly, slowly, her gaze lowered. She gasped when she spotted the angle of his loincloth.</p><p>\u201cIf I did not want you, I would not be hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d A heated sigh.</p><p>\u201cAny time you doubt your appeal, just look here.\u201d He fisted his length and moved his hand up and down, up and down, hissing in a breath at the painful but very necessary pressure. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember how exquisite I find you. So much so you are in constant danger of being devoured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my scars...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour scars simply prove how strong and capable you are. They prove you survived a terrible accident. They are lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she squeaked, her cheeks brightening another degree.</p><p>\u201cReally. And just so you know, there are no boundaries with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He stopped his assault on himself before he spilled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...but...there are always boundaries.\u201d</p><p>Oh, really. \u201cIs there something you don\u2019t want me to do to you? Some place on your body you don\u2019t want me to touch?\u201d He was tense as he awaited her response. He could have misjudged. He could be wrong about her feelings.</p><p>She gulped. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed. \u201cIt is the same for me. Therefore, no boundaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I believe you. But I\u2014I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve explored all the ramifications of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d A sexual relationship? \u201cI think you think and reason too much. We will mate. One day. Not today, but soon.\u201d</p><p>Another sigh, her entire body sagging into the ground. \u201cI know that, too. I\u2019m too attracted to you not to give in.\u201d</p><p>He loved such an open, honest admission. \u201cGood. Now. Have I covered everything that worried you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She chewed at her lip until a tiny bead of blood formed. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have already mentioned that you do that far too much.\u201d Before he realized what he was doing, he reached out, collected the blood with the tip of his finger and licked it away. Her flavor, as sweet as her scent, fizzed and crackled over his taste buds, and he moaned. Dark Abyss, nothing had ever tasted that good. The need for more grew...grew...until he was sweating, panting, fighting for control.</p><p>He would not fall on her. He would not.</p><p>He had known she would delight him in this way, but he had not expected this.</p><p>\u201cI could return home at any second,\u201d she said, unaware of the change in him. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re free now and isn\u2019t that the reason you summoned me? So it stands to reason that the magic that brought me here will soon begin to fade, whether you want it to or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he practically roared, his hunger forgotten in the face of his sudden terror of losing her.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not allow it.\u201d Not now, not ever.</p><p>Ever? Yes, he would keep her forever. Would never let her go.</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d She snapped her fingers. \u201cYou won\u2019t allow it, so it won\u2019t happen?\u201d</p><p>Sweat beaded on his brow as he sat back on his thighs. \u201cI am not safe yet. Therefore, you have not fulfilled all of your duties.\u201d He would remain in perpetual danger, if need be. He\u2019d lost so many loved ones already. He could not bear...the pain. The damned pain, wiping his thoughts. \u201cThat subject is now closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cAre you always this grouchy in the semimorning?\u201d</p><p>Only when you talk of leaving me. \u201cWould a grouchy vampire tell you that you are the most beautiful female he\u2019s ever met?\u201d he asked, determined to soothe them both.</p><p>A luscious softening of her eyes, her mouth. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I am not grouchy. Now close your eyes and relax.\u201d If that ocher gaze met his, he would forget his purpose, lean down, kiss the breath right out of her, then work his way to her vein. And if his teeth sank inside her, his cock would expect equal measure. \u201cI\u2019m going to ease your hurts.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FEMALE he\u2019d ever seen? He must be seeing Odette, then, Jane thought. Thin might be in, at least where she was from, but there was such a thing as too thin and Jane was it. After the accident, she\u2019d been bed bound and tube fed. When she\u2019d finally woken up, able to feed herself, she\u2019d learned of her family\u2019s demise and hadn\u2019t had an appetite.</p><p>Now that her appetite had reasserted itself, she\u2019d been forced to exist on only fruits and nuts.</p><p>Fruits...nuts...hmm... In that moment, she realized she was starving. For a juicy steak and a side of fries\u2014on top of another steak. The food could wait, though. She was also starving for a man\u2019s touch. A touch Nicolai gave her. Liberally. His strong fingers massaged her calves, deep and hard, hitting her just right. Moaning, she sagged against the moss beneath her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cToo much?\u201d he asked in a gravelly voice.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she managed to gasp out. She kept her eyes closed, as he\u2019d demanded. Not because of his order, but because his fangs were still out. There was a slight slur to his words.</p><p>Those fangs scared her as much as they aroused her. She\u2019d seen the harm they could do, ripping through flesh and bone, but also wondered about the pleasure they could bring. Every time she wondered, she shivered.</p> <p>Hell, even now she shivered. If he was hungry, she was going to feed him, she decided. After this massage, she would owe him a kidney, anyway. Because, oh, sweet mercy, nothing had ever felt this good. Not even grinding on top of him\u2014in her fantasy and in reality\u2014and that had felt like heaven.</p><p>Okay, so, maybe the grinding had felt just as good.</p><p>He worked on her calves for over an hour, and by the time he moved up to her thighs, she stopped trying to conceal her breasts and scars. Why should she? He\u2019d already seen them and had claimed to find them exquisite. Her arms slid to the ground, useless. God, the man\u2019s hands were magic.</p><p>Magic. Yes. Somehow, he was using magic. Warmth flowed from his skin and into hers, an unnatural warmth, a drugging warmth, intoxicating her, stealing into her muscles, her bones, until every part of her was tingling\u2014and his property. Oh, yes. Whatever he touched instantly became his, existing for him and only him.</p><p>When his knuckles brushed the edge of her panties, every nerve ending she possessed roared to sudden life, reaching for him. Soon she was panting, groaning, trying to anticipate his next move. At her knee, he rubbed, then stroked up, gliding along her thigh, sweeping over\u2014yes, there, please there, almost, almost\u2014only to pause, not quite stroking where she most needed, before reaching for her other thigh. She had to bite her lip to cut off her plaintive cries for more.</p> <p>If he would prolong the contact, angle it just a little, she could climax. Oh, God. If she climaxed from this...it would be embarrassing.</p><p>The massage continued. And really, who cared about being embarrassed? She didn\u2019t. When would he brush across her panties again? She tensed, waiting, hoping, so damn eager. Her entire body vibrated. Even the air in her lungs began to heat. But time ticked by, and his motions became a little jerky as he kneaded the knots, never offering such wantonness again.</p><p>\u201cDistract me,\u201d she said. Otherwise, she just might beg him for a happy ending. Something she couldn\u2019t allow herself to do. He said they would mate soon. Which meant, now was not the time. Or was she supposed to beg? Before, in the bedroom, he\u2019d said, Not until you beg me. Was that what he wanted now? What he expected? To work her into a frenzy and hear her plead? Well, she would\u2014</p><p>\u201cDistract you how?\u201d he asked, surprising her.</p><p>Okay, so begging wasn\u2019t on the menu. Astonished with herself, she fought a wave of disappointment. \u201cTell me a story.\u201d</p><p>He stilled. \u201cA story?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She cracked open her eyelids and added, \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t stop massaging!\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched despite the tension radiating from him, something she found endearing. Most likely amusement had not been a part of his life for a while, yet he seemed to enjoy her. As she enjoyed him.</p><p>\u201cA story about what?\u201d he asked. He remained between her splayed legs, with her knees bent and framing him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Your family, maybe.\u201d The second she said the words, she wanted to snatch them back. She remembered the passage from the book. He did not recall his past. His memory\u2014</p><p>\u201cI have two brothers and a sister,\u201d he said, and stopped breathing.</p><p>A moment passed, then another. His fangs slid back inside his mouth, disappearing. Shock and pain replaced the desire and joviality in his expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked, even though she knew the answer. Or thought she did. He needed to speak, to release. Something she had learned\u2014and maybe discarded\u2014in her therapy sessions. But just because she hadn\u2019t tried it, didn\u2019t mean he should not.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t remember my siblings until just now. I suspected, but...I have two brothers and a sister. Right now I know, know, they are real.\u201d There was a challenging note in his voice, as if he expected her to argue.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re real,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>He grimaced, nodded. \u201cAt last I can see them in my mind. I just can\u2019t recall their names. When I try, my head nearly explodes with pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA courtesy of the healer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Nicolai. I am so sorry.\u201d To know you had a family and to be unable to recall the past you shared, well, that was a true torture, and far worse than not knowing they existed at all. For months, Jane had survived only on her memories. \u201cEase away from thinking about their names and describe what you see.\u201d Perhaps, when he relaxed, his mind focused on one portion of his past, other memories would follow more easily.</p><p>The glaze of pain faded from his eyes, and the corners of his lips quirked up once more. He dug into her muscles with more ferocity. \u201cMy youngest brother, just a boy, has green eyes and hair several shades lighter than yours. I see him chasing after me, and that makes me happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet he looked up to you,\u201d she said to encourage him. \u201cI had an older sister, and I was always chasing after her, desperate to play with her and her friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Nicolai\u2019s eyes widened, but he was looking beyond her, to a place she couldn\u2019t fathom. \u201cYes, he did look up to me. To all of us. And we loved him. He was sweetness and innocence rolled into a mischievous package. I\u2014I see us standing together, smiling, a unicorn prancing in front of us.\u201d A real unicorn. Jane wanted details\u2014like, had they saddled the creature and ridden it around?\u2014but didn\u2019t want to interrupt the flow of Nicolai\u2019s recollection. \u201cWhat about your other brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is younger, as well, though very close to my age.\u201d He paused, as if searching his mind for validation. He nodded. \u201cThey are all younger than me. Even my darling sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are these other siblings like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister has her golden head bent over a spell book. I try to convince her to leave with me, as I must visit the market, but she refuses. She wants to stay, has too much to do. She works too hard, wants to please too many people. And he, the brother closest to my age, has black hair, like mine, and he\u2019s hunting in the forest, racing alongside the wolves.\u201d</p><p>The bookworm and the warrior, huh? \u201cYou are the dictator, I bet,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cAnd the youngest is the sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicah is a sweetheart, yes.\u201d His eyes widened, a trace of pain returning. \u201cMicah. Yes, that\u2019s his name. I wonder where he is, where they all are, what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll remember, just like you remembered Micah\u2019s name. And maybe you don\u2019t need a healer to do this. These memories came back without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they came back because of you.\u201d Nicolai\u2019s gaze returned to her. He caught sight of her encouraging smile and licked his lips, his expression changing yet again. From wistful to heated, his cheeks flushing, his fangs peeking out. Little beads of sweat popped up on his brow.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d The rising sun cast muted, golden rays over their camp. Though he remained in the shadows, his bronzed skin seemed to glow. His eyes swirled, liquid silver, hypnotizing her.</p><p>\u201cYes. You are the only change in my life,\u201d he said. His attention moved to her breasts, and her nipples pearled for him, as if desperate to please him. \u201cMine,\u201d he added, reminding her of the beast he had become inside the palace.</p><p>This time, the beast delighted her.</p><p>The tingling reignited, more intense and spreading quickly. She might have moaned. Might have lifted her hips, seeking more of his heat. Hard to tell, because her thoughts were so consumed with what she wanted, needed, from him.</p><p>\u201cYou keep saying that.\u201d And she kept hoping it was true. But they\u2019d made no promises to each other, had only stated their desire for each other.</p><p>And really, despite his earlier shout that she would stay with him, she had no idea how much longer they would be together. An hour? A week? A year? They were literally from two different worlds, and she could return as suddenly as she\u2019d appeared.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he said more forcefully, perhaps sensing her doubts.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that? Explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant you. No secret of that. You want me, too.\u201d</p><p>God, those short, abrupt sentences were sexy as hell. As if his mind was locked on one thought\u2014pleasure\u2014and nothing could penetrate his determination to have it. With her and only her.</p><p>But...could she truly satisfy him? More than being from two different worlds, they were completely different people. One, there was his abuse. Would the things she wanted to do to him freak him out? Maybe, maybe not. Nothing had so far. Two, he clearly knew his way around a female body.</p><p>Odette and Laila had been willing to enslave him to experience the joy of his body. Jane knew her way around one man\u2019s. She knew what he had liked, but had no idea what another male might long for.</p><p>Her previous relationship had lasted three years, ending with her accident. Not because of him. Spencer had wanted to stick by her side. She had pushed him away, too grief stricken to deal with him or anyone. And the plain fact was, she had no longer desired him. Not in any way. She had tried, she really had, to make herself want him again. She had planned a date night, with every intention of seducing him. Yet, even the thought of kissing him had made her sick and she had sent him home directly after dinner.</p><p>So, the fact was, while she and Spencer had done everything lovers could do, she\u2019d didn\u2019t have any other experience. None. In school, she\u2019d been far younger than her classmates, so no one had wanted her. After that, she\u2019d been too busy. Spencer was the first man to distract her enough to start something.</p><p>The lack hadn\u2019t bothered her before. There\u2019d been no time to consider it, not even when she had been grinding on top of Nicolai. She\u2019d been too busy trying to figure out what had happened to her, trying to survive her sudden appearance here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, however, she wanted to be perfect. The best. She wanted to please Nicolai the way he had pleased her in her fantasy.</p><p>She had enjoyed sex. And she had missed it, despite her lack of desire, all these months. Actually, nearly a year now. Mostly, she had loved and missed the afterglow, lying in a man\u2019s arms, absorbing his heat, talking, laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost you to your thoughts.\u201d Nicolai cursed under his breath, but there was humor in the undercurrent. \u201cI\u2019m trying to resist you, Jane, and I\u2019m failing. The challenge of engaging your attention isn\u2019t helping.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d A breathy entreaty. \u201cI mean, why are you trying to resist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need time to recover. And there\u2019s something I must tell you first. Something you will not like.\u201d</p><p>Stomach cramp. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>One heartbeat, two. \u201cWithout my memories, I can\u2019t be sure...a woman could be waiting...\u201d</p><p>Another cramp. \u201cOh, God. You\u2019re married?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. No, that much I know. Just before my appearance in the Sex Market, I was with a woman...a servant. Yes. I remember that. I would not have been with a servant if I were married. But I might have promised myself to another.\u201d</p><p>Might have... No. Not possible. \u201cYou hadn\u2019t.\u201d This she said with a sudden surge of confidence. He was too possessive to sleep with a servant if a fianc\u00e9e waited in the wings.</p><p>A glimmer of hope in his expression. \u201cI mention this only as a possibility, not a reality. I could never want anyone as much as I want you right now.\u201d He was looming over her a second later, his mouth poised just above hers. He was breathing shallowly, his hands anchored next to her temples, his erection pressed between her legs.</p><p>Finally. The contact she\u2019d yearned for. He was hers, hers, only hers. She could believe nothing less. \u201cYou may not know yourself, but I think I know you,\u201d she said. \u201cTrust me, no one is waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t being stubborn or blind about this. Discarding his possessive nature and the fact that any woman he committed to would have his full attention, he was vampire and vampires mated for life. Physically they couldn\u2019t stray. Research had proven that. So, memory or not, he would not react to Jane if his heart belonged to another.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I am a horrible person, because I don\u2019t care about a faceless stranger,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t resist you. I won\u2019t resist you. Don\u2019t deny me, Jane. Must taste you, all of you. Please.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her reply but leaned the rest of the way down.</p> <p>\u201cNicolai\u2014\u201d She meant to tell him that she couldn\u2019t resist him, either, and she would never deny him, that he wasn\u2019t a horrible person, but the words were lost in a scorching kiss as he meshed their lips together.</p><p>His tongue thrust past her teeth and rolled with hers. Hot, so hot.</p><p>He tasted of mint and...candy. Mmm. Yes, candy. Sugary sweet, the flavor all his own, consumed her.</p><p>Unable to stop herself, she glided her fingers into his hair.</p><p>\u201cYes. Please. Please,\u201d she said, finally begging.</p><p>Her nails bit into his scalp, holding him to her. She needed more, had to have more, everything else forgotten. Her knees squeezed at his waist, and she rocked herself against him. A gasp of hungry joy escaped her. God! The feel of his erection against her was mind-blowing, shattering, necessary, better than anything she\u2019d ever known. Maybe because she was so damn wet and ready. So she did it again, rocking, rubbing, gasping.</p><p>With a growl of approval, he thrust his tongue deeper. Their teeth scraped together. Dizzying friction, welcome but torturous as her need ratcheted up another level. Then he angled his head for even deeper contact, and she felt the graze of his fangs. No, this was need. True, undiluted need. She wanted to be bitten, again and again and again. To be everything to him. Lover, sustenance, breath.</p><p>Her blood was heating unbearably, her stomach quivering. On and on the kiss continued, until there was no more oxygen left in her lungs. Until Nicolai was her only lifeline.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she rasped. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods, Jane. You\u2019re...you\u2019re like fire. I want to be burned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He licked his way to the pulse hammering at the base of her neck. Was he going to bite her at last? But no, he continued laving at her pulse, sucking on it as one of his hands cupped her breast and kneaded. He pinched the throbbing nipple, and a lance of delicious sensation shot through her entire body.</p><p>Heaven and hell, so sweetly offered...how close she was to falling over the edge. But when she did, if she did\u2014please, let her\u2014where would she land? The clouds, or the fiery pits?</p><p>Only one way to find out...</p><p>\u201cNicolai?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Sweetheart. His sweetheart. \u201cBite me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane.\u201d A groan. \u201cYou tempt me. I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t, because he still thought she needed to heal? Or because a part of him still believed another female was out there, waiting for him? If the impossible happened and he was committed... Why impossible? she wondered next. Jane was here, wasn\u2019t she? Nothing was impossible.</p><p>The knowledge caused the first tendrils of doubt to surface. Jane despised cheaters, but she also hated stories that forced two people to remain together because of a sense of duty, rather than love. Nicolai wasn\u2019t in love. And if he had a woman, why hadn\u2019t she searched for him? Saved him? Again, that made Jane think he couldn\u2019t possibly be committed. No girlfriend would have let this guy go. Therefore, Jane could still have him.</p><p>But, she didn\u2019t want him resenting her. Or feeling pressured. Or regretting what they did. \u201cAll right. We won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will. Just don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Relief. So much relief, ecstasy shimmering, within reach. \u201cYou could never hurt me. Nicolai, please. Do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, please. I\u2019ll beg if necessary. I must have more....\u201d His fangs returned to her neck and grazed her sizzling skin. \u201cMust taste, will die if I do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d She hissed out a breath and stiffened as she mentally prepared herself for the onslaught. Of pleasure or pain, she wasn\u2019t sure. All she knew was that she needed this, too.</p><p>He dragged in a shaky breath. \u201cYou are sure? I don\u2019t have to. I can stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. Please, don\u2019t stop. I\u2019m just wary of the unknown.\u201d</p><p>Liiick. \u201cDo not fear, little Jane. I\u2019ll be careful with you. Will control myself.\u201d Then, with agonizing slowness, he sank his fangs into her neck, sucked on her, swallowed her blood.</p><p>Not once did she experience any pain, but the pleasure, oh, God, the pleasure...exactly as she\u2019d imagined, beautiful in the most erotic way. The missing piece to the puzzle of her life.</p><p>The burn of his mouth, the suction of his tongue, both caused riotous reactions in her body. She clutched at his back, pulled at his hair, lost to a bliss that should have been impossible. Soon she was even writhing and thrashing against him, desperate for completion.</p><p>He purred against her, his breath warm. Then something hot, so wonderfully hot, entered her system. And okay, she hadn\u2019t truly known pleasure before that moment. This was pleasure. Pleasure in its purest form. Strength, heat, power. She felt those, too.</p><p>Her thrashing became a single-minded pursuit for the elusive satisfaction that still hovered so close. She ground herself against his erection, over and over again, little shivers of sensation coursing through her every time he swallowed. God. She could climb him like a mountain. Could eat him up, one tasty bite at a time. Could remain in his arms forever.</p><p>He wrenched free of her vein. \u201cHave to...stop. Can\u2019t take...too much.\u201d</p><p>There was no such thing as too much. \u201cTake more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromised to be careful.\u201d He licked the punctures, shooting more of that liquid heat into her system. He growled, \u201cNow you are marked. Mine.\u201d</p><p>His, just as he was hers. Hers, and no one else\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSo good. Never tasted anything...so sweet. Addicted...already...\u201d</p><p>Yes. Addicted. He was a drug. Her drug, and she doubted there was a cure.</p><p>With her painkillers, she\u2019d had to stop using cold and flat. The withdrawals had been nightmarish. Yet she knew with sudden, shocking clarity that those would not compare to what she\u2019d experience without Nicolai.</p><p>He replaced the hand on her breast with his mouth, flicking his white-hot tongue over her nipple, shooting more of those gratifying lances through her. He didn\u2019t bite, though, not again.</p><p>She wanted him to bite her everywhere. \u201cPlease, Nicolai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want, I will give you.\u201d</p><p>She arched into him, locking her ankles at his lower back. The long, thick length of his erection hit her just right, more liquid dampening her panties. \u201cI want it all.\u201d</p><p>He still wore the loincloth, but the leather must have bunched up, freeing his cock, because she could feel the heat of his silky skin, soft yet, oh, so hard, pushing at the cotton in a bid to move it out of the way. Just a little more, and they\u2019d be skin-to-skin. Strength-to-wet.</p><p>She ached for that. Wanted it with every fiber of her being. But Nicolai had other plans. He continued his downward journey, tracing her scars with his tongue, laving her navel. She would have been humbled by the decadent attention, but she was too aroused. Goose bumps broke out, sensitizing her skin to an almost unbearable degree.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Yes. Yes! His. Always. She frowned. No, not always. The repercussions of his druglike lovemaking hit her like a hammer to the head. She could go home at any moment. This wasn\u2019t permanent, and she couldn\u2019t forget that fact. Couldn\u2019t become attached to him. To this.</p><p>You already are.</p><p>Yes, she was.</p><p>How could she return to her old life now? She\u2019d tasted the forbidden fruit, was addicted just as she\u2019d suspected, and she needed more. More of his hands and his mouth and his teeth and his fingers. More of the heat and the sweetness and the ferocity. But if she didn\u2019t finish this, if she attempted to walk away now, she would always wonder about what could have happened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, she would worry about the consequences later. Right now, she would simply enjoy.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she found herself agreeing.</p> <p>\u201cYou want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, and only you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet for me. I can feel you, feel how ready you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady for you, and only you.\u201d She was repeating herself, but she didn\u2019t care. The words were true.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so hot for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll give me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I...\u201d Jane\u2019s thoughts derailed completely. Finally he was there, between her legs, shoving her panties aside the rest of the way. She anchored her calves over his shoulders as his tongue stroked her.</p><p>At first contact, she screamed. So good, so damn good. He licked, sucked and nibbled at her, building her desire to a fever pitch. So close, closer than ever before.</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like!\u201d</p> <p>His fingers joined the play. First one, sinking in and out, then another, in and out, in and out, stretching her, preparing her for his possession. \u201cCould stay here forever,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>She was incapable of responding, what little breath she had left caught in her throat.</p><p>\u201cTaste so sweet here, too.\u201d</p><p>A sound escaped the knot. A whimper.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, sweetheart.\u201d A command from the animal he\u2019d unleashed at the palace, frothed into a frenzy, desperate, a conqueror. \u201cLet me see that beautiful face light up.\u201d With that, he bit her, right there, between her legs.</p><p>He sucked the blood that beaded, and then, thank God, then he shot whatever his fangs produced straight inside her core.</p><p>Sparks of utter bliss ignited there, then spread, quickly burning her up from top to bottom. Every muscle she possessed clenched, spasmed, shooting her to the stars. Another scream left her, this one tearing through the encroaching daylight.</p><p>The climax was intense, soul shattering. Then Nicolai was looming over her, one of his hands ripping at her panties, his cock probing for entrance. His eyes were glitter-bright, his fangs bared in a determined scowl. Not of anger, but of agonizing need.</p> <p>\u201cMore,\u201d he said with guttural harshness.</p><p>\u201cLet me have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Just before he thrust inside, the bushes to their left rattled, the leaves dancing together. His attention whipped there, a growl of pure menace leaving him.</p><p>Jane was still too lost in the throes of passion to care. \u201cNicolai! Please. What are you waiting for?\u201d Make me your woman in truth.</p><p>\u201cProtect.\u201d He jerked upright, severing all contact. She reached for him, but he placed himself in front of her, acting as her shield.</p><p>The time for pleasure had ended. The time for fighting had arrived.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>NICOLAI\u2019S MORPH FROM tender lover to savage vampire warrior shocked Jane back to her senses. She was naked\u2014ripped panties didn\u2019t count\u2014and her camp had just been invaded. By giants. Four of them.</p><p>All four were eyeing her up and down like a barbecued slab of ribs\u2014and they were starving vegetarians.</p><p>One by one, they confirmed her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cUgly,\u201d the tallest said, the g prolonged.</p><p>\u201cHideous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman,\u201d the shortest said. He was probably six-five.</p><p>The rest of them shrugged, the universal sign for I guess she\u2019ll do. Apparently Odette and Laila looked a lot alike, but sex was sex. They might find her repellant, but they\u2019d still do her. Their gazes dipped and glued to her nipples, saliva dripping from the corners of their mouths.</p><p>Vegetarians now converted into carnivores.</p><p>Jane shuddered. The best thing about her robe, she decided then, was the ease of donning it. She grabbed the material still hanging from the limb where she\u2019d draped it and jerked it over her head. Boom, done. She was dressed and ready to face the newest hazard in her life.</p><p>She\u2019d expected to battle Laila\u2019s guards at some point, but as she snatched up two of her wooden daggers, she realized the giants weren\u2019t as humanoid as the guards had been. Their eyes were bright red, like twin crimson suns rising from the pits of hell. Sharp, fanglike teeth, bared now, still dripping, dripping, forked tongues flicking out and swiping over reptile-thin lips. Wide shoulders, with black wings arching above them. Rather than nails, they possessed claws.</p><p>Somehow, she recognized them as she\u2019d recognized the forest. They were straight out of her darkest nightmares and deep down she knew these creatures were savage, mindless. And Nicolai was going to fight them? He drank from you. He\u2019s strong enough.</p><p>Please be strong enough.</p><p>He snarled a sound of pure menace, his scary animal nature racing back to the forefront. \u201cMine.\u201d He stopped just in front of them, daring them to act.</p><p>He was weaponless, his torso bare. His poor back was as scarred as her front. Not from a whip or an accident, she didn\u2019t think. There was a wide circular mass of scar tissue, raised and puckered, in the center of his back, as if someone had carved out the patch of skin.</p><p>He was a survivor. Like her. He could take these men\u2014and win.</p><p>\u201cWe want woman,\u201d the tallest said. He was clearly the leader. Also, he was as dumb as a box of rocks, because he added, \u201cYou give. Now,\u201d and expected Nicolai to rush to obey.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she and Nicolai said in unison.</p><p>\u201cYou leave,\u201d another said with a frown, just as clearly not understanding why Jane wasn\u2019t being given to him.</p><p>\u201cShe please us. You live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jane told them with a shake of her head. \u201cYou leave.\u201d Simple words they might understand. \u201cAnd you will live.\u201d</p><p>They ignored her.</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d one said to Nicolai. \u201cLast chance.\u201d</p><p>Another said, \u201cYou look like someone. Who?\u201d He shook his head, already losing interest in the question. \u201cNo matter. Give woman. We keep.\u201d</p><p>So. Her will meant nothing. Rape was on their menu du jour. \u201cRip them to shreds,\u201d she told Nicolai.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. He simply leaped forward and raked his claws\u2014claws, longer and sharper than theirs!\u2014along the face of the tallest, the biggest threat, sending the giant stumbling backward.</p><p>The grunt of pain that followed was like the starting bell to a UFC match. No rules, just pain.</p><p>The five males swarmed together in a tangle of limbs, fangs, blood and adrenaline. The blood, well, that sent Nicolai into an animalistic frenzy. He snarled like a panther, bit like a shark and held on to whatever he clamped his teeth into like a pit bull.</p><p>Jane knew better than to interfere. When she\u2019d switched the focus of her work to the human body, hoping to find a cure for her mother, she\u2019d learned quite a bit about physical reactions. A man worked into a rage was completely unaware of his surroundings. The chemicals shooting through his bloodstream would keep Nicolai on a short leash, the end of that leash bound to these giants, where only killing mattered.</p><p>So she stood there, and she watched, silently cheering for her man.</p><p>Not yours, she forced herself to add. Not completely, and not yet. She could share her body with him, her mind, but her heart and soul? No. Not when there was a chance the magic would fade and she would return home. Worse, if he fell in love with her, he would wither and die if she left him.</p><p>Oh...damn. She\u2019d forgotten about that. Such a terrible fate had befallen several of the vampires brought to her lab. She couldn\u2019t let that happen to Nicolai.</p><p>She brushed the depressing, worrisome thoughts aside. No distractions, not now. The fight escalated quickly, the violence seemingly unparalleled. Someone\u2019s arm flew past her head\u2014and it wasn\u2019t attached to a body.</p><p>Just then, Nicolai was walking death. His expression, what few times she glimpsed it, considering how quickly he was moving, was cold. He lacked mercy, never once pulling his punches. He went for the throat, vital organs and groin. Had the giants been human, they would have fallen to his superior power within seconds. But each time he dropped one to the ground, or tore off a limb, the bastard got up for more.</p><p>That only revved Nicolai\u2019s engine. The lethal grace of him...Jane was riveted, even shocked. Oh, she\u2019d known he was capable of this. There, inside the palace, hatred and determination had radiated from him. And guts had spilled across the floor. Had he not rescued her, he would have stayed until every living being had died by his hand. Or teeth. That, she\u2019d known.</p><p>But this man, this warrior, had also given her sizzling pleasure. He\u2019d feasted between her legs, and he\u2019d loved doing it. She thought he might have enjoyed it as much as she had. And, oh, he\u2019d set her blood on fire, thrilled her to her very soul, ensuring both of them existed only for passion. That had happened minutes ago. Mere minutes ago. Now he was a being capable of rendering pain, only pain.</p><p>And all too soon the giants learned to anticipate his moves. They bit at him with their too-sharp saber teeth. They swiped their claws at him, cutting him deep. They spun around him, above him, using their wings to slice at him. Nicolai was forced to jump between them and use his momentum to kick at them. They stumbled, but again, they always rose.</p><p>She would have to do something, after all. Nicolai would tire soon, surely. He was losing blood, crimson streaking down his chest where he\u2019d been scratched. How should she\u2014?</p><p>In less than a heartbeat of time, strong, trunklike arms banded around her, one just above her breasts, the other around her waist, and jerked her into a thick body. Fear bombarded her, nearly paralyzing her. Then fight-or-flight kicked in\u2014as did a reminder that she held two daggers. Fight won.</p><p>She slammed her elbow backward, hitting her attacker in the stomach, meaning to turn and stab. He grunted, but held tight, and she wasn\u2019t able to twist around. She opened her mouth to scream. Before even the slightest sound left her, her mind shouted, You can\u2019t distract Nicolai.</p><p>The giant\u2014and she knew a giant held her\u2014dragged her backward, but she didn\u2019t allow herself to struggle.</p><p>Perhaps they weren\u2019t as dumb as she\u2019d first thought. This one had known to hang back, to wait, to watch, and grab her while everyone else was preoccupied. Were any others waiting in the shadows? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How would she fight them all?</p><p>A cold rage of her own infused her. Thankfully no one else appeared, and when Nicolai and company were no longer in sight, leaves and branches shielding them, she erupted. Fight. She angled her arms, lifted both of her elbows this time, and then slammed them home. He gave another grunt, finally loosening his hold.</p><p>Another angle shift, and she thrust her arms down, using the makeshift daggers. The tips sliced deep into his thighs.</p> <p>With a howl of pain, he shoved her away from his body. One of the daggers remained lodged, but the other glided free as she stumbled forward. Jane righted herself and whirled around, facing him. This giant was scowling, his fangs dripping with saliva. His red eyes glowed with menace.</p><p>\u201cI punish you,\u201d he snarled as he ripped the other dagger free. A flick of his wrist. The sharpened wood clanked on the ground, now useless.</p><p>Fight. \u201cWrong. I\u2019ll punish you.\u201d</p><p>That confused him for a moment. He blinked, brows knitting together. Then he shook his head. \u201cNo. I punish you.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Back to her original assessment. Calling these things dumb as rocks was an insult to the rocks. \u201cBring it, big boy.\u201d Six months of self-defense lessons were about to pay off.</p> <p>Or not. She\u2019d never had to use her \u201cskills\u201d in a genuine life-and-death situation.</p><p>He stomped toward her, booted feet kicking up dirt with every step, the ground shaking. Blood poured down his pant-covered legs, yet he didn\u2019t limp or even seem to notice his injuries.</p><p>When he was within reach, he tried to grab her. She ducked, and when his claws encountered only air, she twisted and stabbed. This time, her dagger sank into his middle. Another howl rent the air. Before she could dart out of the way this time, his fingers were fisting her hair and pushing her face-first into the dirt.</p><p>Seriously? Over that quickly? Oh, hell, no! She rolled into a ball before he could pin her with his massive weight, maneuvered to her back and worked her legs between their bodies. She pushed. He didn\u2019t budge an inch. Damn it!</p><p>Think, Parker. She still had one of the daggers. She stabbed again, going for his neck. He reared back. Too late. Contact, just not where she\u2019d hoped. His cheek split open, and blood poured.</p><p>He flashed his saber-fangs as he snarled.</p> <p>\u201cPunish.\u201d Then he was leaning down, those fangs sinking into her neck. This bite lacked the pleasure and heat of Nicolai\u2019s. This one provided only pain. So much pain.</p><p>He thought to drain and weaken her. A mistake on his part, she thought darkly, steeling herself against every ache and throb. He\u2019d left himself wide-open. Before her mind could fog from blood loss, she wilted into the ground. Either he assumed that she had been properly subdued or that she\u2019d passed out. His fingers left her hair to move to her breasts and squeeze.</p><p>She struck, finally slamming the dagger into his jugular, all the way to the other end. His entire body spasmed, his fangs locking down tight.</p><p>Okay, reassessment time. This was pain. She nearly screamed from the intensity of it.</p><p>There was no dislodging him, even when he sagged against her. His weight shoved the air from her lungs. She lay there, trying to catch her breath, his blood pouring over her.</p><p>For a moment, she was transported back to her car. Her mother dying, her blood dripping onto Jane. Both of them crying, because they knew the others were already gone. Unsavable.</p><p>I love you, Janie.</p><p>I love you, Mom.</p> <p>Something sharp dug into her scalp, ripping strands of her hair. Her body was pulled out from under the giant. His teeth had still been buried deep, and the movement caused his fangs to tear through skin and vein, leaving teeth tracks down her neck, chest and stomach.</p><p>Another scream fought its way from her throat. Still can\u2019t risk distracting Nicolai. His battle royale hadn\u2019t ended. Otherwise, he would have been here. And she knew it wasn\u2019t Nicolai who had grabbed her, even before bright, crimson eyes were glowing down at her. Nicolai would have been gentle, would have tried to soothe her.</p><p>\u201cWoman. Ugly. I will bed, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Peachy. Her eyesight fogged. Had this guy escaped Nicolai, or was he new? Even if she\u2019d had twenty-twenty vision just then, she doubted she would have been able to tell. One hideous monster was the same as any other, she supposed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a...princess,\u201d she said, trying anything to scare him. \u201cPrincess...Odette. Of Delfina. You have to...let me go.\u201d</p><p>Like the caveman he was, he continued to drag her through the dirt. Twigs and rocks scratched at her scabbed back, and she winced. Soon her robe was in tatters and tears burned her eyes.</p><p>She tried again, even as the fog migrated to her mind. \u201cMy mother...queen...will kill\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitch queen not my queen. No queen. Only king.\u201d He rounded a corner and the new angle hurt worse. \u201cHe have you.\u201d</p><p>Extra peachy. \u201cYou\u2019re taking me...to your king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter.\u201d</p><p>After. The same word she\u2019d once thrown at Nicolai, while he\u2019d been chained and helpless. Never again. After was now stricken from her vernacular. \u201cYou keep this up...and I\u2019ll be dead...before we get there.\u201d</p><p>A confused silence. Then a triumphant, \u201cYou not dead. You alive.\u201d</p><p>Box. Of. Rocks. \u201cPick me up...stupid shit. Carry me.\u201d</p><p>The simple order worked. He stopped, swooped down and hefted her up\u2014over his shoulder, fireman style, squashing her stomach into her kidneys, but hey, anything was better than leaving a trail of scabs and blood on the ground. A trail Nicolai didn\u2019t need. Wherever this brute took her, Nicolai would find her. He\u2019d marked her, he\u2019d said. And thank God he had.</p><p>She and her abductor ran into another giant along the way, and stopped. An angry conversation ensued. She caught words like king and now, and curses so dark her ears were probably bleeding. Just like the rest of her.</p><p>Didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out the problem. Word of a female\u2019s capture had already spread to the king. Ugh-O here was not to sample her goods. He was to bring her in and allow the king to decide her fate, as well as become the first to rape her.</p><p>Come on, Nicolai. Where are you?</p><p>Ugh-O leaped back into motion, the messenger remaining close to his side, not trusting him to obey. Or maybe not. Maybe she was the glue that held them together. A few times, the bastard reached out and patted her ass. This always angered the hell out of Ugh-O, and he would swat at the offending appendage, jarring her.</p><p>In fact, his footfalls were so heavy, she slammed up and down, losing her breath over and over again. By the time they reached a twisted maze of caverns, she was convinced her lungs were flat as pancakes, and her intestines were wrapped around her spine.</p><p>Even with her still-dimming eyesight, she watched for Nicolai, hoping to catch a glimpse of him shadowing the beast, ready to strike. While she did spy other beings following her captor\u2014little things with wings, darting through the air, and wolflike creatures skulking around the trees\u2014none of them were the vampire.</p><p>And when she heard a roar, pain-filled and broken, echoing in every direction, she wanted to vomit. That had been Nicolai\u2019s voice. What the hell were the giants doing to him?</p><p>Then the sound cut off abruptly, and she found the silence was even more disturbing than the roar. Had the giants just...killed\u2014 No! No, no, no. But what if...?</p><p>Oh, God. A sob caught in her throat. If he lived, he would have come for her.</p><p>She was his, he\u2019d said so. Many times. And somehow, he was hers. She barely knew the man but she felt something deep and inexorable for him.</p><p>Only minutes before, she\u2019d thought her heart and soul safe from his appeal, her mind too concerned with the danger to him. Now, as she was dragged to the unknown, death a possibility, when she thought him dead, the truth hit her.</p><p>Her heart and soul had never been safe.</p><p>Nicolai fascinated her. He was bossy and arrogant, yet protective when it mattered. He was a killer with a lover\u2019s hands. In his arms, she\u2019d come alive, had been utterly undone. He was already a part of her. In her blood, her head, her everything. So, no. No, no, no. He couldn\u2019t be dead. He just couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Whatever had been done to him, he would heal. He had to heal. His roar had probably cut off because he\u2019d passed out or something. Yes, that was it. And since he healed when he slept, that was a good thing.</p><p>Right?</p><p>The beast had to duck to enter one of the caverns, and she forced herself to concentrate. The hallways were narrow, suffocating. Footsteps echoed as he marched, creating a symphony of terror in her mind. She attempted to memorize the path he took, but it was difficult. So many turns, so dizzying. Alice\u2019s rabbit hole, she thought with a humorless laugh.</p><p>Finally they reached a spacious chamber bursting with more of those winged giants. Murmurs of approval abounded the moment she was spotted, and those approvals swiftly mutated into lusty catcalls. Growling, stiff with anger, Ugh-O tossed her atop a pallet in the center.</p><p>Jane scrambled to her feet. More waves of dizziness accompanied the action, and she swayed. When her vision cleared, she spun in a circle, studying her new surroundings. A throne of glittering crystal grew directly from the wall. That throne would have made a majestic sight, if not for the bare-chested maniac seated on top of it.</p><p>His nose was so far out of place, the left side rested against his cheek. One of his eyes was missing, and there was a hole in his bottom lip, as if one of his saber teeth had punched right through. His chest was a mass of scars, like slices of roast beef that had been glued together\u2014but the glue hadn\u2019t held.</p><p>At least twenty others stood beside him, guarding him. All eyes were on her, bright red lasers she couldn\u2019t escape. Sweat dripped between her breasts, even as her blood chilled. Not one of these creatures would aid her. They all wanted, and expected, a turn.</p><p>In fact, only two people in the room were uninterested in her presence. The only other females. Both were naked, old and wrinkled, unwashed, with straggly hair and dead eyes. They\u2019d been well used, multiple times, and were covered in bite marks and bruises. No wonder these guys were so hot for the repulsive \u201cOdette.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps behind her caused her to spin. More dizziness, intent on lingering. Only when it passed did she realize these were the men who had attacked Nicolai. They were bloody, limping, missing a few body parts and barely breathing, but they were here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my vampire?\u201d she screeched.</p><p>Ignoring her, they fell before their king. \u201cVampire disappear.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d disappeared. That meant he was alive. Thank God. Oh, thank God.</p> <p>\u201cNo fresh meat?\u201d the king asked, speaking up for the first time.</p><p>\u201cNo fresh meat.\u201d</p><p>A rumble of angry muttering sprung from the sovereign, and he waved his fingers toward the men. Four other giants stepped forward, palming swords and swinging before Jane could compute what was going on. Heads rolled, stopping at her feet.</p><p>She hunched over and finally vomited. No, not vomited. She dry heaved. There was nothing in her stomach. Laughter and applause abounded as the bodies were gathered up.</p><p>\u201cFresh meat now. Cook,\u201d the king said with a nod of approval. \u201cWe dine.\u201d</p> <p>They were going to eat their own kind. Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. She straightened, preparing to run.</p><p>Ugh-O settled a hard hand on her shoulder, ending her escape attempt before she\u2019d taken a single step. \u201cI found. I get.\u201d</p><p>The king lost his good humor and frowned. \u201cI give you my hag.\u201d He motioned toward one of the old women. The hag in question stepped forward automatically and bowed. \u201cNow give me yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want the fat one.\u201d</p><p>Hisses abounded.</p><p>Telling the king no was a crime, she supposed. \u201cFight,\u201d she suggested, her voice trembling as much as her body. \u201cFight over me. Winner gets me.\u201d Fingers crossed they killed each other.</p> <p>That dark frown leveled on her. \u201cFight, yes. After.\u201d He crooked his finger at her, expecting her to close the distance between them.</p><p>After. There was that word again. Gulping, she shook her head. Ugh-O squeezed her shoulder harder, harder still, and she winced.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d the king demanded, speaking more sharply now. He waved her over, and if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, next waved to his crotch. As if he expected her to jump on board right here, right now.</p><p>He probably did. She\u2019d heard the unspoken Or else, and rallied her wits. Come on. I can do this. \u201cTake me to your bedchamber.\u201d Never in her life had Jane attempted to seduce someone who repulsed her, and she mentally cringed at the huskiness of her tone. Better she fight this man alone than with all his people watching\u2014and able to join in. \u201cI\u2019ll do things you\u2019ve only dreamed about.\u201d If your dreams involve strangling on your own intestines.</p><p>\u201cJust want your mouth on cock.\u201d</p><p>I would rather die. \u201cAnd I want to put my mouth on your cock.\u201d Lightning, strike me down. Please. \u201cSo let\u2019s go to your bedchamber. Because, and here\u2019s the kicker, I do my best work in private.\u201d</p><p>He was on his feet in an instant, stalking toward her.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p> <p>NICOLAI\u2019S HEAD WAS a seething cauldron of thoughts, his body a tuning fork of emotion. One moment he\u2019d been fighting the giants, protecting Jane, the next he was shouting in pain, unable to control the turmoil in his mind. Faces, so many faces. Voices, so many voices.</p><p>Clutching at his ears, he fell to his knees. The jarring helped. The faces faded and the voices quieted, allowing rational thought to form. Had to...protect... Jane...again... But when he pried his eyelids apart, he saw that the giants were gone.</p><p>So was Jane.</p><p>He was no longer near the river, no longer in the forest. A barren wasteland surrounded him. What trees he saw were gnarled, their leaves withered. Ash floated in an acidic wind, black snow scented with death and destruction. And he smelled something...rotting.</p><p>He recognized nothing.</p><p>He turned, saw a snakelike vine slither from one of the trees, then another, both headed in his direction. They dove for him, bit at him and, when they tasted his blood, seemed to cackle with glee. When they dove a second time, he jumped out of the way\u2014and onto a pile of bones.</p><p>A need to slay the Blood Sorcerer, the new king of Elden, filled him, consumed him entirely. Was the bastard nearby? If so, this wasteland was Elden. Had to be. Elden. Elden. The word reverberated in his head. And just like that, the faces returned to his mind, forcing their way to the surface of a man somehow unprepared for them. Faces, blurring together, becoming one. A scene built.</p><p>A blonde woman crouched in front of him, studying his skinned knee with soft concern in her green eyes. He was a boy, just a boy, and as she chanted a spell and blew warm breath on his wound, peace and love infused him. The torn flesh knitted back together, blood no longer dripping from it.</p><p>When the healing process completed, she grinned over at him. \u201cSee? All better, yes?\u201d Such a sweet voice, tender and carefree. She brushed his frustrated, angry tears away with her knuckles. The tears had not formed because of any pain he felt, but because he\u2019d wanted, needed, to inflict more damage on his opponents. \u201cYou have to stop fighting, darling. Especially boys who are twice your age, and far bigger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I beat them.\u201d And he could have hurt them a lot worse!</p><p>\u201cI know, but the more you damage their pride, the more they will hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey cannot hate if they do not survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides that,\u201d his mother continued sternly, \u201cyou are in a position of power, and they are not. You must be a voice of reason, not a blast of violence.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms. \u201cThey deserved what I did to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what, exactly, did they do to deserve your claws in their necks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey hurt a girl. Pushed her around in a circle and tried to look up her skirt. They scared her so badly she cried. And then they touched her. In one of her private places. Here.\u201d He flattened a palm on his chest. \u201cAnd she screamed.\u201d</p><p>The woman sighed. \u201cAll right. They deserved your wrath. But, Nicolai, my love, there are other ways to punish those who do wrong. Permissible ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d He could think of no way other than what he\u2019d done. Like for like, hurt for hurt.</p><p>\u201cTell your father what they\u2019ve done, and he\u2019ll lock them away or banish them from the kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that they can do more harm elsewhere? Or one day seek revenge?\u201d he scoffed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if you are hurt while you are hurting them?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come to you. You are the most powerful witch in all the world.\u201d</p><p>Another sigh, some of her upset fading. \u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible. And your faith in me is very sweet, if somewhat misguided. Yes, I am powerful, but not as powerful as you will be one day. That\u2019s why I want you to be careful. One day, your temper might cause you to accidentally destroy more than a few lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Mother. I will try and be careful, but I can\u2019t promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, your honesty...\u201d She flashed a soft smile. \u201cOff you go. After you pay my spell casting fee.\u201d</p><p>He scrunched up his face, leaned forward and kissed the softness of her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m a prince. I shouldn\u2019t have to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a queen, so you\u2019ll always have to pay. Go on, now. Find your brother and study with him, my darling. No more running away from your tutors to avenge the world.\u201d</p><p>With a wave, he was darting off, away from her\u2014but not for the classroom. He had too much energy and needed to swim. Swimming always calmed him.</p><p>In the here and now, darkness swooped in, blanking Nicolai\u2019s mind. Another reprieve. He fell the rest of the way to the ground. One of the vines sliced his cheek, but he hardly noticed. He was remembering his past.</p><p>Why was he remembering? Why were the memories flooding him like this?</p><p>The healer who had bound his powers had not unbound them. Perhaps more of Nicolai\u2019s abilities had found their way free. That would also explain the split-second location switch. Perhaps those abilities had demolished the glass cage.</p><p>Except, a quick mental check proved the cage was still there, his abilities and memories still swirling inside it, faster and faster. However, now streaks of crimson were dripping from the top, eroding the glass. Crimson...blood?</p><p>The guards from Delfina? No. Days had passed, and he\u2019d had no reaction to what he\u2019d consumed at the palace. And while he had bitten the ogres, he hadn\u2019t swallowed their blood, unconsciously knowing it was poison to him.</p><p>The last person he\u2019d drunk from was Jane. He\u2019d gulped from her neck, her taste so decadent he\u2019d wanted to stay there forever. And maybe he would have. Maybe he would have drained her if the thought of losing her had not slammed through him. That, followed by the thought of sampling the heaven between her legs, had driven him to leave her neck and descend. And he\u2019d never been so glad to end a meal. Between her legs, she was sweeter than the nectar of honeysuckle.</p><p>He wanted to taste her there again. Wanted to at last sink inside her, possess her fully, become a part of her. Wanted her passion cries in his ears, her limbs all around him, clinging to him. Wanted her nails in his flesh, leaving her own mark.</p><p>Where was she? Had she\u2014?</p><p>Another memory grabbed hold of his attention, using so much force he could only grunt with the pain. Images, voices, blurring together, painting another scene.</p><p>\u201cTighten your hold, boy. You\u2019ll lose your sword in seconds with that puny of a grip.\u201d</p><p>He was still a boy, a little older now, standing in front of a tall, muscled man. Black-as-night hair, eyes of polished silver. He wore a fine silk shirt and leather trousers, his boots unscuffed and tied just under his knees. A man of wealth, no question. A man of authority and knowledge.</p><p>A warrior.</p><p>They stood in the center of a courtyard, lovely plants and flowers thriving all around them. The air was sweet, the ground beneath their feet a lush, springy emerald. Smooth marble walls enclosed the entire area, yet there was no ceiling, allowing morning sunlight to pour inside and reflect off the veins of gold. And just above them, balconies opened up from each of the royal bedrooms, welcoming spectators.</p><p>A young dark-haired boy was perched on the ledge of the balcony to Nicolai\u2019s right, watching while twirling a dagger. He wanted to puff up his chest and pound. He was about to be all kinds of impressive for his younger brother. He could toss with deadly accuracy, stab with lethal force and, when he concentrated, wield two swords at once. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNicolai,\u201d the man in front of him said, impatient. \u201cAre you paying attention to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Otherwise, I would have heard what you said, and you wouldn\u2019t be about to repeat yourself.\u201d</p><p>Dayn chuckled.</p> <p>Father was not amused, and did not reward Nicolai for his honesty. \u201cI have meetings to attend, son. Meetings in another kingdom, which means you will be in charge while I\u2019m gone. I need to know you can defend yourself and those you love. Pay attention. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d He focused on the happenings before him, weighing the metal in his hands. \u201cWhy must we practice over and over again? I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good, but you need to be great. Last time I managed to stab you in the back so badly you scarred!\u201d There was hard admonishment in his father\u2019s voice. \u201cYou must learn to work with all weapons, at all times of the day and night. You must work with one hand, both hands, standing, sitting and injured. Without becoming distracted.\u201d</p><p>Nicolai raised his chin. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just kill my opponents with my fangs and be done with it?\u201d He\u2019d done so before. Many times. Until his mother\u2019s prediction had come true, and he\u2019d destroyed an entire village simply to punish a man for beating his wife.</p><p>He\u2019d at last taken control of his emotions and hadn\u2019t lost his temper since. That didn\u2019t mean his fangs were useless, though.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if your fangs have been pried out of your mouth?\u201d his father demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo one would ever be foolish enough to remove my fangs. Mother says I\u2019m the most powerful vampire in the world. I can walk in the light, and I can steal power from anyone I choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she says you will be.\u201d His father\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cYou are a prince, Nicolai. The crown prince. Many in this world and the other will covet your direct line to my throne. Many will try and hurt you simply to hurt me. You must know how to defend yourself, always, for every situation.\u201d</p><p>Nicolai gave the sword another once-over. Long, thin and polished to a vibrant shine. He was not used to its heaviness, or the thickness of the hilt. \u201cVery well. I will train some more, but why are you not teaching Dayn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many questions.\u201d His father sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhy must he watch? He\u2019s a prince, too, you know.\u201d And so very eager to learn. Each day, after Nicolai\u2019s lessons, Dayn begged to be taught. Nicolai could never resist him.</p> <p>He loved his brother, and would die for him. A boy most in the palace feared. Dayn had an affinity with the animals that roamed the grounds, preferring to run with them rather than to walk alongside his own people.</p><p>Nicolai understood his brother\u2019s need. Sometimes he, too, felt animalistic in nature, most especially when his temper used to overtake him, shattering his control and leaving only a need to destroy, to hurt others.</p><p>\u201cHis time will come,\u201d the king said. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not the new princess, right? She\u2019ll always be too delicate.\u201d He sneered the last.</p><p>\u201cBreena is newly born, and she is not a blood drinker like you and Dayn. She is a witch like her mother. You and Dayn must always protect her. In turn, she will heal your people after battle as your mother used to do.\u201d</p><p>Shame had Nicolai looking down at his dirty boots. He was the reason his mother could no longer heal the wounds of others. He hadn\u2019t meant to, but he had stolen her ability. She hadn\u2019t blamed him, hadn\u2019t even yelled at him.</p><p>He would do anything to return the ability to her. Yet, he could not. Once taken, he could not give back. Ever. He\u2019d tried, over and over again. The only thing he could do, his mother had said, was learn how to control his newly discovered talent for absorbing the magic of others. And he had, remaining in his bedroom for weeks, reading, studying and practicing.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll be a great leader, like you?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI think you and your questions will be the death of me, boy.\u201d The king held out his own sword, touching the metal against Nicolai\u2019s. \u201cLet us begin.\u201d</p><p>Darkness.</p><p>Nicolai was panting now, sweating uncontrollably. Trembling. His hands ached. He looked at them. He must have clawed at his temples, trying to stop the pain from exploding through him, because his nail beds were bloody, his claws mere stumps.</p><p>His father had warned him.</p><p>His father. The king.</p><p>His name truly was Nicolai. Odette had not lied about that. She\u2019d known who and what he was. They all had. So highborn, Laila had liked to say, and now he knew why. He was a prince. A crown prince, and one day, a king.</p><p>A brother to Breena. His sister. His beautiful baby sister with her golden curls. She\u2019d grown into a lovely woman with a heart of fire, despite the fact that she was always protected, always guarded. Nicolai had snuck her out a few times, wanting her to have a taste of the freedom he took for granted. Where was she now?</p><p>Dayn, the brother closest to him, as dark and dangerous as the night, and just as beloved. Where was he?</p><p>His father, proud and strong. Honorable, determined. Unwilling to back away from any challenge. Where was he?</p><p>His mother, soft and gentle, so nurturing, even in the face of his most violent tempers. Where was she?</p><p>Micah, the youngest son, so full of life. Where was he?</p><p>Nicolai pulled himself into a crouch. Somehow, he had moved out of the forest. He was now in front of a lake. Not the lake he\u2019d shared with Jane. This water was thick and red. Every few seconds, a hissing, snapping, flesh-colored fish would fly from the surface, arch in the air, then dive back in.</p><p>The rocks around him were dagger sharp. A hundred yards away, in the center of all that crimson, was a castle. Dark mold clung to the walls, more of those slithering plants crawling in every direction. There was a walkway, a line of monsters patrolling it.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t noticed him, but they would. He was out in the open and needed to find shelter. Perhaps feed to strengthen himself. Then he needed to find Jane. She was out there, somewhere. If she was hurt...</p><p>She had better not be hurt. He must protect her at all cost. Yet, even as determined as he was, he only managed to crawl a few feet before the next memory hit him, welding him in place.</p><p>In this newest scene, he was a grown man, his dark hair shagging around his shoulders. He was bare chested and seated on a bank of rocks, much like the one he\u2019d just seen. Only, the rocks were smooth, the water clear. He\u2019d removed his boots before sitting down, and those were dry, waiting for him on the beach, but his pants were soaked through and caked in salt.</p><p>The moon was high, golden, the sky bright with scattered stars. They winked down at him, mocking him with their tranquility. His mind offered more chaos than he thought he could bear.</p><p>His father, King Aelfric, was sick.</p><p>The healers did not know if he would recover. Nicolai\u2019s mother, Queen Alvina, was frantic with worry. She\u2019d tried countless spells and incantations, yet nothing she\u2019d done had worked. Nicolai had tried countless spells, using the healing magic he\u2019d stolen from her. Not even that elicited favorable results. Alvina suspected foul play, but until she figured out what kind of magic had been used, her hands were as good as tied.</p><p>Nicolai loved his father, gruff though the king was. Besides that, he wasn\u2019t ready to take the throne. He wasn\u2019t sure if he would ever be ready. Becoming king would mean his father was dead, and he wanted his father to live forever.</p><p>And, to be honest, despite Nicolai\u2019s best efforts, despite a few years without a single episode, his temper sometimes got the better of him. When that happened, entire villages suffered. He was simply too volatile to rule an entire kingdom.</p><p>His father might be gruff, but he was fair. Fair, except when it came to Nicolai\u2019s marriage. Though his father had demanded, ranted, raved, Nicolai had refused to settle down. He wasn\u2019t ready to take a queen.</p><p>Being saddled with the same woman forever? That could become a hell as dark as the Abyss. He spent every night with a new female. Sometimes two new females. And once, three.</p><p>And all right, fine. Perhaps that lifestyle had grown tiresome. Perhaps the prize was never worthy of the chase. But some of his friends had married, and though a few were happy, the rest were miserable\u2014and there was nothing they could do to change their fate. Marriage was forever.</p><p>His father wanted him to wed a princess from a neighboring kingdom, but he had not found one that appealed to him. Giving such creatures his name, sharing his kingdom, would grate every hour of every day.</p><p>\u201cNicki,\u201d a young voice called. \u201cNicki!\u201d</p><p>Nicolai was on his feet a second later, hopping along the rocks and racing toward his youngest brother. The youngest prince was on the beach, beside Nicolai\u2019s boots, and unharmed. Relief speared him.</p><p>\u201cMicah, damn it. What are you doing out here? Until you\u2019re older, you\u2019re not supposed to be near the water on your own.\u201d</p><p>The little boy screwed up his lips, all determination and courage. \u201cI\u2019m not on my own! You\u2019re here.\u201d A mischievous glint in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d Just like that, Nicolai\u2019s anger deflated. As always, he could not stay angry with the scamp. Micah looked up to him, wanted to spend time with him, and Nicolai loved that. Loved him. Even though the boy had butchered his name while learning to speak, and his family sometimes still teased him with the nickname. \u201cO-lie.\u201d</p><p>At least he had later moved on to \u201cNicki.\u201d</p><p>The females who made their way to Nicolai\u2019s bed often called him by the shortened Nicki, as well, but that invited a familiarity he never seemed to feel toward them, and after a quick admonishment, they never did it again.</p><p>He was almost afraid something was wrong with him. He loved his family with his whole heart, but no one else could penetrate the barrier he\u2019d unwittingly constructed.</p><p>\u201cDid you come to swim?\u201d Micah asked when Nicolai reached him.</p><p>\u201cNo, to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d the boy asked eagerly. Golden hair gleamed in the moonlight. He smiled, two of his teeth missing. He was not a vampire, like Nicolai and Dayn, but he was powerful all the same. Though he had a warrior\u2019s heart, he took after their mother and sister in so many ways. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course you can.\u201d Nicolai sat and patted the sand.</p><p>Micah plopped down beside him. For several seconds, they breathed in the moist, salt-laden air, silent. Of course, Micah did not do this calmly. He shifted and he kicked out his legs, trying to get comfortable but never quite succeeding.</p><p>\u201cThinking makes me tired,\u201d Micah finally said. \u201cNot like playing.\u201d</p> <p>Nicolai bit back a smile. \u201cWhat do you want to play?\u201d</p><p>The image changed in a heartbeat, not giving way to a single moment of darkness. Nicolai was suddenly lying in the bed beside his father. Somehow, he knew a few days had passed since his night on the beach.</p><p>The king was recovering. Healers had drained him and Nicolai had fed him blood straight from his own vein. Every drop that he could spare, Nicolai had given\u2014and even some that he couldn\u2019t. Finally, success. The poison had been vanquished, and now, the two men were recovering together.</p><p>\u201cPick a female and marry her,\u201d his father said. \u201cIf not one of the princesses, someone. Anyone. Please, Nicolai. I nearly died. Might still, though I feel stronger every hour. Please. You need an anchor, like your mother is to me. Someone to pull you back from the madness. Please.\u201d</p><p>His father had never begged for anything. That he was now, over this...Nicolai did not have the heart to fight him any longer. He\u2019d been pushing himself to this conclusion, anyway.</p> <p>\u201cAs you wish, Father. It will be done. A princess from a neighboring kingdom, as you\u2019ve already approved.\u201d</p><p>Tides of relief permeated the room. \u201cThank you. Thank you, my son.\u201d</p><p>Darkness, there again. Indomitable.</p><p>Nicolai heard a female scream, jolting him.</p><p>This time, when he came back to himself, he was crouched on a flat rock in the middle of the crimson lake. Closer to the moss-covered castle. The monsters had scented him, and were peering over at him through beady eyes. Their tails swayed, ready to strike at him if he dared move any closer.</p><p>The moon was still high, the hooked edges bleeding into a sky covered in a thick film of ash, hiding all the stars.</p> <p>Those fiendish fish darted around him, teeth chomping at him, closer, closer. He was soaked with sweat, his heart a sledgehammer against his ribs, his muscles trembling. His mind, still lost. Aelfric. Alvina. Names.</p><p>Every member of his family now had a name.</p><p>Damn it, where were they? Did they still live? How long had he been away from them?</p><p>Quite a while, if this landscape was any indication.</p><p>He needed to search for them, but that scream...female... His female, he realized. Jane was screaming.</p><p>Jane!</p><p>His blood burned in his veins, singeing, leaving blisters. Those blisters caught fire, tiny infernos that swiftly spread. With a growl, he pushed to his feet. His boots slipped on the slimy rock, but he managed to maintain his balance.</p><p>The monsters tensed. He should challenge them. Wipe the castle stones with their entrails. Yes... His heartbeat slowed, becoming a sporadic fist in his chest. No, he decided next. He would have revenge, would find his family\u2014after. Jane needed him now.</p> <p>His gaze skated over the violated water, the crumbling cliffs farther ashore, the hideous castle straight from a nightmare. He\u2019d traveled here through his memories. Therefore, it stood to reason he could reach Jane through his memories, as well.</p><p>He closed his eyes, pictured her as he\u2019d last seen her. Underneath him. Her naked body splayed for his pleasure.</p><p>Her expression was soft and heated, her teeth nibbling on her lush bottom lip. Her eyes were at half-mast, the long length of her lashes casting shadows over her flushing cheeks. That long, glorious mane of honey-colored hair was spread around her, the ends curling.</p><p>Her breasts were small but firm, her nipples pink and beaded. He\u2019d kissed them, sucked them. Her stomach was flat, her navel a work of art. He\u2019d licked, down...down. Between her legs was the sweetest patch of honey-colored curls, shielding his new favorite place in this world or any other.</p><p>Her legs were long and lean, and they wrapped around him just right.</p><p>Nicolai, he thought he heard her whisper.</p><p>He would have liked her to call him Nicki. Anything that promoted familiarity between them. He wanted her tied to him, in every possible way, forever. A forever that Jane might refuse to give him. If he had proposed to a neighboring princess\u2014and he did not delude himself into thinking that princess was Odette, making his life simple\u2014someone was waiting for him.</p><p>They had not wed, though. Marriage was forever to his people, and his body would react to no one save his wife. But. Yes, but. He would have pledged his name, his life. Easy to dismiss when he\u2019d had no memory of agreeing to do so. Not so easy now, but that wouldn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>Nicolai did not want to be without Jane. He wouldn\u2019t be without her. He would find her and return to Elden. She would be his queen.</p><p>Elden. This decimated land truly was Elden.</p><p>The bloody lake was as much a part of his kingdom as the wasteland he\u2019d first appeared in. His kingdom. Not the Blood Sorcerer\u2019s. A man Nicolai had dreamed of destroying. Would destroy.</p><p>Sickness churned in his stomach, because he knew what that meant. The Blood Sorcerer had slain his parents. Aelfric and Alvina would never have allowed their lands to wither like this.</p><p>Nicolai ached with the need to return the favor.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about that now. Find Jane.</p><p>He opened his eyes, realized he had transported himself back to the wasteland. Those slithering vines were closing in... He squeezed his lids shut, imagined Jane, felt his body disintegrate, the ground disappearing from beneath his feet. When next he looked, the lush forest of Delfina surrounded him. However, he did not see the camp or Jane.</p><p>He breathed deeply, catching her scent. He kicked into motion, running faster and faster, cutting the distance between them as rapidly as possible. All the while, he continued to picture her, the trees around them, until he blinked and at last found himself in the camp she had constructed.</p><p>Unable to slow his momentum, he smacked into a thick trunk and stumbled backward, into the water.</p><p>Another scream reverberated in his head, this one louder and far more desperate. His fangs lengthened, slicing into his bottom lip. His hands curled into fists, but his claws, not yet healed, merely tickled his skin. The daggers Jane had made lay at his feet. He strapped as many as he could to his arms and legs.</p><p>He started forward, his stride determined. Her scent was stronger now...tinged with fear... Every step closer to her heated his blood with fury. She was marked, his, the path she\u2019d taken suddenly a beacon in the night.</p><p>Anyone who had touched her would suffer. It was time the entire kingdom of Delfina\u2014and all the kingdoms in this realm\u2014realized that truth. Even if that meant unleashing the deadliest force of his temper.</p><p>I\u2019m coming, little Jane.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>MOVING THE FESTIVITIES to the king\u2019s bedroom, Jane thought, had been smart. In theory. But she hadn\u2019t known all the variables, or \u201cmonkey wrenches\u201d as she\u2019d called them, while working in her lab, which very often proved to be fatal while experimenting. The biggest monkey wrench this time around? In the throne room, she would have performed on the king of the monsters, and the king alone, while everyone else watched and probably cheered. In the \u201cprivacy\u201d of his bedroom, he expected her to service him and friends. At the same time.</p><p>This was explained to her on the march down the hallway.</p><p>So, even though they\u2019d switched locations, and even though his personal guards had remained behind with the hags to keep them company, there were now four men waiting for Jane to kick things off.</p><p>Not that she planned to put on a performance. She would rather die. And she just might.</p><p>The moment the newest giants spotted her, their eyes began to glow that dark, eerie red. Their bodies tensed, getting ready for the pleasure they expected to receive. Like Nicolai, they wore loincloths. Those loincloths were now tented.</p><p>The king pushed her forward, and she spun to keep her eyes on him. Already he was stripping. Leather crisscrossed over his chest, creating X\u2019s\u2014so not a treasure map\u2014but a second later off came the crisscrosses, then the cloth. Daggers were strapped to his waist. Those he kept on. Dread and horror blended, rushing through her.</p><p>Okay, think, Parker. Think.</p><p>He pointed to the spot at his feet. \u201cOn knees. Use mouth on me. Hands on men. Orloft fuck you.\u201d</p><p>The guards licked their lips, every one of them. Okay. Okay. Options appeared and disappeared in an instant\u2014and all of them were disappointing. She could do as ordered, and bite the king so hard he wouldn\u2019t be using his penis on anyone for a long time. If ever. He\u2019d hit her and dislodge her teeth. A blow that would break her jaw, surely. After that, he\u2019d be able to shove whatever he wanted into her mouth and she wouldn\u2019t be able to stop him.</p><p>She could run. There was no door to stop her. In fact, the entryways and exits were open and airy. But as good as that was for her, that was also good for the men. Four here, plus twenty or so in the throne area. They would give chase. Nothing would block them, and she would be caught. They knew this cavern better than she did, after all. She\u2019d probably be gangbanged.</p><p>She could fight the king and his personal guards, here and now. They would win, no question, but she would have tried. And she might die before actual penetration, so that was a plus. If Nicolai was out there, this might give him time to find her.</p><p>He was out there.</p><p>All right, then. She had a plan of action. Next up, finding a weapon.</p><p>The cavern boasted no luxuries. There was a pallet in the far corner. In the other corner was a pile of bones. Bones. Okay. Not the greatest weapons of all time, but beggars couldn\u2019t be choosers. She could use one as a club.</p><p>\u201cWoman. Knees. Mouth. Pleasure. Now.\u201d</p><p>Jane tried the easiest approach: walking to the pile. Midway, the king jumped in her path. Very well. Easy way, out. She pretended to lunge left. He followed. She quickly switched and ran to his right. The four giants who\u2019d been watching and waiting moved directly in front of the pile and crossed their arms over their chests. Okay, so. Hard way, out, too.</p><p>There was only one thing left to do. She widened her stance and prepared for an attack. \u201cMy answer is no.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The king frowned, glanced at his men with splayed arms, all Women, so stupid, but what can we do? before again pointing at his feet. \u201cYou. Knees. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Moron. Some people drank at the fountain of knowledge. He must have gargled and spit. Then again, he might not have done even that. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you no.\u201d</p><p>He flashed his saber teeth at her. \u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI lied. You\u2019re ugly and mean and I wouldn\u2019t give myself to you even if a flesh-eating bacteria was ravaging this world, and your cock held the only immunization.\u201d</p><p>Confusion followed by relief bathed his monstrous features. \u201cCock. You. Yes.\u201d</p><p>Of course that\u2019s the only word he cared about. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed to tiny slits, and she would not have been surprised to find a red bull\u2019s-eye in the center of her forehead. \u201cI make you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought you\u2019d say.\u201d She lifted her chin and waved her fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re very predictable, after all. So, let\u2019s cut the chitchat and do this.\u201d</p> <p>Growling low in his throat, he advanced. He stretched out a hand to grab her, and she ducked, swung around and elbowed him in the stomach. He grunted, hunching over to gasp for air. The others laughed and snickered. Their merriment surprised her. She\u2019d expected fury.</p><p>The king straightened before she could render another blow, found her with his gaze and advanced. Again, she ducked and swung; again, she elbowed him. Again, he hunched over, breathless.</p><p>This time, the guards clapped. They must think this was foreplay.</p><p>She raced behind the king before he could gain his bearings and kicked. He stumbled forward. She jumped up and, as she came down, elbowed the top of his head. He went down, face-first. The success of her moves thrilled and strengthened her, pumping adrenaline through her system. One more blow to the king for good measure, and she\u2019d turn her attention to the guards.</p><p>Except, as she thrust out her leg to kick him in the stomach, he rolled and latched onto her ankle. With only a tug, he sent her crashing to her ass. Oxygen exploded from her lungs. Black and white winked before her eyes, little spiderwebs and starbursts.</p><p>Before she had time to act, the king swung out his meaty fist. Contact. Her poor cheekbone cracked. Skin split. Her brain rattled against her skull, and the black in her vision completely overpowered the white.</p> <p>Just like that, her advantage was lost. Not that she\u2019d ever really had one.</p><p>Crawl away. Curl into a protective ball. Something!</p><p>Too late. Another punch landed, this one on her jaw. For an endless span, pain and dizziness and nausea became her only companions. Then the spiderweb of black expanded, closing in. Don\u2019t you dare pass out!</p><p>Another punch.</p><p>So. Much. Pain. Okay, you can pass out now.</p><p>Of course, that\u2019s when the darkness thinned against another blast of adrenaline, sharpening her wits. Jane wanted to scream for help, but knew no one here would do anything to help her. Only hurt her further. Plus, physically, she couldn\u2019t scream. As she\u2019d feared, her jaw was broken.</p><p>Another punch.</p><p>More pain. No, pain wasn\u2019t an adequate word for what she experienced. Agony, perhaps, but even that seemed too tame a descriptor.</p> <p>Hard fingers wrapped around her biceps and shook her, causing the agony to radiate through the rest of her. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She blinked opened her eyes. Or eye. One of them was already sealed shut, the upper and lower lid glued together, concealing what felt like a golf ball. She lay on her back, and the king loomed over her. The moment he realized she was awake, he began ripping at her robe.</p><p>He liked to fight his conquests, then. Well, she would give him one to remember. She gritted her teeth against a new onslaught of suffering and kicked him in the face. The action was unexpected, and he stumbled backward before at last hitting the floor. Somehow, she managed to pull herself into a sitting position. The starbursts returned, pushing a moan out of her.</p><p>\u201cHold her,\u201d the king said with an evil grin. He rubbed at his erection. His bare erection. He\u2019d already removed his loincloth.</p><p>Eager to please\u2014as well as get their hands on her, she was sure\u2014the men jumped to obey. In a blink, she was flat on her back, her hands anchored over her head and her legs pinned and spread.</p><p>Just. Like. That.</p><p>In another blink, her breasts were being squeezed and her nipples pinched. And all four giants were staring between her thighs, waiting for her femininity to be revealed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she snapped, but the word was intelligible. \u201cNo!\u201d Was this what Nicolai had endured?</p><p>They laughed. The king fisted the tattered hem of her robe. The rest of the fabric ripped.</p><p>Beyond the cavern, a scream echoed. Her attackers paused, frowned, looked at one another. Another scream echoed, followed by another. And another. Each was pain-filled and panicked. Were the beasts fighting among themselves, perhaps over the hags, or had Nicolai arrived?</p><p>Hope bloomed within her.</p><p>The king shrugged, his attention returning to her body. She wore only her panties now, and they already were ripped in the crotch and therefore useless as far as barriers went. He licked his lips as he stroked his cock once, twice, preparing to penetrate her.</p><p>\u201cBig,\u201d he said, practically patting himself on the back. In this, he was right. His penis was thick, too thick, and as long as a battering ram. She would be torn apart.</p><p>Her hope withered, died. Tears blurred her good eye, and she whimpered, the sound as broken as her jaw. Any second now, and...</p><p>A snarl reverberated, deep and ominous. Closer now, so close.</p><p>Neither the guards nor the king looked away from her to check who had uttered the enraged warning. But suddenly Jane knew, sensed. Nicolai was here.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna die real bad,\u201d she said flatly. Again, her injuries made the words incomprehensible, but she didn\u2019t care. Saying them offered a small measure of satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cNever die.\u201d Still grinning, the king fell to his knees. The guards leaned closer, their hands inching up her arms and legs. Then, as the king guided his cock toward her, something swiped out faster than her eye could track. Blood sprayed. The king roared in pain and shock.</p><p>That same something\u2014a real dagger Nicolai must have stolen from the ogres\u2014swiped at the guards, hitting two at a time. More blood, more roars. The men fell away from her, and finally she was free. She lay there, panting, shaking. Then gentle arms were slipping under her and lifting her. She was carted to the pallet and laid down. Fingertips tenderly brushed her swollen cheek. Nicolai\u2019s face came into view. He was covered in blood, every part of him soaked with crimson.</p><p>Flames leaped and cracked within his eyes. \u201cRape?\u201d</p><p>She gave a slight shake of her head.</p><p>Those flames died, leaving something far worse: cold, merciless rage. Then he was gone.</p><p>He attacked the guards first, those who had maneuvered back to their feet, ripping their tracheas out with his teeth and spitting them to the floor. But that wasn\u2019t enough for him, and he used the dagger to remove their heads from their bodies. Bodies he piled in the entry, effectively locking the king inside the room with him.</p><p>The two men circled each other.</p><p>\u201cSuffer,\u201d Nicolai said, the length and sharpness of his fangs causing him to slur the words.</p><p>\u201cYes. You suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine. Mine! You will die for touching what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>The king blinked, his head tilting to the side. \u201cYou familiar. You vampire. You...prince?\u201d A gasp of horror accompanied the realization. \u201cYes. You prince. Dark prince. Majesty, I beg sorry. I thought you dead. We all thought you dead.\u201d</p><p>Nicolai, the slave, was a prince?</p><p>The king dropped to one knee, a show of submission. \u201cI give my sorries. So many sorries. Majesty. No offense. Take woman. She is yours.\u201d</p><p>Nothing Jane had done had humbled the king. Nothing had evoked fear in him. Now, at the thought of battling royalty, he was on his knees, pleading.</p><p>\u201cYou die,\u201d Nicolai said simply. The king never stood a chance. Her man removed his limbs, one by one. And though the king screamed and screamed and screamed, he didn\u2019t once struggle. As if he knew struggling would earn him an even worse fate.</p><p>Next to go, his eyes. After that, his groin. At that point, his screams became pleas for mercy. Mercy Nicolai did not have. Oops, there went the king\u2019s tongue. No more begging or screaming. Just whimpering.</p><p>\u201cNicolai,\u201d Jane finally managed, her voice so weak even she had trouble hearing what she\u2019d said. Fatigue was riding her hard, and she knew she wouldn\u2019t be awake much longer.</p><p>Nicolai glanced at her, barely able to catch his breath. The need to hurt clung to him like a second skin, visible to all. Never had she seen a more primitive male, wild and uncontrollable, a Pict warrior straight from battle. A sight most people would only ever see in their nightmares.</p><p>\u201cNeed you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He swung back to the dying king. With a quick flick of his wrist, he removed the man\u2019s head, just as he\u2019d done to the others. Then he was poised over Jane, stroking her gently. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, sweetheart. So sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill be...fine. Been...worse. Just need...you.\u201d</p><p>The words were meant to comfort him. They failed. Absolute anguish cloaked his features. He wiped his arm on a nearby cloth, bit into his own wrist and held the bleeding wound to her mouth. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>While Nicolai chanted words she did not understand, the warm liquid cascaded down her throat. At first, she experienced the most delicious tingling, starting in her stomach and moving through her veins. To her jaw, her arms, her legs. The tingling soon sharpened, heated, and she felt as if little molten daggers were slicing through her.</p><p>What the hell was his blood doing to her?</p><p>\u201cNicolai,\u201d she screeched. \u201cHurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re healing, sweetheart. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. The hurt is good.\u201d</p><p>Even as he spoke, her jaw snapped back into place. She screamed, the shrill sound echoing off the cave walls. The lid of her swollen eye split apart, and she groaned. At first, her vision was hazy, as if her corneas had been smeared with Vaseline, but as the heat and the daggers continued to work through her, Windex was sprayed and she could see again. Perfectly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the healing process was complete, she lay there, still panting, sweating and trembling, but a woman reborn. She stretched her jaw, and while there was a lingering ache, she could move it unfettered.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, tears of relief filling her eyes.</p><p>Nicolai sprawled beside her and gathered her in his arms. He held her for a long while before the dam inside her broke and she sobbed against his chest, clutching him tightly to her. All of her book smarts, and she\u2019d been helpless.</p> <p>\u201cI killed them, sweetheart. I killed them all. They\u2019ll never hurt you again. This I swear to you.\u201d</p><p>The evil of the king stunned her. The complete disregard for her will, the violence he had unleashed... Oh, she\u2019d known there were people capable of such dark deeds, but never before had those deeds been brought to her door. It was frightening and heartbreaking to have seen the evidence firsthand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way. Let it out. I\u2019ve got you,\u201d he said soothingly.</p><p>\u201cI was so scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever again. Never again,\u201d he vowed. \u201cUnless...were you afraid of me?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGood, that\u2019s good. I would never hurt you. Even lost in a temper, I couldn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Soon her tears dried. The physical damage, as well as the pain of the healing, had taken their toll, and she sagged against him, sighing and shuddering. \u201cWhat were you chanting when you gave me your blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore of my vampire magic. I cast a healing spell to aid the powers of my blood.\u201d</p><p>She sniffled, her nose stuffy. \u201cIt was better than Vicodin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicodin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA painkiller from my world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA killer of pain. Did you love him?\u201d The words were growled.</p><p>A burst of unexpected humor gave her strength. \u201cNo. In fact, he was hard to shake. He, uh, stalked me, that kind of thing. I had to pretend he didn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>Nicolai kissed her temple and relaxed against her. \u201cShall I hunt and destroy him for you, sweetheart? It would be my pleasure, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have enough enemies. Besides, I destroyed him a while back.\u201d</p><p>Another kiss. \u201cBecause you are strong.\u201d</p><p>Lovely praise, but she was completely undeserving of it and couldn\u2019t pretend otherwise. \u201cI wasn\u2019t strong enough to save myself today.\u201d The tears returned. She brushed them away with a shaky hand. \u201cI took self-defense lessons for a while, but they didn\u2019t help. Not really. He would have...he was going to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever again,\u201d Nicolai repeated, tightening his hold. \u201cI will train you further. And when I\u2019m done with you, not even I will be able to defeat you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Your safety is a personal mission of mine. A mission I will not fail.\u201d</p><p>Maybe the turmoil of the day had made her emotional, but she got teary eyed all over again. That was the sweetest thing a guy had ever said to her. Even better than what he\u2019d said to Laila. \u201cEnough about me. I was afraid the giants had killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt even death would have kept me away from you.\u201d</p><p>Okay. She was wrong. That was the sweetest. She kissed the pulse at the base of his neck. \u201cWhat\u2014what were those things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOgres.\u201d</p><p>A yawn snuck up on her, her eyelids dipping heavily. \u201cThe king seemed to know you.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>And he didn\u2019t want to discuss it. She changed the subject, suddenly too tired to reason out why or press for answers. \u201cYou found me because you\u2019d marked me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said again. He traced his fingertips along her spine. \u201cAnd I have never been gladder for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you marked other women?\u201d Oh, God. She shouldn\u2019t have asked. She wasn\u2019t ready for the answer. Not here, not like this. Not after what had happened. He clearly did not have to be wed or engaged to mark a woman, so there could be a thousand out there. She should have....</p><p>\u201cNot to my knowledge,\u201d he said cautiously.</p><p>She sighed with relief. She would be willing to bet \u201cmarking\u201d was more than a memory, that marking was an instinct, biology at its finest, a knowledge that went bone-deep. After all, dogs did it. Of course, they peed on what they wanted, leaving their scent behind. And they didn\u2019t need to remember doing it; they simply needed to smell and catch a hint of the desired aroma.</p><p>Nicolai had not honed in on any other woman. As easily as he\u2019d found Jane, he would have found any others, without difficulty. If they were out there. So, logically, she had to believe she was the only one.</p><p>Yes, logically. He was free.</p><p>Maybe you\u2019re the one who\u2019s as dumb as a box of rocks. A good scientist studies both sides of the coin. Fine. She\u2019d argue in favor of the other side. Nicolai could very well be engaged, as he\u2019d feared, as she\u2019d tried to deny. And maybe he hadn\u2019t marked the woman yet, wanting to wait for the actual ceremony to complete the connection.</p><p>Or, like the ogres, he could have had a harem of women. Perhaps one woman had not satisfied him for long, so he\u2019d plowed through them like he had a cold and they were tissues. Perhaps there\u2019d been too many to mark. Or perhaps he\u2019d simply never cared enough to do it.</p><p>That certainly fit the image of a pampered prince. Was he a prince, though? Had he been pampered? A man given everything he wanted, never really satisfied?</p><p>Sometimes she hated her brain. And coin flipping.</p><p>The man she knew was volatile and possessive. He didn\u2019t play nice with others, and he didn\u2019t know how to share. Yet he was as far from pampered as a man could be. And he\u2019s mine, she thought, burrowing her head deeper into the hard line of his body. His strong, warm body.</p><p>He knew her, and wasn\u2019t bothered by her verbal and mental tangents. He\u2019d cared enough about her to come back for her\u2014twice\u2014saving her life. That had to count for something.</p><p>\u201cStop thinking and sleep, Jane,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Nothing would happen to her while they were together. She knew it. He would guard her with his life. \u201cHold me and don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he vowed.</p><p>Oh, yes. He cared. She drifted off to sleep with a smile.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>WHEN JANE AWOKE, SHE was still in the cave. She wasn\u2019t sure how much time had passed. All she knew was that she\u2019d never felt so rested. She stretched like a contented kitten, warm despite her nakedness, her muscles liquid, and gazed around.</p><p>Startled by what she saw, she sat up. Enough time had passed for Nicolai to clean every speck of blood from the floor and walls. He\u2019d also removed the bodies and subsequent body parts. If not for the lingering taint of evil, this could have been some kind of underground resort.</p><p>There was no reason for Nicolai to have done such a thing. They weren\u2019t going to live here. Weren\u2019t even going to spend the day. Unless he\u2019d hoped to spare her any upset. Her eyes widened. That was exactly why he\u2019d done it, she realized. The sweet, darling man.</p><p>Hello again, emotional roller coaster. She sniffled, her chin trembling.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, sweetheart. Please don\u2019t cry.\u201d He was perched beside her, looking away from her, and holding out a bundle of wrinkled material. And God, his profile was gorgeous. Still streaked with blood, though some had been washed away, his cheeks were sharp, his lips lush and his expression relaxed. No ill effects from the fighting. \u201cIt kills me inside.\u201d</p><p>After everything he\u2019d done for her, she would do anything he asked. Besides, despite his relaxed expression, lines of tension branched from his eyes, as if permanently etched there. Something more was bothering him, and she wouldn\u2019t add to his troubles.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d She used the hem of the offered fabric to clean her face.</p><p>The corners of his mouth twitched, his inner worries momentarily forgotten. What did he find so humorous? \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now. Will you dress for me?\u201d A question layered with apprehension.</p><p>She thought she knew why. Her nakedness aroused him\u2014or at least, she hoped it did\u2014but he didn\u2019t want to do anything about it. Not after what had happened here. She was grateful.</p><p>She knew the old adage \u201creplace the bad with the good.\u201d She also knew there was nothing better than Nicolai\u2019s touch. He could play her like a piano, stroking all the right keys and creating a symphony. But she didn\u2019t want their first time to spring from any need but the one to be together.</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>Dress. Right. \u201cWith what?\u201d Her robe was ruined beyond repair.</p><p>\u201cYour tissue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She chewed on her bottom lip as she studied the \u201ctissue.\u201d A faded yellow cotton robe, clean, and free of rips. Perfect. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p><p>He motioned behind him with a tilt of his head. \u201cThe only other females here were so grateful to be free of their ogre masters, they stayed long enough to help me clean this room and offered you all of their possessions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was thoughtful of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey also offered me the use of their bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will wipe the floor with their blood!\u201d She jerked the robe over her head.</p><p>When Nicolai came back into view, she saw that he was grinning. That grin...decadent and shameless. Her blood heated. Blood that belonged to him, had once been a part of him.</p><p>\u201cI sent them on their way,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout accepting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I care what you do,\u201d she groused. This conversation, on the heels of her harem worries, brought out the fires of her temper.</p><p>That wiped away his amusement completely. \u201cYou had better care.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. Honesty was needed if they were going to have any kind of relationship. And she wanted a relationship with him, however long they had left together. A day, a week, a month? Or would she remain here forever?</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t worry about that now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said on a sigh. \u201cI care.\u201d Her stomach growled from hunger, and in the quiet of the cave, the sound echoed loudly. She blushed. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I can say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...don\u2019t want you to be hurt if I leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t leave. Now, come.\u201d He stood and waved his fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll feed you.\u201d</p><p>He cared! And how could he be so certain she would remain? \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d she asked, accepting his aid with a tender smile. A smile that quickly fled. Her bones creaked and ached as she straightened.</p><p>\u201cClose to midnight.\u201d</p><p>Back home, she would have been in her bed right now, tossing and turning and dreading the coming morning.</p><p>They made their way back to the river. Limping at first, but muscles relaxing with the exercise, she gathered mint leaves and twigs, and they brushed their teeth as they walked. Afterward, Nicolai foraged for fruits and nuts to tide her over. As she nibbled, she kind of expected creatures from childhood storybooks to jump out and grab her, or Laila to scream a curse and appear, but no. The thirty-minute journey was incident free.</p> <p>Nicolai stepped into the water, dipped all the way in, came up wet and sputtering and motioned for her to do the same. \u201cBathe, and I\u2019ll gather the fish you scare away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, ha. Shows what you know. Fish adore me. Don\u2019t be surprised if they dance at my feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to make me kill the fish in a jealous rage so you can have more to eat?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d More than gorgeous, he was sexy. Amused, playful, all that wet dark hair plastered to his scalp and dripping down his face, crystalline droplets scorching a path down his mouthwatering pectorals, the ropes of his stomach\u2014and, sweet heaven, there were a lot of ropes\u2014and finally catching in the waist of his loincloth.</p><p>Without the taint of the cave, there was nothing to dilute her need. Jane hungered for her man more than anything else.</p><p>You\u2019ve gotta clean up if you want to get dirty with him.</p> <p>\u201cPrepare to be awed,\u201d he said, giving her his back.</p><p>I already am. She removed her new robe and jumped into the water\u2014such cool, refreshing water\u2014before he could turn and see her beaded nipples. She scrubbed up until her skin tingled. Well, tingled from more than desire.</p><p>All the while, she snuck secret glances at Nicolai. He caught several fish and tossed them ashore. As time ticked by, he became more and more apprehensive, his motions clipped. And he was utterly oblivious to her stare. Not once did he glance back at her.</p><p>Moonlight spotlighted him, golden and magical. He was so strong, so capable. She chewed her bottom lip as she treaded water. The water might be cool, but the liquid between her legs was warm.</p><p>Perhaps she should have been scared or experienced post-traumatic stress symptoms. Flashbacks at the very least. After all, she\u2019d nearly been raped and had been beaten. But this was Nicolai. Her protector. Not even bad memories would dare attack her while he was nearby.</p><p>\u201cNicolai,\u201d she said, a husky note in her voice. She hadn\u2019t meant to call him, but his name had emerged unbidden, unstoppable.</p><p>Finally he turned to her. Her breath caught. His eyes were brighter than she\u2019d ever seen them, the gold flecks out to play, mingling seductively with the silver. His cheeks were flushed, his fangs long and sharp.</p><p>\u201cAwed yet?\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Oh, yes. Was that why he was so distressed and distant? She hadn\u2019t properly praised his skills? \u201cYou\u2019re the best fisherman I\u2019ve ever met. Granted, you\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve ever met, but...\u201d</p><p>No hint of a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll feed you,\u201d he said, adding darkly, \u201cAfter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smell your desire for me, little Jane, and I gave you time to grow used to the idea of being with me. Time is up. Come here.\u201d He crooked his finger. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>After wasn\u2019t such a bad word anymore. \u201cAbout time.\u201d She didn\u2019t hesitate. She swam the distance, the water caressing her skin. When she was only a whisper away, she let her feet drop to the bottom and stood. The waterline reached just under her breasts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have you,\u201d he said fiercely.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Please.</p><p>He stepped closer. Every time they inhaled, their chests rubbed together, creating the most dizzying friction.</p><p>\u201cNothing will stop me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot even thoughts of another woman waiting for you?\u201d She hated herself the moment the words left her, but she was still glad they had. Another woman was the reason he had resisted her before.</p><p>Shadows couched his features, turning him into the warrior of the night before. \u201cThere...is. A woman. Most likely.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. \u201cWho?\u201d A plug was lifted, and the desire drained from her, leaving her cold, hollow. \u201cDo you...did you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My father arranged the marriage. I do not remember my intended\u2019s face or her name, or even my proposal. I know only that I promised my father I would wed her.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t you dare cry. At least his heart did not belong to someone else. That should help.</p><p>That didn\u2019t help. She wanted all of him. For herself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re remembering?\u201d she croaked.</p><p>\u201cNot everything, only bits and pieces at a time. I tell you this, not to upset you, Jane, but to warn you. No matter what happens, I\u2019m keeping you. You are mine. That will not change.\u201d</p><p>No matter what happens\u2014as in, if he had to marry another woman. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The possibility of his involvement with another had been so easy to dismiss before. And she could very easily dismiss it now, when it was a reality. If he had decided to end the engagement.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be the other woman. She wouldn\u2019t! She had too much pride. Didn\u2019t she? Oh, God. The fact that she\u2019d even asked meant she already wanted to consider the option.</p><p>No. No, no, no. Her parents had loved each other, respected each other, and that\u2019s what she wanted for herself. A deep, abiding love that placed her first. She didn\u2019t want to spend her nights wondering if her man was in bed with his wife, giving her pleasure and babies. She didn\u2019t want to find herself regulated to the fringes of his life. She didn\u2019t want to be the one everyone blamed for their troubles.</p><p>She deserved better.</p><p>When she returned home and thought back on her time here\u2014she knew she couldn\u2019t stay now, because somehow, some way, she would find a path home\u2014this was the night that would haunt her. Not those pain-filled hours with the ogres. Not even the humiliation of her whipping. This hurt the most.</p><p>She backed away from him. Not allowing the retreat, he reached out and gripped her shoulders, tugging her back to him. Closer this time, until not even a whisper separated them. They were flush against each other, his erection smashed against her belly.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you\u2019re a mind reader as well as an engaged man?\u201d She threw the words like weapons, needing to lash out even in the smallest way.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I know you. You are not leaving me.\u201d The command didn\u2019t come from the tender savior who had held her while she\u2019d slept, but from the dangerous predator who had removed a man\u2019s limbs just to hear him scream. \u201cI told you these things, not to worry you, but to reassure you. Betrothals can be broken. And mine will be. I will have you, and no other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d Was that a declaration? A proposal? Her emotions ran the gamut, and her mind didn\u2019t know whether to release the despair and accept the sudden tide of joy, or wallow in both. \u201cI know you said I wouldn\u2019t, but what if I do, in fact, leave your world? You would...\u201d Die. She shouldn\u2019t know that, couldn\u2019t yet admit that she did, but then, he hadn\u2019t asked her to forever mate with him, had he?</p><p>If he did, mating could very well tie her to this world forever. Her eyes widened. Was that how he knew she would stay?</p><p>\u201cYou will not leave,\u201d he said. \u201cI will make sure of it, whatever I have to do. Now, we finish this, Jane. Here. Now.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her reply, but swooped down, thrusting his tongue deep inside her mouth. Joy won.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help herself. She welcomed him. He still tasted of mint, warm, wet mint, and she couldn\u2019t get enough. And when he tilted her head, taking more, sampling deeper, her nerve endings erupted with sensation. This was what a kiss was meant to be, a possession, a claiming. An awakening of every sense.</p><p>Her hands wound around his neck, her fingers sinking into his hair. Later. She\u2019d ask him what he\u2019d meant by \u201cwhatever I have to do\u201d later. Right now, she had the most important fact. He wasn\u2019t pledging himself to someone else. Here, now, she would enjoy him.</p><p>They stood like that, kissing and rubbing against each other forever. And every second of that forever ramped up her desire, until she was trembling, needy, aching with a fever only he could assuage.</p><p>\u201cWrap your legs around me,\u201d he commanded harshly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Even the thought left her reeling. She jumped up and did as commanded, expecting him to possess her in the next instant. He didn\u2019t enter her, though. No, he carried her to the shore, his hard length sliding against her. She moaned as he laid her down and stretched out on top of her. Still he didn\u2019t enter her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d He placed his hands beside her temples, removed his loincloth and anchored his weight.</p><p>\u201cSo lovely, my female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it. Prove that I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>His lips peeled back from his fangs. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done, you might regret such a request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises.\u201d</p><p>Once again, he defied her expectations. He didn\u2019t go in for the kill, didn\u2019t deliver instant relief to her raging desires. Instead, he spent the next few minutes kneading her breasts and laving her nipples, his fingers tracing erotic patterns on her stomach, but he never quite reached where she needed him most. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he began kissing the same white-hot path his fingers had taken, her legs fell open, a silent plea for contact.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give it to her.</p><p>He licked her inner thighs, between her damp lips, even speared her core with his tongue, sinking inside for the briefest of seconds, teasing her with what could be, but he was always careful to bypass her clit.</p> <p>She needed to come, damn it.</p><p>\u201cNicolai. Stop teasing.\u201d</p><p>Warm breath trekked over her. \u201cWho do you belong to, Jane?\u201d</p><p>Well, well. Now she knew his game. Work her over, tease her with what he could give her, until she gave him what he wanted\u2014what she\u2019d demanded of him. Ownership.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He rested his chin on her pubic bone. His lashes lifted, and his gaze met hers. Tension strained his features. He wanted to come as badly as she did. \u201cYes?\u201d he said.</p><p>Who would break first? \u201cMy turn.\u201d</p><p>She flattened her feet on his shoulders and pushed. A second later, he was the one flat on his back and she was looming over him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Jane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving my turn.\u201d She laved her tongue over his nipples, loving how they speared her tongue. \u201cIf I do anything you don\u2019t like, just say stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll like.\u201d His hands tangled in her hair. His claws must have regrown, because she could feel them biting into her scalp, and she loved it. \u201cAnything you do, I\u2019ll like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, then, let\u2019s see what you like most.\u201d She licked her way to his navel and dipped inside. His muscles quivered with anticipation. Her breasts cradled his erection, and she rubbed up and down, up and down, fueling his passion. Soon the tip of him grew moist, allowing a smoother glide.</p><p>She wanted him out of control. Mindless. Desperate. Exactly as she was when she was with him. She may not have very much experience, but she wouldn\u2019t let that stop or intimidate her, she decided. She would learn his body, his every secret desire.</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cYes, Nicolai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need... I want...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe to taste you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, gods, Jane.\u201d His voice was a croak. \u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p><p>She crouched between his legs and peered down at his cock. He was so long, so thick and hard. Down, down she leaned...but she didn\u2019t gobble up that delicious length. Not yet. She lavished attention on his testicles, teasing him as he had teased her, until his hips were lifting in supplication.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cWho do you belong to?\u201d she asked as he\u2019d asked her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even try to hold out. \u201cYou. Jane.\u201d</p><p>The admission affected her as strongly as a caress, and she shivered. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you so happy you said that.\u201d She fit her lips around the head of his penis. His flavor hit her taste buds, and she groaned in eagerness. More, she wanted more. She slid her mouth all the way down, until he reached the back of her throat.</p><p>A hoarse cry left him. Up she glided, lightly scraping him with her teeth. Another cry. She hovered there, unmoving, tormenting. Waiting.</p><p>\u201cJane, I like this most.\u201d</p><p>Down she slid; up she glided, repeating the process over and over, slowly at first, then increasing her speed. Soon he could no longer speak, could only moan and groan as she had. Having him like this, at her mercy, his desire for her consuming him, directing all of his thoughts and actions, was a powerful aphrodisiac to her.</p><p>Just as his testicles tightened, signaling the start of his climax, she stilled, clamping her lips on the base of his cock, preventing him from going further. A little trick she\u2019d read about but never tried. His roar of need blasted through the forest.</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d he panted. \u201cJane, please.\u201d</p><p>He was trembling, moist with perspiration, but he didn\u2019t come. And when the danger passed, she crawled up his body, trembling just as violently. His fangs were so long they\u2019d cut into his lip, leaving trails of blood down his chin.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me.\u201d Her blood was molten in her veins, causing sweat to bead on her brow. \u201cNeed to be inside you, but not yet, not yet.\u201d His hands returned to her hair, his fingers pulling at the strands. \u201cMust control urge to bite you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t control the urge.\u201d She leaned down and flicked her tongue against one of his fangs, quickly cutting the soft tissue. \u201cGive in to it. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He groaned as if in pain. \u201cDelicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>The world suddenly spun. He\u2019d tossed her on her back, and was looming over her. \u201cMore,\u201d he slurred, his gaze locked on her hammering pulse. \u201cNo, can\u2019t. Not yet, not yet,\u201d he repeated. \u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Why not yet? Maybe she was greedy. Maybe she was selfish. She wanted now, now, now.</p><p>He chuckled, a broken sound. \u201cNo. Baby. I could give you a baby. Do you want a baby?\u201d</p><p>Understanding dawned. Sadness and fear suddenly swamped her, dulling some of her desire. \u201cI can\u2019t have children.\u201d Would he think less of her? No longer want her?</p><p>The woman his father had picked could probably have children.</p><p>Oh, ouch.</p><p>Jane had thought she\u2019d come to terms with her lack. But now...the thought of starting a family with Nicolai... She wanted that, she realized. Not now, but later. When they were safe. To be with him, to have his child growing inside her... She would never know that joy.</p><p>The lack was another reason she\u2019d dumped Spencer when she had. Once, they\u2019d talked about getting married and starting a family, and she\u2019d known how badly he had wanted that. With her, he would never have it. So she\u2019d let him go, knowing he would thank her one day, when he was wed to another woman, his kids running around and laughing in their home.</p><p>\u201cAfter the accident, my body is ruined,\u201d she said, pushing the words past the lump in her throat. \u201cSo, you don\u2019t have to worry about getting me pregnant. Ever. And if you want to stop and never take this thing between us any further, I\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>He peered down at her, a dark warrior whose ire had been pricked. \u201cJane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you no matter what. Need you. Never think otherwise.\u201d With that, he gripped her thighs, spread them and surged up, hitting her deep inside with that one powerful thrust.</p><p>She forgot her sadness as instant, necessary, all-consuming desire flooded her. He was so big he stretched her; she was so wet, her once-neglected body gave him only minimal resistance.</p><p>\u201cNicolai!\u201d His name, oh, how she loved his name.</p><p>\u201cI like this, too,\u201d he said. In and out he moved. \u201cChanged my mind. Like this most.\u201d</p><p>Her mind clouded, her nerve endings razed to the point of pleasure-pain, and she screamed. She\u2019d been so turned on, the slightest stroke would have sent her shooting off to the stars. But this...sweet heaven, this.</p><p>Oh, God, it was so good, and she was so lost, she never wanted to be found, wanted this forever... Nicolai, Nicolai, hers, always hers. She was babbling to herself, and she knew it, couldn\u2019t control it. Didn\u2019t want to control it. Just wanted more. Of him, of this.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t bite, must bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite. Please. I\u2019m yours, Nicolai. I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>He growled, and then his fangs were in her neck and she was climaxing, squeezing at him, clutching at him. Taking everything he had to give and demanding more. And he gave it to her.</p><p>He rode the waves of her satisfaction, thrusting inside her with a fervor that left her breathless. He was all around her, a part of her, the sole light in her world. Drinking, drinking, oh, yes, drinking. Soon she became dizzy, and little doubts peeked from the shadows of her mind, as if they\u2019d been hiding all along, waiting for her defenses to crumble.</p><p>Maybe his words\u2014want you no matter what, need you\u2014were preorgasm talk, meant to lure her into bed and keep her from running. Maybe the cloud of desire had been leading him all along. Maybe he would later change his mind about wanting her.</p><p>Maybe, when this was over, he would let her go.</p><p>No. She fought back. No. This wasn\u2019t temporary. He wouldn\u2019t discard her. Even if he learned the truth about some of the things she\u2019d done to his kind?</p><p>Cold, hard reality. Again, she fought back. Nothing would destroy this moment, not even that. Here, pleasure mattered. Only pleasure.</p><p>He hooked one of his arms under her knee and lifted, opening her wider, increasing the depths he reached. Instantly her body prepared for yet another climax, needing it just as desperately as the others, as if sex with him was a prerequisite for her survival. She should fear that. She needed him too intently, was no longer complete without him.</p><p>Hell, if she left, would she be the one to wither? Had she mated him and just didn\u2019t know it? What did she know about the road to mating? Nothing really.</p><p>Nicolai took hold of her other leg and lifted, surging impossibly deeper, and she forgot even that. There was no part of her left untouched. She was Nicolai\u2019s woman, plain and simple, branded by him, a part of him. After this, she would never be the same, didn\u2019t want to be the same.</p><p>She sank her nails into his scalp and forced his head up. His teeth slid from her vein. \u201cNicolai...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He eyed her, blood dripping from the corner of his mouth. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean... Did I take too much?\u201d Agony wafted.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He could have it all, every last drop. \u201cKiss me,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He met her halfway. Their lips pressed together, their tongues dueled. His flavor filled her, and this time it was mixed with hers. Together, every part of them together...intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYours.\u201d</p><p>Forever, she didn\u2019t let herself add, but, oh, did she want to. Later, they would talk. Yes, the dreaded conversation about feeling and intentions. About the future.</p><p>The kiss continued, spinning out of control, their teeth scraping together, as he slipped and slid within her. He released one of her legs to move his hand between their bodies, and pressed his thumb against her clitoris. Just like that, she exploded again, spasming around him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hissed out a breath, pushed deep once more, and came, every muscle he possessed clenching and unclenching. She\u2019d never made love without a condom, and loved the feel of him jetting inside her.</p><p>When he stilled, she wrapped herself around him, holding him as close as possible. He collapsed on top of her, but quickly rolled to relieve the pressure of his muscled weight. They were both sweat soaked and feverish, trembling.</p><p>\u201cMy Jane,\u201d he said, so much satisfaction in his voice she couldn\u2019t fear the upcoming discussion.</p> <p>She kissed his shoulder. \u201cMy Nicolai.\u201d</p><p>Forever.</p><p>She hoped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave...need to talk,\u201d she breathed, just before drifting off to sleep.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p> <p>PANTING, SWEATING, SATED in the most perfect way, Nicolai snuggled Jane in to his side. Her blood flowed through his veins like champagne, bubbling and fizzing, claiming every thought and beating back a painful realization he wasn\u2019t quite ready to face. He wanted to close his eyes and savor, but he had a few things to work out in his mind first.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted to talk. About what? If she thought to push him away after what they\u2019d shared... Well, that wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>What they\u2019d just done could not be called \u201csex.\u201d</p><p>Sex was an urge. Sex was something you could do with anyone. Sex could be consensual or forced, as he well knew. What they\u2019d done was a mating. Primal, wild, necessary, and as essential as a beating heart.</p><p>He would have died if he\u2019d been denied access to her body. He\u2019d simply had to be inside her. Nothing could have stopped him. Not attack, not death, hell, not even her disappearance. If she had returned to her world, he would have found a way to follow her.</p><p>There was no resisting this woman, not for him, and he wasn\u2019t going to try anymore. Not in any way. His betrothed might be waiting for him, but so what. Like he\u2019d told Jane, he would have her and no other.</p> <p>She\u2019d changed him.</p><p>When he\u2019d first seen her, scented her, his hunger for her had bloomed. Perhaps he\u2019d become obsessed. Because when he\u2019d watched her being whipped, he\u2019d forgotten his plan to save himself and had gone after her. Then, when he\u2019d heard her scream, had realized the ogres were hurting her, his rage had been unequaled. Seeing her beaten face and body had made a mockery of the rage, however, and he\u2019d become fully beast, his darker nature taking over.</p><p>All the times before, he\u2019d only thought he had a temper.</p><p>The fighting had ended too early. He\u2019d wanted to torture the king, wanted to keep him at the brink of death and agony for centuries. For Jane\u2019s sake, he\u2019d finished the bastard off and gathered his woman close, just like this.</p><p>She had slept then, too, but he hadn\u2019t calmed. The need to brand her, to let the world know exactly who she belonged to, had been driving him as forcefully as the rage had. But he hadn\u2019t wanted to hurt her when he took her\u2014and he\u2019d known he would take her.</p><p>So he\u2019d brought her here, intending to swim and pacify himself. He\u2019d meant to feed her the fish, as well, but she\u2019d watched him while he\u2019d captured them, and he\u2019d felt the rise of her desire.</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten his good intentions. His hope to be careful.</p><p>Now he\u2019d had her, had branded her, just as he\u2019d wanted, needed, but he realized even that wasn\u2019t enough. Nothing would ever be enough with her. He would always want her. Always want more.</p> <p>Were his parents alive, they would understand. He knew this to be true.</p><p>He\u2019d loved them, and they had loved him. They would want him to be happy, and he could not be happy without Jane. His father had settled on a neighboring princess only because Nicolai had shown no preference.</p><p>Now, he had.</p><p>Jane could not have children, and that bothered her, but it did not bother him. He hadn\u2019t lied to her. He liked her just as she was. When Nicolai became king in his father\u2019s stead\u2014the need lit, caught fire\u2014he would be expected to have an heir. But he had three siblings well capable of seeing to that.</p><p>So. His new plan of action: secure Jane to his side, return to Elden, kill the Blood Sorcerer who had slain his parents and claim the throne. He didn\u2019t want to wait to discuss this. Urgency rode him. Instinct that drove him to settle things now.</p><p>\u201cJane...\u201d</p><p>A moment passed.</p><p>\u201cJane. Sweetheart.\u201d Gently he shook her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she muttered groggily.</p><p>\u201cWe will talk now.\u201d</p><p>Her slight catch of breath was encouraging. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really. When you first came to me, you mentioned a book. Where is the book now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s what you want to talk about.\u201d She sounded disappointed. \u201cI left it at the palace in Delfina. I don\u2019t think that matters, though. It was the right book, just newer. And blank.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhen you read it, the story was about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. About your enslavement. There was a pink bookmark in the middle, and that\u2019s the page that told about your imprisonment. Then, written by the same hand, was a note from you, commanding me to help you, to come to you. The rest of the pages were blank, though.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d wondered before if he\u2019d written the thing and forgotten. For all he knew, the witches had cursed him to forget everything but what they did to him. Why had the ink disappeared when Jane had shown up in Delfina, though? Because she\u2019d arrived before he\u2019d actually written the book? But, if he\u2019d commanded her to come here\u2014commanded her specifically\u2014he would have met her already. And she would have left him.</p><p>He tensed. He did not like that notion and he quickly discarded it. He hadn\u2019t said \u201ccome back to me.\u201d He\u2019d said \u201ccome to me.\u201d So...magic might have shown her to him, and like the book, he\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>Still, the fear that he could lose her took root and refused to leave him. \u201cDo you want to stay here with me, Jane?\u201d He geared for battle. A battle he would fight viciously to win. She had a life he knew nothing about, and were the situation reversed, were he stuck in her world, he would have to find a way to leave to avenge his family and home. And he would have stolen away with her, he thought.</p><p>Now she was the one to tense. \u201cOkay, I could answer your question with a question of my own. Do you want me to stay? But I won\u2019t. Because I shouldn\u2019t have to qualify my opinion. I\u2019m not a coward.\u201d She licked her lips, as she did each time she felt desire for him, and he felt the hot slide of her tongue on his chest. \u201cSo. Here it is. Yes. I want to stay with you. That\u2019s what I wanted to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>Thank the gods. He had worried for nothing. \u201cI am glad.\u201d Inadequate words. \u201cI want you to stay with me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re not just saying that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, when have I ever just said anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, men say stuff they don\u2019t mean to get women into bed. All the time.\u201d</p><p>Some did, yes, but he never had. He\u2019d always been up front, offering a single night of his attention, his body, but nothing else, and no longer. That was it, the end. Although, to get Jane into his bed again, he\u2019d do and say just about anything.</p><p>\u201cI will always be honest with you. Always. As long as you desire me. Stop, and I will change my dealings with you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the sexiest purr he\u2019d ever heard. \u201cThank you for the warning.\u201d</p><p>Having her near him was arousing. Feeling her lick him, more so. But that laugh...he was hard as a rock in seconds. \u201cI want you with me, Jane. In bed and out.\u201d</p><p>A tremor drove through her, vibrating into him, relief replacing her humor. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done if you\u2019d tried to take away my magic green card. And before you ask, that means get rid of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet rid of you? Sweetheart, I\u2019m doing everything in my power to keep you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Another soft entreaty.</p><p>He would have rolled his eyes if he weren\u2019t so happy with her. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I mean it. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you thank me. I should be thanking you. And I do. Humbly. You have become the reason I live, Jane.\u201d</p><p>He thought he heard her sniffle. She buried her head in the hollow of his neck, rubbing her cheek against him. \u201cSo what\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to return to the kingdom of Elden. I think my siblings are there. Trapped, perhaps. I don\u2019t know. All I know is that, deep down, I am so hungry to slay the new king, I tremble. Like eating, this is a need. I must do it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>He did not want her involved in such a violent, dangerous plan, but he did not want her out of his sight, either. \u201cI need to find a way to keep you bound to me and to this land first. Should I write another book for you?\u201d His magic was stronger now.</p><p>\u201cIf you do, we will be operating under the assumption that I\u2019ll return, no matter what we do or try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd perhaps such an assumption is what would send you back.\u201d Damn this! There had to be a way. \u201cI wonder what spell I used to bring you here. If I knew, I would know if you would leave after a certain time, or after I am truly free. Or if I bound you to the land forever. I remember so many things, but not that, not yet, and I cannot risk another spell. It might interfere with the first.\u201d</p><p>She eased up, her hair tumbling over her bare shoulder, golden moonlight illuminating her. \u201cWhen I first read the book and realized it wasn\u2019t a joke, I wondered how you could have known me when we\u2019d never met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you figured out the answer.\u201d His words were a statement, not a question. He\u2019d known his woman was smart. She was the perfect combination of beauty and intelligence.</p><p>\u201cYes. I dreamed of you before I ever read the book. Saw you chained, but never spoke to you. Now I think they were visions rather than dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why have visions of me before I used my magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe part of me crossed into this world long ago. Some things are familiar to me, like the ghost trees and ogres. Maybe you saw me, too, and that\u2019s how your magic knew to focus on me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat makes sense, but I wonder how you crossed over.\u201d</p><p>She gulped. \u201cI...I...\u201d</p><p>He reached up to cup her cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t fear, Jane. We will figure this out. You won\u2019t leave. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I should tell you. About me. My job. You might change your mind about me.\u201d She traced the tip of her finger along his sternum. \u201cI said I wasn\u2019t a coward and that means full disclosure, even about this. The things I did, horrible things, to learn about your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you before, Jane, that your job\u2014\u201d A pang exploded through his head, silencing him, reminding him of what had happened after he\u2019d fought the ogres here in this very spot. The same spot he\u2019d first drunk from Jane. Pain, then opening his eyes in a new location.</p><p>He grunted. What was...? Another pang, this one rattling his brain against his skull.</p><p>The cage holding his memories and abilities was crumbling, bit by bit.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jane eased to her elbow and smoothed his hair from his brow, her expression soft and luminous with concern. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d</p> <p>Her emotions were in turmoil, yet she cast aside her own concerns to nurture him. No wonder he\u2019d fallen for her so quickly and so easily. \u201cDrinking your blood empowers me as never before,\u201d he confessed, \u201cbut as more of my memories and abilities escape, I experience a...wee little pinch of sensation.\u201d</p><p>Even as he spoke, one of those \u201cwee little pinches\u201d migrated from his head to his chest, and he hissed a breath. That one had been stronger than any of the others.</p><p>\u201cOh, Nicolai. Now I know why you were reluctant to drink from me. I\u2019m so sorry I made you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. And you didn\u2019t make me, Jane. I wanted to. Badly. Besides, that isn\u2019t why. Want you healthy.\u201d</p><p>A sound of frustration. \u201cNow you\u2019re doing what you said you wouldn\u2019t, and weaving pretty words to make me happy.\u201d</p><p>Another pang, another grunt.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can I do? Besides never feed you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay with me. And you will feed me again.\u201d Every day for eternity. \u201cThis will pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. And, Nicolai, we\u2019ve never talked about my job before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t? You researched...experimented...\u201d What kind and on who were answered inside his mind, but he was having trouble reaching the information.</p><p>The color drained from her face. \u201cThat\u2019s right. And you still like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. We\u2019ll discuss it when you\u2019re better.\u201d A pause. Then a whispered, \u201cCould we have talked in my visions? Could I have forgotten conversations? Could whatever magic was used on you bleed into me?\u201d She was talking to herself, trying to reason things out.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, anyway. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, sorry. I\u2019ll be quiet. You rest.\u201d</p><p>Trusting her, he closed his eyes, breathed slowly, deeply, and simply let the memories come. The first to hit him was of a pretty maid quietly entering his bedroom. Hinges squeaked as his gaze sought her. He didn\u2019t know her name, only that he\u2019d smiled at her earlier that day, and she\u2019d taken that smile for the invitation it was. He was lying on his mattress of plush goose feathers, naked, waiting. She stripped as she approached him.</p><p>Just before she reached him, the door opened and closed again. He looked. Another maid. The three of them were going to play. Good. He hadn\u2019t looked forward to a night with only one, a single conquest too easy. Too...boring. He needed to try something new.</p><p>His mind shied away from that particular memory.</p><p>Once, he might have been looking for more than one partner at a time. Once, he might have wanted to try anything and everything. And that one, he still wanted. With Jane. He wanted to do everything with her, but only with her. Everything they did was a new experience. Exciting, and most of all, soul shattering.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t going to change. She affected him too deeply, too intensely. And she hadn\u2019t had much pleasure in her life, he didn\u2019t think. Every new touch from him had left her gasping, writhing, her expression one of wonder and need.</p><p>He wanted her to wear that expression forever. Would see to it, make it a personal mission of his.</p><p>And what she could do with her mouth...that was magic.</p><p>Darkness suddenly fell over his mind, reality becoming clear. He felt Jane\u2019s soft fingers, still smoothing over his brow. Her warm, sweet breath trekked over his cheeks. She had kept her promise. She was staying put.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t lose her, he thought. There had to be a way to keep her. Forever.</p><p>The book, Jane, her dreams of this world. His spell to bring her here. He focused on those things, hoping to spur the memories in that direction. Shifted glamor, the illusion of someone else\u2019s face masking her own, he knew that much. Also an incantation in the words he\u2019d written? Yes...yes... He\u2019d murmured a spell as he\u2019d written in the book. He\u2019d wanted Jane to be standing beside him\u2014and then she was.</p><p>A memory played.</p><p>Don\u2019t do this to me. He heard her voice so clearly. I will find a way to help you.</p><p>She had spoken to him before their first meeting. Their first remembered meeting.</p><p>I must. I need you. Until your body joins your mind, you are useless to me. His reply. Cold, harsh.</p><p>But to take my memory, she\u2019d said.</p><p>He had taken her recollection of their conversations?</p><p>Their voices faded, and his father\u2019s image filled his head. An important memory, but he needed to know about Jane right now. She was the most pressing. The book. Jane. The spell\u2014spells\u2014he\u2019d used.</p><p>His father was speaking to him, but Nicolai couldn\u2019t hear the words. The book. Jane. The spells he\u2019d used. Come on. The book. Jane. The spells he\u2019d used. Gradually, the image shifted. The towering form of his father shrunk. Black hair grew, curling, lightening. Harsh features became soft, delicate. Jane\u2019s.</p><p>This was his past with Jane, the memory resurfacing. More than a whisper of conversation this time, more than a glimpse.</p><p>And there she was, his beautiful Jane, pacing in front of him. They were in his cell. He wore his loincloth and bruises. He lay on his pallet, watching her. From the moment she\u2019d first appeared, untouchable, like a phantom, yet smelling of something wild and primal, he had wanted her.</p><p>Honey-colored hair streamed down her back, bouncing with every agitated step she took. She wore a long shirt that bagged on her, and he wished he could present her with silks and velvets.</p><p>\u201cHow are you tugging me here?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you tug all of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. Magic. And don\u2019t forget, you first came to me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I could forget. I closed my eyes and just...appeared. As if I\u2019d been teleported, even though I never completed my teleportation research, never tested humans. And the plastic I sent over and back was solid and remained solid. I am not solid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you wake up at home, and you are always returned to your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He didn\u2019t like that he couldn\u2019t touch her or drink from her, but no matter how many times she appeared\u2014and she had, countless\u2014her condition remained the same. Insubstantial. So, they would talk and she would entertain him.</p><p>She\u2019d become something to look forward to, his only enjoyment. And he knew she enjoyed their time together, as well. Knew she liked him. She\u2019d confided in him about her work; he\u2019d told her about his frustration and anger that his memories had been destroyed.</p><p>But they couldn\u2019t go on like this. He couldn\u2019t stay here. He couldn\u2019t remain a prisoner forever. There had to be a way to bring her here\u2014all of her. Had to be a way she could aid his escape. A way they could be together physically.</p><p>\u201cTell me the last thing you remember before coming here that first time,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I was sleeping! I just woke up, and poof, I was in the Delfina palace and headed straight for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore that, then. Think. Maybe something was done or said about my world. Years could have passed since it happened, but you would remember.\u201d</p><p>A heavy pause. \u201cThere is something.\u201d Though she was spectral, her footsteps seemed to pound into the floor. \u201cOnce, I interviewed a vampire at my lab. I asked him question after question, but he refused to answer. I stood to leave. Suddenly he spoke up. He told me to let him go, to let him find his female before it was too late. I couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t have the authority. The next day, I returned.\u201d</p><p>Urgency filled him. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my boss told me the vampire had screamed all night. I entered his room\u2014he was quiet by then, but this time he spoke up instantly. He said one day I would meet a man, fall in love with him and lose him. Just as my lack of action had caused him to lose his female. Then he broke free of his restraints. I thought he would fly at me, but he merely lifted his hand and used his claw to slash his own throat. He died right in front of me.\u201d</p><p>Nicolai\u2019s stomach dropped. \u201cHe cursed you, then. A blood curse.\u201d Unbreakable\u2014for the most part.</p><p>\u201cThat was two years ago, and I thought he was just spouting off. Trying to make me feel guilty for his incarceration!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He gave his life force to the words, breathing them into existence, lending them his heartbeat. The curse waited for the perfect time to strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m destined to only ever see you while in spirit form? No matter what we do?\u201d She laughed bitterly. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, no wonder you end up leaving me. I mean, we can\u2019t even touch each other!\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed a hand down his face, his chains rattling. He couldn\u2019t answer her. Not without condemning them both. \u201cWhat do you take pleasure in doing at home, Jane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to discuss that now? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, tossed up her arms. \u201cI exercise and I read. That\u2019s all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll write you a book.

Which means my answer is no. I don\u2019t want to come here, be with you, only to lose you forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to save you, but what I won\u2019t do is watch you die.\u201d Her gaze narrowed on him. \u201cI know how these things work, Nicolai. You\u2019ve told me you care about me. And yeah, that could be your incarceration talking, but maybe not. If we take things to the next level and you lose me, you will wither.\u201d</p><p>He would rather wither than remain enslaved. \u201cThat\u2019s a chance I\u2019m willing to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I will take your memory, Jane.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cYou can do that? You would do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and yes. I would do that and a whole lot more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the pain of having memories taken. How could you even think of doing that to me?\u201d</p><p>Sound reasoning, which he ignored. \u201cI will only take the memories of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll see you but won\u2019t recognize you?\u201d Suddenly she couldn\u2019t quite catch her breath. Tears ran down her cheeks, leaving little wet tracks. \u201cWill you recognize me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Nicolai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must. I need you. Until your body joins your mind, you are useless to me.\u201d Useless, but so necessary.</p><p>\u201cBut to take my memories...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve forced my hand.\u201d Flat, no room for compromise.</p><p>\u201cAnd if we hate each other in this new beginning, as we did before?\u201d</p><p>At first, she had watched him with those haunted amber eyes, her scent so sweet he could practically taste it. He\u2019d wanted her, craved her, but she had kept her distance.</p><p>When at last she deigned to speak to him, he\u2019d been worked into such a frenzy for her that he had lashed out and tried to bite her, only to waft right through her\u2014as well as scare the Abyss out of her. She had vanished. Hadn\u2019t returned for days. Frustration and anger had eaten him.</p> <p>The next time, he forced himself to speak softly to her, to maintain his own distance, gentling her, even though such things went against the very fiber of his nature. After that, she\u2019d come back again, and again, and camaraderie soon morphed into caring.</p><p>What he planned to do to her was a betrayal. He knew that.</p><p>He did it, anyway. He used his magic to create the book, the pen. Used his magic to write to Jane. Used his magic to send her away, back to her world, to her body. Used his magic to wipe her memories. Used his magic to bring her back to him.</p><p>And in the process, his own memories of her were taken. Not because of the witches, but because of him. He\u2019d taken them on purpose. He\u2019d known knowledge of his past with her would influence his future. Might even prevent him from using her.</p><p>Something was shaking him, dislodging the recollection. He tried to hold on, had to know what happened next, but the shaking continued, and he growled.</p><p>\u201cNicolai. Nicolai, you have to snap out of it.\u201d Jane\u2019s voice, closer, in the present, frantic and fearful. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming. Nicolai, please. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>Please.</p><p>He released the past completely, allowing his mind to snap back into focus. He\u2019d hurt her enough already. And, as she had feared, he would lose her again. The spell he\u2019d used had not disrupted the very first spell cast on her. The one that would force her to lose her lover. Nothing could disrupt that spell, and none Nicolai had tried had brought her back to him. Until he\u2019d worked with the first.</p><p>He\u2019d brought Jane here, bound her body to his, on the condition that she leave him when\u2014if\u2014she fell in love with him.</p><p>So, he could keep her, as long as he prevented her from loving him.</p><p>\u201cNicolai.\u201d</p><p>The present. Yes. He heard footsteps. A lot of them. Booted. Spears scraping against the ground. Power saturated the air. Laila, definitely. With her army? Probably.</p><p>Different emotions warred for dominance. Fury, elation, anticipation, hatred, anxiety. Nicolai wanted to attack, to kill, but that would place Jane in jeopardy, and that he wouldn\u2019t do. Ever.</p><p>He jolted upright, a blur of motion. Jane had already pulled on her robe, was ready to go.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d He grabbed her arm, and jerked her away from their camp.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>NICOLAI DRAGGED JANE through the forest, branches slapping at him. She was limping again, and he wanted to carry her, but Laila\u2019s guards must have caught his scent, because the echo of their footsteps increased, and the sense of magic intensified in the night air.</p><p>They were closing in.</p><p>He could have moved from one location to another with only a thought. From here, back to the withered, perverted kingdom of Elden. His heart clenched in his chest, and he gritted his teeth. Now was not the time to think of his home. Or the condition of his home. Or his parents, and the sorcerer he would soon destroy.</p><p>What if he disappeared, but Jane did not go with him? She would be left on her own in an inhospitable environment, the enemy all around.</p><p>Damn this. He had to try something. He\u2019d managed to beat the flood of memories back, but they were knocking at his mind, demanding release. If they overtook him again...</p><p>He focused on what was most important. He and Jane shared a past he\u2019d barely touched on. One she still couldn\u2019t recall. What he knew was that he wouldn\u2019t repeat his previous mistakes.</p><p>He needed that book, the one in Delfina. Had to write something more inside of it. For when she left him. Oh, gods. Yes, that meant he would be operating under the assumption she would love and leave him, but he had to plan for the worst. Maybe, just maybe, a new spell would bring her back.</p><p>Elden had not planned for defeat, and look what had happened.</p><p>\u201cNicolai,\u201d Jane panted. \u201cI\u2019m used to jogging, but this is like Extreme Jogging, Jungle Edition, and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep up. Can we rest?\u201d</p><p>He heard her. Distantly. Tried to concentrate on her, but the darkness was closing in on him, another memory fighting its way free.</p><p>All his life, he had absorbed the powers and magic of others. What they could do, he could then do. That was how he\u2019d formed the air shield inside the palace. The Queen of Hearts had done so; therefore, he had done so, too. And that was why Laila had forbidden anyone from practicing their craft around him.</p><p>Some abilities lasted days, weeks. Others lasted a lifetime.</p><p>He\u2019d remembered most of this already, so of course his mind tried to shove it aside to make room for something else, something new.</p><p>\u201cNicolai. Please.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t lock on her. More details unfolded. His ability to cast illusions, as well as move from one location to another with only a thought, had come from a witch. A lover who had tried to kill him as he lay sleeping. She had wanted to become his bride, but he had wanted only the sex. She\u2019d tried several different identities with him, amusing him.</p><p>He\u2019d never told her that he knew who she was, each and every time she approached, because he recognized her scent. He\u2019d let her continue to come to him, and every time he\u2019d made his intentions clear. Still she\u2019d tried, hoping to change his mind. When she realized she could not, in any incarnation, she finally attacked.</p><p>One moment Nicolai was leading Jane through the forest, the next he was inside a bedroom. His bedroom, he thought. The one in his memory, with the homicidal witch. He did not realize the switch soon enough and slammed into the wall, propelling backward. He hit the floor with a black curse.</p><p>Jane was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Nicolai popped to his feet, his blood flashing hot. He would return to the forest, now, now, damn it, now, and if anyone had touched Jane...</p><p>He remained in the bedroom.</p><p>Fangs bared, he spun, looking for the way out. Blood stained the walls, crimson splattered in every direction. The floor possessed deep grooves, each in patterns of four, as if multiple swords had been dragged over it and had cut into the wood.</p><p>The giant, hairy creatures, their legs\u2014four on each side\u2014sharp and deadly. They had been here. They had come for him.</p><p>Nicolai had been pumping into a woman, a servant. His door had flown open, and he\u2019d heard the screams echoing from below, in the great hall. He should have heard them sooner, but his partner had been screaming, too, distracting him.</p><p>Nicolai had reached for his blood daggers, the ones he kept on his nightstand, intending to fight the monsters, wondering about his family, but he\u2019d...disappeared, falling straight into a winding black hole.</p><p>Had his siblings died alongside his parents? Or fallen into the same hole? He remembered curses around him, echoing.</p><p>Now he stopped breathing. He hadn\u2019t wanted to remember this, not yet, but... Was he certain his parents were dead? Was there no longer any question in his mind?</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to think about it. Yes. He was certain. They were dead. The knowledge practically seeped from the mold-covered walls around him. He hadn\u2019t seen them die, but he\u2019d felt the drain of their life forces. They were gone.</p><p>Oh, gods. And his siblings?</p><p>No, not dead. Now that he knew what to check for, he could feel their energy swirling inside him still; only, the energy was...different than before. Were they trapped somewhere? Unable to free themselves? Probably. Otherwise, Dayn would have destroyed the Blood Sorcerer and reclaimed the palace.</p><p>Dayn and his ability to hunt anyone or thing. Micah, sweet baby-faced Micah, would have been running down the halls and laughing. Breena would have been trying her hand at magic, messing up her spells.</p><p>With these thoughts, he wanted to drop to his knees, roar to the heavens, curse, rant and rail, fight everything and everyone. How to find them? How to free them?</p><p>Now he also realized he\u2019d heard Dayn\u2019s voice in his dreams. Calling to him, telling him to heal himself. They shared a blood connection, something that could never be destroyed. They could speak again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Where are you, brother?</p><p>A moment passed. There was no reply. Very well. He would try again later.</p><p>A sense of urgency reignited, and Nicolai checked for his daggers. They were gone, as were his clothing and all his other weapons. The room had been totally cleaned out.</p> <p>He ground his molars and pictured the rest of the castle, which was surprisingly easy. Towering, more rooms than he could count. Winding hallways and secret passages. He whisked to every bedroom, every cell in the dungeon. He saw people he did not recognize, more bloodstains, more monsters patrolling the gates. Rage consumed him. The need to kill the new king, the sorcerer, intensified. But his family was not here, nor was the sorcerer.</p><p>He would have to return. Soon. Always soon. Right now, he had to protect Jane. A full-time job, he was coming to realize. One he cherished and wouldn\u2019t trade.</p><p>After a last glance at the castle he\u2019d once loved, he closed his eyes and pictured the forest and the last spot he\u2019d seen Jane. He was there a second later\u2014easier every time\u2014but found no sign of his woman. No sign of Laila and her army, either.</p><p>He sniffed...sniffed... There. He locked on to Jane\u2019s sweet scent, mixed with the disgusting aroma of Laila and her men. They were following her.</p><p>He gave chase.</p> <p>JANE HEARD THE VOICES before she spotted the town, and nearly toppled over with relief. She increased her speed, and finally, blessedly, reached civilization. The sun was steadily rising in the sky, casting a violet haze on the people just now starting their day. Warming Jane, and even burning her. Her skin itched, prickling as if little bugs were crawling through her veins.</p><p>She did not want to contemplate the possible reasons for such an occurrence.</p><p>People\u2014humans?\u2014strode along cobbled streets, some carrying wicker baskets piled high with clothing, some carrying bags of\u2014she sniffed, moaned\u2014bread and meat. Her stomach grumbled as her mouth watered. She was light-headed, her blood supply a little low. She needed to replenish.</p><p>Jane paused beside a tree, watching, thinking. She had two choices. Keep moving, remaining on her own, and risk being found by Laila. Or enter the town, eat and risk being found by Laila. At least the second option provided a meal plan. So, okay. No contest.</p><p>Except, she was still Odette. If these people recognized her, word would spread, and she would be found far more quickly. On the plus side, Laila wouldn\u2019t hurt her and Nicolai was no longer with her. He was no longer in danger\u2014she didn\u2019t think\u2014and that was a good thing.</p><p>He\u2019d disappeared in a heartbeat of time, shocking her. She\u2019d waited in the area for what seemed an eternity, but he\u2019d never reappeared and she\u2019d had to move on. He would find her, wherever she was. She couldn\u2019t believe otherwise.</p> <p>Laila\u2019s army had nearly discovered her, marching right over her hiding place. But they\u2019d lost Nicolai\u2019s trail and backtracked in an attempt to find it again. That\u2019s when Jane bolted, forcing her protesting body to act before it shut down completely and Laila returned.</p><p>If\u2014when\u2014Jane was discovered, she wanted to be well-fed, stronger. So again, no contest. She limped forward, entering the town. The moment the people caught sight of her, they stopped what they were doing, horror consuming their features, and knelt.</p><p>Yep. She\u2019d been recognized. What the hell had Odette done to them?</p><p>She closed the distance between her and one of the groups with food. \u201cPlease. I\u2019m so hungry. May I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake whatever you wish, princess,\u201d the man closest to her said, thrusting the basket in her direction.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any money, but I\u2019ll find a way to pay you back. I swear.\u201d The scent of roasted chicken hit her, transporting her straight to heaven. She stretched out a shaky hand, reached inside the confines of the wicker and claimed a bowl of something creamy. Was she drooling? You can\u2019t dive in like an animal. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHammond, princess.\u201d There was a trace of anger in that husky voice.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the food, Hammond.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything for you, princess.\u201d The anger morphed into hatred.</p><p>Jane sighed, looked around. \u201cPlease stand. All of you. There\u2019s no reason to bow.\u201d</p><p>Several seconds ticked by before they obeyed, as if they feared she would attack them for rising, even though she\u2019d told them to. Other than that, they didn\u2019t move. Though she wanted to limp away, find a deserted, shadowed corner and shove her face right into the food, she couldn\u2019t. They might suspect she was not who they thought she was.</p><p>\u201cI need a room,\u201d she announced. \u201cAnd water. And clean clothing. Please. If one of you could point me in the right direction, I would be grateful.\u201d</p><p>At first, no one stepped forward. Then, reluctantly, a middle-aged female curtsied and said, \u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me, princess, I will see to your needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, an eternity, Jane was inside a bedroom, alone. She devoured the contents of the bowl\u2014some kind of chicken salad\u2014before bathing in the steaming tub the woman had filled with a muttered spell. Not human, after all, but a witch. The water soothed Jane\u2019s sensitive skin, relieving the itching. Afterward, she donned a clean, blue robe the witch had laid out for her.</p><p>All she lacked was Nicolai, and this day would be perfect.</p><p>Where was he?</p><p>With a weary sigh, she sprawled out on the bed. Firm, lumpy, but heaven for her still aching muscles and bones. What to do, what to do. Nicolai was, at heart, a protector. Fierce, unwavering. Which meant he hadn\u2019t left her voluntarily.</p><p>So. Either his abilities\u2014whatever they were\u2014were responsible, or someone had used magic to draw him away from her. The first was more likely. As strong as Nicolai was becoming, she doubted anyone would be able to simply spell him someplace anymore. Because, if that were the case, Laila would have done it days ago.</p><p>Laila. The bitch was a problem. A big one. As long as she was out there, Nicolai would be hunted, in danger. Jane could turn herself in, she supposed, and try to convince the princess to leave \u201cthe slave\u201d alone. Would that help, though? Having tasted the man herself, she knew how impossible it would be to forget him.</p><p>Laila probably craved him more than the air she breathed. The thought alone caused jealousy to rise up, sharp and biting. Jane ignored the unproductive response. A few problems with turning herself in. One, Laila could wield magic. Jane could not. Two, Jane\u2019s secret could be found out. And if the queen whipped her own daughter, what would she do to an enemy impersonating one of her children? Three, what if Nicolai followed her to Delfina? He could be captured again, his memories wiped. His body used.</p><p>His body belonged to Jane. No one else.</p><p>She rolled to her side, clutching the pillow to her middle, suddenly reminded of the day she had received Nicolai\u2019s book. She\u2019d read a few passages and had thought of him for hours afterward. She had been obsessed with him, really. After reading a few more passages, she had fantasized about him, practically making love to her pillow. Then, she had gone to him.</p><p>Maybe she could reach him again.</p><p>She closed her eyes and imagined him inside her cabin, puttering around, fixing things, then seducing her into bed. There, he touched her, stripped her. Kissed her, tasted her. Consumed her. Goose bumps spread. She could almost feel the warmth of his breath, the slick glide of his skin.</p><p>\u201cNicolai,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Jane.</p><p>His voice, so deep, so familiar. For a moment, she experienced a wave of dizziness, felt as if she were floating. Then the mattress was beneath her again, and...cold. Cold? In less than a second, the mattress had gone from warmed to chilled. Impossible. Unless\u2014 Her eyelids popped open, hope unfurling.</p><p>Hope dying. She hadn\u2019t whisked to Nicolai. She was inside her cabin. On her own bed.</p><p>Jane jolted upright, trying to suck air into her lungs. A knot formed in her throat, and nothing could penetrate it. No. She couldn\u2019t be here. No, no, no. She popped to her feet, nearly toppling as her knees shook. She rushed around, stumbling a few times, grabbing her knickknacks to see if they were real or imagined.</p><p>Please be imagined.</p><p>They were solid, dusty, as if they hadn\u2019t been cleaned in weeks. They were real. She choked back a sob.</p><p>No! Tears blurred her vision. She swiped her arms over her dresser, knocking everything to the floor. A glass vase shattered. A hairbrush clattered. How the hell had she gotten here? She\u2019d wanted to be with Nicolai. She needed to be with him and had to get back. She would get back.</p><p>She just had to figure out how.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>JANE RAGED FOR HALF AN HOUR. Panicked for an hour after that. Then she did what she did best\u2014reasoned. There was a logical explanation for what had happened. There always was. So, she brushed her teeth, showered and redressed in her robe. No way she\u2019d dress in jeans and a T-shirt. She didn\u2019t belong here anymore, and wouldn\u2019t dress as if she did.</p><p>She belonged there. With Nicolai.</p><p>She stretched out on her bed, and her comforter plumped around her. Okay. She could do this. What had she been doing before she\u2019d ended up here? Lying in bed, just like this, thinking about Nicolai. Imagining the two of them making love, actually. Good, that was good. She would just do that again.</p><p>She cleared her mind with a little shake of her head, drew in a deep breath, released the air...slowly...and forced her muscles to relax. A picture of Nicolai rose front and center. Dark hair shagging around his head, silver eyes liquid with desire. For her. Lips parted as he breathed shallowly, his own desire raging. His fangs peeked out.</p><p>Her stomach quivered, but other than that, nothing happened. No dizziness, no movement whatsoever. Keep going. In her mind, she saw him remove his shirt, slowly pulling the material over his head. His skin, his beautifully bronzed skin, glistened exquisitely. His nipples were small and brown, utterly lickable. That scrumptious trail of hair lead from his navel to a cock she\u2019d once loved with her mouth.</p><p>Warm moisture pooled between her legs. But again, no floating, no changing locations.</p><p>Damn it. She hadn\u2019t been this unsuccessful since the age of eight, when she\u2019d read about making synthetic diamonds in the microwave. Diamonds she\u2019d hoped to present to her mother on her birthday. The charcoal bricks and peanut butter necessary for the conversion had survived the lengthy cook time. The dish she\u2019d put them in had not. Neither had the microwave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A chuckle escaped her as she suddenly recalled her mother\u2019s reaction. They\u2019d been standing in the kitchen, her darling mother looking through the thick, dark smoke to Jane, who was holding the book that explained exactly how to do it. Her disbelieving expression was comical.</p><p>\u201cDiamonds?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cI followed every step, didn\u2019t miss a single one.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother coughed as she claimed the book. Several minutes passed before she turned her attention to the blackened mess inside the microwave. \u201cYou followed every step, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you used a Pyrex dish?\u201d</p><p>Jane blinked. \u201cP-Pyrex?\u201d</p><p>Dizziness caused the image to waver, fade, and that dizziness caused a bubble of excitement to burst through her chest. This was it. She was returning....</p> <p>The moment the dizziness passed, she popped open her eyelids and sat up. For a moment, her unfamiliar surroundings simply couldn\u2019t register. She was perched on a linoleum floor in the center of a kitchen. There was a stainless-steel stove, a sink, scuffed cabinets. The layout was familiar\u2014she\u2019d just seen it in her mind\u2014but the colors were not.</p><p>Once, the walls had been painted yellow. Now they were painted blue. Once, the refrigerator had been silver. Now it was black. Still she knew. This had been her kitchen. She\u2019d grown up here. Her mother had stood just in front of that sink, coughing from the smoke wafting from the microwave. A high-pitched scream suddenly echoed, a jumble of words following. \u201cIntruder! Thief! Murderer! What the hell are you doing here?\u201d a woman gasped from behind her. \u201cWho are you? Get out! Get out right now! Billy, call 9-1-1.\u201d</p><p>Jane whipped around, instinctively holding up her hands in a you-can-trust-me gesture. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Absolute fear coated the woman\u2019s features. She grabbed a knife from the counter, waving the sharp tip in Jane\u2019s direction. \u201cThat\u2019s what all the psychos say.\u201d</p><p>Jane backed away.</p><p>\u201cBilly!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d a sleepy male voice growled from around the corner.</p><p>Oh, crap. Reinforcements. Remembering the house\u2019s layout, Jane bolted, heading straight for the front door. She raced into the morning sunlight, the length of her robe tangling around her feet. And sure enough, she was in her old neighborhood. Not much had changed. The houses were small, a little run-down and crowded too close together.</p><p>Fearing the woman and her Billy would give chase\u2014and grab a shotgun\u2014she sprinted about half a mile along the gravel road, turned sharply and ducked behind Mrs. Rucker\u2019s giant oak. She\u2019d hidden here a lot as a kid.</p><p>She was panting and sweating as she slid to her ass. And damn. Her feet throbbed. The little rocks had sliced them to ribbons.</p><p>Well, that was fun. Not. What the hell had just happened?</p><p>She ran the variables through her mind, weighed each of the possible outcomes, compared them and discarded all but one. His blood. She\u2019d had Nicolai\u2019s blood; he\u2019d fed it to her to heal her. His abilities must have transferred to her. Like him, she could move from one place to the other, disappearing and reappearing. In essence, teleporting.</p><p>She just had to picture where she wanted to go, and boom. She was there in a snap. Amazement filled her. She\u2019d studied the manipulation of macroparticles for years before she\u2019d succeeded in teleporting plastic, basically faxing a small portion from one station to another. Now, to move a living being between planes with only a thought...it was everything she\u2019d worked for, gift-wrapped and handed to her.</p><p>So, when she\u2019d imagined her old kitchen, she had traveled to her old kitchen. Before, in that town, she had imagined Nicolai in her bed, and had therefore traveled back to her bed. So simple, so easy, an answer that made sense. Finally.</p> <p>She could return to her man.</p><p>She was grinning as she closed her eyes and pictured the quaint little bedroom she\u2019d previously occupied. The wooden tub, the feathered bed. Yes, the bed. Where she\u2019d sprawled, hoping Nicolai would find her.</p><p>Dizziness rolled through her, and she couldn\u2019t contain her gasp of excitement. Next time she opened her eyes, she would be there. Back in Delfina. And if she retained this ability, she would never have to worry about losing Nicolai to magic again. She could stay with him always. If she didn\u2019t retain it automatically, she could drink from him every day to ensure that she did.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d a female voice said. \u201cThere you are, using your magic to become invisible again. Who were you spying on this time, sister dear?\u201d</p><p>Dread replaced Jane\u2019s excitement as she opened her eyes. She was in the little room, all right, but that room was now overflowing with Laila and her soldiers. Two of them held a teary-eyed woman. The very woman who had brought Jane here, who had fed her, clothed her.</p><p>Laila stood at the edge of the bed, peering down at her. There was no sign of Nicolai.</p><p>Slowly Jane sat up. Careful. \u201cYes, I was using my invisibility again.\u201d As far as lies went, that was a good one. Irrefutable. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that any way to greet your loving sister? A sister who has searched and searched for you, desperate to save you from a madman\u2019s clutches.\u201d</p><p>A thought hit her: despite traveling between worlds, the Odette mask was still in place. Sweet! But really, Jane knew if Laila had \u201csearched and searched\u201d for her, it had been to slay her and claim Nicolai for her own. Two could play the deceit game, however.</p><p>\u201cThank you for saving me, darling. All I\u2019ve done these past few days is miss you.\u201d</p><p>Emerald eyes narrowed to tiny slits.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Jane added before Laila could reply. \u201cWhat are you doing to the woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Laila waved a dismissive hand. \u201cI knew you were here, I could sense your magic, but I couldn\u2019t find you and feared she had killed you.\u201d Was that relish in her tone?</p><p>\u201cAs you can see, she didn\u2019t.\u201d As she spoke, she said a prayer that Nicolai did not come for her, yet. She didn\u2019t want him walking in on this. Didn\u2019t want Laila to see him.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Laila twisted and eyed the guards holding her. \u201cShe\u2019s no longer of any use to us. Dispose of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDispose of her\u201d had better not mean... A third guard stepped up behind the woman, who had begun to flail and panic, grabbed her by the jaw and jerked, breaking her neck in seconds. Her body sagged forward, going limp. Lifeless.</p><p>Jane could only gape in shock, in horror. \u201cWh-why did you do that?\u201d</p><p>The guards dragged the body away, and Laila shrugged. \u201cShe irritated me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...\u201d Bitch. The urge to murder the princess flashed white-hot through her veins. And she\u2019d once thought herself unready for such an act.</p><p>That she remained in place, seemingly unaffected, saved her. There was a little voice of reason in the back of her head, reminding her that she was outnumbered and outgunned.</p><p>Jane had never been a violent person. Perhaps Nicolai\u2019s dark side was rubbing off on her, too, because she liked the thought of hurting Laila. Welcomed it. One day, I will destroy you.</p><p>Laila eased onto the mattress, pressing close. Jane barely stopped herself from scooting away in disgust. \u201cNow, sister dear, we have much to discuss.\u201d</p><p>NICOLAI REMAINED IN the shadows, bypassing huts and outdoor vendors pedaling their wares. Jane\u2019s scent, so sweet...stronger now...so close...mixed with a hundred others. Some rotten, pungent. Some sweat soaked, some magic ripe.</p><p>Laila and her army were here.</p><p>The moment realization struck, he stopped caring about stealth. He leaped into action, feet hammering at the ground. The citizens paused when they spotted him, some doing a double take. Murmurs soon arose.</p><p>Did they know him?</p><p>He caught words like prince and dead, each a question. They did know him, then. Knew he was a prince of Elden. They\u2019d thought him dead. Did they think the same about his family?</p><p>He almost stopped to question them. Almost. Jane was in danger. That preceded everything. He quickened his pace. His intense sense of smell took him to a little hut at the edge of the town. Guards spilled from it, filing into the streets. There were even guards posted at the neighboring homes, all watching and waiting for their princess.</p><p>Nicolai returned to the shadows. Thankfully no one in this area had noticed him. People were perched in front of their windows, nervously eyeing the guards. Potential allies?</p><p>Some were witches, but most were humans. Humans who had crossed into this realm throughout the centuries, for whatever reason. They had congregated here, settled and sprouted roots. That had been a mistake, for this town was part of Delfina and under the rule of the Queen of Hearts. They couldn\u2019t help him.</p><p>He drew in a heated breath, released it. Well, he didn\u2019t need help. He was a prince. A vampire. Powerful beyond imagining. He had led an army of his own, had conquered kingdoms and female hearts. He could absorb the abilities of others, and it was time he used that to his advantage\u2014and not accidentally.</p><p>Eyes narrowing, he homed in on the house. Jane was inside. He felt her energy, as sweet as her scent and...now blended with his own. He gave a primitive grunt of approval. Mine. He had done more than mark her; he had branded her. I\u2019m coming for you, sweetheart.</p><p>He switched his focus to Laila. She was rotten to her core, with a scent to match. Magic swirled inside her, dark and potent. Ability after ability, honed over centuries of living with such a slowly ticking clock. He rifled through them.</p><p>She could hypnotize others; that could aid him, yes, but she could only entrance one person at a time. She could heal her own wounds. He could already do that. She could cause wounds. Another maybe. She could spark false desire. No. A muscle ticked in his jaw, though. How many times had she used that ability on him?</p><p>Doesn\u2019t matter. He continued his search, discarding...discarding... There! Remote viewing, like what he\u2019d done inside the palace with Jane. Perfect, and now his earlier ability made sense. He wondered how many times Laila had used the ability on him. Watched him without his knowledge.</p><p>No matter the answer, she would never be able to do so again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grabbed on to the ability and gave a soft mental tug, drawing it closer and closer to him. A little more...just a little more... His chest puffed as his every cell suddenly absorbed the magic necessary to see places he could not physically reach. Still he kept tugging, and tugging, and tugging. Drawing the magic away from her and into him.</p><p>Laila wouldn\u2019t know what he was doing. His victims never did, until it was too late. Right now, she would be experiencing only mild fatigue. If he attempted to draw all of her abilities, all of her power, however, she would know and could try to stop him, erecting mental blocks.</p><p>Suddenly his mind opened up. In a blink, he was looking at Jane, as if he were sitting beside her. Only, he saw her through Laila\u2019s eyes. And Laila saw the mask. Saw Odette. Odette\u2019s dark hair, Odette\u2019s green eyes. Her too-long nose and thick jowls.</p> <p>Knowing Jane rested under that mask was enough to light his body on fire and soothe the sharpest edges of his fear for her safety. She was alive, unharmed. He would have her again.</p><p>\u201cWhat did the slave do to you? Tell me before I perish from worry.\u201d Laila ruined the effect of the demand with a yawn.</p><p>Jane fluffed her hair, every inch the princess. \u201cLike you said before, he desired me. I desired him, one thing led to another, and we were steaming up the forest, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you bespell him to desire you?\u201d Each word was tauter than the last. \u201cYou must have. Otherwise, he would be with you now. Yet, I have caught no sign of him. So where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t bespell him.\u201d Jane offered no more.</p> <p>\u201cThen how did you elicit his desire? He hated you, tried to kill you. You did something, I know you did. Just admit it.\u201d</p><p>Jane smirked over at her, and it was a glorious sight. \u201cHold on to your panties, Laila dear, because this might shock you. I\u2014wait for it\u2014treated him with respect. You should try it sometime. You might be delighted with the results.\u201d</p><p>Hate burned through Laila so relentlessly, Nicolai felt the heat of it inside his own body. \u201cYou lie. You\u2019ve never treated anyone with respect. I doubt you even know what the word means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we showing our claws now, darling? Because I promise you, mine are sharper.\u201d</p><p>Pride filled him. No one would doubt she was Odette now. Not even the queen herself. She wore confidence as snugly as a cloak.</p><p>\u201cI will ask you one more time,\u201d Laila gritted out.</p> <p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere. Is. He?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead.\u201d A casual shrug. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Laila\u2019s mouth dropped open, a strangling sound emerging. \u201cYou killed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, I did.\u201d Jane threw her legs over the mattress, and winced. They must be paining her, he thought, wishing he were there to ease her hurts. She straightened. \u201cNow, let\u2019s go home. I\u2019m eager to sleep in my own bed.\u201d</p><p>Laila remained in place and crossed her arms over her middle. \u201cWhere\u2019s his body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fed it to the ogres, of course,\u201d she replied blithely. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the questions, anyway? Nicolai did not belong to you.\u201d</p><p>She was giving him what he\u2019d told her he wanted, he thought. A chance to destroy Laila, undetected. Time to reach Elden, to kill the new king. And yes, the urgency was still there, simmering inside him, stronger with every minute that passed, but he still couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, leave her.</p> <p>Relief bathed Laila, bleeding into him, but the emotion was as quickly schooled as the hatred. \u201cI found the ogre cave. Nicolai\u2019s body was not there. Others\u2019 were, which has to mean he killed them and escaped.\u201d</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cWrong. I massacred the ogres. After they finished with him.\u201d</p><p>The shock returned. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>A buff of her nails. \u201cA girl never reveals her fighting secrets. She might need them later on.\u201d</p><p>A heartbeat of silence. A low growl.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Laila shouted, no longer able to contain her emotions. She jumped to her feet, stomped her foot. \u201cHe was mine.\u201d</p><p>Jane got in her face, putting them nose to nose.</p><p>\u201cActually, you spoiled brat, he\u2019s mine. Was mine.\u201d</p><p>Tension thickened the air, practically vibrating between them. Long moments passed, the only sound that of their breathing. Finally Laila backed down. She stepped away, widening the distance.</p><p>\u201cOf course. You\u2019re right.\u201d Grudgingly offered. \u201cSo tell me. Why did you kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI no longer desired him.\u201d</p><p>Even though Nicolai knew why she said what she said, his inner beast did not like hearing those words. Later, he would have to be soothed. Later, he would have to explain his past with her and apologize for what he\u2019d done.</p><p>Would her claim then become true?</p><p>\u201cNow, then. Let\u2019s return to the palace,\u201d Jane said. \u201cGuards. Move out.\u201d</p><p>They hesitated.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d she screamed, her patience clearly gone.</p><p>This time, they scrambled to obey. Jane followed them, forcing Laila to trail after her. Nicolai could feel the princess\u2019s desire to stab her sister in the back. But she didn\u2019t, and as they marched out of the town, he skulked after them.</p><p>Soon...</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>EVEN THOUGH, AS A PRINCESS of Delfina, she was carried on a plush velvet lounge, the sun blocked by a canopy of dark netting, Jane much preferred traveling with Nicolai. Where was he? Close, she thought. She could almost scent him, a hint of magic, a pinch of seductive spice. She prayed he\u2019d opted not to follow her.</p><p>Laila thought he was dead. So, in a way, he was finally free of the bitch. He could travel to Elden, and do what needed doing. And Jane could deliver his vengeance\u2014a special care package of lethal\u2014for him.</p><p>The princess had killed an innocent woman for no damn reason. No wonder the people in town had been afraid of Odette. The royal family abused their power, and Jane wasn\u2019t going to let them do so anymore.</p><p>Then she and Nicolai could be together again.</p><p>When Laila finally decided to stop for the evening, Jane\u2019s legs were stiff from disuse. Not as stiff as they could have been, at least. In fact, not even close to what she was used to dealing with. No throbbing pain, no bone-crushing aches. However, a walk would have been nice.</p><p>Sadly, a walk wasn\u2019t in the forecast for some time to come. She had to continue to lounge as the guards erected her tent. And decorated the inside. And carted in her trunks. Trunks Laila had brought with her, perhaps hoping to bribe her for a night with Nicolai.</p><p>When they finished, bowing before her and awaiting dismissal, Laila climbed down from her own raised lounge, stepping on their backs to reach the ground.</p><p>\u201cThere will be a celebration of your return,\u201d the princess announced with a clap of her hands. \u201cWe will dine in my tent. My slaves will dance for us, and you may choose whichever you desire to warm your furs.\u201d</p><p>Gee. Thanks. \u201cSorry, but I\u2019m tired.\u201d Jane climbed down, too, feeling guilty the entire time. Although the guards blinked with surprise at her slighter weight and that sparked a kernel of fear. \u201cI wish only to bathe and sleep. And eat. I haven\u2019t been fed properly in days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathe, yes. Then join me. I will feed you. Since your return from the grave, there has been too much friction between us. I do not like it, and long for the ease of our former relationship.\u201d</p><p>A lie, Jane knew. Laila hated Odette with the same passion she had craved Nicolai in her bed, but to protest was to, perhaps, act against the real Odette\u2019s character. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said on a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll join you in an hour.\u201d A small reprieve, but a reprieve all the same. She made her way to her own tent.</p><p>A long soak in the portable tub did much to appease her aches and pains. A tub Rhoslyn had filled. The girl was a surprisingly welcome sight.</p><p>Jane scrubbed from head to toe, using the floral-scented soap that had rested on the rim. \u201cDid Laila demand that you come on this journey or did you volunteer?\u201d</p><p>Frizzy red hair bobbed. \u201cI volunteered, princess.\u201d She unfolded a vivid green robe from a trunk. \u201cJust in case we found you, and you had need of me.\u201d</p><p>I should have been nicer to this girl. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you until you entered my tent. Where were you in the procession?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehind the third line of defense, with the rest of the servants and slaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wished I\u2019d known. You could have ridden in the carriage with me.\u201d Jane emerged from the water and grabbed the towel resting on a nearby bench.</p><p>\u201cI will help you,\u201d Rhoslyn said, rushing over. The robe dangled from her arms.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d There were some things she was now capable of doing herself\u2014things she hadn\u2019t been able to do while practically chained to a hospital bed\u2014and she would never again allow anyone to do them for her.</p><p>Dried, she pinched one corner of the robe and lifted. Her lips curved down in distaste. Though finely made, the material was too wide for her, and far too thick. She\u2019d melt from the heat. And, where the robe gaped, she\u2019d fry like battered shrimp when in the sun.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry if the cloth is not to your liking.\u201d Free of her burden, Rhoslyn bowed her head. \u201cYou may beat me if you wish.\u201d</p><p>Jane caught the layer of fear in her voice. \u201cBeat you? Rhoslyn, I\u2019m not going to beat you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>The girl continued as if she hadn\u2019t heard a word Jane had said. \u201cI thought you would prefer something durable, rather than enticing. And your sister was quite eager to reach you, so I did not have much time to pack your things. I am not complaining,\u201d she rushed to add. \u201cI simply wished to explain why there are not many robes to choose from, and why I did not bring your very best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did great, I swear. I love the gown. Love it. See?\u201d She dressed and twirled. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt lovelier.\u201d</p><p>Rhoslyn offered her a genuine smile. \u201cI am glad, princess. Oh. And I am happy to tell you that I brought your book.\u201d</p><p>Jane paused, her heart suddenly thumping. \u201cReally? Where is it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The girl crossed to the other side of the tent. Slowly, Jane realized, and with care. \u201cHey. Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself carrying those buckets?\u201d Great. Something else to feel guilty about.</p><p>Rhoslyn stiffened, stumbling over her own feet, before continuing on. \u201cI am fine, princess.\u201d She hunched over another trunk, dug inside and lifted the leather-bound tome.</p><p>Jane gasped with horror. As the girl had bent over, her hair had fallen forward and Jane had caught sight of bruising on her neck. Black and blue and clearly spreading farther down. \u201cWhat happened to your back?\u201d This time, her tone was firm, unyielding, demanding an answer.</p> <p>Rhoslyn\u2019s thin arm shook as she held out the book. \u201cI allowed you to be abducted by the slave. I was punished. As I deserved.\u201d</p><p>Whipped, then. Laila hadn\u2019t given the girl time to pack properly, but she\u2019d damn sure made time to use the cat-o\u2019-nine-tails. Jane claimed the offered item, hating Laila a little more. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t your fault. You couldn\u2019t have stopped him. Hell, you weren\u2019t even there.\u201d</p><p>No reply was forthcoming.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m headed to my sister\u2019s tent. While I\u2019m gone, I want you to soak in the tub. If you want. If you don\u2019t, don\u2019t. Then, I want you to rest. Do not wait up for me. And that\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>Eyes wide with surprise, Rhoslyn gave another nod.</p> <p>Jane stepped outside. Overhead, the sun was setting, muted and a deep purple. And yet, it still managed to burn her newly sensitive skin, making her itch all over again. Now wasn\u2019t the time to consider what that meant, either.</p><p>Laila\u2019s tent was a mere ten steps away. At the entrance, Jane stopped and squared her shoulders. You can do this. The sound of laughter and music wafted toward her as she brushed past the flap. She scouted her new surroundings, trying to take everything in at once. To the right, Laila was perched on a hastily constructed dais. Lounging, of course, and eating pastries. There was an empty seat beside her.</p><p>Six naked men slow danced in the center. They were tall, leanly muscled and oiled to a glossy shine. Two blonds, two redheads and two with dark hair. Math at its finest. Hands roamed, and bodies bumped and grinded. Each man had an erection, but Jane doubted they liked what they were doing. Their eyes were glazed and lifeless. Were they bespelled?</p><p>To the left was a band. Well, the Delfina version of a band. A naked harpist, a naked violinist and a naked vocalist. Jane was sensing a theme. And, well, shit. This had the makings of an orgy. Participation had better not be mandatory. Her body belonged to Nicolai, and no one else.</p><p>\u201cOdette,\u201d Laila called, catching sight of her. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>What ulterior motive do you have? Jane wondered as she closed the distance between them. No way the princess had thrown this little shindig together out of the goodness of her heart. Fact: she didn\u2019t have a heart.</p> <p>Jane eased into her chair and stretched out. \u201cMy...pleasure.\u201d Something about the princess was off, she immediately realized. No, not off. Different. Yes, that was a better word. She pulsed with power, stronger than before. Had she cast some sort of spell on herself? Could witches even do that?</p><p>Wasn\u2019t like Jane could ask. She was supposed to be a witch herself.</p><p>Laila waved her hand over the tray of pastries. \u201cHave anything you like.\u201d</p><p>Hmm, sugar. Her stomach twisted with hunger. How many hours had passed since she\u2019d had that delicious chicken salad? The same number of hours that had passed since the princess had killed that innocent woman. Goodbye, appetite. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must drink.\u201d Laila clapped. \u201cFix my sister a goblet of wine.\u201d</p><p>The servant behind their chairs jumped to obey, and seconds later, Jane was holding a bejeweled, golden goblet. Rather than refuse it, she held on. Drinking the wine was out of the question, though. She needed her wits. All of her wits.</p><p>If an opportunity presented itself, she was going to deliver her care package tonight. Poison? A stabbing? Whatever method she picked, she would have to be careful. She couldn\u2019t win against the princess\u2019s magical abilities. Especially since she had no idea what the girl could do.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Laila purred. \u201cEnjoy.\u201d</p> <p>For over an hour, the men danced and Laila watched, eating and drinking. Jane watched her, studying her like a lab rat. Soon the princess was giggling and throwing grapes at the men. When the giggles subsided, she became aroused. Unabashedly, she moved her hand underneath her robe and rubbed herself between her legs.</p><p>\u201cTouch his chest,\u201d the princess called huskily. \u201cYes, like that. Now lick his nipples. Oh, good boy. That\u2019s the way.\u201d With her free hands, she cupped one of her breasts.</p><p>Jane blushed. She\u2019d nailed the happenings of the night like most of these slaves were probably going to nail Laila. Any minute now, and every single one of them would be orgying.</p><p>Oh, gross. She\u2019d just turned the word orgy into a verb.</p><p>She was just about to excuse herself when the tent flap lifted. A new man, a slave, entered, and he was as naked as the others. He, too, was tall and oiled, though he was lean and lanky. Jane didn\u2019t recognize him, and yet, her eyes ate him up. Her heart sped up, her blood heated. Her skin tingled deliciously.</p><p>He had hair so pale it was like falling snow. His eyes were as black as a stormy night, and thickly lined with kohl. He was probably five-ten, his shoulders a little narrow, and his belly flat, almost concave. His skin was bronzed to a mochalike shimmer.</p><p>There was an almost feminine sense of gentleness about him. A gentleness that didn\u2019t seem to fit the hard gleam of his eyes, as if it were a winter coat that belonged to someone else.</p><p>Like Jane had done, he paused in the doorway to take everything in. Anger flared his nostrils. Hate wafted from him, then desire. True desire, overshadowing everything else. He sniffed, gaze panning, then locking on her. He was striding forward a second later. Then he stilled, catching himself.</p><p>Breath caught in Jane\u2019s throat. She might not recognize that face and body, but she recognized that purposeful, powerful stride. Nicolai. He was projecting someone else\u2019s image, she knew it.</p><p>He was here. He was alive, healthy and whole, she thought, giddy with the knowledge. She should have been upset. He was ruining her plan, putting himself in danger. And yet, she reacted to his nearness...needed him. His body, his blood.</p><p>Her eyes widened as she realized what she\u2019d just contemplated. She wanted to drink...his blood?</p><p>Oh, yes, she thought, her gaze zeroing in on his vein. She could see the slight fluttering there and wanted to sink her teeth in. Teeth. Was she...? She ran her tongue along the edge of her teeth. They felt the same, no fangs having sprouted unexpectedly. A wave of disappointment hit her.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t allowed herself to contemplate such an idea because she hadn\u2019t wanted to face that very sense of disappointment.</p><p>Vampires were not able to turn humans into blood drinkers. She knew because testing their blood, mixing it with human blood, had been one of her experiments. Nothing had happened, nothing had changed.</p><p>Hope did not abandon her completely. Nicolai was a little more...everything than any other vampire she\u2019d known, so if anyone could change her, it was him. And she wanted to change. Wanted to live as long as he would.</p><p>\u201cOh, there he is,\u201d Laila said. \u201cMy special slave. Come here, darling boy. Let me show you off to my sister.\u201d</p><p>At first, Nicolai did not obey. Jane was glad. She didn\u2019t want him anywhere near the princess and her slutty hands. And if the princess dared to put those hands on him, Jane couldn\u2019t be held responsible for her actions. Actions that would involve the removal of the offending appendages.</p><p>Nicolai kicked into gear, and all too soon he stood between the lounges. He bowed his head, subservient.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty,\u201d Laila cooed. \u201cIsn\u2019t he pretty, Odette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she managed to choke out.</p><p>Laila sat up and petted his chest.</p><p>You are going to die, bitch. Jane fisted her hands on her thighs, her nails cutting, drawing blood.</p><p>\u201cI found him days ago, as I was scouring Delfina to save you. He did not wish to travel with me. At first. He had another love, you know, and wished to remain with him. But I quickly changed your mind, didn\u2019t I, precious?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, but he offered no reply. Not so subservient, after all.</p><p>Petting, petting, the bitch was still petting him. Jane was reaching out before she could stop herself, wrapping her fingers around Laila\u2019s wrist and squeezing. \u201cI want him.\u201d</p><p>Triumph filled those green eyes. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t have him. He\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaila\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do you recall when I wanted your slave, and you would not share?\u201d</p><p>So. That\u2019s what this night was about. Tempting Jane, then denying her. \u201cLet me explain something to you, Laila. I am older than you. Which means I am the future queen. Your future queen. What I want, I get. Even if that \u2018what\u2019 belongs to you.\u201d She might not know Delfina law, but she knew the construction of a matriarchal culture, as well as social hierarchy.</p><p>In the end, top dog always won. Right now, Jane was top dog.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan do anything I want, yes.\u201d Jane tossed the girl\u2019s hand into her lap. \u201cSo don\u2019t you dare touch him. I\u2019ve claimed rights. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Bright red spots of color bloomed on Laila\u2019s cheeks. \u201cMother will have something to say about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019m sure it will be \u2018job well done.\u2019\u201d Jane pushed to her feet, standing beside Nicolai. She curbed the urge to link their hands, to bury her head in the hollow of his neck, and simply breathe him in. \u201cBottom line. She\u2019s not here. Is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The color spread to Laila\u2019s nape.</p><p>\u201cAnd that means...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour word is law,\u201d Laila gritted out. \u201cVery well. I will let you have him without a fight. If he wishes to belong to you. Darling,\u201d she said, standing and peering deep into his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Magic crackled between them.</p><p>Jane experienced a momentary wave of nervousness. Could Nicolai be entranced, or whatever Laila was doing to him? \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d she barked.</p><p>Laila ignored her. \u201cTell my sister how much you desire me, precious. Tell her whose body you crave.\u201d</p> <p>His lips compressed into a thin line.</p><p>\u201cTell her! Now.\u201d</p><p>Even the harp and violin drowned out, overshadowed by the thud of Jane\u2019s heartbeat. Then Nicolai shook his head and said, \u201cI desire the princess Odette,\u201d and the world outside their circle reentered her awareness.</p><p>A shocked gasp. An angry growl. \u201cNo. No, you lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he lie?\u201d Jane demanded.</p> <p>Laila\u2019s narrowed gaze swung to her. \u201cWhat did you do to him? How did you steal his affections from me? What did you do?\u201d she screeched.</p><p>\u201cShe did nothing. I simply want her.\u201d There was enough truth in Nicolai\u2019s voice to prove his claim.</p><p>\u201cI will\u2014\u201d Laila raised her hand, either to hit Nicolai or cast a spell.</p><p>Either way, Jane didn\u2019t care. She grabbed on to the bitch\u2019s wrist a second time. \u201cYou haven\u2019t yet learned the concept of the phrase my property. Touch him, and you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>Several seconds passed before Laila schooled her features and dropped her arm to her side. She released a shuddering breath. \u201cYou\u2019re different, Odette. You never treated me this shabbily before.\u201d</p><p>Jane shrugged, as if unconcerned, but deep inside she trembled. \u201cNear-death experiences have a way of leaving their mark. Good night, sister dear.\u201d Finally she claimed Nicolai\u2019s hand and ushered him out of the tent, hurrying to hers.</p> <p>Rhoslyn had taken her at her word, and had not remained to see to her needs. Jane and Nicolai were alone.</p><p>She whirled to face him. He\u2019d dropped the mask, and she could see his dark, shaggy hair, his bright silver eyes. His towering height, wide shoulders and rock-solid strength. Her desire intensified, burning through her.</p><p>\u201cWe have much to discuss,\u201d he said. He cupped her cheeks, his grip strong and sure. \u201cBut first, I need you. I missed you more than I can say.\u201d And then he wasn\u2019t saying anything at all. He was kissing her hungrily, and she was kissing him back.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>NICOLAI WRAPPED JANE in his arms, taking her passion and returning it with equal measure. He\u2019d nearly dropped to his knees the moment he\u2019d spotted her, perched beside his enemy, in danger but alive. Relief, yes, he\u2019d experienced that emotion. Fury, that, too. Laila had been within his reach, his to kill.</p><p>Fear had accompanied the fury, however. He\u2019d felt the magical spell protecting the bitch from physical injury, and returning whatever violence was dished to the one doing the attacking.</p><p>If he\u2019d gone for her throat...if Jane had...</p><p>They would have died.</p> <p>Didn\u2019t happen. Jane\u2019s safe now.</p><p>Laila must know Nicolai was coming for her, or she would not have cast the spell. A spell most witches avoided. No one could hurt her, it was true, but no one could help her, either. If she injured herself accidentally, the spell would turn on her, seeing her as the threat. She would not only suffer with her injury, she would suffer a hundredfold with the magic.</p><p>\u201cNicolai,\u201d Jane rasped.</p><p>He\u2019d feared she would not recognize him, that he would have to steal Laila\u2019s ability to hypnotize to force her to leave with him. Something he hadn\u2019t known he could succeed in doing, not with Laila\u2019s spell waiting to strike. He should have had more faith in his woman. Jane was as aware of him as he was of her. The face he wore didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart.\u201d The sweetness of her scent infused with his cells. Her decadent taste filled his mouth. His blood heated, and every muscle in his body hardened, anticipating her touch.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you...do with the...real slave?\u201d Her tongue licked at his each time she paused to breathe.</p><p>\u201cSet him free.\u201d In more ways than one. Laila had scrambled the poor man\u2019s brain, until he hadn\u2019t known up from down, left from right, making herself the only tangible thing in his world, forcing him to cling to her.</p><p>Nicolai could have simply chained the poor man for the night and hidden him, but he\u2019d thought, That could have been me. He\u2019d used his own abilities to break through and remind the man of who he was and who he loved, removing Laila from the equation.</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d Jane\u2019s hold tightened on him, nearly breaking his ribs. Worth it, he thought. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we...escape, while we...have the chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. When the princess sleeps, I can invade her dreams, force her to hurt herself.\u201d Another ability he possessed. \u201cThen we\u2019ll leave. Return to Elden.\u201d Each sentence was punctuated with a deep, wet kiss that rocked him to his soul.</p><p>\u201cSo we need to do something to pass the time, huh?\u201d Jane returned her full attention to his tongue, sucking and rolling it with her own. Her hands slid through his hair, her nails scraping his scalp and leaving their mark.</p><p>He loved that she accepted his need for vengeance so easily. He loved that she clung to him, as desperate for closer contact as he was. But nothing would ever be close enough, not for either of them. He loved that she was smarter than he, and sometimes got lost in her own thoughts.</p><p>He just loved...her. Yes, he realized. He did. He loved her. He\u2019d fallen in love with her soon after she first appeared in his world. They\u2019d been strangers, but they\u2019d soon bonded. From the bond, caring had sprung. From the caring, love. But the desire...oh, the desire had always been there.</p><p>A glimmer of resentment in his chest. Not directed at her, but to the vampire who had cursed her. Nicolai could never tell her how he felt. She might return the sentiment and vanish.</p><p>\u201cI missed you. So much,\u201d he said, willing to confess that much but no more. \u201cThe separation was like being stabbed.\u201d Over and over again, the wound and pain never ending.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d She kissed and nipped a path along his jaw, his neck, licking and laving. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He disengaged from the erotic contact, and peered down at her. \u201cHome home?\u201d</p><p>She refused to stop. With a little leap, she was back in his arms and sucking on his pulse. \u201cYes, home home. My world.\u201d</p><p>Nicolai cupped her chin, forcing her to still, to look at him. Her eyes were glazed with passion, her lids at half-mast. His heart constricted at such a lovely sight. A shake of his head was required to put him back on track. \u201cLet me be clear on this. You left my world and returned to yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d almost lost her again. And he\u2019d had no idea! \u201cHow did you get back?\u201d he croaked.</p><p>A secret smile played at the edges of her lips. One that burned through him, deepening his arousal. \u201cApparently, when you gave me your blood, you gave me your ability to teleport, too.\u201d</p><p>Dark Abyss. He had never considered that possibility. Maybe because he\u2019d only ever shared his blood with his father, and his father had already possessed some of Nicolai\u2019s abilities.</p><p>\u201cAnd you came back to me.\u201d He\u2019d never been one to see fate\u2019s hand in his life, but now...if Jane hadn\u2019t been injured by the ogres, he wouldn\u2019t have given her his blood. If he hadn\u2019t given her his blood, he wouldn\u2019t have found a way to tie her to his side for the rest of their lives.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always come back to you.\u201d</p><p>A heavy weight lifted from his shoulders. The curse had somehow lost its power over her. Otherwise, she would have remained in her world.</p><p>He traced his thumbs over her cheekbones. \u201cI\u2019ve told you this before, but I want you to listen closely. I don\u2019t care if I have a thousand betrothed females waiting on me. You are all that matters.\u201d He would have only one woman. This woman. Forever.</p><p>He swooped back down, plunging his tongue past her teeth and into the sweet recesses of her mouth. She welcomed him with a moan.</p><p>He\u2019d been cold and detached with females most of his life. Oh, he\u2019d treated his mother and sister as the treasures they were, but everyone else he had never even given a second thought. He\u2019d been a prince, and they his due. Or so he\u2019d convinced himself.</p><p>Fate, he mused again. Had he not been a slave, desperate to escape, he might have treated Jane the same way. And that would have been a shame, to never have known her and the nuances of her personality. Unselfish, brave, stronger than anyone he knew, capable and honorable.</p><p>Honorable. Yes. He would never have to wonder where he stood with her. She would always tell him, whether he was a prince or a pauper. She would never be intimidated by him, would always challenge him.</p><p>\u201cI want you naked.\u201d He tugged at the shoulder straps of her robe, shoving the material to the floor. In seconds, emerald material pooled at her feet. He lifted her out of it, and settled her more firmly against his body. Skin-to-skin. Finally.</p><p>Every time she exhaled, their chests rubbed together, and he thrilled at the contact. She was hot and silky against him. Her nipples were beaded, rasping against the fine mat of hair he possessed. His shaft pressed to both their bellies, moisture seeping from the tip. He arched his hips, creating a delicious glide.</p><p>She arched to meet him, the friction sparking exquisitely. \u201cI can\u2019t ever get enough of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He traced his hands down the ridges of her spine, loving the goose bumps that jumped up to meet him. He cupped her ass. \u201cNo panties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone were given to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d If he had his way, she\u2019d never wear them again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I want you. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me. Nothing will separate us, Jane. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched. She toyed with the ends of his hair. \u201cI think so, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow so. I don\u2019t want to lose you. I can\u2019t lose you. I want to wed you. To be with you always. I choose you, Jane. Over my crown, my people and my vengeance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears welled in her eyes, creating amber pools. Nicolai tensed, waiting, unsure in a way he\u2019d never been before.</p><p>\u201cJust as I choose you,\u201d she said brokenly.</p><p>Thank the gods. He would have dropped to his knees and begged if necessary. \u201cI want to be your family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>A soft touch along his check. Jane\u2019s expression was so tender, tears filled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cJane. I love you.\u201d No reason to deny it now. \u201cI want to show you. Let me show you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open on a gasp. \u201cYou...you love me? I mean, I know you mentioned marriage, but this is the first you\u2019ve said of love and I...I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you. With all my heart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Nicolai.\u201d She threw herself at him, laughing and crying at the same time. \u201cI love you, too. So much.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her declaration was like stepping into a warm ray of the sun after an eternity spent in the cold darkness of winter. Something he hadn\u2019t known he needed, but now that he had it, he knew he couldn\u2019t live without it.</p><p>He drew her down to the floor. Her nipples were flushed and rosy, and he couldn\u2019t resist. He circled one with his tongue, flicked it until she moaned, then moved to the other. His fangs extended and ached. Now wasn\u2019t the time to indulge in the delight that was her blood, however. He\u2019d fed before coming to her, hoping to dull his hunger for her.</p><p>No other blood had ever affected him the way Jane\u2019s did. So powerful, so consuming. And while he wanted his memory back in full now, he would rather not disappear without warning again and have to track his woman\u2019s location, leaving her in danger.</p><p>Danger she could handle, as she\u2019d proven over and over again.</p><p>He eased up to study her. That honey-colored hair was spread around her shoulders, her eyes glazed and ravenous. She chewed on her bottom lip as she glided her hands along the roped planes of his stomach. She was a wanton sight, a goddess come from the heavens.</p> <p>He rose to his knees and guided her legs apart. So wet, so pink. He wanted to dive in, both with his mouth and with his cock. Sweat was already sheening his brow, his cells like little knives in his veins, demanding he take her, claim her. His woman. Now, always.</p><p>Not yet, not yet.</p><p>He had to prepare her. The first time they had sex, he\u2019d hurt her. Not that she\u2019d protested. She\u2019d been too tight, and he\u2019d been too eager. Not this time. This time she would enjoy every second.</p><p>He traced a finger up her hot center and she jerked as if struck by lightning.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She fisted her hands on the rug beneath her, and lifted her hips.</p><p>With the movement, his finger slid inside her of its own accord. Those inner walls closed around him, squeezing. He could have spilled then and there. Breathe, damn it. He worked that finger in and out, in and out, until she was writhing, mindless, gasping his name. Then he worked in a second finger. In and out, in and out.</p><p>Soon she was moaning every few seconds, rolling her hips in circles, seeking his thumb on her center. He gave it to her. For a moment. She cried out in relief\u2014and then groaned in distress when he took the pressure away.</p><p>A third finger joined the other two, in and out, in and out. Stretching her, spreading that sweet, sweet dew. When her muscles tensed, ready to lock down in climax, he severed all contact.</p> <p>\u201cPlease!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>Such a succulent entreaty. He used the hand wet with her juices on his cock, slicking himself up. He closed his eyes in ecstasy, loving the pressure as much as Jane had. Needing it. He stroked up...down....</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t.\u201d Her legs wound around his back, her ankles locking just above his ass; she tugged him down. Without anything to balance him, he fell on top of her. She gasped when his weight hit. \u201cPlease, Nicolai. Do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he rasped. He couldn\u2019t wait a second more, either.</p><p>He guided his tip to her entrance and thrust, deep and sure. They cried out in unison. Then she was coming, clenching around him, driving his need higher...higher. More, he had to have more. Wanted to bite her, wouldn\u2019t let himself bite her.</p><p>Instead, he sank his fangs into his own wrist. Blood laced his tongue. Blood still flavored with Jane. He wanted to suck, but he forced himself to release his vein and hold the wound over Jane\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cDrink,\u201d he commanded. They would do this every day. Would never risk her losing the ability to move between worlds.</p><p>Obeying, she closed her eyes. She looked as if she were...savoring? Oh, gods above, she was. The very idea sent his need soaring. His testicles drew up tight. Any moment now, he would explode. He wanted her with him, though, all the way.</p><p>\u201cHarder, Jane,\u201d he said, even as he increased the speed of his thrusts. He hit her so damned deep, making her gasp, but she never stopped drinking, and soon her hips were once again rising up to meet him. She was gulping greedily, moaning with every swallow.</p><p>My woman. Mine.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d shouted the words. \u201cYes,\u201d Jane responded, inner walls closing tighter and tighter around him as her second orgasm rocked her. \u201cYours.\u201d</p><p>This time, there was no holding back. She milked him, and he gave her every drop, shooting it inside her.</p><p>They clung together for several minutes, hours, years, shivering and shuddering until finally sagging to the floor. He couldn\u2019t quite catch his breath, couldn\u2019t quite form a rational thought, but even then he knew he didn\u2019t want to hurt her and rolled to his side.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was turning into a vampire, then convinced myself I wasn\u2019t,\u201d she said sleepily. \u201cBut I must be. Your blood...it tastes so damn good. I\u2019ve been craving it, like a drug. And now that I\u2019ve had more of it\u2014\u201d she shivered \u201c\u2014I feel so good.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. He hadn\u2019t known such a thing was possible. Unlike the nightwalkers, he was a living being, born rather than created. Making others simply wasn\u2019t\u2014hadn\u2019t been\u2014possible.</p><p>Besides, even if he\u2019d wanted to share his blood with others, which he hadn\u2019t, his human lovers had not wanted to drink from him. In fact, they had found the very idea disgusting. Same with the witches, and same with the shifters, though their objections had stemmed more from contamination of the species.</p><p>\u201cYou crave all blood or just mine?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust yours. Though the thought of drinking from others isn\u2019t as abhorrent as it should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other symptoms?\u201d He liked the thought of sharing this with her, but the complications scared him to his soul.</p><p>\u201cMy skin is a little more sensitive than normal. More sensitive than yours, I think. But, if I\u2019m becoming a vampire, a heightened sensitivity would make sense because I haven\u2019t yet had time to adjust.\u201d</p><p>How many other humans would tell him that becoming a vampire \u201cmakes sense\u201d? He almost smiled. Almost.</p><p>He would have to teach her how to feed, just in case they were parted for any amount of time. He tensed at the thought of her mouth on someone else. It\u2019s the only way. Cutting through a vein was not a skill you developed naturally, but one you had to learn.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about changing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA little afraid. A little excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me if you experience any other signs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her temple. \u201cRest now, sweetheart. I\u2019ll wake you in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll kill Laila?\u201d</p><p>See? Jane knew him better than anyone else he\u2019d ever known. \u201cYes. We\u2019ll kill Laila.\u201d He wondered if he could draw Jane into the dream, guarding her, preventing Laila from lashing at her while she was defenseless.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Her warm sigh caressed his skin as she snuggled more firmly against him. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>She fell asleep, and he began to plan their future together, ignoring a sudden and intense sense of foreboding.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>THEY DRESSED QUICKLY, quietly, and Jane packed a little bag of necessities. Such as the book\u2014Nicolai had been overjoyed to see it\u2014a few robes, snacks and a canteen of water. Laila had not brought any weapons for Odette to use, a fact that disappointed Jane but didn\u2019t surprise her.</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to invade her dreams?\u201d she asked Nicolai.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d He moved in front of her and gripped her shoulders. Once again he wore the slave\u2019s mask. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>She knew what that meant\u2014he would be in danger\u2014and her answer was hell, no. \u201cI\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>He sighed as if he\u2019d expected such a response and had already resigned himself to it. \u201cI do want to take you into the dream with me, and I will try to do so. Having never done something like that before, I don\u2019t know if it will work. Meanwhile, I want you to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He flicked his tongue over an incisor. \u201cIf I can\u2019t force her to harm herself, I\u2019ll have to absorb her powers. All of her powers and all the spells she has cast upon herself.\u201d</p><p>Jane\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou can do that?\u201d</p><p>A stiff nod. \u201cMost likely I will have to go that route. I tried to invade her dreams while you were sleeping and encountered an unexpected resistance. If the resistance is still there, while I\u2019m in close proximity to her, I\u2019ll have to do something to lower her guard to steal her magic. Something...nonviolent.\u201d</p><p>She began to understand, and wanted to throw up. Or maybe throw a punch. \u201cLike...kissing her?\u201d Or more?</p><p>Another nod, this one barely discernable.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just stab her?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNot without dying myself. She\u2019s cast a spell that causes any injury I attempt to inflict on her to be directed at myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so that\u2019s out.\u201d Jane nibbled on her bottom lip, felt the cuts already there and realized she had been doing a lot of nervous chewing lately. \u201cThat explains the power I felt wafting from her, I guess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou felt that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She squared her shoulders. \u201cAnd okay, fine.

Please tell me you\u2019ll be able to hurt her once you absorb her powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Absolute determination radiated from him. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess sticking your tongue down the devil\u2019s throat has a nice enough payoff.\u201d She punched him in the arm. \u201cGood luck, tiger.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again, this time far less strained. \u201cThank you. Now. Will you please stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, sorry. I may not possess any magic of my own, but Laila still assumes I\u2019m Odette. You might need me. Therefore, I\u2019m sticking to your side as if I\u2019ve been glued there.\u201d</p> <p>A moment passed in silence, then another. Finally he pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cAll right. You may come with me. If things do not progress as I hope, you are to run to Elden, and search out the prince Dayn. Trust no one else. Tell him you belong to me. Tell him you are my betrothed.\u201d</p><p>How sad he suddenly sounded. At the thought of losing her? \u201cAnd he\u2019ll believe me?\u201d Not that she would leave. She wouldn\u2019t, not for any reason. They would be together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve marked you, so yes. Yes, he will. He is a blood drinker, like me.\u201d</p><p>When he turned away, she grabbed his arm. A puny move but one that worked all the same. \u201cYou found your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I have a feeling you will succeed where I have failed.\u201d</p><p>Again, he went to leave. Again, she held on to him. \u201cSo you are a prince?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThe crown prince, destined to rule all of Elden.\u201d</p><p>This time, he remained in place, awaiting her response. She released him and shrugged. \u201cThat explains a lot.\u201d</p><p>He blinked down at her. \u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say on the subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He was royalty. So what? Everyone had a flaw.</p><p>She bent down, grabbed the strap of her pack and hefted the heavy thing onto her shoulder. The cord dug into her muscle, but she didn\u2019t allow herself to wince. Nicolai would take the burden upon himself, and he needed his hands free.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t expect me to be all humble and obey your every whim. That\u2019s not going to happen. So are we doing this or what?\u201d</p><p>His lashes fused, hiding his irises, as he leaned down, wrapped her in his arms and kissed her, softly, sweetly, a tender lover expressing his gratitude. For what? she wondered, then she forgot the question. Her lips tingled. Their tongues met briefly, and she tasted him. Wanted more. Always, she wanted more.</p><p>He straightened and sighed. \u201cI do not want her magic affecting you, Jane. If I fail and she turns on you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSticks and stones may break my bones, but I might be a vampire so I don\u2019t give a shit. I\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p><p>His brow knitted with confusion and anger. \u201cNo one will be breaking your bones.\u201d</p><p>She patted his cheek. \u201cI believe I\u2019ve already told you that I\u2019m going with you and that\u2019s final. Stop trying to talk me out of it.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he could feel her determination. Maybe he hated the thought of being apart as much as she did. Either way, his hands left her and he nodded. \u201cStubborn baggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that to mean delightful female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be right.\u201d He twined their fingers and ushered her outside, into the night. The moon was hidden behind thick, dark clouds, the air cool and moist. A storm must be brewing.</p><p>There was a campfire crackling a few feet away, casting golden rays and heat, but no guards around it. Actually, there was no sign of life anywhere. Not even in front of Laila\u2019s tent. Jane knew men patrolled the perimeter, however. She could hear their hearts beating. Thump-thump. Thump-thump.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s off,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Nicolai replied, his voice flat.</p><p>\u201cShe should have guards in front of her tent. Why did she send them away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must be expecting me.\u201d</p><p>Could they never catch a break? \u201cWe should leave. Come back another day. If she knows who you are, she\u2019ll attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, she will.\u201d His voice was still flat, but resolve gave it a dangerous edge. \u201cWe may be giving her too much credit. She may not know, may only suspect. Either way, she dies tonight.\u201d</p><p>He spoke like a man who knew he didn\u2019t have a lot of time. Jane recalled his need to return to Elden. A physical need that was slowly killing him, he\u2019d said. Perhaps that was the case here.</p><p>So, when he strode the short distance and swept inside the tent without pause, Jane made no protests. Lanterns were still lit, and her eyes adjusted instantly. Unlike earlier, no slaves danced in the center.</p><p>To her consternation, Laila was not asleep on her bed. She still lounged on her chaise, sipping from a goblet. Waiting.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d she said casually. She stroked the timepiece hanging around her neck. A timepiece that had not been there earlier. \u201cAnd now I have my answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d Nicolai shoved Jane behind him.</p><p>She placed her hands on his back, felt the muscles knot.</p><p>Fury colored Laila\u2019s expression for a split second before she smoothed her features. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay where you are, slave. And believe me, you won\u2019t be able to move from one location to another with only a thought, so don\u2019t even try.\u201d</p><p>Had she used her magic to root him in place? Jane moved beside him\u2014and yes, that was exactly what Laila\u2019d done, she realized as her own feet became as heavy as boulders. Laila hadn\u2019t moved, hadn\u2019t even blinked, yet somehow she\u2019d used her magic.</p><p>Dread blasted through her, little bombs that spread their poison quickly. \u201cMother will be very disappointed in you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWill she?\u201d Laila smiled, shifting her attention to Jane. \u201cOr will she be proud of me for destroying an imposter?\u201d</p><p>Breathe, just breathe.</p><p>\u201cEarlier, when I had that human female killed, I felt your upset and disgust. I wondered why. That is not something my sister ever felt. Then, I felt someone digging through my powers. I wondered who, but I didn\u2019t cast a spell to stop\u2014or hurt\u2014the person, because I also wondered what they wanted. Imagine my surprise when they\u2014he\u2014chose my magic mirror.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t ask. Couldn\u2019t. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cThen, imagine my further surprise when my very loyal slave ceased to desire me. The same way another slave of mine ceased to desire me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicolai never desired you,\u201d Jane spat.</p><p>Laila shrugged, unconcerned. \u201cHe never desired you, either. In fact, I think he was relieved when I took over his care. Then, suddenly, you return from the grave, and he can\u2019t tear his eyes away from you. He yearns for you, abducts you. Not to use you as a shield, but because he can\u2019t bear to be away from you. Something was wrong, and I knew it. Now, I know what that something is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just what do you know?\u201d Nicolai asked as calmly as if they were having Sunday brunch and discussing the next day\u2019s forecast.</p><p>Jane looked up at him. He\u2019d dropped the mask. There was his dark hair, his silver eyes. His wide shoulders, his muscles stretching the fabric of his dark blue robe. A beautiful man she would protect with her own life.</p><p>\u201cThe woman beside you is not my sister,\u201d Laila said. \u201cHer name is Jane, correct?\u201d</p><p>Breathe. \u201cI am Odette. You can\u2019t prove otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Well, perhaps you are right.\u201d Anger laced the princess\u2019s tone, the words as sharp as daggers. \u201cOnce, I could look through the eyes of others. Now that ability has been taken from me. No matter, though. I remembered how Nicolai used to talk to someone inside his cell. A woman. Jane. No one else could see her. We assumed him insane.\u201d She laughed smugly, and even her humor sliced. \u201cBut your name is Jane, I would bet, and you are human.\u201d</p><p>Jane could feel the fury pulsing off of Nicolai. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re the insane one.\u201d</p><p>Laila unfolded from the chair and stood. Her gaze swung to Nicolai. \u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t, slave. As you can tell, I\u2019ve cast a spell to prevent you from stealing any more of my powers. While the two of you...frolicked, I fortified my magic.\u201d Had he tried?</p><p>\u201cExcept,\u201d he said with a smile of his own, all white and lethal, \u201cany powers you use are mine to use, as well. That, you cannot prevent from happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t...\u201d Laila screeched. She\u2019d tried to step toward them, but her foot had stopped midair.</p><p>\u201cYes, I can. Holding you in place doesn\u2019t harm you physically, and, in fact, saves you from my claws. So you should be happy. Your protective spell is working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelease me, or I will scream for the guards.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow, taunting her. \u201cAnd you think they\u2019ll believe you concerning Odette? They won\u2019t, and we both know it. Your only chance is to release her. Do it, and we\u2019ll talk. You and I. Alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Because I\u2019m a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Jane said.</p><p>Laila scowled at her, but continued. \u201cVow that you won\u2019t try to kill me or use the powers that I use, and I\u2019ll consider it.\u201d</p><p>Nicolai opened his mouth to reply, probably to agree, but Jane stopped him. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I don\u2019t care what the two of you decide.\u201d And as soon as she was able, she was taking a crash course in Magic 101. She wanted to know the rules. What a witch could and couldn\u2019t do. She wanted to know how to stop them. How to defeat them.</p><p>\u201cHow about this, Nicolai,\u201d Laila said, smiling again. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out what kind of damage I can do to your Jane without ever taking a step.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A moment later, Jane felt as if her head was about to explode. She cried out, clutched her ears, felt warm drops of blood spill onto her palms. Her entire world focused on her throbbing brain, and she lost sight of everything around her.</p><p>Her knees buckled, but her feet were still locked into the rug-covered floor. She could only crouch, screaming and crying and praying for death. An eternity seemed to pass. But then, the pain stopped just as suddenly as it had hit her.</p><p>Gradually she became aware of her surroundings and realized Laila was now screaming.</p> <p>Nicolai, Jane thought distantly. Nicolai must have stolen her ability to squeeze minds\u2014or whatever she\u2019d done\u2014and was using it against the princess. But he was grunting, too, as if the pain was exploding through him.</p><p>Laila\u2019s screams ceased abruptly. Nicolai quieted a second later.</p><p>The only sound to be heard were panting, labored breaths. Jane tried to stand, but didn\u2019t have the strength. She saw that her bag had fallen and rested a few inches away. She was soaked with sweat, her robe seemingly a hundred pounds heavier.</p><p>She managed to turn her head and glance up at Nicolai. He wasn\u2019t looking at her, but at Laila, his eyes narrowed, hatred radiating from him.</p><p>\u201cYou saw what I saw,\u201d Laila gritted out. \u201cYour precious human studied your kind. Cut them up, hurt them. Tell me, were they your friends?\u201d</p> <p>Oh, no, Jane thought. No, no, no. Somehow he\u2019d known she had researched and done experiments on his kind, but he hadn\u2019t known the identities of her victims. Had she hurt one of his friends?</p><p>\u201cDo you still wish to protect her?\u201d Laila demanded. \u201cDo you still wish to be her lover?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Such heavy silence.</p><p>Please don\u2019t tell me you knew any of them. If he had, he would hate her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, princess?\u201d Nicolai said, his voice devoid of all emotion.</p> <p>A knot grew in Jane\u2019s throat, practically cutting off her air. He did. He hated her. She needed to apologize, to explain, but couldn\u2019t do so here, now.</p><p>He can\u2019t hate you. He loves you. He\u2019ll forgive you. Eventually. She hoped.</p><p>Laila\u2019s chin lifted, triumph flashing through her eyes. Such cruel green eyes. \u201cI want you to bind yourself to me. Forever.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cNo. What do I gain in return? Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll allow you to kill the girl.\u201d She motioned to Jane with a wave of her hand.</p><p>Acid burned a hole in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill her,\u201d he said, matter-of-fact, \u201cbut I don\u2019t need to enslave myself to do it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. Jane had become one of his enemies, his hated, must-be-destroyed-at-any-cost enemies. \u201cNicolai. Please. I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t deign to look at her. Just held up his hand to silence her. \u201cI took your memories. Me. I wanted you to save me. So, as you can see, I never truly wanted you. Only what you could do for me. Save your apologies.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d...what? Why would he...?</p><p>Everything rushed back, as if a glass cage had been shattered inside her mind. They had talked, they had shared. Discovered that she was cursed. He\u2019d known that forcing her to cross over, to save him, would endanger him. For that very reason, she had refused. He\u2019d taken her memory and forced her to do it.</p><p>At the time, she\u2019d thought she would resent him. Instead, she was glad he\u2019d done it. Glad she\u2019d helped him, freed him, made love with him. She even understood his reasoning. When she had been bed bound, she had tried to bargain with God for freedom. In that state of mind, you did things. Things you weren\u2019t always proud of.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she returned home permanently, though, as the curse dictated? She loved him. She should have lost him already.</p><p>Or was his hatred the thing that would keep them apart, not her absence? Her stomach somersaulted. \u201cI\u2019ll kill her, then,\u201d Laila said.</p><p>\u201cWith magic?\u201d Nicolai laughed. \u201cPlease do. Then I\u2019ll have the power to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I kill you, then the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me dead, princess. You want me pliant.\u201d His head tilted to the side. \u201cWhy did you bury my memories? Not of the girl, but of everything else. I know why you blocked my powers, but the memories...\u201d</p><p>A smug gleam entered her eyes. \u201cYou want to know, fine. I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m not the beast you think me, you know.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou appeared at the slave market in Delfina, and everyone assumed you were a Prince Nicolai look-alike. Everyone wanted to buy you. Me, Odette. The wealthy, the poor. Only Odette and I knew you truly were Prince Nicolai of Elden, crown prince, vampire, powerful beyond imagining.\u201d Again, she stroked the timepiece. \u201cYou fought wildly and managed to slay several people who simply approached you to study you closer. Then, you escaped.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened ever so slightly, an involuntary reaction Jane was sure. She figured he hadn\u2019t recalled that part of his life yet. She wanted to reach out to him, but feared he would reject her.</p><p>\u201cOdette had set you free, after blocking your powers. She wanted you away from the market, away from the prying eyes of others. News had just come from Elden that the king and queen had been slain.\u201d</p><p>A sharp intake of breath was Nicolai\u2019s only response. How Jane ached for him.</p><p>\u201cAs you can guess, Odette wouldn\u2019t have freed you if she had no way of capturing you. Yet still you proved elusive. She nearly succeeded a dozen times, because you kept trying to return to Elden, yet you always found a way to abandon her. When she at last caught you, she scoured the depths of your mind. You might not have witnessed the event, but you knew. You had heard the news, as we had, and magic had filled in the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cIn a bid to gain control of the lands, the Blood Sorcerer attacked. Your mother and father lay dying, and each cast a spell. Your mother, to send you away to safety. Your father, to fill you with a need for vengeance.\u201d</p><p>Jane could feel Nicolai\u2019s fury growing...sharpening....</p><p>\u201cOdette couldn\u2019t allow you to keep trying to return,\u201d Laila went on. \u201cNor could she allow you to search for your brothers and sister. Had they known you still lived, they would have come for you. So, they had to think you were dead, slain with your parents. That way, no one would ever come to your rescue.\u201d</p><p>His hands fisted.</p><p>\u201cAnd now,\u201d Laila went on, \u201cnow it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>\u201cTwenty years have passed since the Blood Sorcerer attacked the palace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head, once, twice. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d A fleeting smile. \u201cYou were as unaware of the passage of time as you were of your past. Odette made sure of it.\u201d Laila lifted her chin. \u201cSo. How about this for a bargain? I will help you defeat the Blood Sorcerer, if you kill the human. Right here, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd forget the crimes you have committed against me?\u201d he seethed.</p><p>At least he hadn\u2019t accepted right away, Jane thought darkly, dryly. That he would turn on her so savagely...she could not forgive. Unless this was a trick. Unless he meant to gain Laila\u2019s trust.</p><p>Hope eternal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either that, or I let the healer wipe your memory once again. We\u2019ve had to do so several times, you know.\u201d</p><p>Tighter and tighter those hands curled. \u201cYou would trust me not to hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You will take a blood oath not to. Before I release you, and after you kill the girl.\u201d</p><p>Jane gulped, her mouth going dry.</p><p>This time, Nicolai didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cVery well. Release us from your magical hold, and I vow never to kill or hurt you. Help me slay my enemy, and I...I will kill the girl.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>SUDDENLY JANE\u2019S FEET were freed. Nicolai snaked out an arm, catching her before she could bolt. Not that she would have. Or, yeah. She would have. Actually, even with his grip, she still could. All she had to do was disappear. To disappear, all she had to do was think of her home.</p><p>As the man she loved tugged her closer...closer...panic took over, her thoughts too chaotic to tame. Then, an unexpected calm took hold of her. This was the man she loved. The man who claimed to love her. The man who did love her. He might be angry with her\u2014furious, even\u2014but he wouldn\u2019t kill her. This was a trick to trap Laila.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t ever hurt her. She knew that on a bone-deep level. He was beautiful and wanton, wicked and yet principled. She\u2019d given herself to him body and soul. Now and forever, just as he\u2019d given himself to her. Nothing would change that, not even her past. She trusted him.</p><p>Blind trust had never come easily to her. She\u2019d always believed in proof. Testing theories, changing variables and watching reactions, but blind trust was what she was giving her man. He\u2019d come through for her time after time, and he would again.</p><p>Yes, she knew there was a dark side to his nature.</p><p>Hell, she\u2019d seen him in action on multiple occasions. No matter what, however, he would never turn that dark side on her. So, he had a plan. Pretending to want to kill her was part of it.</p><p>\u201cRelease me, too, princess,\u201d Nicolai said.</p><p>\u201cNo. Just the girl.\u201d</p><p>He growled, but that was the only indication he gave that he\u2019d heard her.</p><p>Jane couldn\u2019t let another moment go by without telling him how she felt. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Nicolai. I didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence.\u201d A lash, and yet he gave her the subtlest of nods, as if he wanted her to continue.</p><p>Still he dragged her closer, until her body was flush with his. His heat enveloped her, so familiar she relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI worked for the government, and yes, I studied your kind, but I never tortured and I never killed. I didn\u2019t know you at the time, and I didn\u2019t know what I did would hurt you or someone you loved. I just tried to help my people understand what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe. Quiet.\u201d His fangs flashed down at her, but again, he gave her the barest hint of a nod. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you.

While his expression was calm, stern, his heart beat erratically. He was not as unaffected as he seemed.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t look away from her when he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to drink from her neck, princess. I\u2019m also going to cover her mouth to prevent her from screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her scream,\u201d Laila said, anger soothed. \u201cI\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not have anyone rushing into this tent and watching. Nor do I want you nearing us until she\u2019s...dead.\u201d</p><p>Pretend. This is pretend, she reminded herself. Otherwise, he would have simply swooped down, savagely bit and sucked the life right out of her. Yet, here he stood, arguing with his tormentor, demanding certain concessions.</p><p>\u201cDo not tell me what to do, slave. I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill accept my terms or we are back to where we started.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Jane drew in a deep breath and tilted her head to the side as she exhaled, giving him easier access to her vein. His eyes widened, his pupils flaring. His fangs lengthened and sharpened a little more.</p><p>\u201cI want her on the floor,\u201d he croaked. \u201cRelease my feet, Laila. You can stop me again if I lunge for you.\u201d</p><p>Another pause.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Laila said on a sigh.</p><p>A second later, Nicolai was urging Jane the rest of the way to the ground.</p> <p>He loomed over her as he had countless other times. Her hair splayed around her shoulders, and her robe sagged.</p><p>\u201cNicolai,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cNot another word, Jane.\u201d The gold flecks in his eyes seemed to swirl. Down, down he leaned. Breath emerged from her lungs and mouth shallowly. Just as his teeth sank home, he flattened his hand over her mouth.</p><p>Her eyes flared. Her body bowed. Warm, electric pleasure entered with his teeth, shooting through every inch of her. He was sucking slowly, so slowly, taking little sips. And his hand...his hand was cut, his blood dripping into her mouth, down her throat and swirling in her belly.</p><p>He was feeding her even as he drank from her. His fingers tapped at her cheek, a bid for...something.</p><p>She had only to reason this out.</p><p>He\u2019d told Laila he would kill her. Therefore, he was pretending to kill her. And any time Jane had spoken up to soften him, he\u2019d told her to shut the hell up but had really wanted her to keep talking. So...he must want her acting panicked and disbelieving while acting uncaring himself.</p><p>She tested her theory, struggling against him, giving Laila a show. When Nicolai grunted his approval, she knew beyond any doubt. She pounded her fists into his shoulders, as if trying to shove him away. She bucked, as if trying to dislodge him.</p> <p>When the wound in his hand closed up, he ground his palm against her teeth to reopen the flesh. Once again, his blood trickled down her throat.</p><p>Then, he groaned, sucking a little harder at her vein, drawing a little more blood.</p><p>Enough, she thought she heard him say, but that was impossible. His lips were still on her vein. Enough. You have to stop. He lifted his head, panting, licked his lips, then dove back down, biting her in a new place. This, too, pumped pleasure straight into her veins.</p><p>Careful, careful, careful. Don\u2019t take too much. Slow down.</p><p>Jane frowned. Nicolai was speaking, but he was doing so straight into her head.</p><p>Have to time this just right. Again, his voice drifted through her head. The pressure against her vein eased.</p><p>Nicolai?</p><p>His body jerked against hers. Jane?</p><p>Yes. I can hear you, and now I\u2019m guessing you can hear me. How is that possible?</p><p>He licked her neck, careful not to let Laila see. Some blood drinkers share a mental connection.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d the princess snapped.</p><p>I need you to kill the princess for me.</p><p>Though he wanted the pleasure of doing so, he couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d vowed not to. Which meant, someone had to do it for him. So, that was his plan. To have Jane strike the lethal blow.</p><p>Consider it done.</p><p>Thank you. A pause. I\u2019m sorry for what I did to you. Before. And now.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, too. Her heart skipped a beat.</p><p>The princess has lowered her defenses, just as we hoped, and I\u2019ve absorbed some of her power. The spell that stopped anyone from hurting her is now mine. She\u2019ll still be strong, however, just not as strong.</p><p>Nicolai didn\u2019t drink much more. He even dribbled several mouthfuls of blood down Jane\u2019s neck and onto the ground. He was creating a mess, she knew. The illusion of death. She forced her struggles to slow...slow...until sagging limply, arms falling uselessly to her sides. She lay there, breathing as shallowly as possible. So much so she knew not even Nicolai could see the rise and fall of her chest.</p><p>Through tiny slits in her eyelids she watched him lift his head. Blood continued to drip from his chin, splashing on her collar and absorbing into her robe. He pressed two fingers into her nape, searching for a pulse. She knew what he felt: a wild, strong beat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d Nicolai severed all contact as he stood. \u201cI\u2019ve done my part. Now you do yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStep away from her,\u201d Laila said. \u201cI will check for myself.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. He moved to the other side of the tent, away from Jane, away from the princess.</p><p>But...just how was she supposed to kill the woman? She had no weapons, and Laila wasn\u2019t devoid of all her powers. She could cast a spell in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Come on, Parker. Think. Footsteps pattered. Body heat wafted. Think faster. Then the creak of bones echoed as Laila crouched. The body heat drew closer...closer...as the princess reached out.</p><p>The flicker of an idea presented itself. Dangerous, untested, but the only way. Nicolai, can she travel with only a thought, like you? Jane rushed out.</p><p>No.</p><p>Perfect. Laila\u2019s fingers pressed into Jane\u2019s neck. Jane opened her eyes, reached up and latched onto her wrist. A gasp of shock sounded. At the same time, Nicolai swooped in and grabbed the timepiece from around Laila\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he snapped. \u201cJane. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014?\u201d Laila began.</p><p>Before the princess could begin casting, Jane closed her eyes and pictured her home\u2014with Laila in it. Now that her mind was calm, her focus cold, it wasn\u2019t difficult. She saw her kitchen, experienced a wave of dizziness. Laila struggled against her, but as the dizziness intensified, the struggles slowed. For a moment, Jane felt as if she were floating, and tightened her grip on the princess.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you...what...?\u201d Laila\u2019s voice was weak, and Jane could hear an underlay of pain.</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d Nicolai shouted. \u201cJane! What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>When the dizziness left her, when she felt something hard and chilled pressing into her back, she looked around. She and Laila were inside her kitchen. Sunlight streamed in through the window, burning her so badly she actually sizzled. She rolled away with a hiss of pain, seeking the shade.</p><p>Nicolai hadn\u2019t teleported with Jane that night in the forest, but then, he hadn\u2019t been operating at full tilt. Most of his abilities had still been locked away. Tonight, he\u2019d been like a powder keg\u2014and so was Jane.</p><p>She stopped, flat on her back, Laila still in a crouch. The princess was pallid, sweating and...falling. She hit the floor, face-first.</p><p>Jane meant to leap away, grab a knife. That\u2019s the reason she\u2019d brought the witch here. Suddenly she could scent Laila\u2019s blood. It wasn\u2019t an altogether pleasant smell, and yet hunger twisted her stomach. Such raw, consuming hunger.</p><p>Before she realized she\u2019d even moved, she was angled toward the princess, her teeth sinking into her vein. Only a trickle of blood met her tongue. Frustration clawed at her. She angled her head, bit again. Again, only a trickle. She lifted, found the princess\u2019s pulse with her gaze, then swooped back down. This time, the blood flowed like a newly awakened river.</p><p>She should have had to chew to get what she wanted, a thought that grossed her out, but her gums were aching terribly, and her teeth\u2014fangs?\u2014had slid right in.</p><p>Warm, rushing life continued to fill her mouth. She moaned, dug her teeth in deeper, sucked harder, replenishing what she\u2019d lost.</p><p>She must have hit a nerve because Laila came out of her faint with a jolt, and tried to push Jane away. She tightened her hold, gulping and gulping and gulping. Soon, Laila ceased struggling. Went as limp as a rag. Jane continued to drink, physically unable to pull herself from the drug that was this woman\u2019s blood. Drug, yes. Because, with the blood, something else, something warmer, almost...fizzy, rushed through her.</p><p>Her cells practically exploded with energy.</p><p>Stop, you have to stop. If she took any more, she would kill the princess. She could hear the distant thump-thump of a heartbeat, and knew it was slowing, almost beyond repair. The flow of blood was trickling off, thinning.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to stop. I brought her here to kill her. Stopping defeats the purpose.</p><p>But in the back of her mind, she knew\u2014somehow, as if the memory were not her own\u2014that to kill this way was to live this way. One death would not be enough. She would drain everyone she drank from. Always. No one would be safe from her. Not even Nicolai.</p><p>Nicolai.</p><p>Panting, she jerked her teeth out of Laila. She flicked her tongue and, sure enough, she had fangs.</p><p>Nicolai had made her a vampire.</p><p>With a shaky hand, she brushed the hair from her face. When she caught sight of that hand in the light, she gasped.</p><p>She...glowed. Bright, golden, white lightning exploded from her skin. And the crackling in her veins...she felt like she could do anything. Until she moved her hand into a ray of that sunlight and started sizzling. She groaned with pain, her arm falling to her side.</p><p>Note to self: avoid the sun.</p><p>Another thing of note: You\u2019re here for a reason. Don\u2019t forget.</p><p>As if she could.</p><p>She leaped up and, knowing exactly where her knives were, grabbed one, careful to remain in the shadows. As she peered down at the woman who had enslaved Nicolai, taken away his rights, abused him physically and sexually\u2014for over twenty years!\u2014she found that she couldn\u2019t stab her. Couldn\u2019t kill the bitch that way, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Death would be too easy for Laila. You have to do something. When she wakes up, she\u2019ll use her magic against you.</p><p>Could she, though? This world was different from Laila\u2019s, with different metaphysical laws, different atmospheres. Would her magic work here? Nicolai\u2019s ability to cross from one world to the other worked in both places, but while Nicolai could withstand his own sun, he would not be able to withstand Jane\u2019s. Proof: she could tolerate his, but not hers. And she\u2019d dealt with this sun all her life.</p><p>She wished she had interviewed or dissected a witch\u2014and she didn\u2019t care what kind of monster people would think her for such a desire. But one had never been brought to her lab. Could that be because no one had known they were here? Could they not use any of their powers in this world, and were rendered human?</p> <p>There was one way to find out.</p><p>Jane dragged the princess to her bedroom, which was hard to do with her windows and drapes all open, found rope and tied the bitch to the bedposts. Not once did Laila awaken. Jane showered quickly, cleaning off the blood, then dressed in familiar jeans and a T-shirt. Felt odd, wearing her \u201cnormal\u201d clothes. Felt...wrong.</p><p>Trembling, she threw the robe in the washer. Nicolai? she cast out mentally, hoping for a reply. Are you out there? Are you okay? Soon as she took care of Laila, she would go back to him.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t yet bonded fully. Otherwise, neither of them would have been able to drink from others. She wanted to bond fully.</p><p>Jane returned to her bedroom, pushed a chair in front of the princess and waited. She wouldn\u2019t let herself think about Nicolai yet.</p> <p>Hours passed, ticking by slowly. Finally, though, Laila cracked open her eyes. She moaned, tugged at her bonds, frowned. Realization jolted her upright\u2014or rather, as much as possible.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Jane told her. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything to you that you haven\u2019t done to someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for this,\u201d Laila snarled.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re stuck here.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed, then another. Then, suddenly, Jane could hear the woman\u2019s voice in her head, as clearly as she\u2019d heard Nicolai\u2019s. What did she do to me? Why can\u2019t I use my magic?</p><p>Jane smiled. Well, well. One blessing at least. \u201cYou can\u2019t use your magic because you\u2019re in my world now.\u201d</p> <p>Laila gasped. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d Oh, great goddess. She has my powers. She has my powers!</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I am a vampire, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that!\u201d She\u2019s reading my mind, the bitch. I hate her! Now clear your mind. How did she become like Nicolai?</p><p>\u201cI drank his blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop doing that, I said.\u201d</p><p>Jane chewed on her bottom lip. If she could read minds, she could go deeper than surface thoughts. Right?</p><p>She focused more intently on Laila\u2019s thoughts.... Have to escape... How do I escape without my powers? I have to steal my powers back.</p><p>She probed a little deeper. Suddenly she was reliving the episode on her kitchen floor. Except, she saw and felt and heard through Laila\u2019s senses. Waking up to untutored fangs in her neck, weakened, unable to use her powers. Powers she\u2019d relied on her entire life. She had taken the princess\u2019s powers, Jane realized. That was what fizzed inside her veins.</p> <p>Nicolai could absorb other people\u2019s powers, and when Jane had consumed his blood, she must have developed that ability just like the teleportation.</p><p>She probed even deeper. There seemed to be a thousand different voices, a thousand flashes from the girl\u2019s life. She listened and watched for the things concerning Nicolai... There!</p><p>She watched, listened. Hated the princess all over again.</p><p>\u201cYou wiped Nicolai\u2019s mind,\u201d she growled as she came back to the present. She was shaking. \u201cYou told him\u2014and he thought\u2014a healer had done it.\u201d</p><p>Laila paled. \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d Laila had wiped his mind and bound his powers, then planted a new memory, one of the healer doing so. She hadn\u2019t wanted him to blame her. She\u2019d also tried to plant suggestions of love and adoration, but while she had manipulated his thoughts, she hadn\u2019t been able to manipulate his emotions.</p><p>And now I can do so, Jane thought. She wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to use the ability, so she latched onto every memory she could, pictured a black box and stuffed them inside, hiding them away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Laila demanded. \u201cStop... What...why...?\u201d</p><p>Jane remained silent. She worked for hours, grabbing and stuffing, grabbing and stuffing. When she finished, the cabin was dark and musty, and her body so weak she had already slid out of her chair.</p><p>She met Laila\u2019s gaze. A blank gaze. \u201cWho\u2014who are you?\u201d Panic sprouted. \u201cWho am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTit for tat,\u201d Jane said with a forced smile. When the sun set, she loaded Laila into her car, drove her into the nearest town and dropped her off. She was without powers, memory and money. She would have to place herself at someone else\u2019s mercy.</p><p>Mercy she might not find.</p><p>Jane returned home, pulled on her robe and threw herself on her bed. She pictured the tent where she\u2019d last seen Nicolai, but...nothing happened. She tried again...with the same result.</p><p>She tried for hours, the entire night. By morning she was a sobbing mess, weak, sick to her stomach. She couldn\u2019t do it. She couldn\u2019t return.</p><p>The curse had finally kicked in.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>THREE DAYS. WITHIN THREE DAYS, Nicolai\u2019s full memory was returned.</p><p>And now, holding his timepiece, he knew exactly what had happened to his parents. The Blood Sorcerer had launched a sneak attack, going for the king and queen first, allowing his monsters to ravage them. The hideous monsters from Nicolai\u2019s nightmares, the ones he\u2019d seen on the castle walkway and inside his bedroom.</p><p>Laila had it right. As the pair lay dying, they had cast separate spells. The queen, to send her children away. The king, to spark a need for vengeance. Both spells had bonded with him\u2014and his timepiece. A gift from his parents. All their children had one. Even Micah, the youngest.</p><p>Micah, just a baby.</p><p>Now, twenty years had passed. Micah was a man. Unless he\u2019d been trapped in a time standstill like Nicolai. And if he still lived.</p><p>Nicolai knew Dayn lived. Now that his memory and abilities were restored, so was his mind connection to the other blood drinker in the family. He could hear the turmoil of his brother\u2019s thoughts. Could feel the man\u2019s desperation.</p><p>Breena was out there, too. Rumor was, she was living with Berserkers. An impossibility. Berserkers had been wiped out long ago. So...where was she really?</p><p>And Jane...his Jane. Sometimes he could hear her as he heard Dayn. Distantly, the words and emotions muted. Don\u2019t think about her right now. You\u2019ll collapse.</p><p>He\u2019d never gotten to tell his beloved siblings goodbye. Nor had he gotten to tell his parents. His father had wanted so badly to see him wed. Betrothed at the very least, and Nicolai had agreed to bind himself to someone. Only, he never had. Not really. He\u2019d finally settled on the princess of Brokk, but he had never made a formal offer. And, oh, how his father had despaired.</p><p>While he could not give his father a bride\u2014if he couldn\u2019t have Jane, he would have no one\u2014he could at last give his father the vengeance he\u2019d used his last breath ensuring.</p><p>Nicolai knew he was not too late, for the timepiece continued to tick. When the hands stopped, then and only then would it be too late. But the hands were moving more quickly than they should have, meaning time was running out.</p><p>He would return to Elden, kill the sorcerer and claim his rightful place on the throne. Nothing would stop him. Tomorrow, he added. Nothing would stop him tomorrow. He could not bring himself to leave Laila\u2019s tent. Not yet. This was the last place he\u2019d seen and held Jane.</p><p>Jane.</p><p>You aren\u2019t supposed to think about her.</p><p>Beyond the tent, he could hear the rest of the camp rousing. Footsteps pounded closer and closer and he knew it was only a matter of minutes before someone ventured inside again. He pictured the Princess Laila, as he had done before, cloaking himself in her image.</p><p>Sure enough, the tent flap rose and two guards stepped inside, awaiting orders.</p><p>\u201cLeave this place,\u201d he found himself saying. \u201cGather everything and everyone else and return home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of you, princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying. Now go.\u201d</p><p>They bowed and exited, used to her abruptness. He\u2019d been casting illusions for years, and had once teased his brothers and sisters, pretending to be them\u2014in front of them. They had laughed, and begged for more.</p><p>The memory had his chest constricting. He would have liked to tease Jane that way.</p><p>Jane, he thought again. Her blood flowed through his veins, heating him up, making him ache and tingle. How was he supposed to live without her?</p><p>He didn\u2019t care what she\u2019d done in the past. How could he? She had already confessed her past to him, when he\u2019d been imprisoned, and she\u2019d appeared to him in phantom form.</p><p>He knew she thought he blamed her and perhaps even hated her. Was that why she stayed away? Had he failed to convince her otherwise when they\u2019d spoken in their minds?</p><p>There\u2019d been no other way. He\u2019d had to convince Laila he would kill her. So even though he\u2019d wanted to hug and kiss her and tell her how much he loved her, how there was nothing she could ever do to earn his hatred, he had glared at her, snapped at her.</p><p>She\u2019d returned to her own time. To save him. And now, enough time had passed that he feared she no longer possessed the ability to travel here. Or was the curse keeping her there? The curse he\u2019d thought he\u2019d overcome. Oh, yes, he realized. There was his answer.</p><p>He stalked to Jane\u2019s bag and dug inside, withdrawing the book. He\u2019d flipped through the blank pages a thousand times already. Each of those thousand times he\u2019d imagined casting another spell, one to bring her back to him.</p><p>Yet, how could he make such a spell work? How could he circumvent the curse that separated them? So far he had not...thought of... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A way.</p><p>Heart galloping, Nicolai found a pen, sat on Laila\u2019s lounge and started writing....</p><p>TWO WEEKS LATER, JANE returned from her midnight jog and found a box on her porch. The same box she\u2019d found before. She knew what rested inside it and gulped.</p> <p>Not a day had passed that she hadn\u2019t thought about Nicolai, cried for him, prayed to see him again. She found herself racing up the porch steps, grabbing the box and shoving her way inside the cabin.</p><p>Every day she\u2019d changed a little more. She still ate food, still needed it, but she also needed blood. Her midnight jogs, which she no longer needed to work the stiffness out of her muscles because her muscles didn\u2019t get stiff anymore, had become snack time. The deer ran from her, but like a lion with a gazelle, she always caught one.</p><p>The biggest change of all? She was pregnant. She\u2019d realized the truth only a few hours ago, and had been in a shocked daze ever since. She should have figured it out before now, having spent the past several mornings vomiting. More than that, Nicolai\u2019s blood had healed her spine and legs, so why not her reproductive system, too?</p><p>She wanted to see Nicolai, needed to tell him. Had to make love with him, laugh with him, hold on to him and never let go.</p><p>The bookbinding creaked as she opened the front flap. There was a tattered pink ribbon\u2014from one of her robes, she realized, her eyes filling with tears. Heart pounding against her ribs, she mentally read, her voice too wobbly to speak.</p> <p>\u201cMy name is Nicolai, and I am the crown prince of Elden. I will become king the day I kill the Blood Sorcerer. And I will kill him. After I tell my female that I love her.\u201d</p><p>She swiped at her burning eyes.</p><p>\u201cI will always love my Jane, and I am miserable without her. She thinks I despise her, but for the first time in her life, my too-intelligent woman is wrong. I did and said what I had to only to save her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she managed to work past the knot.</p><p>\u201cHer life is far more important to me than my own.\u201d</p><p>The words swam. Again, she swiped at her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cBut she is cursed. Cursed to lose the man she loves. And she has. She\u2019s lost him. Absolutely. But now...now she can find him again. If not through magic or abilities, than with her mind.\u201d</p><p>Jane wiped her eyes with the back of her wrist, trembling, hopeful, joyous, excited and scared. Scared, because Nicolai was offering her the world, but she had no way to tell him.</p><p>\u201cCome back to me, Jane. Please. Come back to me. I await you. I will await you forever.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the pages were blank.</p><p>Oh, Nicolai. I want to. I want to so badly. She stood on her shaky legs and walked, trancelike, into her shower. She sat and let the water pour over her, clothes and all. Nicolai wanted to see her, but she couldn\u2019t return. Every time she tried, she destroyed a little piece of her soul.</p><p>And yet, she gave it another try.</p><p>She closed her eyes and pictured the tent. Just like before, nothing happened. Just as she\u2019d feared. She tried again. And again. And again. Only when the water was cold as ice did she emerge from the stall. Don\u2019t give up hope. There\u2019s another way. Yes. Yes. With her mind, he\u2019d said.</p><p>Her mind.</p> <p>The next evening, she gathered all the necessary tools for transfer. Crudely, quickly constructed, but hopefully adequate. She donned her robe and placed the sensors of the machine along her bedposts. Trembling, she stretched out on her mattress, flipped the switch and closed her eyes. If she died because of this, okay. If she hurt herself, whatever. She refused to allow fear or anything else to stop her from doing whatever was necessary to reach her man. Refused to deny her baby the chance to know a father\u2019s love.</p><p>A slight buzzing in her ears. Sickness in her stomach. Her machine could work, she reminded herself, and had worked with plastic.</p><p>I\u2019m not plastic. Oh, God. Jane pictured her destination, trying to use Nicolai\u2019s ability alongside the man-made appliance. Several seconds ticked by. Seconds that felt like separate eternities. Finally she felt her body begin to heat...heard the buzzing increase in volume...felt the bed disappear from beneath her... Heat...more heat...</p><p>Buzzing, gone. Nothing. She was nothing.</p><p>\u201cJANE. SWEETHEART.\u201d</p><p>Nicolai. There was his voice, so close. Panting, she pried her eyelids open, and she saw that she was lying on the floor of the tent, Nicolai looming over her, his hands wrapped around her arms as he shook her.</p><p>She\u2019d done it. She\u2019d crossed over. Traveled to him, her mind the guide.</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d he said on a sigh of relief. There was no need for more words. Not yet.</p><p>An instant later they were kissing and pulling at each other\u2019s clothes. In seconds, they were naked and falling to the floor. No preliminaries. Nicolai shoved open her legs and thrust deep. Thrust home.</p><p>Jane cried out, already wet for him, needing him like she needed air to breathe. He pounded in and out, pushing her to heights she\u2019d only dreamed about these past two weeks.</p><p>Her nipples rasped his chest, sparking a fire. An inferno. Spreading through her, consuming her, and she erupted, screaming, screaming, clutching at him, scratching his back. And then his fangs were in her neck, and he was drinking, and she was climaxing again, angling her head and biting into his neck.</p><p>He roared as she drank him down, bucking against her, going even deeper, and soon shooting inside her. Glorious, necessary, life affirming.</p><p>When he collapsed against her, she held on tight. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever been happier. She was with her man, her love, the future bright.</p><p>\u201cYou got the book,\u201d he said, planting little kisses along her jaw.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Thank you for sending it. I couldn\u2019t get here. I wanted so badly to come back to you, but I couldn\u2019t move from one location to another in a blink anymore.\u201d</p><p>He propped his weight on his elbows and peered down at her. \u201cThank you. Thank you for coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d She cupped his cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019ll be happy to know Laila is now in the same position she placed you in.\u201d She\u2019d watched the news. Laila had been found, her image flashed, calling for anyone who might know her. And until someone claimed her, she\u2019d been locked in a mental institution for the violently insane.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about her. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Now. \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d</p><p>He lost a little of his good humor. \u201cYou look worried. Jane, you can tell me anything. I will never hate you. Never turn away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... Do you remember when I told you I couldn\u2019t have children?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can.\u201d A smile grew. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to. I found out a few days ago. We\u2019re going to be parents.\u201d</p><p>His mouth fell open, snapped closed. Fell open again. \u201cJane...I... Jane!\u201d With a whoop, he leaned down and kissed her again. \u201cYou are sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Another kiss. \u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d His smile was radiant. \u201cOh, Jane.\u201d He kissed her again and again, his hand constantly rubbing over her still-flat belly. \u201cI love you, and want you with me. Tell me you\u2019ll stay. Tell me you\u2019ll live with me. Marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201d She laughed, hugging him tight. \u201cIn case you don\u2019t understand, yes means yes.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled against her lips. \u201cI must still return to Elden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you will. With me. I adore you, Prince or King or whatever you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I adore you, Jane. My heart and my queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She cupped his cheeks, loving him more with every minute that passed. \u201cNow let\u2019s go to Elden and kick some ass.\u201d</p><p>THE DARKEST ANGEL</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>FROM HIGH IN THE HEAVENS, Lysander spotted his prey. At last. Finally, I will end this. His jaw clenched and his skin pulled tight. With tension. With relief. Determined, he jumped from the cloud he stood upon, falling quickly...wind whipping through his hair...</p><p>When he neared ground, he allowed his wings, long and feathered and golden, to unfold from his back and catch in the current, slowing his progress.</p><p>He was a soldier for the One True Deity. One of the Elite Seven, created before time itself. With as many millennia as he\u2019d lived, he\u2019d come to learn that each of the Elite Seven had one temptation. One potential downfall. Like Eve with her apple. When they found this...thing, this abomination, they happily destroyed it before it could destroy them.</p><p>Lysander had finally found his.</p><p>Bianka Skyhawk.</p><p>She was the daughter of a Harpy and a phoenix shape-shifter. She was a thief, a liar and a killer who found joy in the vilest of tasks. Worse, the blood of Lucifer\u2014his greatest enemy and the sire of most demon hordes\u2014flowed through her veins. Which meant Bianka was his enemy.</p><p>He lived to destroy his enemies.</p><p>However, he could only act against them when they broke a heavenly law. For demons, that involved escaping their fiery prison to walk the earth. For Bianka, who had never been condemned to hell, that would have to involve something else. What, he didn\u2019t know. All he knew was that he\u2019d never experienced what mortals referred to as \u201cdesire.\u201d</p><p>Until Bianka.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>He\u2019d seen her for the first time several weeks ago, long black hair flowing down her back, amber eyes bright and lips bloodred. Watching her, unable to turn away, a single question had drifted through his mind: Was her pearl-like skin as soft as it appeared?</p><p>Forget desire. He\u2019d never wondered such a thing about anyone before. He\u2019d never cared. But the question was becoming an obsession, discovering the truth a need. And it had to end. Now. This day.</p><p>He landed just in front of her, but she couldn\u2019t see him. No one could. He existed on another plane, invisible to mortal and immortal alike. He could scream, and she would not hear him. He could walk through her, and she would not feel him. For that matter, she would not smell or sense him in any way.</p><p>Until it was too late. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He could have formed a fiery sword from air and cleaved her head from her body, but didn\u2019t. As he\u2019d already realized and accepted, he could not kill her. Yet. But he could not allow her to roam unfettered, tempting him, a plague to his good sense, either. Which meant he would have to settle for imprisoning her in his home in the sky.</p><p>That didn\u2019t have to be a terrible ordeal for him, however. He could use their time together to show her the right way to live. And the right way was, of course, his way. What\u2019s more, if she did not conform, if she did finally commit that unpardonable sin, he would be there, at last able to rid himself of her influence.</p><p>Do it. Take her.</p> <p>He reached out. But just before he could wrap his arms around her and fly her away, he realized she was no longer alone. He scowled, his arms falling to his sides. He did not want a witness to his deeds.</p><p>\u201cBest day ever,\u201d Bianka shouted skyward, splaying her arms and twirling. Two champagne bottles were clutched in her hands and those bottles flew from her grip, slamming into the ice-mountains of Alaska surrounding her. She stopped, swayed, laughed. \u201cOopsie.\u201d</p><p>His scowl deepened. A perfect opportunity lost, he realized. Clearly, she was intoxicated. She wouldn\u2019t have fought him. Would have assumed he was a hallucination or that they were playing a game. Having watched her these past few weeks, he knew how much she liked to play games.</p><p>\u201cWaster,\u201d her sister, the intruder, grumbled. Though they were twins, Bianka and Kaia looked nothing alike. Kaia had red hair and gray eyes flecked with gold. She was shorter than Bianka, her beauty more delicate. \u201cI had to stalk a collector for days\u2014days!\u2014to steal that. Seriously. You just busted Dom P\u00e9rignon White Gold Jeroboam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d Mist wafted from Bianka\u2019s mouth. \u201cThey sell Boone\u2019s Farm in town.\u201d</p> <p>There was a pause, a sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s only acceptable if you also steal me some cheese tots. I used to highjack them from Sabin every day, and now that we\u2019ve left Budapest, I\u2019m in withdrawal.\u201d</p><p>Lysander tried to pay attention to the conversation, he really did. But being this close to Bianka was, as always, ruining his concentration. Only her skin was similar to her sister\u2019s, reflecting all the colors of a newly sprung rainbow. So why didn\u2019t he wonder if Kaia\u2019s skin was as soft as it appeared?</p><p>Because she is not your temptation. You know this.</p><p>There, atop a peak of Devil\u2019s Thumb, he watched as Bianka plopped to her bottom. Frigid mist continued to waft around her, making her look as if she were part of a dream. Or an angel\u2019s nightmare.</p><p>\u201cBut you know,\u201d Kaia added, \u201cstealing Boone\u2019s Farm in town doesn\u2019t help me now. I\u2019m only partially buzzed and was hoping to be totally and completely smashed by the time the sun set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be thanking me, then. You got smashed last night. And the night before. And the night before that.\u201d</p> <p>Kaia shrugged. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, your life is in a rut. You steal liquor, climb a mountain while drinking and dive off when drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then yours is in a rut, too, since you\u2019ve been with me each of those nights.\u201d The redhead frowned. \u201cStill. Maybe you\u2019re right. Maybe we need a change.\u201d She gazed around the majestic summit. \u201cSo what new and exciting thing do you want to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplain. Can you believe Gwennie is getting married?\u201d Bianka asked. \u201cAnd to Sabin, keeper of the demon of Doubt, of all people. Or demons. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>Gwennie. Gwendolyn. Their youngest sister.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s weird.\u201d A still-frowning Kaia eased down beside her. \u201cWould you rather be a bridesmaid or be hit by a bus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bus. No question. That, I\u2019d recover from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p> <p>Bianka did not like weddings? Odd. Most females craved them. Still. No need for the bus, Lysander wanted to tell her. You will not be attending your sister\u2019s wedding.</p><p>\u201cSo which of us will be her maid of honor, do you think?\u201d Kaia asked.</p><p>\u201cNot it,\u201d Bianka said, just as Kaia opened her mouth to say the same.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><p>Bianka laughed with genuine amusement. \u201cYour duties shouldn\u2019t be too bad. Gwennie\u2019s the nicest of the Skyhawks, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice when she\u2019s not protecting Sabin, that is.\u201d Kaia shuddered. \u201cI swear, threaten the man with a little bodily harm, and she\u2019s ready to claw your eyes out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink we\u2019ll ever fall in love like that?\u201d As curious as Bianka sounded, there was also a hint of sadness in her voice.</p><p>Why sadness? Did she want to fall in love? Or was she thinking of a particular man she yearned for? Lysander had not yet seen her interact with a male she desired.</p><p>Kaia waved a deceptively delicate hand through the air. \u201cWe\u2019ve been alive for centuries without falling. Clearly, it\u2019s just not meant to be. But I, for one, am glad about that. Men become a liability when you try and make them permanent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d was the reply. \u201cBut a fun liability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. And I haven\u2019t had fun in a long time,\u201d Kaia said with a pout.</p><p>\u201cMe, either. Except with myself, but I don\u2019t suppose that counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does the way I do it.\u201d</p><p>They shared another laugh.</p><p>Fun. Sex, Lysander realized, now having no trouble keeping up with their conversation. They were discussing sex. Something he\u2019d never tried. Not even with himself. He\u2019d never wanted to try, either. Still didn\u2019t. Not even with Bianka and her amazing (soft?) skin.</p><p>As long as he\u2019d been alive\u2014a span of time far greater than their few hundred years\u2014he\u2019d seen many humans caught up in the act. It looked...messy. As un-fun as something could be. Yet humans betrayed their friends and family to do it. They even willingly, happily gave up hard-earned money in exchange for it. When not taking part themselves, they became obsessed with it, watching others do it on a television or computer screen.</p><p>\u201cWe should have nailed one of the Lords when we were in Buda,\u201d Kaia said thoughtfully. \u201cParis is hawt.\u201d</p><p>She could only be referring to the Lords of the Underworld. Immortal warriors possessed by the demons once locked inside Pandora\u2019s box. As Lysander had observed them throughout the centuries, ensuring they obeyed heavenly laws\u2014since their demons had escaped hell before those laws were enacted, no one having thought escape possible, they had not been killed but thrust into that box first, and the Lords second\u2014he knew that Paris was host to Promiscuity, forced to bed a new person every day or weaken and die.</p><p>\u201cParis is hot, yes, but I liked Amun.\u201d Bianka stretched to her back, mist again whipping around her. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t speak, which makes him the perfect man, in my opinion.\u201d</p><p>Amun, the host of the demon of Secrets. So. Bianka liked him, did she? Lysander pictured the warrior. Tall, though Lysander was taller. Muscled, though Lysander was more so. Dark where Lysander was light. He was actually relieved to know the Harpy preferred a different type of male than himself.</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t change her fate, but it did lessen Lysander\u2019s burden. He hadn\u2019t been sure what he would have done if she\u2019d asked him to touch her. That she wouldn\u2019t was most definitely a relief.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Aeron?\u201d Kaia asked. \u201cAll those tattoos...\u201d A moan slipped from her as she shivered. \u201cI could trace every single one of them with my tongue.\u201d</p><p>Aeron, host of Wrath. One of only two Lords with wings, Aeron\u2019s were black and gossamer. He had tattoos all over his body, and looked every inch the demon he was. What\u2019s more, he had recently broken a spiritual covenant. Therefore, Aeron would be dead before the upcoming nuptials.</p><p>Lysander\u2019s charge, Olivia, had been ordered to slay the warrior. So far she had resisted the decree. The girl was too softhearted for her own good. Eventually, though, she would do her duty. Otherwise, she would be kicked to earth, immortal no longer, and that was not a fate Lysander would allow.</p><p>Of all the angels he\u2019d trained, she was by far his favorite. As gentle as she was, a man couldn\u2019t help but want to make her happy. She was trustworthy, loyal and all that was pure; she was the type of female who should have tempted him. A female he might have been able to accept in a romantic way. Wild Bianka...no. Never.</p><p>\u201cHowever will I choose between my two favorite Lords, B?\u201d Another sigh returned Lysander\u2019s focus to the Harpies.</p><p>Bianka rolled her eyes. \u201cJust sample them both. Not like you haven\u2019t enjoyed a twofer before.\u201d</p><p>Kaia laughed, though the amusement didn\u2019t quite reach her voice. Like Bianka, there was a twinge of sadness to the sound. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>Lysander\u2019s mouth curled in mild distaste. Two different partners in one day. Or at the same time. Had Bianka done that, too? Probably.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Kaia asked. \u201cYou gonna hook up with Amun at the wedding?\u201d</p><p>There was a long, heavy pause. Then Bianka shrugged. \u201cMaybe. Probably.\u201d</p><p>He should leave and return when she was alone. The more he learned about her, the more he disliked her. Soon he would simply snatch her up, no matter who watched, revealing his presence, his intentions, just to save this world from her dark influence.</p><p>He flapped his wings once, twice, lifting into the air.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want more than anything else in the world?\u201d she asked, rolling to her side and facing her sister. Facing Lysander directly, as well. Her eyes were wide, amber irises luminous. Beams of sunlight seemed to soak into that glorious skin, and he found himself pausing.</p><p>Kaia stretched out beside her. \u201cTo co-host Good Morning America?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, but that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m stumped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Bianka nibbled on her bottom lip. Opened her mouth. Closed her mouth. Scowled. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, but you can\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>The redhead pretended to twist a lock over her lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, K. Tell anyone, and I\u2019ll deny it then hunt you down and chop off your head.\u201d</p><p>Would she truly? Lysander wondered. Again, probably. He could not imagine hurting his Olivia, whom he loved like a sister. Maybe because she was not one of the Elite Seven, but was a joy-bringer, the weakest of the angels.</p><p>There were three angelic factions. The Elite Seven, the warriors and the joy-bringers. Their status was reflected in both their different duties and the color of their wings. Each of the Seven possessed golden wings, like his own. Warriors possessed white wings merely threaded with gold, and the joy-bringers\u2019 white wings bore no gold at all.</p><p>Olivia had been a joy-bringer all the centuries of her existence. Something she was quite happy with. That was why everyone, including Olivia, had experienced such shock when golden down had begun to grow in her feathers.</p> <p>Not Lysander, however. He\u2019d petitioned the Angelic Council, and they\u2019d agreed. It had needed to be done. She was too fascinated by the demon-possessed warrior Aeron. Too...infatuated. Ridding her of such an attraction was imperative. As he well knew.</p><p>His hand clenched into a fist. He blamed himself for Olivia\u2019s circumstances. He had sent her to watch the Lords. To study them. He should have gone himself, but he\u2019d hoped to avoid Bianka.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t just lie there. Tell me what you want to do more than anything else in the world,\u201d Kaia exclaimed, once again drawing his attention.</p><p>Bianka uttered another sigh. \u201cI want to sleep with a man.\u201d</p><p>Kaia\u2019s brow scrunched in confusion. \u201cUh, hello. Wasn\u2019t that what we were just discussing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, dummy. I mean, I want to sleep. As in, conk out. As in, snore my ass off.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in silence as Kaia absorbed the announcement. \u201cWhat! That\u2019s forbidden. Stupid. Dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Harpies lived by two rules, he knew. They could only eat what they stole or earned, and they could not sleep in the presence of another. The first was because of a curse on all Harpy-kind, and the second because Harpies were suspicious and untrusting by nature.</p><p>Lysander\u2019s head tilted to the side as he found himself imagining holding Bianka in his arms as she drifted into slumber. That fall of dark curls would tumble over his arm and chest. Her warmth would seep into his body. Her leg would rub over his.</p><p>He could never allow it, of course, but that didn\u2019t diminish the power of the vision. To hold her, protect her, comfort her would be...nice.</p><p>Would her skin be as soft as it appeared?</p> <p>His teeth ground together. There was that ridiculous question again. I do not care. It does not matter.</p><p>\u201cForget I said anything,\u201d Bianka grumbled, once more flopping to her back and staring up at the bright sky.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Your words are singed into my ears. Do you know what happened to our ancestors when they were stupid enough to fall asl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, okay. Yes.\u201d She pushed to her feet. The faux fur coat she wore was bloodred, same as her lips, and a vivid contrast to the white ice around her. Her boots were black and climbed to her knees. She wore skintight pants, also black. She looked wicked and beautiful.</p><p>Would her skin be as soft as it appeared?</p><p>Before he realized what he was doing, he was standing in front of her, reaching out, fingers tingling. What are you doing? Stop! He froze. Backed several steps away.</p><p>Sweet heaven. How close he\u2019d come to giving in to the temptation of her.</p><p>He could not wait any longer. Could not wait until she was alone. He had to act now. His reaction to her was growing stronger. Any more, and he would touch her. And if he liked touching her, he might want to do more. That was how temptation worked. You gave in to one thing, then yearned for another. And another. Soon, you were lost.</p> <p>\u201cEnough heavy talk. Let\u2019s get back to our boring routine and jump,\u201d Bianka said, stalking to the edge of the peak. \u201cYou know the rules. Girl who breaks the least amount of bones wins. If you die, you lose. For, like, ever.\u201d She gazed down.</p><p>So did Lysander. There were crests and dips along the way, ice bounders with sharp, deadly ridges and thousands of feet of air. Such a jump would have killed a mortal, no question. The Harpy merely joked about the possibility, as if it were of no consequence. Did she think herself invulnerable?</p><p>Kaia lumbered to her feet and swayed from the liquor still pouring through her. \u201cFine, but don\u2019t think this is the last of our conversation about sleeping habits and stupid girls who\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bianka dove.</p><p>Lysander expected the action, but was still surprised by it. He followed her down. She spread her arms, closed her eyes, grinning foolishly. That grin...affected him. Clearly she reveled in the freedom of soaring. Something he often did, as well. But she would not have the end she desired.</p><p>Seconds before she slammed into a boulder, Lysander allowed himself to materialize in her plane. He grabbed her, arms catching under hers, wings unfolding, slowing them. Her legs slapped against him, jarring him, but he didn\u2019t release his hold.</p><p>A gasp escaped her, and her eyelids popped open. When she spotted him, amber eyes clashing with the dark of his, that gasp became a growl.</p><p>Most would have asked who he was or demanded he go away. Not Bianka.</p><p>\u201cBig mistake, Stranger Danger,\u201d she snapped. \u201cOne you\u2019ll pay for.\u201d</p><p>As many battles as he\u2019d fought over the years and as many opponents as he\u2019d slain, he didn\u2019t have to see to know she had just unsheathed a blade from a hidden slit in her coat. And he didn\u2019t have to be a psychic to know she meant to stab him.</p><p>\u201cIt is you who made the mistake, Harpy. But do not worry. I have every intention of rectifying that.\u201d Before she could ensure that her weapon met its intended target, he whisked her into another plane, into his home\u2014where she would stay. Forever.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>BIANKA SKYHAWK GAPED at her new surroundings. One moment she\u2019d been tumbling toward an icy valley, intent on escaping her sister\u2019s line of questioning, as well as winning their break-the-least-amount-of-bones game, and the next she\u2019d been in the arms of a gorgeous blond. Which wasn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. She\u2019d tried to stab him, and he\u2019d blocked her. Freaking blocked her. No one should be able to block a Harpy\u2019s deathblow.</p><p>Now she was standing inside a cloud-slash-palace. A palace that was bigger than any home she\u2019d ever seen. A palace that was warm and sweetly scented, with an almost tangible sense of peace wafting through the air.</p><p>The walls were wisps of white and smoke, and as she watched, murals formed, seemingly alive, winged creatures, both angelic and demonic, soaring through a morning sky. They reminded her of Danika\u2019s paintings. Danika\u2014the All-Seeing Eye who watched both heaven and hell. The floors, though comprised of that same ethereal substance, allowing a view of the land and people below, were somehow solid.</p><p>Angelic. Cloud. Heaven? Dread flooded her as she spun to face the male who had grabbed her. \u201cAngelic\u201d described him perfectly. From the top of his pale head to the strength in that leanly muscled, sun-kissed body, to the golden wings stretching from his back. Even the white robe that fell to his ankles and the sandals wrapped around his feet gave him a saintly aura.</p><p>Was he an angel, then? Her heart skipped a beat. He wasn\u2019t human, that was for sure. No human male could ever hope to compare to such blinding perfection. But damn, those eyes...they were dark and hard and almost, well, empty.</p><p>His eyes don\u2019t matter. Angels were demon assassins, and she was as close to a demon as a girl could get. After all, her great-grandfather was Lucifer himself. Lucifer, who had spent a year on earth unfettered, pillaging and raping. Only a few females had conceived, but those that had soon gave birth to the first of the Harpies.</p><p>Unsure of what to do, Bianka strode around her blond; he remained in place, even when she was at his back, as if he had nothing to fear from her. Maybe he didn\u2019t. Obviously he had powers. One, he\u2019d blocked her\u2014she just couldn\u2019t get over that fact\u2014and two, he\u2019d somehow removed her coat and all her weapons without touching her.</p><p>\u201cAre you an angel?\u201d she asked when she was once again in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No hesitation. As if his heritage wasn\u2019t something to be ashamed of.</p><p>Poor guy, she thought with a shudder. Clearly he had no idea the crappy hand he\u2019d been dealt. If she had to choose between being an angel and a dog, she\u2019d choose the dog. They, at least, were respectable.</p><p>She\u2019d never been this close to an angel before. Seen one, yes. Or rather, seen what she\u2019d thought was an angel but had later learned was a demon in disguise. Either way, she hadn\u2019t liked the guy, her youngest sister\u2019s father. He considered himself a god and everyone else beneath him.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring me here to kill me?\u201d she asked. Not that he\u2019d have any luck. He would find that she was not an easy target. Many immortals had tried to finish her off over the years, but none had succeeded. Obviously.</p><p>He sighed, warm breath trekking over her cheeks. She had accidentally-on-purpose closed some of the distance between them; he smelled of the icecaps she so loved. Fresh and crisp with just a hint of earthy spice.</p><p>When he realized that only a whisper separated them, his lips, too full for a man but somehow perfect for him, pressed into a mulish line. Though she didn\u2019t see him move, he was suddenly a few more inches away from her. Huh. Interesting. Had he increased the distance on purpose?</p><p>Curious, she stepped toward him.</p><p>He backed away.</p><p>He had. Why? Was he scared of her?</p><p>Just to be contrary, as she often was, she stepped toward him again. Again, he stepped away. So. The big, bad angel didn\u2019t want to be within striking distance. She almost grinned.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she prompted. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I did not bring you here to kill you.\u201d His voice was rich, sultry, a sin all its own. And yet, there was a layer of absolute truth to it, and she suspected she would have believed anything he said. As if whatever he said was simply fated, meant to be. Unchangeable. \u201cI want you to emulate my life. I want you to learn from me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d What would he do if she touched him? The tiny gossamer wings on her own back fluttered at the thought. Her T-shirt was designed especially for her kind, the material loose to keep from pinning those wings as she jolted into super-speed. \u201cWait. Don\u2019t answer. Let\u2019s make out first.\u201d A lie, but he didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d he said, his patience clearly waning. \u201cThis is not a game. Do not make me bind you to my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhh, now that I like. Sounds kinky.\u201d She darted around him, running her fingertips over his cheek, his neck. \u201cYou\u2019re as soft as a baby.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a breath, stiffened. \u201cBianka.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut better equipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBianka!\u201d</p><p>She patted his butt. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will cease that immediately!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d She laughed, the amused, carefree sound echoing between them.</p> <p>Scowling, he reached out and latched onto her upper arm. There wasn\u2019t time to evade him; shockingly, he was faster than she was. He jerked her in front of him, and dark, narrowed eyes stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cThere will be no touching. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Her gaze flicked to his hand, still clutching her arm. \u201cAt the moment, you\u2019re the one touching me.\u201d</p><p>Like hers, his gaze fell to where they were connected. He licked his lips, and his grip tightened just the way she liked. Then he released her as if she were on fire and once again increased the distance between them.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand?\u201d His tone was hard and flat.</p><p>What was the problem? He should be begging to touch her. She was a desirable Harpy, damn it. Her body was a work of art and her face total perfection. But for his benefit, she said, \u201cYeah, I understand. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll obey.\u201d Her skin tingled, craving the return of his. Bad girl. Bad, bad girl. He\u2019s a stupid angel and therefore not an appropriate plaything.</p> <p>A moment passed as he absorbed her words. \u201cAre you not frightened of me?\u201d His wings folded into his back, arcing over his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, raising a brow and doing her best to appear unaffected. \u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Well, then, he\u2019d have to somehow grow the fiery claws of her father\u2019s people. That was the only thing that scared her. Having been scratched as a child, having felt the acid-burn of fire spread through her entire body, having spent days writhing in agonizing, seemingly endless pain, she would do anything to avoid such an experience again.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m still not. And now you\u2019re starting to bore me.\u201d She anchored her hands on her hips, glaring up at him. \u201cI asked you a question but you never answered it. Why do you want me to be like you? So much so, that you brought me into heaven, of all places?\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked below one of his eyes. \u201cBecause I am good and you are evil.\u201d</p><p>Another laugh escaped her. He frowned, and her laughter increased until tears were running from her eyes. When she quieted, she said, \u201cGood job. You staved off the boredom.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened. \u201cI was not teasing you. I mean to keep you here forever and train you to be sinless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGods, how\u2014 Oops, sorry. I mean, golly, how adorable are you? \u2018I mean to keep you here forever and train you,\u2019\u201d she said in her best impersonation of him. There was no reason to fight about her eventual escape. She\u2019d prove him wrong just as soon as she decided to leave. Right now, she was too intrigued. With her surroundings, she assured herself, and not the angel. Heaven was not a place she\u2019d ever thought to visit.</p><p>His chin lifted a notch, but his eyes remained expressionless. \u201cI am serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are. But you\u2019ll find that you can\u2019t keep me anywhere I don\u2019t want to be. And me? Without sin? Funny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall see.\u201d</p><p>His confidence might have unnerved her had she been less confident in her own abilities. As a Harpy, she could lift a semi as if it were no more significant than a pebble, could move faster than the human eye could see and had no problem slaying an unwelcome host.</p><p>\u201cBe honest,\u201d she said. \u201cYou saw me and wanted a piece, right?\u201d</p><p>For the briefest of moments, horror blanketed his face. \u201cNo,\u201d he croaked out, then cleared his throat and said more smoothly, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Insulting bastard. Why such horror at the thought of being with her? She was the one who should be horrified. He was clearly a do-gooder, more so than she\u2019d realized. I am good and you are evil, he\u2019d said. Ugh.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me again why you want to change me. Didn\u2019t anyone ever tell you that you shouldn\u2019t mess with perfection?\u201d</p><p>That muscle started ticking below his eye again. \u201cYou are a menace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, dude.\u201d She liked to steal\u2014so what. She could kill without blinking\u2014again, so what. It wasn\u2019t like she worked for the IRS or anything. \u201cWhere\u2019s my sister, Kaia? She\u2019s as much a menace as I am, I\u2019m sure. So why don\u2019t you want to change her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is still in Alaska, wondering if you are buried inside an ice cave. And you are my only project at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Project? Bastard. But she did like the thought of Kaia searching high and low but finding no sign of her, almost like they were playing a game of Hide and Seek. Bianka would totally, finally win.</p><p>\u201cYou appear...excited,\u201d he said, head tilting to the side. \u201cWhy? Does her concern not disturb you?\u201d</p><p>Yep. A certified do-gooder. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be here long.\u201d She peeked over his shoulder; more of that wisping white greeted her. \u201cGot anything to drink here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Slowly the corners of her lips lifted. \u201cI guess that means you like to go naked. Awesome.\u201d</p><p>His cheeks reddened. \u201cEnough. You are trying to bait me and I do not like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have brought me here.\u201d Hey, wait a minute. He\u2019d never really told her why he\u2019d chosen her as his project, she realized. \u201cBe honest. Do you need my help with something?\u201d After all, she, like many of her fellow Harpies, was a mercenary, paid to find and retrieve. Her motto: if it\u2019s unethical and illegal and you\u2019ve got the cash, I\u2019m your girl! \u201cI mean, I know you didn\u2019t just bring me here to save the world from my naughty influence. Otherwise, millions of other people would be here with me.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his massive chest.</p><p>She sighed. Knowing men as she did, she knew he was done answering that type of question. Oh, well. She could have convinced him otherwise by annoying him until he caved, but she didn\u2019t want to put the work in.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you do for fun around here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI destroy demons.\u201d</p><p>Like you, she finished for him. But he\u2019d already said he had no intention of killing her, and she believed him\u2014how could she not? That voice... \u201cSo you don\u2019t want to hurt me, you don\u2019t want to touch me, but you do want me to live here forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be an idiot to refuse such an offer.\u201d That she sounded sincere was a miracle. \u201cWe\u2019ll pretend to be married and spend the nights locked in each other\u2019s arms, kissing and touching, our bodies\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Just stop.\u201d And, drumroll please, that muscle began ticking under his eye again.</p><p>This time, there was no fighting her grin. It spread wide and proud. That tic was a sign of anger, surely. But what would it take to make that anger actually seep into his irises? What would it take to break even a fraction of his iron control?</p><p>\u201cShow me around,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to live here, I need to know where my walk-in closet is.\u201d During the tour, she could accidentally-on-purpose brush against him. Over and over again. \u201cDo we have cable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I cannot give you a tour. I have duties. Important duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do. My pleasure. That should be priority one.\u201d</p><p>Teeth grinding together, he turned on his heel and strode away. \u201cYou will find it difficult to get into trouble here, so I suggest you do not even try.\u201d His voice echoed behind him.</p><p>Please. She could get into trouble with nothing but a toothpick and a spoon. \u201cIf you leave, I\u2019ll rearrange everything.\u201d Not that there was any furniture to be seen.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get bored and take off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>It was a response, at least. \u201cSo you\u2019re seriously going to leave me? Just like that?\u201d She snapped her fingers.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Another response, though he didn\u2019t stop walking.</p><p>\u201cWhat about that bed you were going to chain me to? Where is it?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh, back to silence.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even tell me your name,\u201d she called, irritated despite herself. How could he abandon her like that? He should hunger for more of her. \u201cWell? I deserve to know the name of the man I\u2019ll be cursing.\u201d</p><p>Finally, he stopped. Still, a long while passed in silence and she thought he meant to ignore her. Again. Then he said, \u201cMy name is Lysander,\u201d and stepped from the cloud, disappearing from view.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>LYSANDER WATCHED AS TWO newly recruited warrior angels\u2014angels under his training and command\u2014finally subdued a demonic minion that had dug its way free from hell. The creature was scaled from head to hoof and little horns protruded from its shoulders and back. Its eyes were bright red, like crystallized blood.</p><p>The fight had lasted half an hour, and both angels were now bleeding, panting. Demons were notorious for their biting and scratching.</p><p>Lysander should have been able to critique the men and tell them what they had done wrong. That way, they would do a better job next time. But as they\u2019d struggled with the fiend, his mind had drifted to Bianka. What was she doing? Was she resigned to her fate yet? He\u2019d given her several days alone to calm and accept. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d one of his trainees asked. Beacon was his name.</p><p>\u201cYou letsss me go, you letsss me go,\u201d the demon said pleadingly, its forked tongue giving it a lisp. \u201cI behave. I return. Ssswear.\u201d</p><p>Lies. As a minion, it was a servant to a demon High Lord\u2014just as there were three factions of angels, there were three factions of demons. High Lords held the most power, followed by Lords, who were followed by the lowest of them all, minions. Despite this one\u2019s lack of status, it could cause untold damage among humans. Not only because it was evil, but also because it was a minion of Strife and took its nourishment from the trouble it caused others.</p> <p>By the time Lysander had sensed its presence on earth, it had already broken up two marriages and convinced one teenager to start smoking and another to kill himself.</p><p>\u201cExecute it,\u201d Lysander commanded. \u201cIt knew the consequences of breaking a heavenly law, yet it chose to escape from hell anyway.\u201d</p><p>The minion began to struggle again. \u201cYou going to lisssten to him when you obviousssly ssstronger and better than him? He make you do all hard work. He do nothing hissself. Lazy, if you asssk me. Kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do not ask you,\u201d Lysander said.</p><p>Both angels raised their hands and fiery swords appeared.</p> <p>\u201cPleassse,\u201d the demon screeched. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t do thisss.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t hesitate. They struck.</p><p>The scaled head rolled, yet the angels did not dematerialize their swords. They kept the tips poised on the motionless body until it caught flame. When nothing but ash remained, they looked to Lysander for instruction.</p><p>\u201cExcellent job.\u201d He nodded in satisfaction. \u201cYou have improved since your last killing, and I am proud of you. But you will train with Raphael until further notice,\u201d he said. Raphael was strong, intelligent and one of the best trackers in the heavens.</p><p>Raphael would not be distracted by a Harpy he had no hopes of possessing.</p><p>Possessing? Lysander\u2019s jaw clenched tightly. He was not some vile demon. He possessed nothing. Ever. And when he finished with Bianka, she would be glad of that. There would be no more games, no more racing around him, caressing him and laughing. The clenching in his jaw stopped, but his shoulders sagged. In disappointment? Couldn\u2019t be. Perhaps he needed a few days to calm and accept.</p> <p>HE\u2019D LEFT HER ALONE for a week, the sun rising and setting beyond the clouds. And each day, Bianka grew madder\u2014and madder. And madder. Worse, she grew weaker. Harpies could only eat what they stole (or earned, but there was no way to earn a single morsel here). And no, that wasn\u2019t a rule she could overlook. It was a curse. A godly curse her people had endured for centuries. Reviled as Harpies were, the gods had banded together and decreed that no Harpy could enjoy a meal freely given or one they had prepared themselves. If they did, they sickened terribly. The gods\u2019 hope? Destruction.</p><p>Instead, they\u2019d merely ensured Harpies learned how to steal from birth. To survive, even an angel would sin.</p><p>Lysander would learn that firsthand. She would make sure of it. Bastard.</p><p>Had he planned this to torture her?</p><p>In this palace, Bianka had only to speak of something and it would materialize before her. An apple\u2014bright and red and juicy. Baked turkey\u2014succulent and plump. But she couldn\u2019t eat them, and it was killing her. Liter-fucking-ally.</p><p>At first, Bianka had tried to escape. Several times. Unlike Lysander the Cruel, she couldn\u2019t jump from the clouds. The floor expanded wherever she stepped and remained as hard as marble. All she could do was move from ethereal room to ethereal room, watching the murals play out battle scenes. Once she\u2019d thought she\u2019d even spied Lysander.</p><p>Of course, she\u2019d said, \u201cRock,\u201d and a nice-sized stone had appeared in her hand. She\u2019d chucked it at him, but the stupid thing had fallen to earth rather than hit him.</p><p>Where was he? What was he doing? Did he mean to kill her like this, despite his earlier denial? Slowly and painfully? At least the hunger pains had finally left her. Now she was merely consumed by a sensation of trembling emptiness.</p> <p>She wanted to stab him the moment she saw him. Then set him on fire. Then scatter his ashes in a pasture where lots of animals roamed. He deserved to be smothered by several nice steaming piles. Of course, if he waited much longer, she would be the one burned and scattered. She couldn\u2019t even drink a glass of water.</p><p>Besides, fighting him wasn\u2019t the way to punish him. That, she\u2019d realized the first day here. He didn\u2019t like to be touched. Therefore, touching him was the way to punish him. And touch him she would. Anywhere, everywhere. Until he begged her to stop. No. Until he begged her to continue.</p><p>She would make him like it, and then take it away.</p><p>If she lasted.</p><p>Right now, she could barely hold herself up. In fact, why was she even trying?</p><p>\u201cBed,\u201d she muttered weakly, and a large four-poster appeared just in front of her. She hadn\u2019t slept since she\u2019d gotten here. Usually she crashed in trees, but she wouldn\u2019t have had the strength to climb one even if the cloud had been filled with them. She collapsed on the plush mattress, velvet coverlet soft against her skin. Sleep. She\u2019d sleep for a little while.</p><p>FINALLY LYSANDER COULD STAND it no more. Nine days. He\u2019d lasted nine days. Nine days of thinking about the female constantly, wondering what she was doing, what she was thinking. If her skin was as soft as it looked.</p><p>He could tolerate it no longer. He would check on her, that was all, and see for himself how\u2014and what\u2014she was doing. Then he would leave her again. Until he got himself under control. Until he stopped thinking about her. Stopped wanting to be near her. Her training had to begin sometime.</p><p>His wings glided up and down as he soared to his cloud. His heartbeat was a bit...odd. Faster than normal, even bumping against his ribs. Also, his blood was like fire in his veins. He didn\u2019t know what was wrong. Angels only sickened when they were infected with demon poison, and as Lysander had not been bitten by a demon\u2014had not even fought one in weeks\u2014he knew that was not the problem.</p><p>Blame could probably be laid at Bianka\u2019s door, he thought with a scowl.</p><p>First thing he noticed upon entering was the food littering the floor. From fruits to meats to bags of chips. All were uneaten, even unopened.</p><p>Scowl melting into a frown, he folded his wings into his back and stalked forward. He found Bianka inside one of the rooms, lying atop a bed. She wore the same clothing she\u2019d been clad in when he\u2019d first taken her\u2014red shirt, tights that molded to her perfect curves\u2014but had discarded her boots. Her hair was tangled around her, and her skin worryingly pale. There was no sparkle to it, no pearl-like gleam. Bruises now formed half-moons under her eyes.</p><p>Part of him had expected to find her fuming\u2014and out for his head. The other part of him had hoped to find her compliant. Not once had he thought to find her like this.</p><p>She thrashed, the covers bunched around her. His frown deepened.</p><p>\u201cHamburger,\u201d she croaked.</p><p>A juicy burger appeared on the floor a few inches from the bed, all the extras\u2014lettuce, tomato slices, pickles and cheese\u2014decorating the edges of the plate. The manifestation didn\u2019t surprise him. That was the beauty of these angelic homes. Whatever was desired\u2014within reason, of course\u2014was provided.</p><p>All this food, and she hadn\u2019t taken a single bite. Why would she request\u2014 It wasn\u2019t stolen, he realized, and for the first time in his endless existence, he was angry with himself. And scared. For her. He hated the emotion, but there it was. She hadn\u2019t eaten in these last nine days because she couldn\u2019t. She was truly starving to death.</p><p>Though he wanted her out of his head, out of his life, he hadn\u2019t wanted her to suffer. Yet suffer she had. Unbearably. Now she was too weak to steal anything. And if he force-fed her, she would vomit, hurting more than she already was. Suddenly he wanted to roar.</p><p>\u201cBlade,\u201d he said, and within a single blink, a sharp-tipped blade rested in his hand. He stalked to the side of the bed. He was trembling.</p><p>\u201cFries. Chocolate shake.\u201d Her voice was soft, barely audible.</p><p>Lysander slashed one of his wrists. Blood instantly spilled from the wound, and he stretched out his arm, forcing each drop to fall into her mouth. Blood was not food for Harpies; it was medicine. Therefore her body could accept it. He\u2019d never freely given his blood to another living being and wasn\u2019t sure he liked the thought of something of his flowing inside this woman\u2019s veins. In fact, the thought actually caused his heartbeat to start slamming against his ribs again. But there was no other way.</p><p>At first, she didn\u2019t act as if she noticed. Then her tongue emerged, licking at the liquid before it could reach her lips. Then her eyes opened, amber irises bright, and she grabbed on to his arm, jerking it to her mouth. Her sharp teeth sank into his skin as she sucked.</p><p>Another odd sensation, he thought. Having a woman drink from him. There was heat and wetness and a sting, yet it was not unpleasant. It actually lanced a pang of...something unnameable straight to his stomach and between his legs.</p><p>\u201cDrink all you need,\u201d he told her. His body would not run out. Every drop was replaced the moment it left him.</p><p>Her gaze narrowed on him. The more she swallowed, the more fury he saw banked there. Soon her fingers were tightening around his wrist, her nails cutting deep. If she expected some sort of reaction from him, she would not get it. He\u2019d been alive too long and endured far too many injuries to be affected by something so minor. Except for that pang between his legs... What was that?</p><p>Finally, though, she released him. He wasn\u2019t sure if that gladdened him or filled him with disappointment.</p><p>Gladdened, of course, he told himself.</p><p>A trickle of red flowed from the corner of her mouth, and she licked it away. The sight of that pink tongue caused another lance to shoot through him.</p><p>Definitely disap\u2014uh, gladdened.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard,\u201d she growled through her panting. \u201cYou sick, torturing bastard.\u201d</p><p>He moved out of striking distance. Not to protect himself, but to protect her. If she were to attack him, he would have to subdue her. And if he subdued her, he might hurt her. And accidentally brush against her.

And now, even his voice was trembling. Odd.</p><p>\u201cAnd that makes what you did okay?\u201d She jerked to a sitting position, all that dark hair spilling around her shoulders. The pearl-like sheen was slowly returning to her skin. \u201cYou left me here, unable to eat. Dying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Was that skin as soft as it looked? He gulped. \u201cAnd I am sorry.\u201d Her anger should have overjoyed him. As he\u2019d hoped, she would no longer laugh up at him, her face lit with the force of her amusement. She would no longer race around him, petting him. Yes, he should have been overjoyed. Instead, the disappointment he\u2019d just denied experiencing raced through him. Disappointment mixed with shame.</p> <p>She was more a temptation than he had realized.</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d she gasped out. \u201cYou know that I can only consume what I steal or earn and yet you failed to make arrangements for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he admitted, hating himself for the first time in his existence.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s more, you left me here. With no way home.\u201d</p><p>His nod was stiff. \u201cI have since made restitution by saving your life. But as I said, I am sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, well, you\u2019re sorry,\u201d she said, throwing up her arms. \u201cThat makes everything better. That makes almost dying acceptable.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for his reply. She kicked her legs over the bed and stood. Her skin was at full glow now. \u201cNow you listen up. First, you\u2019re going to find a way to feed me. Then, you\u2019re going to tell me how to get off this stupid cloud. Otherwise I will make your life a hell you\u2019ve never experienced before. Actually, I will anyway. That way, you\u2019ll never forget what happens when you mess with a Harpy.\u201d</p><p>He believed her. Already she affected him more than anyone else ever had. That was hell enough. Proof: his mouth was actually watering to taste her, his hands itching to touch her. Rather than reveal these new developments, however, he said, \u201cYou are powerless here. How would you hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPowerless?\u201d She laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d One step, two, she approached him.</p><p>He held his ground. He would not retreat. Not this time. Assert your authority. \u201cYou cannot leave unless I allow it. The cloud belongs to me and places my will above yours. Therefore, there is no exit for you. You would be wise to curry my favor.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath, paused. \u201cSo you still mean to keep me here forever? Even though I have a wedding to attend?\u201d She sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cWhen did I ever give you the impression that I meant otherwise? Besides, I heard you tell your sister you didn\u2019t want to go to that wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I said I didn\u2019t want to be a bridesmaid. But I love my baby sis, so I\u2019ll do it. With a smile.\u201d Bianka ran her tongue over her straight, white teeth. \u201cBut let\u2019s talk about you. You like to eavesdrop, huh? That sounds a little demonic for a goody-goody angel.\u201d</p><p>Over the years he\u2019d been called far worse than demonic. The goody-goody, though... Was that how she saw him? Rather than as the righteous soldier he was? \u201cIn war, I do what I must to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight.\u201d Her eyes narrowed as she crossed her arms over her middle. Stubbornness radiated from her. \u201cWe were at war before I even met you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d A war he would win. But what would he do if he failed to set her on the right path? He would have to destroy her, of course, but for him to legally be allowed to destroy her, he reminded himself, she would first have to commit an unpardonable sin. Though she\u2019d lived a long time, she had never crossed that line. Which meant she would have to be encouraged to do so. But how? Here, away from civilization\u2014both mortal and immortal\u2014she couldn\u2019t free a demon from hell. She couldn\u2019t slay an angel. Besides him, but that would never happen. He was stronger than she was.</p><p>She could blaspheme, he supposed, but he would never\u2014never!\u2014encourage someone to do that, no matter the reason. Not even to save himself.</p><p>The only other possibility was for her to convince an angel to fall. As she was his temptation, and as he was the only angel of her acquaintance, he was the only one she could convince. And he wouldn\u2019t. Again, not for any reason. He loved his life, his Deity, and was proud of his work and all he had accomplished.</p><p>Perhaps he would simply leave Bianka here, alone for the rest of eternity. That way, she could live but would be unable to cause trouble. He would visit her every few weeks\u2014perhaps months\u2014but never remain long enough for her to corrupt him.</p><p>A sudden blow to the cheek sent his head whipping to the side. He frowned, straightened and rubbed the now-stinging spot. Bianka was exactly as she\u2019d been before, standing in front of him. Only now she was smiling.</p> <p>\u201cYou hit me,\u201d he said, his astonishment clear.</p><p>\u201cHow sweet of you to notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d To be honest, he should not have been surprised. Harpies were as violent by nature as their inhuman counterparts, the demons. Why couldn\u2019t she have looked like a demon, though? Why did she have to be so lovely? \u201cI saved you, gave you my blood. I even explained why you could not leave, just as you asked. I did not have to do any of those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I really need to repeat your crimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d They were not crimes! But perhaps it was best to change the subject. \u201cAllow me to feed you,\u201d he said. He walked to the plate holding the hamburger and picked it up. The scent of spiced meat wafted to his nose, and his mouth curled in distaste.</p><p>Though he didn\u2019t want to, though his stomach rolled, he took a bite. He wanted to gag, but managed to swallow. Normally he only ate fruits, nuts and vegetables. \u201cThis,\u201d he said with much disgust, \u201cis mine.\u201d Careful not to touch her, he placed the food in her hands. \u201cYou are not to eat it.\u201d</p><p>By staking the verbal claim, the meal did indeed become his. He watched understanding light her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, cool.\u201d She didn\u2019t hesitate to rip into the burger, every crumb gone in seconds. Next he sipped the chocolate shake. The sugar was almost obscene in his mouth, and he did gag. \u201cMine,\u201d he repeated faintly, giving it to her, as well. \u201cBut next time, please request a healthier meal.\u201d</p><p>She flipped him off as she gulped back the ice cream. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>He bypassed the French fries. No way was he going to defile his body with one of those greasy abominations. He found an apple, a pear, but had to request a stalk of broccoli himself. After claiming them, he took a bite of each and handed them over. Much better.</p><p>Bianka devoured them. Well, except for the broccoli. That, she threw at him. \u201cI\u2019m a carnivore, moron.\u201d</p><p>She hardly had to remind him when the unpleasant taste of the burger lingered on his tongue. Still, he chose to overlook her mockery. \u201cAll of the food produced in this home is mine. Mine and mine alone. You are to leave it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great if I were actually staying,\u201d she muttered while stuffing the fries in her mouth.</p><p>He sighed. She would accept her fate soon enough. She would have to.</p><p>The more she ate, the more radiant her skin became. Magnificent, he thought, reaching out before he could stop himself.</p><p>She grabbed his fingers and twisted just before contact. \u201cNope. I don\u2019t like you, so you don\u2019t get to handle the goods.\u201d</p><p>He experienced a sharp pain, but merely blinked over at her. \u201cMy apologies,\u201d he said stiffly. Thank the One True Deity she\u2019d stopped him. No telling what he would have done to her had he actually touched her. Behaved like a slobbering human? He shuddered.</p><p>She shrugged and released him. \u201cNow for my second order. Let me go home.\u201d As she spoke, she assumed a battle stance. Legs braced apart, hands fisted at her sides.</p><p>He mirrored her movements, refusing to admit, even to himself, that her bravery heated his traitorous blood another degree. \u201cYou cannot hurt me, Harpy. Fighting me would be pointless.\u201d</p><p>Slowly her lips curled into a devilish grin. \u201cWho said I was going to try and hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Before Lysander could blink, she closed the distance between them and pressed against him, arms winding around his neck and tugging his head down. Their lips met and her tongue thrust into his mouth. Automatically, he stiffened. He had seen humans kiss more times than he could count, but he\u2019d never longed to try the act for himself.</p><p>Like sex, it seemed messy\u2014in every way imaginable\u2014and unnecessary. But as her tongue rolled against his, as her hands caressed a path down his spine, his body warmed\u2014far more than it had when he\u2019d simply thought of being here with her\u2014and the tingle he\u2019d noticed earlier bloomed once more. Only this time, that tingle grew and spread. Like the shaft between his legs. Rising...thickening...</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to taste her and now he was. She was delicious, like the apple she\u2019d just eaten, only sweeter, headier, like his favorite wine. He should make her stop. This was too much. But the wetness of her mouth wasn\u2019t messy in the least. It was electrifying.</p><p>More, a little voice said in his head.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she rasped, as if he\u2019d spoken aloud.</p><p>When she rubbed her lower body against his, every sensation intensified. His hands fisted at his sides. He couldn\u2019t touch her. Shouldn\u2019t touch her. Should stop this as she\u2019d stopped him, as he\u2019d already tried to convince himself.</p><p>A moan escaped her. Her fingers tangled in his hair. His scalp, an area he\u2019d never considered sensitive before, ached, soaking up every bit of attention. And when she rubbed against him again, he almost moaned.</p><p>Her hands fell to his chest and a fingertip brushed one of his nipples. He did moan; he did grab her. His fingers gripped her hips, holding her still even though he wanted to force her to rub against him some more. The lack of motion didn\u2019t slow her kiss. She continued to dance their tongues together, leisurely, as if she could drink from him forever. And wanted to.</p><p>He should stop this, he told himself yet again.</p><p>Yes. Yes, he would. He tried to push her tongue out of his mouth. The pressure created another sensation, this one new and stronger than any other. His entire body felt aflame. He started pushing at her tongue for an entirely different reason, twining them together, tasting her again, licking her, sucking her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMmm, yeah. That\u2019s the way,\u201d she praised.</p><p>Her voice was a drug, luring him in deeper, making him crave more. More, more, more. The temptation was too much, and he had to\u2014</p><p>Temptation.</p> <p>The word echoed through his mind, a sword sharp enough to cut bone. She was a temptation. She was his temptation. And he was allowing her to lead him astray.</p><p>He wrenched away from her, and his arms fell to his sides, heavy as boulders. He was panting, sweating, things he had not done even in the midst of battle. Angry as he was\u2014at her, at himself\u2014his gaze drank in the sight of her. Her skin was flushed, glowing more than ever. Her lips were red and swollen. And he had caused that reaction. Sparks of pride took him by surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou should not have done that,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Slowly, she grinned. \u201cWell, you should have stopped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to stop you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t,\u201d she said, that grin growing.</p><p>His teeth ground together. \u201cDo not do it again.\u201d</p><p>One of her brows arched in smug challenge. \u201cKeep me here against my will, and I\u2019ll do that and more. Much, much more. In fact...\u201d She ripped her shirt over her head and tossed it aside, revealing breasts covered by pink lace.</p><p>Breathing became impossible.</p><p>\u201cWant to touch them?\u201d she asked huskily, cupping them with her hands. \u201cI\u2019ll let you. I won\u2019t even make you beg.\u201d</p><p>Holy...Lord. They were lovely. Plump and mouthwatering. Lickable. And if he did lick them, would they taste as her mouth had? Like that heady wine? Blood...heating...again...</p> <p>He didn\u2019t care what kind of coward his next action made him. It was either jump from the cloud or replace her hands with his own.</p><p>He jumped.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>LYSANDER LEFT BIANKA alone for another week\u2014bastard!\u2014but she didn\u2019t mind. Not this time. She had plenty to keep her occupied. Like her plan to drive him utterly insane with lust. So insane he\u2019d regret bringing her here. Regret keeping her here. Regret even being alive.</p><p>That, or fall so in love with her that he yearned to grant her every desire. If that was the case\u2014and it was a total possibility since she was insanely hot\u2014she would convince him to take her home, and then she would finally get to stab him in the heart.</p><p>Perfect. Easy. With her breasts, it was almost too easy, really.</p><p>To set the stage for his downfall, she decorated his home like a bordello. Red velvet lounges now waited next to every door\u2014just in case he was too overcome with desire for her to make it to one of the beds now perched in every corner. Naked portraits\u2014of her\u2014hung on the misty walls. A decorating style she\u2019d picked up from her friend Anya, who just happened to be the goddess of Anarchy.</p><p>As Lysander had promised, Bianka had only to speak what she wanted\u2014within reason\u2014to receive it. Apparently furniture and pretty pictures were within reason. She chuckled. She could hardly wait to see him again. To finally begin.</p> <p>He wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. Not just because of her (magnificent) breasts and hotness\u2014hey, no reason to act as if she didn\u2019t know\u2014but because he had no experience. She had been his first kiss; she knew it beyond any doubt. He\u2019d been stiff at first, unsure. Hesitant. At no point had he known what to do with his hands.</p><p>That hadn\u2019t stopped her from enjoying herself, however. His taste...decadent. Sinful. Like crisp, clean skies mixed with turbulent night storms. And his body, oh, his body. Utter perfection with hard muscles she\u2019d wanted to squeeze. And lick. She wasn\u2019t picky.</p><p>His hair was so silky she could have run her fingers through it forever. His cock had been so long and thick she could have rubbed herself to orgasm. His skin was so warm and smooth she could have pressed against him and slept, just as she\u2019d dreamed about doing before she\u2019d met him. Even though sleeping with a man was a dangerous crime her race never committed.</p><p>Stupid girl! The angel wasn\u2019t to be trusted, especially since he clearly had nefarious plans for her\u2014though he still refused to tell her exactly what those plans were. Teaching her to act like him had to be a misdirection of the truth. It was just too silly to contemplate. But his plans didn\u2019t matter, she supposed, since he would soon be at her mercy. Not that she had any.</p><p>Bianka strode to the closet she\u2019d created and flipped through the lingerie hanging there. Blue, red, black. Lace, leather, satin. Several costumes: naughty nurse, corrupt policewoman, devil, angel. Which should she choose today?</p><p>He already thought her evil. Perhaps she should wear the see-through white lace. Like a horny virgin bride. Oh, yes. That was the one. She laughed as she dressed.</p><p>\u201cMirror, please,\u201d she said, and a full-length mirror appeared in front of her. The gown fell to her ankles, but there was a slit between her legs. A slit that stopped at the apex of her thighs. Too bad she wasn\u2019t wearing any panties.</p><p>Spaghetti straps held the material in place on her shoulders and dipped into a deep vee between her breasts. Her nipples, pink and hard, played peekaboo with the swooping make-me-a-woman pattern.</p><p>She left her hair loose, flowing like black velvet down her back. Her gold eyes sparkled, flecks of gray finally evident, like in Kaia\u2019s. Her cheeks were flushed like a rose, her skin devoid of the makeup she usually wore to dull its shimmer.</p><p>Bianka traced her fingertips along her collarbone and chuckled again. She\u2019d summoned a shower and washed off every trace of that makeup. If Lysander had found himself attracted to her before\u2014and he had, the size of his hard-on was proof of that\u2014he would be unable to resist her now. She was nothing short of radiant.</p><p>A Harpy\u2019s skin was like a weapon. A sensual weapon. Its jewel-like sheen drew men in, made them slobbering, drooling fools. Touching it became all they could think about, all they lived for.</p><p>That got old after a while, though, which was why she\u2019d begun wearing full body makeup. For Lysander, though, she would make an exception. He deserved what he got. After all, he wasn\u2019t just making Bianka suffer. He was making her sisters suffer. Maybe.</p><p>Was Kaia still looking for her? Still worried or perhaps thinking this was a game as Bianka had first supposed? Had Kaia called their other sisters and were the girls now searching the world over for a sign of her, as they\u2019d done when Gwennie went missing? Probably not, she thought with a sigh. They knew her, knew her strength and her determination. If they suspected she\u2019d been taken, they would have confidence in her ability to free herself. Still.</p><p>Lysander was an ass.</p><p>And most likely a virgin. Eager, excited, she rubbed her hands together. Most men kissed the women they bedded. And if she had been his first kiss, well, it stood to reason he\u2019d never bedded anyone. Her eagerness faded a bit. But that begged the question, why hadn\u2019t he bedded anyone?</p><p>Was he a young immortal? Had he not found anyone he desired? Did angels not often experience sexual need? She didn\u2019t know much about them. Fine, she didn\u2019t know anything about them. Did they consider sex wrong? Maybe. That would explain why he hadn\u2019t wanted to touch her, too.</p><p>Okay, so it made more sense that he simply hadn\u2019t experienced sexual need before.</p><p>He\u2019d definitely experienced it during their kiss, though. She went back to rubbing her hands together. \u201cWhat are you wearing? Or better yet, not wearing?\u201d</p><p>Heart skidding to a stop, Bianka whipped around. As if her thoughts had summoned him, Lysander stood in the room\u2019s doorway. Mist enveloped him and for a moment she feared he was nothing more than a fantasy.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>In her fantasies, he would not be angry. He would be overcome with desire. So...he was here, and he was real. And he was peering at her breasts in openmouthed astonishment.</p><p>Astonishment was better than anger. She almost grinned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d she asked, smoothing her palms over her hips. Let the games begin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Like it, she finished for him. With the amount of truth that always layered his voice, he probably couldn\u2019t utter a single lie.</p><p>\u201cYour skin...it\u2019s different. I mean, I saw the pearlesque tones before, but now...it\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d She twirled, her gown dancing at her ankles. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d His tongue traced his teeth as the anger she\u2019d first suspected glazed his features. \u201cCover her,\u201d he barked.</p><p>A moment later, a white robe draped her from shoulders to feet.</p><p>She scowled. \u201cReturn my teddy.\u201d The robe disappeared, leaving her in the white lace. \u201cTry that again,\u201d she told him, \u201cand I\u2019ll just walk around naked. You know, like I am in the portraits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPortraits?\u201d Brow furrowing, he gazed about the room. When he spotted one of the pictures of her, sans clothing, reclining against a giant silver boulder, he hissed in a breath.</p><p>Exactly the reaction she\u2019d been hoping for. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I turned this quaint little cloud into a love nest so I\u2019d feel more at home. And again, if you remove anything, my redesign will be a thousand times worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do to me?\u201d he growled, facing her. His eyes were narrowed, his lips thinned, his teeth bared.</p><p>She fluttered her lashes at him, all innocence. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBianka.\u201d</p><p>It was a warning, she knew, but she didn\u2019t heed it. \u201cI think it\u2019s my turn to ask the questions. So where do you go when you leave me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not your concern.\u201d</p><p>Was he panting a little? \u201cLet\u2019s see if I can make it my concern, shall we?\u201d She sauntered to the bed and eased onto the edge. Naughty, shameless girl that she was, she spread her legs, giving him the peek of a lifetime. \u201cFor every question you answer, I\u2019ll put something on,\u201d she said in a sing-song voice. \u201cDeal?\u201d</p><p>He spun, but not before she saw the shock and desire that played over his harshly gorgeous face. \u201cI do my duty. Watch the gates to hell. Hunt and kill demons that have escaped. Deliver punishment to those in need. Guard humans. Now cover yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say what item of clothing I\u2019d don, now did I?\u201d She gave herself a once-over. \u201cOne shoe, please. White leather, high heel, open toe. Ties up the calf.\u201d The shoe materialized on her foot, and she laughed. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA trickster,\u201d Lysander muttered. \u201cI should have known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I trick you? Did you ask for specifics? No, because you were secretly hoping I wouldn\u2019t cover myself at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is not true,\u201d he said, but for once, she did not hear that layer of honesty in his voice. Interesting. When he lied, or perhaps when he was unsure about what he was saying, his tone was as normal as hers.</p><p>That meant she would always know when he lied. Did things get any better than that?</p><p>This was going to be even easier than she\u2019d anticipated. \u201cNext question. Do you think about me while you\u2019re gone?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Thick, heavy.</p><p>Wait. She could hear him breathing. In, out, harsh, shallow. He was panting.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes,\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cBut since you really didn\u2019t answer, I don\u2019t have to add the other shoe.\u201d</p><p>Again, he didn\u2019t reply. Thankfully, he didn\u2019t leave, either.</p><p>\u201cOnward and upward. Are angels allowed to dally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but they rarely want to,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>So she\u2019d been right. He didn\u2019t have firsthand knowledge of desire. What he was now feeling had to be confusing him, then. Was that why he\u2019d brought her here? Because he\u2019d seen her and wanted her, but hadn\u2019t known how to handle what he was feeling? The thought was almost...flattering. In a stalkerish kind of way, of course. That didn\u2019t change her plans, however. She would seduce him\u2014and then she would slice his heart in two. A symbolic gesture, really. An inside joke between them. Well, for herself. He might not get it.</p><p>Still, she couldn\u2019t deny that she liked the idea of being his first. None of the women after her would compare, of course, and that\u2014 Hey, wait. Once he tasted the bliss of the flesh, he would want more. Bianka would have escaped him and stabbed him\u2014and he would have recovered because he was an immortal\u2014by then. He could go to any other female he desired.</p> <p>He would kiss and touch that female.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d she snapped back. Her hands were clenched, her nails cutting her palms. He could be with anyone; it wouldn\u2019t bother her. They were enemies. Someone else could deal with his Neanderthal tendencies. But gods, she might just kill the next woman who warmed his bed out of spite. Not jealousy.</p><p>\u201cI answered one of your questions. You must add a garment to your body. Panties would be nice.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019d like the other shoe to appear, please.\u201d A moment later, her other foot was covered. \u201cBack to business. Did you return so that I\u2019d kiss you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. I wanted to taste you again. I wanted to touch you again. Maybe let you touch me this time. I\u2019ve been aching since you left me. Had to bring myself to climax twice just to cool the fever. But don\u2019t worry, I imagined it was you. I imagined stripping you, licking you, sucking you into my mouth. Mmm, I\u2019m so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d he croaked out, spinning to face her. \u201cStop.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes, which she\u2019d once thought were black and emotionless, were now bright as a morning sky, his pupils blown with the intensity of his desire. But rather than stalk to her, grab her and smash his body into hers, he held out his hand, fingers splayed. A fiery sword formed from the air, yellow-gold flames flickering all around it.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he commanded again. \u201cI do not want to hurt you, but I will if you persist with this foolishness.\u201d</p><p>That layer of truth had returned to his voice.</p><p>Far from intimidating her, his forcefulness excited her. I thought you didn\u2019t like his Neanderthal tendencies.</p><p>Oh, shut up.</p><p>Bianka leaned back, resting her weight against her elbows. \u201cDoes Lysandy like to play rough? Should I be wearing black leather? Or is this a game of bad cop, naughty criminal? Should I strip for my body-cavity search?\u201d</p><p>He stalked to the edge of the bed, his thick legs encasing her smaller ones, pressing her knees together. He was hard as a rock, his robe jutting forward. Those golden flames still flickering around the sword both highlighted his face and cast shadows, giving him a menacing aura.</p><p>Just then, he was both angel and demon. A mix of good and evil. Savior and executioner.</p><p>Her wings fluttered frantically, readying for battle\u2014even as her skin tingled for pleasure. She could be across the room before he moved even a fraction of an inch. Still. She had trouble catching her breath; it was like ice in her lungs. And yet her blood was hot as his sword. This mix of emotions was odd.</p><p>\u201cYou are worse than I anticipated,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>If this progressed the way she hoped, he would be very happy about that one day. But she said, \u201cThen let me go. You\u2019ll never have to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that will purge you from my mind? That will stop the wondering and the craving? No, it will only make them worse. You will give yourself to others, kiss them the way you kissed me, rub against them the way you rubbed against me, and I will want to kill them when they will have done nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>What a confession! And she\u2019d thought her blood hot before... \u201cThen take me,\u201d she suggested huskily. She traced her tongue over her lips, slow and measured. His gaze followed. \u201cIt\u2019ll feel sooo good, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd discover if you are as soft and wet as you appear? Spend the rest of eternity in bed with you, a slave to my body? No, that, too, will only make my cravings worse.\u201d</p><p>Oh, angel. You shouldn\u2019t have admitted that. A slave to his body? If that was his fear, he more than craved her. He was falling. Hard. And now that she knew how much he wanted her...he was as good as hers. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to kill me,\u201d she said, swirling a fingertip around her navel, \u201ckill me with pleasure.\u201d</p><p>He stopped breathing.</p><p>She sat up, closing the rest of the distance between them. Still he didn\u2019t strike. She flattened her palms on his chest. His nipples were as beaded as hers. He closed his eyes, as if the sight of her, looking up at him through the thick shield of her lashes, was too much to bear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you in on a little secret,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m softer and wetter than I appear.\u201d</p><p>Was that a moan?</p><p>And if so, had it come from him? Or her? Touching him like this was affecting her, too. All this strength at her fingertips was heady. Knowing this gorgeous warrior wanted her\u2014her, and no other\u2014was even headier. But knowing she was the very first to tempt him, and so strongly, was the ultimate aphrodisiac.</p><p>\u201cBianka.\u201d Oh, yes. A moan.</p><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019d like, we can just lie next to each other.\u201d Said the spider to the fly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to touch. We don\u2019t have to kiss. We\u2019ll lie there and think about all the things we dislike about each other and maybe build up an immunity. Maybe we\u2019ll stop wanting to touch and to kiss.\u201d</p><p>Never had she told such a blatant lie, and she\u2019d told some big ones over the centuries. Part of her expected him to call her on it. The other part of her expected him to grasp on to the silly suggestion like a lifeline. Use it as an excuse to finally take what he wanted. Because if he did this, simply lay next to her, one temptation would lead to another. He wouldn\u2019t be thinking about the things he disliked about her\u2014he would be thinking about the things he could be doing to her body. He would feel her heat, smell her arousal. He\u2019d want\u2014need\u2014more from her. And she\u2019d be right there, ready and willing to give it to him.</p><p>She fisted his robe and gently tugged him toward her. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a try, don\u2019t you think? Anything\u2019s worth a try to make this madness stop.\u201d</p><p>When they were nose to nose, his breath trickling over her face, his gaze fastened on her lips, she began to ease backward. He followed, offering no resistance.</p><p>\u201cWant to know one of the things I dislike about you?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cYou know, to help get us started.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, as if he were too entranced to speak.</p><p>She decided to push a little faster than anticipated. He already seemed ready for more. \u201cThat you\u2019re not on top of me.\u201d Just a little more persuasion, and that would be remedied. Just a little... \u201cHow amazing would it feel to be that close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d an unfamiliar female voice suddenly called. \u201cAre you here?\u201d</p><p>Who the hell? Bianka scowled.</p><p>Lysander straightened, jerking away from her as if she had just sprouted horns. He stepped back, disengaging from her completely. But he was trembling, and not from anger.</p><p>\u201cIgnore her,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have important business to attend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLysander?\u201d the woman called again.</p><p>Damn her, whoever she was!</p><p>His expression cleared, melted to steel. \u201cNot another word from you,\u201d he barked, backing away. \u201cYou tried to lure me into bed with you. I don\u2019t think you meant to make me dislike you at all. I think you meant to\u2014\u201d A low snarl erupted from his throat. \u201cYou are not to try such a thing with me again. If you do, I will finally cleave your head from your body.\u201d</p><p>Well, this battle was clearly over. Not one to give up, however, she tried a different strategy. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to leave again? Coward! Well, go ahead. Leave me helpless and bored. But you know what? When I\u2019m bored, bad things happen. And next time you come back here, I just might throw myself at you. My hands will be all over you. You won\u2019t be able to pry me off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d the girl called again.</p><p>He ground his teeth. \u201cReturn to your cloud,\u201d he threw over his shoulder. \u201cI will meet you there.\u201d</p><p>He was going to meet another girl? At her cloud? Alone, private? Oh, hell, no. Bianka hadn\u2019t worked him into a frenzy so that someone else could reap the reward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before she could inform him of that, however, he said, \u201cGive Bianka whatever she wants.\u201d Talking to his own cloud, apparently. \u201cAnything but escape and more of those...outfits.\u201d His gaze intensified on her. \u201cThat should stave off the boredom. But I only agree to this on the condition that you vow to keep your hands to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Anything she wanted? She didn\u2019t allow herself to grin, the girl forgotten in the face of this victory. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so it is,\u201d he said, then spun and stalked from the room. His wings expanded in a rush, and he disappeared before she could follow. But then, there was no need to follow him. Not now.</p> <p>He had no idea that he\u2019d just ensured his own downfall. Whatever she wants, he\u2019d said. She laughed. She didn\u2019t need to touch him or wear lingerie to win their next battle. She just needed his return. Because then, he would become her prisoner.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>HE\u2019D ALMOST GIVEN IN.</p><p>Lysander could not believe how quickly he\u2019d almost given in to Bianka. One sultry glance from her, one invitation, and he\u2019d forgotten his purpose. It was shameful. And yet, it was not shame that he felt. It was more of that strange disappointment\u2014disappointment that he\u2019d been interrupted!</p><p>Standing before Bianka, breathing in her wicked scent, feeling the heat of her body, all he\u2019d been able to recall was the decadent taste of her. He\u2019d wanted more. Wanted to finally touch her skin. Skin that had glowed with health, reflecting all those rainbow shards. She\u2019d wanted that, too, he was sure of it. The more aroused she\u2019d become, the brighter those colors had glowed.</p> <p>Unless that was a trick? What did he truly know of women and desire?</p><p>She was worse than a demon, he thought. She\u2019d known exactly how to entrance him. Those naked photos had nearly dropped him to his knees. Never had he seen anything so lovely. Her breasts, high and plump. Her stomach, flat. Her navel, perfectly dipped. Her thighs, firm and smooth. Then, being asked to lie beside her and think of what he disliked about her...both had been temptations, and both had been irresistible.</p><p>He\u2019d known his resolve was crumbling and had wanted to rebuild it. And how better to rebuild than to ponder all the things he disliked about the woman? But if he had lain next to her, he would not have thought of what he disliked\u2014things he couldn\u2019t seem to recall then or now. He might have even thought about what he liked about her.</p><p>She was brilliant. She\u2019d had him.</p><p>He\u2019d never desired a demon. Had never secretly liked bad behavior. Yet Bianka excited him in a way he could not have predicted. So, what did he like most about her at the moment? That she was willing to do anything, say anything, to tempt him. He liked that she had no inhibitions. He liked that she gazed up at him with longing in those beautiful eyes.</p><p>How would she look at him if he actually kissed her again? Kissed more than her mouth? How would she look at him if he actually touched her? Caressed that skin? He suddenly found himself wanting to watch mortals and immortals alike more intently, gauging their reactions to each other. Man and woman, desire to desire.</p> <p>Just the thought of doing so caused his body to react the way it had done with Bianka. Hardening, tightening. Burning, craving. His eyes widened. That, too, had never happened before. He was letting her win, he realized, even though there was distance between them. He was letting his one temptation destroy him, bit by bit.</p><p>Something had to be done about Bianka, since his current plan was clearly failing.</p><p>\u201cLysander?\u201d</p><p>His charge\u2019s voice drew him from his dark musings. \u201cYes, sweet?\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s head tilted to the side, her burnished curls bouncing. They stood inside her cloud, flowers of every kind scattered across the floor, on the walls, even dripping from the ceiling.</p><p>Her eyes, as blue as the sky, regarded him intently. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been listening to me, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. Truth had always been his most cherished companion. That would not change now. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are forgiven,\u201d she said with a grin as sweet as her flowers.</p> <p>With her, it was that easy. Always. No matter how big or small the crime, Olivia couldn\u2019t hold a grudge. Perhaps that was why she was so treasured among their people. Everyone loved her.</p><p>What would other angels think of Bianka?</p><p>No doubt they would be horrified by her. He was horrified.</p><p>I thought you were not going to lie? Even to yourself. He scowled. Unlike the forgiving Olivia, he suspected Bianka would hold a grudge for a lifetime\u2014and somehow take that grudge beyond the grave.</p><p>For some reason, his scowl faded and his lips twitched at the thought. Why would that amuse him? Grudges were born of anger, and anger was an ugly thing. Except, perhaps, on Bianka. Would she erupt with the same amount of unrelenting passion she brought to the bedroom? Probably. Would she want to be kissed from her anger, as well?</p><p>The thought of kissing her until she was happy again did not delight him.</p><p>Usually he dealt with other people\u2019s anger the way he dealt with everything else. With total unconcern. It was not his job to make people feel a certain way. They were responsible for their own emotions, just as he was responsible for his. Not that he experienced many. Over the years, he\u2019d simply seen too much to be bothered. Until Bianka.</p><p>\u201cLysander?\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s voice once more jerked him from his mind. His hands fisted. He\u2019d locked Bianka away, yet she was still managing to change him. Oh, yes. His current plan was failing.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he have desired someone like sweet Olivia? It would have made his endless life much easier. As he\u2019d told Bianka, desire wasn\u2019t forbidden, but not many of their kind ever experienced it. Those that did only wanted other angels and often wed their chosen partner. Except in storybooks, he had never heard of an angel pairing with a different race\u2014much less a demon.</p><p>\u201c\u2014you go again,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>He blinked, hands fisting all the tighter. \u201cAgain, I apologize. I will be more diligent the rest of our conversation.\u201d He would make sure of it.</p><p>She offered him another grin, though this one lacked her usual ease. \u201cI only asked what was bothering you.\u201d She folded her wings around herself and plucked at the feathers, carefully avoiding the strands of gold. \u201cYou\u2019re so unlike yourself.\u201d</p><p>That made two of them. Something was troubling her; sadness had never layered her voice before, yet now it did. Determined to help her, he summoned two chairs, one for him and one for her, and they sat across from each other. Her robe plumed around her as she released her wings and twined her fingers together in her lap. Leaning forward, he rested his weight on his elbows.</p><p>\u201cLet us talk about you first. How goes your mission?\u201d he asked. Only that could be the cause. Olivia found joy in all things. That\u2019s why she was so good at her job. Or rather, her former job. Because of him, she was now something she didn\u2019t want to be. A warrior angel. But it was for the best, and he did not regret the decision to change her station. Like him, she\u2019d become too fascinated with someone she shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Better to end that now, before the fascination ruined her.</p><p>She licked her lips and looked away from him. \u201cThat\u2019s actually what I wanted to speak with you about.\u201d A tremor shook her. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do it, Lysander.\u201d The words emerged as a tortured whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can kill Aeron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, though he knew what she would say. But unlike Bianka, Aeron had broken a heavenly law, so there could be no locking him away and leading him to a righteous path.</p><p>If Olivia failed to destroy the demon-possessed male, another angel would be tasked with doing so\u2014and Olivia would be punished for her refusal. She would be cast out of the heavens, her immortality stripped, her wings ripped from her back.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t hurt anyone since his blood-curse was removed,\u201d she said, and he heard the underlying beseeching.</p><p>\u201cHe helped one of Lucifer\u2019s minions escape hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Legion. And yes, Aeron did that. But he ensures the little demon stays away from most humans. Those she does interact with, she treats with kindness. Well, her version of kindness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that Aeron helped the creature escape.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s shoulders sagged, though she in no way appeared defeated. Determination gleamed in her eyes. \u201cI know. But he\u2019s so...nice.\u201d</p><p>Lysander barked out a laugh. He just couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cWe are speaking of a Lord of the Underworld, yes? The one whose entire body is tattooed with violent, bloody images no less? That is the male you call nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of the etchings are violent,\u201d she mumbled, offended for some reason. \u201cTwo are butterflies.\u201d</p><p>For her to have found the butterflies amid the skeletal faces decorating the man\u2019s body meant she\u2019d studied him intently. Lysander sighed. \u201cHave you...felt anything for him?\u201d Physically?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked, but rosy color bloomed on her cheeks.</p><p>She had, then. \u201cNever mind.\u201d He scrubbed a hand down his suddenly tired face. \u201cDo you like your home, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>She blanched at that, as if she knew the direction he was headed. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like your wings? Do you like your lack of pain, no matter the injury sustained? Do you like the robe you wear? A robe that cleans itself and you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied softly. She gazed down at her hands. \u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know that you will lose all of that and more if you fail to do your duty.\u201d The words were harsh, meant for himself as much as for her.</p><p>Tears sprang into her eyes. \u201cI just hoped you could convince the council to rescind their order to execute him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not even try.\u201d Honest, he reminded himself. He had to be honest. Which he preferred. Or had. \u201cRules are put into place for a reason, whether we agree with those reasons or not. I have been around a long time, have seen the world\u2014ours, theirs\u2014plunged into darkness and chaos. And do you know what? That darkness and chaos always sprang from one broken rule. Just one. Because when one is broken, another soon follows. Then another. It becomes a vicious cycle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A moment passed as she absorbed his words. Then she sighed, nodded. \u201cVery well.\u201d Words of acceptance uttered in a tone that was anything but.</p><p>\u201cYou will do your duty?\u201d What he was really asking: Will you slay Aeron, keeper of Wrath, whether you want to or not? Lysander wasn\u2019t asking more of her than he had done himself. He wasn\u2019t asking what he wouldn\u2019t do himself.</p><p>Another nod. One of those tears slid down her cheek.</p> <p>He reached out and captured the glistening drop with the tip of his finger. \u201cYour compassion is admirable, but it will destroy you if you allow it so much power over you.\u201d</p><p>She waved the prediction away. Perhaps because she did not believe it, or perhaps because she believed it but had no plans to change and therefore didn\u2019t want to discuss it anymore. \u201cSo who was the woman in your home? The one in the portraits?\u201d</p><p>He...blushed? Yes, that was the heat spreading over his cheeks. \u201cMy...\u201d How should he explain Bianka? How could he, without lying?</p><p>\u201cLover?\u201d she finished for him.</p><p>His cheeks flushed with more of that heat. \u201cNo.\u201d Maybe. No! \u201cShe is my captive.\u201d There. Truthful without giving away any details. \u201cAnd now,\u201d he said, standing. If she could end a subject, so could he. \u201cI must return to her before she causes any more trouble.\u201d He must deal with her. Once and for all.</p> <p>OLIVIA REMAINED IN PLACE long after Lysander left. Had that blushing, uncertain, distracted man truly been her mentor? She\u2019d known him for centuries, and he\u2019d always been unflappable. Even in the heat of battle.</p><p>The woman was responsible, she was sure. Lysander had never kept one in his cloud before. Did he feel for her what Olivia felt for Aeron?</p><p>Aeron.</p><p>Just thinking his name sent a shiver down her spine, filling her with a need to see him. And just like that, she was on her feet, her wings outstretched.</p><p>\u201cI wish to leave,\u201d she said, and the floor softened, turning to mist. Down she fell, wings flapping gracefully. She was careful to avoid eye contact with the other angels flying through the sky as she headed into Budapest. They knew her destination; they even knew what she did there.</p><p>Some watched her with pity, some with concern\u2014as Lysander had. Some watched her with antipathy. By avoiding their gazes, she ensured no one would stop her and try and talk sense into her. She ensured she wouldn\u2019t have to lie. Something she hated to do. Lies tasted disgustingly bitter.</p> <p>Long ago, during her training, Lysander had commanded her to tell a lie. She would never forget the vile flood of acid in her mouth the moment she\u2019d obeyed. Never again did she wish to experience such a thing. But to be with Aeron...maybe.</p><p>His dark, menacing fortress was perched high on a mountain and finally came into view. Her heart rate increased exponentially. Because she existed on another plane, she was able to drift through the stone walls as if they were not even there. Soon she was standing inside Aeron\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>He was polishing a gun. His little demon friend, Legion, the one he\u2019d helped escape from hell, was darting and writhing around him, a pink boa twirling with her.</p><p>\u201cDance with me,\u201d the creature beseeched.</p><p>That was dancing? That kind of heaving was what humans did as they were dying.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019ve got to patrol the town tonight, searching for Hunters.\u201d</p><p>Hunters, sworn enemy of the Lords. They hoped to find Pandora\u2019s box and draw the demons out of the immortal warriors, killing each man. The Lords, in turn, hoped to find Pandora\u2019s box and destroy it\u2014the same way they hoped to destroy the Hunters.</p><p>\u201cMe hate Huntersss,\u201d Legion said, \u201cbut we needsss practice for Doubtie\u2019sss wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t be dancing at Sabin\u2019s wedding, therefore practice isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>Legion stilled, frowned. \u201cBut we dance at the wedding. Like a couple.\u201d Her thin lips curved downward. Was she...pouting? \u201cPleassse. We ssstill got time to practice. Dark not come for hoursss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I finish cleaning my weapons, I have to run an errand for Paris.\u201d Paris, Olivia knew, was keeper of Promiscuity and had to bed a new woman every day or he would weaken and die. But Paris was depressed and not taking proper care of himself, so Aeron, who felt responsible for the warrior, procured females for him. \u201cWe\u2019ll dance another time, I promise.\u201d Aeron didn\u2019t glance up from his task. \u201cBut we\u2019ll do it here, in the privacy of my room.\u201d</p><p>I want to dance with him, too, Olivia thought. What was it like, pressing your body against someone else\u2019s? Someone strong and hot and sinfully beautiful?</p><p>\u201cBut, Aeron...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart. I do these things because they\u2019re necessary to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Olivia tucked her wings into her back. Aeron needed to take time for himself. He was always on the go, fighting Hunters, traveling the world in search of Pandora\u2019s box and aiding his friends. As much as she watched him, she knew he rarely rested and never did anything simply for the joy of it.</p><p>She reached out, meaning to ghost a hand through Aeron\u2019s hair. But suddenly the scaled, fanged creature screeched, \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d clearly sensing Olivia\u2019s presence. In a blink, Legion was gone.</p><p>Stiffening, Aeron growled low in his throat. \u201cI told you not to return.\u201d</p><p>Though he couldn\u2019t see Olivia, he, too, always seemed to know when she arrived. And he hated her for scaring his friend away. But she couldn\u2019t help it. Angels were demon assassins and the minion must sense the menace in her.</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, but he couldn\u2019t hear her.</p><p>He returned the clip to his weapon and set it beside his bed. Scowling, he stood. His violet eyes narrowed as he searched the bedroom for any hint of her. Sadly, it was a hint he would never find.</p><p>Olivia studied him. His hair was cropped to his scalp, dark little spikes barely visible. He was so tall he dwarfed her, his shoulders so wide they could have enveloped her. With the tattoos decorating his skin, he was the fiercest creature she\u2019d ever beheld. Maybe that was why he drew her so intensely. He was passion and danger, willing to do anything to save the ones he loved.</p><p>Most immortals put their own needs above everyone else\u2019s. Aeron put everyone else\u2019s above his own. That he did so never failed to shock her. And she was supposed to destroy him? She was supposed to end his life?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m told you\u2019re an angel,\u201d he said.</p><p>How had he known what\u2014the demon, she realized. Legion might not be able to see her, either, but as she\u2019d already realized, the little demon knew danger when she encountered it. Plus, whenever Legion left him, she returned to hell. Fiery walls that could no longer confine her but could welcome her anytime she wished. Olivia\u2019s lack of success had to be a great source of amusement to that region\u2019s inhabitants.</p><p>\u201cIf you are an angel, you should know that won\u2019t stop me from cutting you down if you dare try and harm Legion.\u201d</p><p>Once again, he was thinking of another\u2019s welfare rather than his own. He didn\u2019t know that Olivia didn\u2019t need to bother with Legion. That once Aeron was dead, Legion\u2019s bond to him would wither and she would again be chained to hell.</p><p>Olivia closed the distance between them, her steps tentative. She stopped only when she was a whisper away. His nostrils flared as if he knew what she\u2019d done, but he didn\u2019t move. Wishful thinking on her part, she knew. Unless she fell, he would never see her, never smell her, never hear her.</p><p>She reached up and cupped his jaw with her hands. How she wished she could feel him. Unlike Lysander, who was of the Elite, she could not materialize into this plane. Only her weapon would. A weapon she would forge from air, its heavenly flames far hotter than those in hell. A weapon that would remove Aeron\u2019s head from his body in a mere blink of time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m told you\u2019re female,\u201d he added, his tone hard, harsh. As always. \u201cBut that won\u2019t stop me from cutting you down, either. Because, and here\u2019s something you need to know, when I want something, I don\u2019t let anything stand in the way of my getting it.\u201d</p><p>Olivia shivered, but not for the reasons Aeron probably hoped. Such determination...</p><p>I should leave before I aggravate him even more. With a sigh, she spread her wings and leapt, out of the fortress and into the sky.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>\u201cYOU, CLOUD, BELONG TO ME,\u201d Bianka said. That was not an attempt to escape, nor another sexy outfit, therefore it was acceptable. \u201cLysander gave you to me, so as long as I don\u2019t touch him, I get what I want. And I want you. I want you to obey me, not him. Therefore, you have to heed my commands rather than his. If I tell you to do something and he tells you not to, you still have to do it. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>And oh, baby, this was going to be fun.</p><p>The more she thought about it, the happier she was that she couldn\u2019t touch Lysander again. Really. Seducing\u2014or rather, trying to seduce\u2014him had been a mistake. She\u2019d basically ended up seducing herself. His heat...his scent...his strength... Give. Me. More.</p><p>Now, all she could think about was getting his weight back on top of her. About how she wanted to teach him where she liked to be touched. Once he\u2019d gotten the hang of kissing, he\u2019d teased and tantalized her mouth with the skill of a master. It would be the same with lovemaking.</p><p>She would lick each and every one of his muscles. She would hear him moan over and over again as he licked her.</p><p>How could she want those things from her enemy? How could she forget, even for a moment, how he\u2019d locked her away? Maybe because he was a challenge. A sexy, tempting, frustrating challenge.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter, though. She was done playing the role of sweet, horny prisoner. She still couldn\u2019t kill him; she\u2019d be stuck here for eternity. Which meant she\u2019d have to make him want to get rid of her. And now, as master of this cloud, she would have no problem doing so.</p><p>She could hardly wait to begin. If he stuck to past behavior, he\u2019d be gone for a week. He\u2019d return to \u201ccheck on\u201d her. Operation Cry Like A Baby could begin. Tomorrow she\u2019d plan the specifics and set the stage. A few ideas were already percolating. Like tying him to a chair in front of a stripper pole. Like enforcing Naked Tuesdays. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chuckling, she propped herself against the bed\u2019s headboard, yawned and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hold a bowl of Lysander\u2019s grapes,\u201d she said, and felt a cool porcelain bowl instantly press atop her stomach. Without opening her eyes, she popped one of the fruits into her mouth, chewed. Gods, she was tired. She hadn\u2019t rested properly since she\u2019d gotten here\u2014or even before.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. There were no trees to climb, no leaves to hide in. And even if she summoned one, Lysander could easily find her if he returned early\u2014</p> <p>Wait. No. No, he wouldn\u2019t. Not if she summoned hundreds of them. And if he dismissed all the trees, she would fall, which would awaken her. He would not be able to take her unaware.</p><p>Chuckling again, Bianka pried her eyelids apart. She polished off the grapes, scooted from the bed and stood. \u201cReplace the furniture with trees. Hundreds of big, thick, green trees.\u201d</p><p>In the snap of her fingers, the cloud resembled a forest. Ivy twined around stumps and dew dripped from leaves. Flowers of every color bloomed, petals floating from them and dancing to the ground. She gaped at the beauty. Nothing on earth compared.</p><p>If only her sisters could see this.</p><p>Her sisters. Winning a game or not, she missed them more with every second that passed. Lysander would pay for that, too.</p> <p>She yawned again. When she attempted to climb the nearest oak, her lingerie snagged on the bark. She straightened, scowled\u2014reminded once again of the way her dark angel had stalked to her, leaned into her, hot breath trekking over her skin.</p><p>\u201cI want to wear a camo tank and army fatigues.\u201d The moment she was dressed, she scaled to the highest bough, fluttering wings giving her speed and agility, and reclined on a fat branch, peering up into a lovely star-sprinkled sky. \u201cI\u2019d like a bottle of Lysander\u2019s wine, please.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers were clutching a flagon of dry red a second later. She would have preferred a cheap white, but whatever. Hard times called for sacrifices, and she drained the bottle in record time.</p><p>Just as she summoned a second, she heard Lysander shout, \u201cBianka!\u201d</p><p>She blinked in confusion. Either she\u2019d been up here longer than she\u2019d thought or she was hallucinating.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she have imagined a Lord of the Underworld? she wondered disgustedly. Oh, oh. How cool would it be if Lysander oil-wrestled a Lord? They\u2019d be wearing loincloths, of course, and smiles. But nothing else.</p> <p>And she could totally have that! This was her cloud, after all. She and Lysander were now playing by her rules. And, because she was in charge, he couldn\u2019t rescind his command that she be obeyed without her permission.</p><p>At least, she prayed that was the way this would work.</p><p>\u201cRemove the trees,\u201d she heard him snap.</p><p>She waited, unable to breathe, but the trees remained. He couldn\u2019t! Grinning, she jolted upright and clapped. She\u2019d been right, then. This cloud belonged to her.</p><p>\u201cRemove. The. Trees.\u201d</p><p>Again, they remained.</p><p>\u201cBianka!\u201d he snarled. \u201cShow yourself.\u201d</p><p>Anticipation flooded her as she jumped down. A quick scan of her surroundings revealed that he wasn\u2019t nearby. \u201cTake me to him.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked and found herself standing in front of him. He\u2019d been shoving his way through the foliage and when he spotted her, he stopped. He clutched that sword of fire.</p><p>She backed away, remaining out of reach. No touching. She wouldn\u2019t forget. \u201cThat for me?\u201d she asked, motioning to the weapon with a tilt of her chin. She\u2019d never been so excited in her life and even the sight of that weapon didn\u2019t dampen the emotion.</p><p>A vein bulged in his temples.</p><p>She\u2019d take that for a yes. \u201cNaughty boy.\u201d He\u2019d come to kill her, she thought, swaying a little. That was something else to punish him for. \u201cYou\u2019re back early.\u201d</p><p>His gaze raked her newest outfit, his pupils dilated and his nostrils flared. His mouth, however, curled in distaste. \u201cAnd you are drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you accuse me of such a thing!\u201d She tried for a harsh expression, but ruined it when she laughed. \u201cI\u2019m just tipsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to my cloud?\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest, the picture of stubborn male. \u201cWhy won\u2019t the trees disappear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you\u2019re wrong. This is no longer your cloud. Second, the trees will only leave if I tell them to leave. Which I am. Leave, pretty trees, leave.\u201d Another laugh. \u201cOh, my gods. I said leave to a tree. I\u2019m a poet and I didn\u2019t know it.\u201d Instantly, there was nothing surrounding her and Lysander but glorious white mist. \u201cThird, you\u2019re not going anywhere without my permission. Did you hear that, cloud? He stays. Fourth, you\u2019re wearing too many clothes. I want you in a loincloth, minus the weapon.\u201d</p><p>His sword was suddenly gone. His eyes widened as his robe disappeared and a flesh-colored loincloth appeared. Bianka tried not to gape. And she\u2019d thought the forest gorgeous. Wow. Just...wow. His body was a work of art. He possessed more muscles than she\u2019d realized. His biceps were perfectly proportioned. Rope after rope lined his stomach. And his thighs were ridged, his skin sun-kissed.</p><p>\u201cThis cloud is mine, and I demand the return of my robe.\u201d His voice was so low, so harsh, it scraped against her eardrums.</p><p>The sweet sound of victory, she thought. He remained exactly as she\u2019d requested. Laughing, she twirled, arms splayed wide. \u201cIsn\u2019t this fabulous?\u201d</p><p>He stalked toward her, menace in every step.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d She danced out of reach. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that. I want you in a large tub of oil.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, he was trapped inside a tub. Clear oil rose to his calves, and he stared down in horror.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like having your will overlooked?\u201d she taunted.</p><p>His gaze lifted, met hers, narrowed. \u201cI will not fight you in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly man. Of course you won\u2019t. You\u2019ll fight...\u201d She tapped her chin with a fingernail. \u201cLet\u2019s see, let\u2019s see. Amun? No. He won\u2019t speak and I\u2019d like to hear some cursing. Strider? As keeper of Defeat, he\u2019d ensure you lost to prevent himself from feeling pain, but that would be an intense battle and I\u2019m just wanting something to amuse me. You know, something light and sexy. I mean, since I can\u2019t touch you, I want a Lord to do it for me.\u201d</p><p>Lysander popped his jaw. \u201cDo not do this, Bianka. You will not like the consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s just sad,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here two weeks, but you don\u2019t know me at all. Of course I\u2019ll like the consequences.\u201d Torin, keeper of Disease? Watching him fight Torin would be fun, \u2019cause then he\u2019d catch that black plague. Or would he? Could angels get sick? She sighed. \u201cParis will have to do, I guess. He\u2019s handsy, so that works in my favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloud, place Paris, keeper of Promiscuity, into the tub with Lysander.\u201d</p><p>When Paris appeared a moment later, she clapped. Paris was tall and just as muscled as Lysander. Only he had black hair streaked with brown and gold, his eyes were electric blue and his face perfect enough to make her weep from its beauty. Too bad he didn\u2019t stir her body the way Lysander did. Making out with him in front of the angel would have been fun.</p><p>\u201cBianka?\u201d Paris looked from her to the angel, the angel to her. \u201cWhere am I? Is this some ambrosia-induced hallucination? What the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, you\u2019re overdressed. You should only be wearing a loincloth like Lysander.\u201d</p><p>His T-shirt and jeans were instantly replaced with said loincloth.</p><p>Best. Day. Ever. \u201cParis, I\u2019d like you to meet Lysander, the angel who abducted me and has been holding me prisoner up here in heaven.\u201d</p><p>Instantly Paris morphed from confusion to fury. \u201cReturn my weapons and I\u2019ll kill him for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such a sweetie,\u201d she said, flattening a hand over her heart. \u201cWhy is it we haven\u2019t slept together yet?\u201d</p><p>Lysander snarled low in his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked him, all innocence. \u201cHe wants to save me. You want to subjugate me for the rest of my long life. But anyway, let me finish the introductions. Lysander, I\u2019d like you to meet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who he is. Promiscuity.\u201d Disgust layered Lysander\u2019s voice. \u201cHe must bed a new woman every day or he weakens.\u201d</p><p>Another grin lifted the corners of her lips, this one smug. \u201cActually, he can bed men, too. His demon\u2019s not picky. I do hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind while you guys are rubbing up against each other.\u201d</p><p>Lysander took a menacing step toward her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Paris demanded again, glowering now. Bianka knew he was picky even if his demon wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? Lysander gave me control of his home, so now I get whatever I want and I want you guys to wrestle. And when you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll find Kaia and tell her what\u2019s happened, that I\u2019m trapped with a stubborn angel and can\u2019t leave. Well, I can\u2019t leave until he gets so sick of me he allows the cloud to release me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr until I kill you,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOr until Paris kills you. But I hope you guys will play nice for a little while, at least. Do you have any idea how sexy you both are right now? And if you want to kiss or something while rolling around, don\u2019t let me stop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Bianka,\u201d Paris began, beginning to look uncomfortable. \u201cKaia\u2019s in Budapest. She\u2019s helping Gwen with the wedding, and thinks you\u2019re hiding to get out of your maid of honor duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not maid of honor, damn it!\u201d But at least Kaia wasn\u2019t worried. The bitch, she thought with affection.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what she says. Anyway, I don\u2019t mind fighting another dude to amuse you, but seriously, he\u2019s an angel. I need to return to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to thank me.\u201d She held out her hands. \u201cA bowl of Lysander\u2019s popcorn, please.\u201d The bowl appeared, the scent of butter wafting to her nose. \u201cNow then. Let\u2019s get this party started. Ding, ding,\u201d she said, and settled down to watch the battle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>LYSANDER COULD NOT BELIEVE what he was being forced to do. He was angry, horrified and, yes, contrite. Hadn\u2019t he done something similar to Bianka? Granted, he hadn\u2019t stripped her down. Hadn\u2019t pitted her against another female.</p><p>There was the tightening in his groin again.</p> <p>What was wrong with him?</p><p>\u201cI will set you free,\u201d he told Bianka. And sweet Holy Deity, she looked beautiful. More tempting than when she\u2019d worn that little bit of nothing. Now she wore a green and black tank that bared her golden arms. Were those arms as soft as they appeared? Don\u2019t think like that. Her shirt stopped just above her navel, making his mouth water, his tongue yearn to dip inside. What did I just say? Don\u2019t think like that. Her pants were the same dark shades and hung low on her hips.</p><p>He\u2019d come here to fight her, to finally force her hand, and judging by that outfit, she\u2019d been ready for combat. That...excited him. Not because their bodies would have been in close proximity\u2014really\u2014and not because he could have finally gotten his hands on her\u2014again, really\u2014but because, if she injured him, he would have the right to end her life. Finally.</p><p>But he\u2019d come here and she\u2019d taught him a quick yet unforgettable lesson instead. He\u2019d been wrong to whisk her to his home and hold her captive. Temptation or not. She might be his enemy in ways she didn\u2019t understand, but he never should have put his will above hers. He should have allowed her to live her life as she saw fit.</p><p>That\u2019s why he existed in the first place. To protect free will.</p> <p>When this wrestling match ended, he would free her as he\u2019d promised. He would watch her, though. Closely. And when she made a mistake, he would strike her down. And she would. Make a mistake, that is. As a Harpy, she wouldn\u2019t be able to help herself. He wished it hadn\u2019t come to that. He wished she could have been happy here with him, learning his ways.</p><p>The thought of losing her did not sadden him. He would not miss her. She\u2019d placed him in a vat of oil to wrestle with another man, for Lord\u2019s sake.</p><p>There was suddenly a bitter taste in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d he prompted. \u201cHave you no response?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you will set me free,\u201d she finally said with a radiant grin. She twirled a strand of that dark-as-night hair around her finger. \u201cAfter. Now, I do believe I rang the starting bell.\u201d</p><p>Her words were slightly slurred from the wine she\u2019d consumed. A drunken menace, that\u2019s what she was. And he would not miss her, he told himself again.</p> <p>The bitterness intensified.</p><p>A hard weight slammed into him and sent him propelling to his back. His wings caught on the sides of the pool as oil washed over him from head to toe, weighing him down. He grunted, and some of the stuff\u2014cherry-flavored\u2014seeped into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to use tongue if you kiss,\u201d Bianka called helpfully.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t lock women away,\u201d Paris growled down at him, a flash of scales suddenly visible under his skin. Eyes red and bright. Demon eyes. \u201cNo matter how irritating they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friends did something similar to their women, did they not? Besides, the girl isn\u2019t your concern.\u201d Lysander shoved, sending the warrior hurtling to his back. He attempted to use his wings to lift himself, but their movements were slow and sluggish so all he could do was stand.</p><p>Oil dripped down his face, momentarily shielding his vision. Paris shot to his feet, as well, hands fisted, body glistening.</p><p>\u201cSo. Much. Fun,\u201d Bianka sang happily.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Lysander told her. \u201cThis is unnecessary. You have made your point. I\u2019m willing to set you free.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary to fight without music!\u201d Once again she tapped her chin with a nail, expression thoughtful. \u201cI know! We need some Lady Gaga in this crib.\u201d</p><p>A song Lysander had never heard before was playing through the cloud a second later. Like a siren rising from the sea, Bianka began swaying her hips seductively.</p><p>Lysander\u2019s jaw clenched so painfully the bones would probably snap out of place at any moment. Clearly there would be no reasoning with Bianka. That meant he had to reason with Paris. But who would ever have thought he\u2019d have to bargain with a demon?</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d he began\u2014just as a fist connected with his face.</p><p>His head whipped back. His feet slipped on the slick floor and he tumbled to his side. More of the cherry flavor filled his mouth.</p><p>Paris straddled his shoulders, punched him again. Lysander\u2019s lip split. Before a single drop of blood could form, however, the wound healed.</p><p>He frowned. He now had the right to slay the man, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. He did not blame Paris for this battle; he blamed Bianka. She had forced them into this situation.</p><p>Another punch. \u201cAre you the one who\u2019s been watching Aeron?\u201d Paris demanded.</p><p>\u201cHey, now,\u201d Bianka called. No longer did she sound so carefree. \u201cParis, you are not to use your fists. That\u2019s boxing, not wrestling.\u201d</p><p>Lysander remained silent, not understanding the difference. A fight was a fight.</p><p>Another punch. \u201cAre you?\u201d Paris growled.</p><p>\u201cParis! Did you hear me?\u201d Now she sounded angry. \u201cUse your fists like that again and I\u2019ll cut off your head.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d do it, too, Lysander thought, and wondered why she was so upset. Could she, perhaps, care for his health? His eyes widened. Was that why she preferred the less intensive wrestling to the more violent boxing? Would she want to do the same to him if he were to punch the Lord? And what would it mean if she did?</p><p>How would he feel about that?</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d Paris repeated.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He worked his legs up, planted his feet on Paris\u2019s chest and pressed. But rather than send the warrior flying, his foot slipped and connected with Paris\u2019s jaw, then ear, knocking the man\u2019s head back.</p><p>\u201cUse your hands, angel,\u201d Bianka suggested. \u201cChoke him! He deserves it for breaking my rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d Paris snapped. He lost his footing and tumbled to his butt. \u201cI thought you wanted me to destroy him, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>She blinked over at them, brow furrowed. \u201cI do. I just don\u2019t want you to hurt him. That\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>Paris tangled a hand through his soaked hair. \u201cSorry, darling, but if this continues, I\u2019m going to unleash a world of hurt on your frenemy. Nothing you say will be able to stop me. Clearly, he doesn\u2019t have your best interests at heart.\u201d</p><p>Darling? Had the demon-possessed immortal just called Bianka darling? Something dark and dangerous flooded Lysander\u2014mine echoed through his head\u2014and before he realized what he was doing, he was on top of the warrior, a sword of fire in his hand, raised, descending...about to meet flesh.</p><p>A firm hand around his wrist stopped him. Warm, smooth skin. His wild gaze whipped to the side. There was Bianka, inside the tub, oil glistening off her. How fast she\u2019d moved.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill him,\u201d she said determinedly.</p><p>\u201cBecause you want him, too,\u201d he snarled. A statement, not a question. Rage, so much rage. He didn\u2019t know where it was coming from or how to stop the flow.</p><p>She blinked again, as if the thought had never entered her mind, and that, miraculously, cooled his temper. \u201cNo. Because then you would be like me and therefore perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be fair to the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking and fight, damn you,\u201d Paris commanded. A fist connected with Lysander\u2019s jaw, tossing him to the side and out of Bianka\u2019s reach. He maintained his grip on the sword and even when it dipped into the oil, it didn\u2019t lose a single flame. In fact, the oil heated.</p><p>Great. Now he was hot-tubbing, as the humans would say.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do that for, you big dummy?\u201d Bianka didn\u2019t wait for Paris\u2019s reply but launched herself at him. Rather than scratch him or pull his hair, she punched him. Over and over again. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Paris took the beating without retaliating.</p><p>That saved his life.</p><p>Lysander grabbed the Harpy around the waist and hefted her into the hard line of his body. Soaked as they both were, he had a difficult time maintaining his grip. She was panting, arms flailing for the demon-possessed warrior, but she didn\u2019t try to pull away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you to defy me, you rotten piece of shit,\u201d she growled.</p><p>Paris rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSend him away,\u201d Lysander commanded.</p><p>\u201cNot until after I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He splayed his fingers, spanning much of her waist. He both rejoiced and cursed that he couldn\u2019t feel the texture of Bianka\u2019s skin through the oil. \u201cI want to be alone with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone. With you.\u201d</p><p>With no hesitation, she said, \u201cGo home, Paris. Your work here is done. Thanks for trying to rescue me. That\u2019s the only reason you\u2019re still alive. Oh, and don\u2019t forget to tell my sisters I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>The sputtering Lord disappeared.</p><p>Lysander released her, and she spun around to face him. She was now grinning.</p><p>\u201cSo you want to be alone with me, do you?\u201d</p><p>He ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cWas that fun for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t ashamed to admit it, he realized. Captivating baggage. \u201cReturn the cloud to me and I will take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. What?\u201d Her grin slowly faded. \u201cI thought you wanted to be alone with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. So that we can conclude our business.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment, regret, anger and relief played over her features. One step, two, she closed the distance between them. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not giving you the cloud. That would be stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my word that once you return it to me, I will take you home. I know you hear the truth in my claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her shoulders sagged a little. \u201cSo we really would be rid of each other. That\u2019s great, then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Did she still not believe him? Or... No, surely not. \u201cDo you want to stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d She sucked her bottom lip into her mouth, and her eyes closed for a moment, an expression of pleasure consuming her features. \u201cMmm, cherries.\u201d Blood...heating...</p><p>Her lashes lifted and her gaze locked on him. Determination replaced all the other emotions, yet her voice dipped sexily. \u201cBut I know something that tastes even better.\u201d</p> <p>So did he. Her. A tremor slid the length of his spine. \u201cDo not do this, Bianka. You will fail.\u201d He hoped.</p><p>\u201cOne kiss,\u201d she beseeched, \u201cand the cloud is yours.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. Hot, so hot. \u201cYou cannot be trusted to keep your word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But I want out of this hellhole, so I\u2019ll keep it this time. Promise.\u201d</p><p>Hold your ground. But that was hard to do while his heart was pounding like a hammer against a nail. \u201cIf you wanted out, you would not insist on being kissed.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze narrowed, as well. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m asking for something you haven\u2019t already given me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want it?\u201d He regretted the question immediately. He was prolonging the conversation rather than putting an end to it.</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cIt\u2019s a goodbye kiss, moron, but never mind. The cloud is yours. I\u2019ll go home and kiss Paris hello. That\u2019ll be more fun, anyway.\u201d</p><p>There would be no kissing Paris! Lysander had his tongue sliding into her mouth before he could convince himself otherwise. His arms even wound around her waist, pulling her closer to him\u2014so close their chests rubbed each time they breathed. Her nipples were hard, deliciously abrading.</p><p>\u201cOut of the oil,\u201d she murmured. \u201cClean.\u201d</p><p>He was still in the loincloth, but his skin was suddenly free of the oil, his feet on soft yet firm mist. The cloud might belong to him once more, but she could still make reasonable demands.</p> <p>Bianka tilted her head and took his possession deeper. Their tongues dueled and rolled and their teeth scraped. Her hands were all over him, no part of him forbidden to her.</p><p>Goodbye, she had said.</p><p>This was it, then. His last chance to touch her skin. To finally know. Yes, he planned to see her again, to watch her from afar, to wait for his chance to rid himself of her permanently, but never again would he allow himself to get this close to her. And he had to know.</p><p>So he did it.</p><p>He glided his hands forward, tracing from her lower back to her stomach. There, he flattened his palms, and her muscles quivered. Dear Deity of Light and Love. She was softer than he\u2019d realized. Softer than anything else he\u2019d ever touched. He moaned. Have to touch more. Up he lifted, remaining under her shirt. Warm, smooth, as he\u2019d already known. Still soft, so sweetly soft. Her breasts overflowed, and his mouth watered for a taste of them. Soon, he told himself. Then shook his head. This was it; the last time they would be together. Goodbye, pretty breasts. He kneaded them.</p><p>More soft perfection.</p><p>Trembling now, he reached her collarbone. Her shoulders. She shivered. Still so wonderfully soft. More, more, more, he had to have more. Had to touch all of her.</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d she gasped out. She dropped to her knees, working at the loincloth before he realized what she was doing.</p> <p>His shaft sprang free, and his hands settled atop her shoulders to push her away. But once he touched that soft skin, he was once again lost to the sensation. Perfection, this was perfection.</p><p>\u201cGoing to kiss you now. A different kind of kiss.\u201d Warm, wet heat settled over the hard length of him. Another moan escaped him. Up, down that wicked mouth rode him. The pleasure...it was too much, not enough, everything and nothing. In that moment, it was necessary to his survival. His every breath hinged on what she would do next. There would be no pushing her away.</p><p>She twirled her tongue over the plump head; her fingers played with his testicles. Soon he was arching his hips, thrusting deep into her mouth. He couldn\u2019t stop moaning, groaning, the gasping breaths leaving him in a constant stream.</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d he growled. \u201cBianka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way, baby. Give Bianka everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Everything. He would give her everything.</p><p>The sensation was building, his skin tightening, his muscles locking down on his bones. And then something exploded inside him. Something hot and wanton. His entire body jerked. Seed jetted from him, and she swallowed every drop.</p><p>Finally she pulled away from him, but his body wouldn\u2019t stop shaking. His knees were weak, his limbs nearly uncontrollable. That was pleasure, he realized, dazed. That was passion. That was what human men were willing to die to possess. That was what turned normally sane men into slaves. Like I am now. He was Bianka\u2019s slave. Fool! You knew this would happen. Fight. It was only as she stood and smiled at him tenderly\u2014and he wanted to tug her into his arms and hold on forever\u2014that a measure of sanity stole back into his mind. Yes. Fight. How could he have allowed her to do that?</p><p>How could he still want her?</p><p>How could he want to do that to her in return?</p><p>How could he ever let her go?</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d he said. He needed a moment to catch his breath. No. He needed to think about what had happened and how they should proceed. No. He tangled a hand in his hair. What should he do?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201d Her smile disappeared as if it had never been. \u201cThe cloud is yours.\u201d Her voice trembled with...fear? Couldn\u2019t be. She hadn\u2019t showed a moment of fear since he\u2019d first abducted her. But she even backed away from him. \u201cNow take me home. Please.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to reply. What he would say, he didn\u2019t know. He only knew he did not like seeing her like that.</p><p>\u201cTake me home,\u201d she croaked.</p><p>He\u2019d never gone back on his word, and he wouldn\u2019t start now. He nodded stiffly, grabbed her hand, and flew her back to the ice mountain in Alaska, exactly as he\u2019d found her. Red coat, tall boots. Sensual in a way he hadn\u2019t understood then.</p><p>He maintained his grip on her until the last possible second\u2014until she slipped away from him, taking her warmth and the sweet softness of her skin with her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you again.\u201d Mist wafted around her as she turned her back on him. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>She...what? After what had happened between them, she was dismissing him? No, a voice roared inside his head. \u201cBehave, and you will not,\u201d he gritted out. A lie? The bitter taste in his mouth had returned.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Without meeting his gaze, she twisted and blew him a kiss as if she hadn\u2019t a care in the world. \u201cI\u2019d say you were an excellent host, but then, you don\u2019t want me to lie, do you?\u201d With that, she strolled away from him, dark hair blowing in the wind.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>FIRST THING BIANKA DID after bathing, dressing, eating a bag of stolen chips she had hidden in her kitchen, painting her nails, listening to her iPod for half an hour and taking a nap in her secret basement was call Kaia. Not that she had dreaded the call and wanted to put it off or anything. All of those other activities had been necessary. Really.</p><p>Plus, it wasn\u2019t like her sister was worried about her anymore. Paris would already have told her what was going on. But Bianka didn\u2019t want to discuss Lysander. Didn\u2019t even want to think about him and the havoc he was causing her emotions\u2014and her body and her thoughts and her common sense.</p><p>After making out with him a little, she\u2019d wanted to freaking stay with him, curl up in his arms, make love and sleep. And that was unacceptable.</p><p>The moment her sister answered, she said, \u201cNo need to throw me a Welcome Home party. I\u2019m not sticking around for long.\u201d Do not ask me about the angel. Do not ask me about the angel.</p><p>\u201cBianka?\u201d her twin asked groggily.</p><p>\u201cYou were expecting someone else to call in the middle of the night?\u201d It was 6:00 a.m. here in Alaska. Having traveled between the two places multiple times since Gwen had gotten involved with Sabin, she knew that meant it was 3:00 a.m. there in Budapest.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kaia said. \u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>Seriously? \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of people. Gwennie, who has become the ultimate bridezilla. Sabin, who is doing his best to soothe the beast but whines to me like I care.\u201d She rambled on as if Bianka had never been abducted and she\u2019d never been worried. Sure, she\u2019d thought Bianka was merely shirking her duties, but was a little worry too much to ask for? \u201cAnya, who has decided she deserves a wedding, too. Only bigger and better than Gwen\u2019s. William, who wants to sleep with me and doesn\u2019t know how to take no for an answer. He\u2019s not possessed by a demon so he\u2019s not my type. Shall I go on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>She imagined Kaia high in a treetop, clutching her cell to her ear, grinning and trying not to fall. \u201cSo really, you were sleeping? While I was missing, my life in terrible danger? Some loving sister you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. You were on vacay, and we both know it. So don\u2019t give me a hard time. I had an...exciting day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing who?\u201d she asked dryly. Only two weeks had passed since she\u2019d last seen Kaia, but suddenly a wave of homesickness\u2014or rather, sistersickness\u2014flooded her. She loved this woman more than she loved herself. And that was a lot!</p><p>Kaia chuckled. \u201cI wish it was because of a who. I\u2019m waiting for two of the Lords to fight over me. Then I\u2019ll comfort them both. So far, no luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! But I mentioned Gwen has become the bride from hell, right? They\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll act just like her, so no one\u2019s willing to take a real chance on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBride from hell, how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer dress didn\u2019t fit right. Her napkins weren\u2019t the right color. No one has the flowers she wants. Whaa, whaa, whaa.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound like the usually calm Gwen. \u201cDistract her. Tell her the Hunters captured me and performed a handbotomy on me like they did on Gideon.\u201d Gideon, keeper of Lies. A sexy warrior who dyed his hair as blue as his eyes and had a wicked sense of humor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The thought of seducing him didn\u2019t delight her as it once might have. Stupid angel. Do not think about him.</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t care if you were chopped up into little pieces. You\u2019re too much like me and apparently we take nothing seriously so we deserve what we get,\u201d Kaia said. \u201cShe\u2019s driving me freaking insane! And to top off my mountain-o-crap, I was totally losing our game of Hide and Seek. So anyway, why\u2019d you decide to rescue yourself? I\u2019m telling you, you have a better chance of survival in the clouds than here with Gwen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurvival schmival. It wasn\u2019t fun anymore.\u201d A lie. Things had just started to heat up the way she\u2019d wanted. But how could she have known that would scare her so badly?</p> <p>\u201cGood going, by the way. Allowing yourself to be taken into the clouds where I couldn\u2019t get to you. Brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was it terrible? Being spirited away by a sexy angel?\u201d</p><p>She twirled a strand of hair around her finger and pictured Lysander\u2019s glorious face. The desire he\u2019d leveled at her while she\u2019d sucked him dry had been miraculous. You don\u2019t want to talk about him, remember? \u201cYes. It was terrible.\u201d Terribly wonderful.</p><p>\u201cYou bringing him to Buda for the wedding?\u201d</p> <p>The words were sneered, clearly a joke, but Bianka found herself shouting, \u201cNo!\u201d before she could stop herself. A Harpy dating an angel? Unacceptable!</p><p>And anyway, allowing the demon-possessed Lords of the Underworld to surround a warrior straight from heaven would be stupid. Not that she feared for Lysander. Guy could handle himself, no problem. The way he formed a sword of fire from nothing but air was proof of that. But if something were to happen to Gwennie\u2019s precious Sabin, like, oh, decapitation, the festivities would be somewhat dimmed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there, though,\u201d she added in a calmer tone. \u201cI kinda have to, you know. Since I\u2019m the maid of honor and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell, no. I am, remember?\u201d</p><p>She grinned slowly. \u201cYou told me you\u2019d rather be hit by a bus than be a bridesmaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I want to have a bigger part than you, so...here I am, in Budapest, helping little Gwennie plan the ceremony. Not that she\u2019s taking my suggestions. Would it kill her to at least consider making everyone come naked?\u201d</p> <p>They shared a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell, you and I can attend naked,\u201d Bianka said. \u201cIt\u2019ll certainly liven things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone!\u201d</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>Kaia pushed out a breath. \u201cSo you\u2019re fine?\u201d she asked, a twinge of concern finally appearing in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d And she was. Or would be. Soon, she hoped. All she had to do was figure out what to do about Lysander. Not that he\u2019d tried to stick around, the jerk. He hadn\u2019t been able to get away from her fast enough. Sure, she\u2019d pushed him away. But dude could have fought for her attention after what she\u2019d done for him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna make the angel pay for taking you without permission, right? Who am I kidding? Of course you are. If you wait till after the wedding, I can help. Please, please let me help. I have a few ideas and I think you\u2019ll like them. Picture this. It\u2019s midnight, your angel is strapped to your bed, and we each rip off one of his wings.\u201d</p><p>Nice. But because she didn\u2019t know whether Lysander was watching and listening or not\u2014was he? It was possible, and just the thought had her skin heating\u2014she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m done with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d Kaia gasped out. \u201cYou can\u2019t be done with him. He abducted you. Held you prisoner. Yeah, he oil-wrestled Paris and I\u2019m pissed I didn\u2019t get to see, but that doesn\u2019t excuse his behavior. If you let him off without punishment, he\u2019ll think it\u2019s okay. He\u2019ll think you\u2019re weak. He\u2019ll come after you again.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Yes, he would, she thought, suddenly trying not to grin. \u201cNo, he won\u2019t,\u201d she lied. Are you listening, Lysander, baby?</p><p>\u201cBianka, tell me you don\u2019t like him. Tell me you aren\u2019t lusting for an angel.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly her smile faded. This was exactly the line of questioning she\u2019d hoped to avoid. \u201cI\u2019m not lusting for an angel.\u201d Another lie.</p><p>Another pause. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom thought Gwen\u2019s dad was an angel and she regretted sleeping with him all these years. They\u2019re too good. Too...different from us. Angels and Harpies are not meant to mix. Tell me you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know it. Now, I\u2019ve gotta go. Tell the bridezilla to go easy on you. Love you and see you soon,\u201d she replied and hung up before Kaia could say anything else.</p><p>Despite her fear of what Lysander made her feel, Bianka wasn\u2019t done with him. Not even close. But she\u2019d been on his turf before and therefore at a disadvantage. If he wasn\u2019t here, she needed to get him here. Willingly.</p><p>She\u2019d told him to leave her alone, she thought, and that could be a problem. Except...</p><p>With a whoop, she jumped up and spun around. That wouldn\u2019t be a problem at all. That was actually a blessing and she was smarter than she\u2019d realized. By telling him to stay away from her, she\u2019d surely become the forbidden fruit. Of course he was here, watching her.</p><p>Men never could do what they were told. Not even angels.</p><p>So. Easy.</p><p>Even better, she\u2019d given him a little taste of what it was like to be with her. He would crave more. But also, she hadn\u2019t allowed him to pleasure her. His pride would not allow her to remain in this unsatisfied state for long, while he had enjoyed such sweet completion.</p><p>And if that wasn\u2019t the case, he wasn\u2019t the virile warrior she thought he was and he therefore wouldn\u2019t deserve her.</p><p>How long till he made an actual appearance? They\u2019d only been apart half a day, but she already missed him.</p><p>Missed him. Ugh. She\u2019d never missed a man before. Especially one who wanted to change her. One who despised what she was. One who could only be labeled enemy.</p><p>You have to avoid him. You want to sleep in his arms. You were protective of him while he fought Paris. He angered you but you didn\u2019t kill him. And now you\u2019re missing him? You know what this means, don\u2019t you?</p><p>Her eyes widened, and her excitement drained. Oh, gods. She should have realized...should at least have suspected. Especially when she\u2019d protected him, defended him.</p><p>Lysander, a goody-goody angel, was her consort.</p><p>Her knees gave out and she flopped onto the floor. As long as she\u2019d been alive, she\u2019d never thought to find one. Because, well, a consort was a meant-to-be husband. Some nights she\u2019d dreamed of finding hers, yes, but she hadn\u2019t thought it would actually happen.</p><p>Her consort. Wow.</p><p>Her family was going to flip. Not because Lysander had abducted her\u2014they\u2019d come to respect that\u2014but because of what he was. More than that, she didn\u2019t trust Lysander, would never trust him, and so could never do any actual sleeping with him.</p><p>Sex, though, she could allow. Often. Yes, yes, she could make this work, she thought, brightening. She could lure him to the dark side without letting her family know she was spending time with him. Humiliation averted!</p><p>Decided, she nodded. Lysander would be hers. In secret. And there was no better time to begin. If he was watching as she suspected, there was only one way to get him to reveal himself.</p><p>She dressed in a lacy red halter and her favorite skinny jeans and drove into town. Only reason she owned a car was because it made her appear more human. Flying kind of gave her away. Though her arms and navel were exposed, the frigid wind didn\u2019t bother her. Chilled her, yes, but that she could deal with. She wanted Lysander to see as much of her as possible.</p><p>She parked in front of The Moose Lodge, a local diner, and strode to the front door. Because it was so early and so cold, no one was nearby. A few streetlamps illuminated her, but she wasn\u2019t worried. She unlocked the door\u2014she\u2019d stolen the key from the owner months ago\u2014and disabled the alarm.</p><p>Inside, she claimed a pecan pie from the glassed refrigerator, grabbed a fork and dug in while walking to her favorite booth. She\u2019d done this a thousand times before.</p><p>Come out, come out, wherever you are. He wouldn\u2019t have just left her to her evil ways without thinking to protect the world from her. Right? She wished she could feel him, at least sense him in some way. His scent perhaps, that wild, night-sky scent. But as she breathed deeply, she smelled only pecans and sugar. Still. She hadn\u2019t sensed him when he\u2019d snatched her from mid-free fall, so it stood to reason she wouldn\u2019t sense him now.</p><p>Once the pie was polished off, the pan discarded and her fork licked clean, she filled a cup with Dr. Pepper. She placed a few quarters in the old jukebox and soon an erratic beat was echoing from the walls. Bianka danced around one of the tables, thrusting her hips forward and back, arching, sliding around, hands roving over her entire body.</p><p>For a moment, only a brief, sultry moment, she thought she felt hot hands replace her own, exploring her breasts, her stomach. Thought she felt soft feathered wings envelop her, closing her in. She stilled, heart drumming in her chest. So badly she wanted to say his name, but she didn\u2019t want to scare him away. So...what should she do? How should she\u2014</p><p>The feeling of being surrounded evaporated completely.</p><p>Damn him!</p><p>Teeth grinding, not knowing what else to do, she exited the diner the same way she\u2019d entered. Through the front door, as if she hadn\u2019t a care. That door slammed behind her, the force of it nearly shaking the walls.</p><p>\u201cYou should lock up after yourself.\u201d</p><p>He was here; he\u2019d been watching. She\u2019d known it! Trying not to grin, she spun around to face Lysander. The sight of him stole her breath. He was as beautiful as she remembered. His pale hair whipped in the wind, little snow crystals flying around him. His golden wings were extended and glowing. But his dark eyes were not blank, as when she\u2019d first met him. They were as turbulent as an ocean\u2014just as they\u2019d been when she\u2019d left him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought I told you to stay away from me,\u201d she said, doing her best to sound angry rather than aroused.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cAnd I told you to behave. Yet here you are, full of stolen pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do? Return it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be crass. I want you to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoment I do, I\u2019ll start to vomit.\u201d She crossed her arms over her middle. Close the distance. Kiss me. \u201cThat would ruin my lipstick, so I have to decline.\u201d</p><p>He, too, crossed his arms over his middle. \u201cYou can also earn your food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in silence. Then, \u201cDo you have no morals?\u201d he gritted out. \u201cNo.\u201d No sexual boundaries, either. So freaking kiss me already! \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He popped his jaw in frustration and disappeared.</p><p>Bianka\u2019s arms dropped to her sides and she gazed around in astonishment. He\u2019d left? Left? Without touching her? Without kissing her? Bastard! She stomped to her car.</p><p>LYSANDER WATCHED AS Bianka drove away. He was hard as a rock, had been that way since she\u2019d paraded around her cabin naked, had lingered in a bubble bath and then changed into that wicked shirt. His shaft was desperate for her.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she be an angel? Why couldn\u2019t she abhor sin? Why did she have to embrace it?</p><p>And why was the fact that she did these things\u2014steal, curse, lie\u2014still exciting him?</p><p>Because that was the way of things, he supposed, and had been since the beginning of time. Temptation seeped past your defenses, changed you, made you long for things you shouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>There had to be a way to end this madness. He couldn\u2019t destroy her, he\u2019d already proven that. But what if he could change her? He hadn\u2019t truly tried before, so it could work. And if she embraced his way of life, they could be together. He could have her. Have more of her kisses, touch more of her body.</p><p>Yes, he thought. Yes. He would help her become a woman he could be proud to walk beside. A woman he could happily claim as his own. A woman who would not be his downfall.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>AS LYSANDER HAD NEVER had a...girlfriend, as the humans would say, he had no idea how to train one. He knew only how to train his soldiers. Without emotion, maintaining distance and taking nothing personally. His soldiers, however, wanted to learn. They were eager, his every word welcomed. Bianka would resist him at every turn. That much he knew.</p><p>So. The first day, he followed her, simply observing. Planning.</p><p>She, of course, stole every meal, even snacks, drank too much at a bar, danced too closely with a man she obviously did not know, then broke that man\u2019s nose when he cupped her bottom. Lysander wanted to do damage of his own, but restrained himself. Barely. At bedtime, Bianka merely paced the confines of her cabin, cursing his name. Not for a minute did she rest.</p><p>How lovely she was, dark hair streaming down her back. Red lips pursed. Skin glowing like a rainbow in the moonlight. So badly he wanted to touch her, to surround her with his wings, making them the only two people alive, and simply enjoy her.</p><p>Soon, he promised himself.</p> <p>She\u2019d given him release, yet he had not done the same for her. The more he thought about that\u2014and think about it he did, all the time\u2014the more that did not sit well with him. The more he thought about it, in fact, the more embarrassed he was.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how to touch her to bring her release, but he was willing to try, to learn. First, though, he had to train her as planned. How, though? he wondered again. She seemed to respond well to his kisses\u2014his chest puffed up with pride at that. He\u2019d never rewarded his soldiers for a job well done, but perhaps he could do so for Bianka. Reward her with a kiss every time she pleased him.</p><p>A failproof plan. He hoped.</p><p>The second day, he was practically humming with anticipation. When she entered a clothing store and stuffed a beaded scarf into her purse, he materialized in front of her, ready to begin.</p><p>She stilled, gaze lifting and meeting his. Rather than bow her head in contrition, she grinned. \u201cFancy meeting you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut that back,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou do not need to steal clothing to survive.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her middle, a stubborn stance he knew well. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><p>A human woman who stood off to the side eyed Bianka strangely. \u201cUh, can I help you?\u201d</p><p>Bianka never looked away from him. \u201cNope. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe cannot see me,\u201d Lysander told her. \u201cOnly you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I look insane for talking with you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She laughed, surprising him. And even though her amusement was misplaced, he loved the sound of her laughter. It was magical, like the strum of a harp. He loved the way her mirth softened her expression and lit her magnificent skin.</p><p>Have to touch her, he thought, suddenly dazed. He took a step closer, intending to do just that. Have to experience that softness again. And in doing so, she could begin to know the delights of his rewards.</p><p>She gulped. \u201cWh-what are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t help you?\u201d the woman asked, cutting her off.</p><p>Bianka remained in place, trembling, but tossed her a glare. \u201cI\u2019m sure. Now shut it before I sew your lips together.\u201d</p><p>The woman backed away, spun and raced to help someone else.</p><p>Lysander froze.</p><p>\u201cYou may continue,\u201d Bianka said to him.</p><p>How could he reward her for such rudeness? That would defeat the purpose of her training. \u201cDo you not care what people think of you?\u201d he asked, head tilting to the side.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, and she stopped trembling. \u201cNo. Why should I? In a few years, these people will be dead but I\u2019ll still be alive and kicking.\u201d As she spoke, she stuffed another scarf in her purse.</p><p>Now she was simply taunting him. \u201cPut it back, and I\u2019ll give you a kiss,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>Stuttering again. He was affecting her. \u201cYou heard me.\u201d He would not repeat the words. Having said them, all he wanted to do was mesh their lips together, thrust his tongue into her mouth and taste her. Hear her moan. Feel her clutch at him.</p><p>\u201cYou would willingly kiss me?\u201d she rasped.</p><p>Willingly. Desperately. He nodded.</p><p>She licked her lips, leaving a sheen of moisture behind. The sight of that pink tongue sent blood rushing into his shaft. His hands clenched at his sides. Anything to keep from grabbing her and jerking her against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d She shook her head, as if clearing her thoughts. Her eyes narrowed again, those long, dark lashes fusing together. \u201cWhy would you do that? You, who have tried to resist me at every turn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust put the scarves back.\u201d So the kissing can begin.</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cAre you trying to bribe me? Because you should know, that won\u2019t work with me.\u201d</p><p>Rather than answer\u2014and lie\u2014he remained silent, chin jutting in the air. Blood...heating.</p><p>Still watching him, she reached out, palmed a belt and stuffed it in her purse, as well. \u201cSo what do you plan to do to me if I keep stealing? Give me a severe tongue-lashing? Too bad. I don\u2019t accept.\u201d</p><p>Fire slid the length of his spine even as his anger spiked. He closed the distance until the warmth of her breath was fanning over his neck and chest. \u201cYou could not get enough of me in the heavens, yet now that you are here, you want nothing to do with me. Tell me. Was your every word and action up there a lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course my every word and action was a lie. That\u2019s what I do. I thought you knew that.\u201d</p><p>So...did she desire him or not? Two days ago she\u2019d told her sister, Kaia, that she wanted nothing to do with him. At the time, he\u2019d thought she was merely saying that for Kaia\u2019s benefit. Now, he wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cYou could be lying now,\u201d he said. At least, that\u2019s what he hoped. And who would have thought he\u2019d ever wish for a lie?</p><p>Excitement sparked in her eyes and spread to the rest of her features. She patted his cheek, then flattened her palm on his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re learning, angel.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a breath. So hot. So soft.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a proposition for you. Steal something from this store and I\u2019ll kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Wait. Her words from a moment ago drifted through his head. You\u2019re learning, angel. He was learning? \u201cNo,\u201d he croaked out. He would not do such a thing. Not even for her. \u201cThese people need the money their goods provide. Do you care nothing for their welfare?\u201d</p><p>A flash of guilt joined the excitement. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p><p>Another lie? Probably. That guilt...it gave him hope. \u201cWhy do you need to steal like this, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForeplay,\u201d she said with a shrug.</p><p>Blood...heating...again.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, I need you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>At the unexpected intrusion, they both stiffened. Bianka\u2019s gaze pulled from his; together they eyed the policeman now standing beside her.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cCan\u2019t you see that I\u2019m in the middle of a conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re talking to God Himself.\u201d The grim-faced officer latched onto her wrist. \u201cI need you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Lysander,\u201d she said, clearly expecting him to do something.</p><p>Instinct demanded he save her. He wanted her safe and happy, but this would be good for her. \u201cI told you to put the items back.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped as the officer led her away. And, if Lysander wasn\u2019t mistaken, there was pride in her gaze.</p><p>ARRESTED FOR SHOPLIFTING, Bianka thought with disgust. Again. Her third time that year. Lysander had watched the policeman usher her in back, empty her purse and cuff her. All without a word. His disapproval had said plenty, though.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t let it upset her. He\u2019d stood his ground, and she admired that. Was turned on by it. This wouldn\u2019t be an easy victory, as she\u2019d assumed. Besides, for the first time in their relationship, he\u2019d offered to kiss her. Willingly kiss her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But only if she replaced her stolen goods, she reminded herself darkly. Didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that he wanted to change her. To condition her to his way of life.</p><p>It was exactly what she wanted to do to him. Which meant he wanted her as desperately as she wanted him.</p><p>It also meant it was time to take this game to the next level. She, however, would not be the one to cave. The six hours she\u2019d spent behind bars had given her time to think. To form a strategy.</p> <p>She was whistling as she meandered down the station steps. Lysander had finally posted her bail, but he hadn\u2019t hung around to speak with her. Well, he hadn\u2019t needed to. She knew he was following her.</p><p>At home, she showered, lingering under the hot spray, soaping herself more slowly than necessary and caressing her breasts and playing between her legs. Unfortunately, he never appeared. But no matter.</p><p>Just in case her shower hadn\u2019t gotten him in the mood, she read a few passages from her favorite romance novel. And just in case that hadn\u2019t gotten him in the mood, she decorated her navel with her favorite dangling diamond, dressed in a skintight tank and skirt and knee-high boots, and drove to the closest strip club.</p><p>\u201cI only have a few days left. Then I\u2019m traveling to Budapest for Gwen\u2019s wedding and you are not invited. Do you hear me? Try and come and I\u2019ll make your life hell. So, if you want a go at me, now\u2019s the time,\u201d she said as she got out of the car.</p><p>Again, he didn\u2019t appear.</p> <p>She almost screeched in frustration. So far, her strategy sucked. What was he doing?</p><p>The night was cold yet the inside of the club was hot and stuffy, the seats packed with men. Onstage, a redhead\u2014clearly not a natural redhead\u2014swung around a pole. The lights were dimmed, and smoke clung to the air.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna dance, darling?\u201d someone asked Bianka.</p><p>\u201cNope. Got better things to do.\u201d She did, however, steal the stranger\u2019s wallet, sneak a beer from the bar and settle into a table in the back corner. Alone. \u201cEnjoy,\u201d she whispered to Lysander, toasting him with the bottle.</p><p>\u201cHave you no shame?\u201d he suddenly growled from behind her.</p><p>Finally! Every muscle in her body relaxed, even as her blood heated with awareness. But she didn\u2019t turn to face him. He would have seen the triumph in her eyes. \u201cYou have enough shame for both of us.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted. \u201cThat does not seem to be the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Well, then, let\u2019s loosen you up. Do you want a lap dance?\u201d She held up the cash she\u2019d taken. \u201cI\u2019m sure the redhead onstage would love to rub against you.\u201d</p><p>His big hands settled on her shoulders, squeezing.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe you\u2019d like a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would indeed,\u201d the stranger she\u2019d stolen from said, now in front of her table. He reached into his back pocket. Frowned. \u201cHey, my wallet\u2019s gone.\u201d His gaze settled on the small brown leather case resting on her tabletop. His frown deepened. \u201cThat looks like mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow odd,\u201d she said innocently. \u201cSo do you want me to buy you a beer or not?\u201d</p><p>Lysander\u2019s grip tightened. \u201cGive him back his wallet and I\u2019ll kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat. Gods, she wanted his kiss. More than she\u2019d ever wanted anything. His lips were soft, his taste decadent. And if she allowed him to kiss her, well, she knew she could convince him to do other things.</p> <p>But she said, \u201cSteal his watch and I\u2019ll kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d the guy asked, brow furrowed. \u201cSteal whose watch?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, wishing she could shoo him away.</p><p>Lysander leaned down and cupped her breasts. A tremor moved through her, her nipples beading, reaching for him. Sweet heaven. Her stomach quivered, jealous of her breasts, wanting the touch lower.</p><p>\u201cGive him back the wallet.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she wanted to do just that. Anything for more of Lysander and this sultry side of him. She didn\u2019t need the money, anyway. Wait. What are you doing? Caving? She straightened her spine. \u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kiss you all over your body,\u201d Lysander added.</p><p>Oh... Hell. He\u2019d decided to take their game to the next level, as well.</p><p>Damn, damn, damn. She couldn\u2019t lose. If she did, he would control her with sex. He would expect her to be good like him. All the damn time. There would be no more stealing, no more cursing, no more fun. Well, except when they were in bed\u2014but would he expect her to be good there, too?</p><p>Life would become boring and sinless, everything a Harpy was taught to fight against.</p><p>She stood to shaky legs and turned, finally facing him. His hands fell away from her. She tried not to moan in disappointment. His expression was blank.</p><p>She blanked hers, as well, reached out and cupped him. Though he showed no emotion, he couldn\u2019t hide his hardness. \u201cSteal something, anything at all, and I\u2019ll kiss you all over.\u201d Her voice dipped huskily. \u201cRemember last time? You came in my mouth, and I loved every moment of it.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d the guy behind her exclaimed. \u201cGive me five minutes and I\u2019ll have stolen something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t trainable, are you?\u201d Lysander asked stiffly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, but suddenly she didn\u2019t feel like smiling. There\u2019d been resignation in his tone. Had she pushed him too far again? Was he going to leave her? Never return? \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you should stop trying, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Trying what?\u201d the stranger asked, confused.</p><p>Gods, when would he leave?</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet lost,\u201d she growled.</p><p>Lysander\u2019s gaze lifted, narrowed on the human. Then Bianka heard footsteps. Her angel hadn\u2019t said anything, hadn\u2019t revealed himself, but had somehow managed to make the human leave. He had powers she hadn\u2019t known about, then. Why was that even more exciting?</p><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t give the wallet back and I won\u2019t steal anything, where does that leave us?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAt war. I don\u2019t know about you, but I do my best fighting in bed,\u201d she said, and then threw her arms around his neck.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>WIND WHIPPED THROUGH Bianka\u2019s hair, and she knew that Lysander was flying her somewhere with those majestic wings. She had her eyes closed, too busy enjoying him\u2014finally!\u2014to care where he took her. His tongue made love to hers. His hands clutched her hips, fingers digging sharply. Then she was tipping over, a cool, soft mattress pressing into her back. His weight pinned her deliciously.</p><p>And it shouldn\u2019t have been delicious. This was not a position she allowed. Ever. It caged her wings, and her wings were the source of her strength. Without them, she was almost as weak as a human. But this was Lysander, honest to a fault, and she\u2019d wanted him forever, it seemed. And as wary as he\u2019d been about this sort of thing, she was afraid any type of rebuke would send him flying away.</p><p>Besides, he could do anything he wanted to her like this...</p><p>\u201cNo one is to enter,\u201d he said roughly.</p><p>Moaning, she wound her legs around his waist, tilted her head to receive his newest kiss and enjoyed a deeper thrust of his tongue. White lightning, the man was a fast learner. Very fast. He was now an expert at kissing. The best she\u2019d ever had. By the time she finished with him, he\u2019d be an expert at everything carnal.</p><p>His cock, hard and long and thick, rode the apex of her thighs. She could feel every inch of him through the softness of his robe. His arms enveloped her, and when she opened her eyes\u2014they were inside his cloud, she realized\u2014she saw his golden wings were spread, forming a blanket over them.</p><p>She tangled her hands in his hair and pulled from the kiss. \u201cAre you going to get into trouble for this?\u201d she asked, panting. Wait. What? Where had that thought come from?</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she lied, forcing a grin. No, no, no. That wasn\u2019t a lie. \u201cBut that adds a little extra danger, don\u2019t you think?\u201d There. Better. That was more like her normal self. She didn\u2019t like his goodness, didn\u2019t want to preserve it and keep him safe.</p><p>Did she?</p><p>\u201cWell, I will not get into trouble.\u201d He flattened his palms at her temples, boxing her in and taking the bulk of his own weight. \u201cIf that is the only reason you are here, you can leave.\u201d</p><p>How fierce he appeared. \u201cSo sensitive, angel.\u201d She hooked her fingers at the neck of his robe and tugged. The material ripped easily. But as she held it, it began to weave itself back together. Frowning, she ripped again, harder this time, until there was a big enough gap to shove the clothing from his shoulders and off his arms. \u201cI was only teasing.\u201d</p><p>His chest was magnificent. A work of art. Muscled and sun-kissed and devoid of any hair. She lifted her head and licked the pulse at the base of his neck, then traced his collarbone, then circled one of his nipples. \u201cDo you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot. Wet,\u201d he rasped, lids squeezed tight.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but do you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She sucked a peak until he gasped, then kissed away the sting. A tremor of pleasure rocked him, which caused a lance of pride to work through her. \u201cWhy do you desire me, angel? Why do you care if I\u2019m good or not?\u201d</p><p>A pause. A tortured, \u201cYour skin...\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in her body stiffened, and she glared up at him. \u201cSo any Harpy will do?\u201d She tried to hide her insult, but didn\u2019t quite manage it. The thought of another Harpy\u2014hell, any other woman, immortal or not\u2014enjoying him roused her most vicious instincts. Her nails lengthened, and her teeth sharpened. A red haze dotted her line of vision. Mine, she thought. She would kill anyone who touched him. \u201cWe all have this skin, you know?\u201d The words were guttural, scraping her throat.</p><p>His lashes separated as his eyes opened. His pupils were dilated, his expression tightening with...an emotion she didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cYes, but only yours tempts me. Why is that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d was all she could first think to say, her anger draining completely. But she needed to respond, had to think of something light, easy. \u201cTo answer your question, you want me because I\u2019m made of awesome. And guess what? I will make you so happy you said that, warrior.\u201d</p><p>Warrior, rather than angel. She\u2019d never called him that before. Why? And why now?</p><p>\u201cNo. I will make you happy.\u201d He ripped her shirt just as she had done his robe. She wasn\u2019t wearing a bra, and her breasts sprang free. Another tremor moved through him as he lowered his head.</p> <p>He licked and sucked one nipple, as she had done to him, then the other, feasting. Savoring. Soon she was arching and writhing against him, craving his mouth elsewhere. Her skin was sensitized, her body desperate for release. Yet she didn\u2019t want to rush him. She was still afraid of scaring him away. But damn him, if he didn\u2019t hurry, didn\u2019t touch her between her legs, she was going to die.</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d she said on a trembling breath.</p><p>His wings brushed both her arms, up and down, tickling, caressing, raising goosebumps on her flesh. Holy hell, that was good. So damn good.</p><p>He lifted from her completely.</p><p>\u201cWh-what are you doing? I wasn\u2019t going to tell you to leave,\u201d she screeched, bracing her weight on her elbows.</p> <p>\u201cI do not want anything between us.\u201d He shoved the robe down his legs until he was gloriously naked. Moisture gleamed at the head of his cock, and her mouth watered. Reaching out, he gripped her boots and tore them off. Her jeans quickly followed. She, of course, was not wearing any panties.</p><p>His gaze drank her in, and she knew what he saw. Her flushed, glowing skin. The aching juncture between her legs. Her rose-tinted nipples.</p><p>\u201cI want to touch and taste every inch,\u201d he said and just kind of fell on her, as if his will to resist had abandoned him completely.</p><p>\u201cTouch and taste every inch next time.\u201d Please let there be a next time. She tried to hook her legs around his waist again. \u201cI need release now.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her by the knees and spread her. Her head fell back, her hair tangling around her, and he kissed a path to her breasts, then to her stomach. He lingered at her navel until she was moaning.</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d she said again. Fine. She\u2019d jump on this grenade if she had to; if he wanted to taste, he could taste. \u201cMore. I need more.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than give it to her, he stilled. \u201cI...took care of myself before following you this day,\u201d he admitted, cheeks pinkening. \u201cI thought that would give me resistance against you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, shock pouring through her. \u201cYou pleasured yourself?\u201d</p><p>A stiff nod.</p><p>\u201cDid you think of me?\u201d</p><p>Another nod.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby. That\u2019s good. I can picture it, and I love what I see.\u201d His hand on his cock, stroking up and down, eyes closed, features tight with arousal, body straining toward release. Wings spread as he fell to his knees, the pleasure too much. Her, naked in his mind. \u201cWhat did you think about doing?\u201d</p><p>Another pause. A hesitant response. \u201cLicking. Between your legs. Tasting you, as I said.\u201d</p><p>She arched her back, hands skimming down her middle to her thighs. Although he already held her open, she pushed her legs farther apart. \u201cThen do it. Lick me. I want it so bad. Want your tongue on me. See how wet I am?\u201d</p> <p>He hissed in a breath. \u201cYes. Yes.\u201d Leaning down, he started at her ankles and kissed his way up, lingering at the back of her knees, at the crease of her legs.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, so on edge she was ready to scream. \u201cPlease. Do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered again. \u201cYes.\u201d Finally he settled over her, mouth poised, ready. His tongue flicked out. Then, sweet contact.</p><p>She expected the touch, but nothing could have prepared her for the perfection of it. She did scream, shivered. Begged for more. \u201cYes, yes, yes. Please, please, please.\u201d</p><p>At first, he merely lapped at her, humming his approval at her taste. Thank the gods. Or God. Or whoever was responsible for this man. If he hadn\u2019t liked her in that way, she wasn\u2019t sure what she would have done. In that moment, she wanted\u2014needed\u2014to be everything he wanted\u2014needed. She wanted him to crave every part of her, as she craved every part of him.</p><p>Even his goodness?</p><p>Yes, she thought, finally admitting it. Yes. Just then, she had no defenses; she\u2019d been stripped to her soul. His goodness somehow balanced her out. She\u2019d fought against it\u2014and still had no plans to change\u2014but they were two extremes and actually complemented each other, each giving the other what he or she lacked. In her case, the knowledge that some things were worth taking seriously. In his, that it wasn\u2019t a crime to have fun.</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d he moaned. \u201cTell me how...what...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Soon his tongue was darting in and out of her, mimicking the act of sex. She grasped at the sheets, fisting them. She writhed, meeting his every thrust. She screamed again, moaned and begged some more.</p><p>Finally, she splintered apart. Bit down on her bottom lip until she tasted blood. White lights danced over her eyes\u2014from her skin, she realized. Her skin was so bright it was almost blinding, glowing like a lamp, something that had never happened before.</p><p>Then Lysander was looming above her. \u201cYou are not fertile,\u201d he rasped. Sweat beaded him.</p><p>That gave her fuzzy mind pause. \u201cI know.\u201d Her words were as labored as his. Harpies were only fertile once a year and this wasn\u2019t her time. \u201cBut how do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSense it. Always know that kind of thing. So...are you ready?\u201d he asked, and she could hear the uncertainty in his voice.</p><p>He must not know proper etiquette, the darling virgin. He would learn. With her, there was no etiquette. Doing what felt good was the only thing that drove her.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She flattened her hands on his shoulders and pushed him to his back, careful of his wings. He didn\u2019t protest or fight her as she straddled his waist and gripped his cock by the base. Her wings fluttered in joy at their freedom. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>He licked his lips, nodded. His wings lifted, enveloped her, caressing her. Her head fell, the long length of her hair tickling his thighs. He trembled.</p><p>Would he regret this? she suddenly wondered. She didn\u2019t want him to hate her for supposedly ruining him. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d she asked. \u201cThere\u2019s no taking it back once it\u2019s done.\u201d If he wasn\u2019t ready, well, she would...wait, she realized. Yes, she would wait until he was ready. Only he would do. No other. Her body only wanted him.</p><p>\u201cDo not stop,\u201d he commanded, mimicking her.</p><p>A grin bloomed. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful with you,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers circled her hips and lifted her until she was poised at his tip. \u201cThe only thing that could hurt me is if you leave me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chance of that,\u201d she said, and sank all the way to the hilt.</p><p>He arched up to meet her, feeding her his length, his eyes squeezing shut, his teeth nearly chewing their way through his bottom lip. He stretched her perfectly, hit her in just the right spot, and she found herself desperate for release once more. But she paused, his enjoyment more important than her own. For whatever reason.</p><p>\u201cTell me when you\u2019re ready for me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove!\u201d he shouted, hips thrusting so high he raised her knees from the mattress.</p><p>Groaning at the pleasure, she moved, up and down, slipping and sliding over his erection. He was wild beneath her, as if he\u2019d kept his passion bottled up all these years and it had suddenly exploded from him, unstoppable.</p><p>Soon, even that wasn\u2019t enough for him. He began hammering inside her, and she loved it. Loved his intensity. All she could do was hold on for the ride, slamming down on him, gasping. Her nails dug into his chest, her moans blended with his. And when her second orgasm hit, Lysander was right there with her, roaring, muscles stiffening.</p><p>He grabbed her by the neck and jerked her down, meshing their lips together. Their teeth scraped as he primitively, savagely kissed her. It was a kiss that stripped her once more to her soul, left her raw, agonized. Reeling.</p><p>He was indeed her consort, she thought, dazed. There was no denying it now. He was it for her. Her one and only. Necessary. Angel or not. She laughed, and was surprised by how carefree it sounded. Tamed by great sex. It figured. After this, no other man would do. Ever. She knew it, sensed it.</p><p>She collapsed atop him, panting, sweating. Scared. Suddenly vulnerable. How did he feel about her? He didn\u2019t approve of her, yet he had gifted her with his virginity. Surely that meant he liked her, just as she was. Surely that meant he wanted her around.</p><p>His heart thundered in his chest, and she grinned. Surely.</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d he said shakily.</p><p>She yawned, more replete than she\u2019d ever been. My consort. Her eyelids closed, her lashes suddenly too heavy to hold up. Fatigue washed through her, so intense she couldn\u2019t fight it.</p><p>\u201cTalk...later,\u201d she replied, and drifted into the most peaceful sleep of her life.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>FOR HOURS LYSANDER HELD Bianka in the crook of his arm while she slept, marveling\u2014this was what she\u2019d craved most in the world and he had given it to her\u2014and yet, he was also worrying. He knew what that meant, knew how difficult it was for a Harpy to let down her guard and sleep in front of another. It meant she trusted him to protect her, to keep her safe. And he was glad. He wanted to protect her. Even from herself.</p><p>But could he? He didn\u2019t know. They were so different.</p><p>Until they got into bed, that is.</p><p>He could not believe what had just happened. He had become a creature of sensation, his baser urges all that mattered. The pleasure...unlike anything he\u2019d ever experienced. Her taste was like honey, her skin so soft he wanted it against him for the rest of eternity. Her breathy moans\u2014even her screams\u2014had been a caress inside his ears. He\u2019d loved every moment of it.</p><p>Had he been called to battle, he wasn\u2019t sure he would have been able to leave her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why her, though? Why had she been the one to captivate him?</p><p>She lied to him at every opportunity. She embodied everything he despised. Yet he did not despise her. For every moment with her, he only wanted more. Everything she did excited him. The pleasure she\u2019d found in his arms...she had been unashamed, uninhibited, demanding everything he had to give.</p><p>Would he have been as enthralled by her if she had led a blameless life? If she had been more demure? He didn\u2019t think so. He liked her exactly as she was.</p> <p>Why? he wondered again.</p><p>By the time she stretched lazily, sensually against him, he still did not have the answers. Nor did he know what to do with her. He\u2019d already proven he could not leave her alone. And now that he knew all of her, she would be even more impossible to resist.</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d she said, voice husky from her rest.</p><p>\u201cI am here.\u201d</p><p>She blinked open her eyes, jolted upright. \u201cI fell asleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I feel asleep.\u201d She scrubbed a hand down her beautiful face, twisted and peered down at him with vulnerable astonishment. \u201cI should be ashamed of myself, but I\u2019m not. What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>He reached up and traced a fingertip over her swollen lips. How hard had he kissed her? \u201cI\u2019m...sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost control for a moment. I shouldn\u2019t have taken you so\u2014\u201d</p><p>She nipped at his finger, her self-recrimination seeming to melt away in favor of amusement. \u201cDo you hear me complaining about that?\u201d</p><p>He relaxed. No, he did not hear her complaining. In fact, she appeared utterly sated. And he had done that. He had given her pleasure. Pride filled him. Pride\u2014a foolish emotion that often led to a man\u2019s downfall. Was that how Bianka would make him fall? For as his temptation, she would make him fall.</p><p>With a sigh, she flopped back against him. \u201cYou turned serious all of the sudden. Want to talk about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, too bad,\u201d she grumbled, but he heard a layer of satisfaction in her tone. Did she enjoy making him do things he didn\u2019t want to do\u2014or didn\u2019t think he wanted to do? \u201cBecause you\u2019re going to talk. A lot. You can start with why you first abducted me. I know you wanted to change me, but why me? I still don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t tell her; she already had enough power over him, and knowing the truth would only increase that power. But he also wanted her to understand how desperate he\u2019d been. Was. \u201cAt the heart of my duties, I am a peacekeeper, and as such, I must peek into the lives of the Lords of the Underworld every so often, making sure they are obeying heavenly laws. I...saw you with them. And as I have proven with my actions this day, I realized you are my one temptation. The one thing that can tear me from my righteous path.\u201d</p><p>She sat up again, faced him again. Her eyes were wide with...pleasure? \u201cReally? I alone can ruin you?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThat does not mean you should try and do so.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she leaned down and kissed him. Her breasts pressed against his chest, once again heating his blood in that way only she could do. But he was done fighting it, done resisting it. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I just like being important to you, I guess.\u201d Her cheeks suddenly bloomed with color. \u201cWait. That\u2019s not what I meant, either. What I\u2019m trying to say is that you\u2019re forgiven for whisking me to your palace in the sky. I would have done the same thing to you had the situation been reversed.\u201d</p> <p>He had not expected forgiveness to come so easily. Not from her. Frown intensifying, he cupped her cheeks and forced her to meet his gaze. \u201cWhy were you with me? I know I am not what your kind views as acceptable.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, the action a little stiff. \u201cI guess you\u2019re my temptation.\u201d</p><p>Now he understood why she\u2019d grinned over his proclamation. He wanted to whoop with satisfied laughter.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to be together\u2014\u201d She stopped, waiting. When he nodded, she relaxed and continued, \u201cThen I guess I could only steal from the wicked.\u201d</p><p>It was a concession. A concession he\u2019d never thought she would make. She truly must like him. Must want more time with him.</p><p>\u201cSo listen,\u201d she said. \u201cMy sister is getting married in a week, as I told you before. Do you want to, like, come with me? As my guest? I know, I know. It\u2019s short notice. But I didn\u2019t intend to invite you. I mean, you\u2019re an angel.\u201d There was disgust in her voice. \u201cBut you make love like a demon so I guess I should, I don\u2019t know, show you off or something.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to reply. What he would say, he didn\u2019t know. They could not tell others of their relationship. Ever. But a voice stopped him.</p><p>\u201cLysander. Are you home?\u201d</p><p>Lysander recognized the speaker immediately. Raphael, the warrior angel. Panic nearly choked him. He couldn\u2019t let the man see him like this. Couldn\u2019t let any of his kind see him with the Harpy.</p><p>\u201cWe must discuss Olivia,\u201d Raphael called. \u201cMay I enter your abode? There is some sort of block preventing me from doing so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he called. Was his panic in his voice? He\u2019d never experienced it before, so didn\u2019t know how to combat it. \u201cWait for me. I will emerge.\u201d He sat up and slipped from the bed, from Bianka. He grabbed his robe, or rather, the pieces of it, from the floor and wrapped it around himself. Immediately it wove back together to fit his frame. The material even cleaned him, wiping away Bianka\u2019s scent.</p><p>The latter, he inwardly cursed. For the best.</p><p>\u201cLet him in,\u201d Bianka said, fitting the sheet around her, oblivious. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Lysander kept his back to her. \u201cI do not want him to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve covered my naughty nakedness.\u201d</p><p>He gave no reply. Unlike her, he would not lie. And if he did not lie to her, he would hurt her. He did not want to do that, either.</p><p>\u201cSo call him in already,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI want to see if all angels look like sin but act like saints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want him inside right now. I will go out to meet him. You will stay here,\u201d he said. Still he couldn\u2019t face her.</p><p>\u201cWait. Are you jealous?\u201d</p><p>He gave no reply.</p><p>\u201cLysander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay silent. Please. Cloud walls are thin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay...silent?\u201d A moment passed in the very silence he\u2019d requested. Only, he didn\u2019t like it. He heard the rustle of fabric, a sharp intake of breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t want him to know I\u2019m here, do you? You\u2019re ashamed of me,\u201d she said, clearly shocked. \u201cYou don\u2019t want your friend to know you\u2019ve been with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBianka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You don\u2019t get to speak right now.\u201d With every word, her voice rose. \u201cI was willing to take you to my sister\u2019s wedding. Even though I knew my family would laugh at me or view me with disgust. I was willing to give you a chance. Give us a chance. But not you. You were going to hide me away. As if I\u2019m something shameful.\u201d</p><p>He whirled on her, fury burning through him. At her, at himself. \u201cYou are something shameful. I kill beings like you. I do not fall in love with them.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything. Just looked up at him with wide, hurt-filled eyes. So much hurt he actually stumbled back. A sharp pain lanced his chest. But as he watched, her hurt mutated into a fury that far surpassed his.</p><p>\u201cKill me, then,\u201d she growled.</p><p>\u201cYou know I will not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. Because deep down you still think you can change me. You think that I will become the pure, virtuous woman you want me to be. Well, who are you to say what\u2019s virtuous and what isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He merely arched a brow. The answer was obvious and didn\u2019t need to be stated.</p><p>\u201cI told you that from now on I\u2019d only hurt the wicked, right? Well, surprise! That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done since the beginning. The pie you watched me eat? The owner of that restaurant cheats at cards, takes money that doesn\u2019t belong to him. The wallet I stole? I took it from a man cheating on his wife.\u201d</p><p>He blinked down at her, unsure he\u2019d heard correctly. \u201cWhy would you have kept that from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should it change how you feel about me?\u201d She tossed back the cover and stood, glorious in her nakedness. Her skin was still aglow, multihued light reflecting off it\u2014he\u2019d touched that skin. Dark hair cascaded around her\u2014he\u2019d fisted that hair.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you,\u201d he said. \u201cI do. But it has to be in secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the same. Until what we just did,\u201d she said as she hastily dressed. Her clothes were not like his, did not repair on their own, and so that ripped shirt revealed more than it hid.</p><p>He tried again. Tried to make her understand. \u201cYou are everything my kind stands against, Bianka. I train warriors to hunt and kill demons. What would it say to them were I to take you as my companion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a better question. What does it say to them that you hide your sin? Because that\u2019s how you view me, isn\u2019t it? Your sin. You are such a hypocrite.\u201d She stormed past him, careful not to touch him. \u201cAnd I will not be with a hypocrite. That\u2019s worse than being an angel.\u201d</p><p>He thought she meant to race to Raphael and flaunt her presence. Shockingly enough, she didn\u2019t. And because he hadn\u2019t commanded her to stay, when she said, \u201cI want to leave,\u201d the cloud opened up at her feet.</p><p>She disappeared, falling through the sky.</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d he shouted. Lysander spread his wings and jumped after her. He passed Raphael, but at that point, he didn\u2019t care. He only wanted Bianka safe\u2014and that hurt and fury wiped away from her expression.</p><p>She\u2019d turned facedown to increase her momentum. He had to tuck his wings into his back to increase his own. Finally, he caught her halfway and wrapped his arms around her, her back pressed into his stomach. She didn\u2019t flail, didn\u2019t order him to release her, which he\u2019d been prepared for. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they reached her cabin, he straightened them, spread his wings and slowed. Snow still covered the ground and crunched when they landed. She didn\u2019t pull away. Didn\u2019t run. Something else he\u2019d been prepared for.</p><p>Clearly he knew very little about her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably best this way, you know,\u201d she said flatly, keeping her back to him. The wind slapped her hair against his cheeks. \u201cThat was my afterglow talking earlier, anyway. I never should have invited you to the wedding. We\u2019re too different to make anything work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was willing to try,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. Don\u2019t do this, he projected. Don\u2019t end us.</p><p>She laughed without humor, and he marveled at the difference between this laugh and the one she\u2019d given inside his cloud. Marveled and mourned. \u201cNo, you were willing to hide me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Therefore I was trying to make something work. I want to be with you, Bianka. Otherwise I would not have followed you. I would have left you alone from the first. I would not have tried to show you the light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such a pompous ass,\u201d she spat. \u201cShow me the light? Please! You want me to be perfect. Blameless. But what happens when I fail? And I will, you know? Perfection just isn\u2019t in me. One day I will curse. Like now. Fuck you. One day I will take something just because it\u2019s pretty and I want it. Would that ruin me in your eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t so far,\u201d he spat back.</p> <p>She laughed again, this one bleaker, grim. \u201cThe scarves I took were made by child laborers. So I haven\u2019t really done anything too terrible yet. But I will. And you know what? If you were to do something nauseatingly righteous, I wouldn\u2019t have cared. I would still have wanted to take you to the wedding. That\u2019s the difference between us. Evil or not, good or not, I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you, too. But that was not always the case, and you know it. You would care.\u201d He tightened his grip on her. \u201cBianka. We can work this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t.\u201d Finally, she twisted to face him. \u201cThat would require giving you a second chance, and I don\u2019t do second chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a second chance. I just need you to think about this. To realize our relationship must stay hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be your secret shame, Lysander.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. She was trying to force his hand, and he didn\u2019t like it. \u201cYou steal in secret. You sleep in secret. Why not this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat you don\u2019t know the answer proves you aren\u2019t the warrior I thought you were. Have a nice life, Lysander,\u201d she said, jerking from his hold and walking away without a backward glance.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>LYSANDER SAT IN THE BACK of the Budapest chapel, undetectable, watching Bianka help her sisters and their friends decorate for the wedding. She was currently hanging flowers from the vaulted ceiling. Without a ladder.</p><p>He\u2019d been following her for days, unable to stay away. One thing he\u2019d noticed: she talked and laughed as if she was fine, normal, but the sparkle was gone from her eyes, her skin.</p><p>And he had done that to her. Worse, not once had she cursed, lied or stolen. Again, his fault. He\u2019d told her she was unworthy of him. He\u2019d been\u2014was, right?\u2014too embarrassed of her to tell his people about her.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t deny that he missed her. Missed everything about her. That much he knew. She excited him, challenged him, frustrated him, consumed him, drew him, made him feel. He did not want to be without her.</p><p>Something soft brushed his shoulder. He barely managed to tear his gaze from Bianka to turn and see that Olivia was now sitting beside him.</p><p>What was wrong with him? He hadn\u2019t heard her arrive. Normally his senses were tuned, alert.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you summon me here?\u201d she asked. She glanced around nervously. Her dark curls framed her face, rosebuds dripping from a few of the strands.</p><p>\u201cTo Budapest? Because you are always here anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs are you these days,\u201d she replied dryly.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cDid you just come from Aeron\u2019s room?\u201d</p><p>She gave a reluctant nod.</p><p>\u201cRaphael came to me,\u201d he said. The day he\u2019d lost Bianka. The worst day of his existence.</p><p>\u201cThose flowers aren\u2019t centered, B,\u201d the redheaded Kaia called, claiming his attention and stopping the rest of his speech to his charge. \u201cShift them a little to the left.\u201d</p><p>Bianka expelled a frustrated sigh. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My left, dummy.\u201d</p><p>Grumbling, Bianka obeyed.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Kaia beamed up at her.</p><p>Bianka flipped her off, and Lysander grinned. Thank the One True Deity he had not killed all of her spirit.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re perfect, too,\u201d her youngest sister, Gwendolyn, said.</p><p>Bianka released the ceiling panels and dropped to the floor. When she landed, she straightened as if the jolt had not affected her in any way. \u201cGlad the princess is finally happy with something,\u201d she muttered. Then, more loudly, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t get married in a tree like a civilized Harpy.\u201d</p><p>Gwen anchored her hands on her fists. \u201cBecause my dream has always been to be wed in a chapel like any other normal person. Now, will someone please remove the naked portraits of Sabin from the walls? Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to get rid of them when I just spent all that time hanging them?\u201d Anya, goddess of Anarchy and companion to Lucien, keeper of Death, asked, clearly offended. \u201cThey add a little something extra to what would otherwise be very boring proceedings. My wedding will have strippers. Live ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoring? Boring!\u201d Fury passed over Gwen\u2019s features, black bleeding into her eyes, her teeth sharpening.</p><p>Lysander had watched this same change overtake her multiple times already. In the past hour alone.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be boring,\u201d Ashlyn, companion to Maddox, the keeper of Violence, said soothingly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The pregnant woman rubbed her rounded belly. That belly was larger than it should have been, given the early state of her pregnancy. No one seemed to realize it, though. They would soon enough, he supposed. He just hoped they were ready for what she carried.</p><p>What would a child of Bianka\u2019s be like? he suddenly wondered. Harpy, like her? Angel, like him? Or a mix of both?</p><p>A pang took root and flourished in his chest.</p><p>\u201cBoring?\u201d Gwen snarled again, clearly not ready to let the insult slide.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Bianka threw up her arms. \u201cSomeone get Sabin before Gwennie kills us all in a rage.\u201d</p><p>A Harpy in a rage could hurt even other Harpies, Lysander knew. As Gwen\u2019s consort, Sabin, keeper of Doubt, was the only one who could calm her.</p><p>With that thought, Lysander\u2019s head tilted to the side. He had never seen Bianka erupt, he realized. She\u2019d viewed everything as a game. Well, not true. Once, she had gotten mad. The time Paris had punched him. Lysander had been her enemy, but she\u2019d still gotten mad over his mistreatment.</p><p>Lysander had calmed her.</p><p>The pang grew in intensity, and he rubbed his breast-bone. Was he Bianka\u2019s consort? Did he want to be?</p><p>\u201cNo need to search me out. I\u2019m here.\u201d Sabin strode through the double doors. \u201cAs if I\u2019d be more than a few feet away when she\u2019s so sensitiv\u2014uh, just in case she needed my help. Gwen, baby.\u201d There at the end, his tone had lowered, gentled. He reached her and pulled her into his arms; she snuggled against him. \u201cThe most important thing tomorrow is that we\u2019ll be together. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d Olivia said, drawing his attention from the now-cooing couple. \u201cThe wait is difficult. Raphael came to you and...what?\u201d</p><p>Lysander sighed, forcing himself to concentrate. \u201cAnswer a few questions for me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said after a brief hesitation.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you like Aeron when he is so different from you?\u201d</p><p>She twisted the fabric of her robe. \u201cI think I like him because he is so different from me. He has thrived amid darkness, managing to retain a spark of light in his soul. He is not perfect, is not blameless, but he could have given in to his demon long ago and yet still he fights. He protects those he loves. His passion for life is...\u201d She shivered. \u201cAmazing. And really, he only hurts people when his demon overtakes him\u2014and only if they are wicked, at that. Innocents, he leaves alone.\u201d</p><p>It was the same with Bianka. Yet Lysander had tried to make her ashamed of herself. Ashamed when she should only be proud of what she had accomplished, thriving amid darkness, as Olivia had said. \u201cAnd you are not embarrassed for our kind to know of your affection for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmbarrassed of Aeron?\u201d Olivia laughed. \u201cWhen he is stronger, fiercer, more alive than anyone I know? Of course not. I would be proud to be called his woman. Not that it could ever happen,\u201d she added sadly.</p><p>Proud. There was that word again. And this time, something clicked in his mind. I\u2019m not going to be your secret shame, Lysander, Bianka had said. He\u2019d reminded her that she committed all her other sins in secret. Why not him? She hadn\u2019t told him the answer, but it came to him now. Because she\u2019d been proud of him. Because she\u2019d wanted to show him off.</p><p>As he should have wanted to show her off.</p><p>Any other man would have been proud to stand beside her. She was beautiful, intelligent, witty, passionate and lived by her own moral code. Her laughter was more lovely than the song of a harp, her kiss as sweet as a prayer.</p><p>He\u2019d considered her the spawn of Lucifer, yet she was a gift from the One True Deity. He was such a fool.</p><p>\u201cHave I answered your questions sufficiently?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He was surprised by the rawness of his voice. Had he ruined things irreparably between them?</p><p>\u201cSo answer a few now for me.\u201d</p><p>Unable to find his voice, he nodded. He had to make this right. Had to try, at least.</p><p>\u201cBianka. The Harpy you watch. Do you love her?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Love. He found her among the crowd and the pang in his chest grew unbearable. She was currently adding a magic marker mustache to one of Sabin\u2019s portraits while Kaia added...other things down below. Kaia was giggling; Bianka looked like she was just going through the motions, taking no joy.</p><p>He wanted her happy. Wanted her the way she\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cYou think you are embarrassed of her,\u201d Olivia continued when he gave no response.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d He forced the words to leave him.</p> <p>\u201cI am\u2014or was\u2014a joy-bringer, Lysander. It was my job to know what people were feeling and then help them see the truth. Because only in truth can one find real joy. You were never embarrassed of her. I know you. You are embarrassed by nothing. You were simply scared. Scared that you were not what she needs.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. Could that be true? He\u2019d tried to change her. Had tried to make her what he was so that she, in turn, would like what he was? Yes. Yes, that made sense, and for the second time in his existence, he hated himself.</p><p>He had let Bianka get away from him. When he should have sung her praises to all of the heavens, he had cast her aside. No man was more foolish. Irreparable damage or not, he had to try and win her back.</p><p>He jumped to his feet. \u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cI love her.\u201d He wanted to throw his arms around her. Wanted to shout to all the world that she belonged to him. That she had chosen him as her man.</p><p>His shoulders slumped. Chosen. Key word. Past tense. She would not choose him again. She did not give second chances, she\u2019d said.</p> <p>She often lies...</p><p>For the first time, the thought that his woman liked to lie caused him to smile. Perhaps she had lied about that. Perhaps she would give him a second chance. A chance to prove his love.</p><p>If he had to grovel, he would. She was his temptation, but that did not have to be a bad thing. That could be his salvation. After all, his life would mean nothing without her. Same for her. She had told him that he was her own temptation. He could be her salvation.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he told Olivia. \u201cThank you for showing me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>How should he approach Bianka? When? Urgency flooded him. He wanted to do so now. As a warrior, though, he knew some battles required planning. And as this was the most important battle of his existence, plan his attack he would.</p> <p>If she forgave him and decided to be with him, they would still have a tough road ahead. Where would they live? His duties were in the heavens. She thrived on earth, with her family nearby. Plus, Olivia was destined to kill Aeron, who would essentially be Bianka\u2019s brother-in-law after tomorrow. And if Olivia decided not to, another angel would be chosen to do the job.</p><p>Most likely, that would be Lysander.</p><p>One thing his Deity had taught him, however, was that love truly could conquer all. Nothing was stronger. They could make this work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost you again,\u201d Olivia said with a laugh. \u201cBefore you rush off, you must tell me why you summoned me. What Raphael said to you.\u201d</p><p>Some of his good mood evaporated. While Olivia had just given him hope and helped him find the right path, he was about to dash any hopes of a happily-ever-after for her.</p><p>\u201cRaphael came to me,\u201d he repeated. Just do it; just say it. \u201cHe told me of the council\u2019s unhappiness with you. He told me they grow weary of your continued defiance.\u201d</p><p>Her smile fell away. \u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI just...I haven\u2019t been able to bring myself to hurt him. Watching him gives me joy. And I deserve to experience joy after so many centuries of devoted service, do I not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if he is dead, I will never be able to do the things I now dream about.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cWhat things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouching him. Curling into his arms.\u201d A pause. \u201cKissing him.\u201d</p><p>Dangerous desires indeed. Oh, did he know their power. \u201cIf you never experience them,\u201d he offered, \u201cthey are easier to resist.\u201d But he hated to think of this wonderful female being without something she wanted.</p><p>He could petition the council for Aeron\u2019s forgiveness, but that would do no good. A decree was a decree. A law had been broken and someone had to pay. \u201cVery soon, the council will be forced to offer you a choice. Your duty or your downfall.\u201d</p><p>She gazed down at her hands, once again twisting the fabric of her robe. \u201cI know. I don\u2019t know why I hesitate. He would never desire me, anyway. The women here, they are exciting, dangerous. As fierce as he is. And I am\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecious,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are precious. Never think otherwise.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a shaky smile.</p><p>\u201cI have always loved you, Olivia. I would hate to see you give up everything you are for a man who has threatened to kill you. You do know what you would be losing, yes?\u201d</p><p>That smile fell away as she nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou would fall straight into hell. The demons there will go for your wings. They always go for the wings first. No longer will you be impervious to pain. You will hurt, yet you will have to dig your way free of the underground\u2014or die there. Your strength will be depleted. Your body will not regenerate on its own. You will be more fragile than a human because you were not raised among them.\u201d</p><p>While he thought he could survive such a thing, he did not think Olivia would. She was too delicate. Too...sheltered. Until this point, every facet of her life had dealt with joy and happiness. She had known nothing else.</p><p>The demons of hell would be crueler to her than they would be even to him, the man they feared more than any other. She was all they despised. Wholly good. Destroying such innocence and purity would delight them.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d Her voice trembled. Tears streaked down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cBecause I do not want you to make the wrong decision. Because I want you to know what you\u2019re up against.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in silence, then she jumped up and threw her arms around his neck. \u201cI love you, you know.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her tightly, sensing that this was her way of saying goodbye. Sensing that this would be the last time they were offered such a reprieve. But he would not stop her, whatever path she chose.</p><p>She pulled back and smoothed her trembling hands down her glistening white robe. \u201cYou have given me much to consider. So now I will leave you to your female. May love always follow you, Lysander.\u201d As she spoke, her wings expanded. Up, up she flew, misting through the ceiling\u2014and Bianka\u2019s flowers\u2014before disappearing.</p><p>He hoped she\u2019d choose her faith, her immortality, over the keeper of Wrath, but feared she would not. His gaze strayed to Bianka, now walking down the aisle toward the exit. She paused at his row, frowned, before shaking her head and leaving. If he\u2019d been forced to pick between her and his reputation and lifestyle, he would have picked her, he realized.</p><p>And now it was time to prove it to her.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>I\u2019VE GOT TO PULL MYSELF from this funk, Bianka thought. This was her youngest sister\u2019s wedding day. She should be happy. Delighted. If she were honest, though, she was a tiny bit\u2014aka a lot\u2014jealous. Gwen\u2019s man, a demon, loved her. Was proud of her.</p><p>Lysander considered Bianka unworthy.</p><p>She\u2019d thought about proving herself to him, but had quickly discarded the idea. Proving herself worthy\u2014his idea of worthy, that is\u2014would entail nothing more than a lie. And Lysander hated lies. So, according to him, she would never be good enough for him. Which meant he was stupid, and she didn\u2019t date stupid men. Plus, he didn\u2019t deserve her.</p><p>He deserved to rot in his unhappiness. And that\u2019s what he\u2019d be without her. Unhappy. Or so she hoped.</p><p>\u201cSo much for our plan to go naked,\u201d Kaia muttered beside her. \u201cGwen saw me leave my room that way and almost sliced my throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid not,\u201d the bride in question said from behind them.</p><p>They turned in unison. Bianka\u2019s breath caught as it had every time she\u2019d seen her youngest sister in her gown. It was a princess cut, which was fitting, the straps thin, the beautiful white lace cinching just under her breasts before flowing to her ankles. The material covering her legs was sheer, allowing glimpses of thigh and those gorgeous red heels.</p><p>Her strawberry curls were half up, half down, diamonds glittering through the strands. There was so much love and excitement in her gold-gray eyes it was almost blinding.</p><p>\u201cI almost pushed you out a window,\u201d Gwen added.</p><p>They laughed. Even stoic Taliyah, their oldest sister, who had her arm wrapped through Gwen\u2019s. Since it turned out Gwen\u2019s father was the Lords\u2019 greatest enemy, and Gwen\u2019s mom had disowned her years ago, Taliyah was escorting Gwen down the aisle.</p><p>\u201cHence the reason I\u2019m now wearing this.\u201d Kaia motioned to her own gown, an exact match to Bianka\u2019s. A buttercup-yellow creation with more ribbons, bows and sequined rose appliqu\u00e9s than anyone should wear in an entire lifetime. They even wore hats with orange streamers.</p><p>Gwen shrugged, unrepentant. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you looking prettier than me, so sue me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeddings suck,\u201d Bianka said. \u201cYou should have just had Sabin tattoo your name on his ass and called it good.\u201d That\u2019s what she would have done. Not that Lysander ever would have agreed to such a thing. Whether they were together or not.</p><p>Which they never would be. Bastard.</p><p>\u201cI did. Have him tattoo my name on his ass,\u201d Gwen said. \u201cAnd his arm. And his chest. And his back. But then I casually mentioned how much I\u2019d always wanted a big wedding, and well, he told me I had four weeks to plan it or he\u2019d take over and do it himself. And everyone knows men can\u2019t plan shit. So...\u201d She shrugged again, though the excitement and love on her face had intensified. \u201cAre they ready for us yet?\u201d</p><p>Bianka and Kaia turned back to the chapel, peeking through the crack in the closed doors.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Bianka said. \u201cParis is missing.\u201d</p><p>Paris, who had gotten ordained over the internet, would be presiding over the nuptials. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe better hurry,\u201d she added grumpily. \u201cOr I\u2019ll find a way to make him oil-wrestle again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been so depressed lately. Missing your angel?\u201d Kaia asked her, pinkie-waving to Amun, who stood in the line of groomsmen beside Sabin at the altar.</p><p>Amun shouldn\u2019t have been able to see her, but somehow he did. He nodded, a smile twitching at the corners of his lips.</p> <p>\u201cOf course not. I hate him.\u201d A lie. She hadn\u2019t told her sisters why she and Lysander had parted, only that they had. Forever. If they knew the truth, they\u2019d want to kill him. And as all but Gwen were paid killers, immensely good at their job, she\u2019d find herself the proud owner of Lysander\u2019s head.</p><p>Which she didn\u2019t want.</p><p>She just wanted him. Stupid girl.</p><p>\u201cI only would have teased you for a few years, you know,\u201d Kaia said. \u201cYou should have kept him around. It might have been fun to corrupt him.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to be corrupted any more than she wanted to be purified. They were too different. Could never make anything work. Their separation was for the best. So why couldn\u2019t she get over it? Why did she feel his gaze on her, every minute of every day? Even now, when she looked like a Southern belle on crack?</p> <p>\u201cSo Sabin doesn\u2019t have a last name,\u201d she said to Gwen, drawing attention away from herself. \u201cAre you going to call yourself Gwen Sabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that. I\u2019m going to call myself Gwen Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Anya plan to call herself? Anya Underworld?\u201d Kaia asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cKnowing our goddess, she\u2019ll demand Lucien take her last name. Trouble. Or is that her middle name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI here, I here,\u201d a voice suddenly screeched. Legion pushed her way in front of Bianka and Kaia. She was wearing a yellow dress, as well. Only hers had more ribbons, bows and sequins. A basket of flowers was clutched in her hands, her too-long nails curling around the handle. Best of all, she wore a tiara. Because she didn\u2019t have hair, it had had to be glued to her scaled head. \u201cWe begin now.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for permission but shouldered her way through the door. The crowd\u2014which consisted of the Lords of the Underworld, their companions and some gods and goddesses Anya knew\u2014turned and gasped when they saw her. Well, except for Gideon. He\u2019d recently been captured and tortured by Hunters, the Lords\u2019 nemeses, and was currently missing his hands. (His feet weren\u2019t in the best of shape, either.) Because of his injuries, he was beyond weak, so he lay in his gurney, barely conscious. He\u2019d insisted on coming, though.</p> <p>From his pew, Aeron smiled indulgently as Legion tossed pink petals in every direction. Just as she reached the front, Paris raced to the podium. He looked harried, pale, and Sabin punched him in the shoulder.</p><p>Sabin looked amazing. He wore a black tux, his hair slicked back, and when he turned to face the door, watching for Gwen, his entire face lit. With love. With pride. Bianka\u2019s jealousy increased. She wanted that. Wanted her man to find her perfect in every way.</p><p>Was that too much to ask?</p><p>Apparently so. Stupid Lysander.</p><p>\u201cGo, go, go,\u201d Gwen ordered, giving them a little push.</p><p>Bianka kicked into motion, heading toward Strider, her appointed groomsman. He smiled at her when she reached him. He would be proud to call her his woman, she thought. She tried to make herself return the gesture, but her eyes were too busy filling with tears. She looked around, trying to distract herself.</p><p>The chapel really was beautiful. The glittery white flowers she\u2019d hung from the ceiling were thick and lush and offered a canopy, a haven. They were the best part of the decor, if you asked her. Candles flickered with golden light, twining with shadows.</p><p>Kaia approached her side, and everyone except for Gideon stood. The music changed, slowing down to the bridal march. Gwen and Taliyah appeared. Sabin\u2019s breath caught. Yes, that was the way a man should react to the sight of his woman.</p> <p>What makes you think you were ever Lysander\u2019s woman?</p><p>Because she was his one temptation. Because of the reverent way he had touched her. Because she liked how he made her feel. Because they balanced each other. Because he completed her in a way she hadn\u2019t known she needed. He was the light to her darkness.</p><p>He was willing to show you that light. Over and over again.</p><p>Perhaps she should have fought for him. That\u2019s what she was, after all. A fighter. Yet she\u2019d given in as if he meant nothing to her when he had somehow become the most important thing in her life.</p><p>Bianka didn\u2019t mean to, but she tuned out as Paris gave his speech and the happy couple recited their vows, her thoughts remaining focused on Lysander. Should she try and fight for him now? If so, how would she go about it?</p><p>Only when the crowd cheered did she snap out of her haze, watching as Sabin and Gwen kissed. Then they were marching down the aisle and out the doors together. The rest of the bridal party made their way out, as well.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Strider asked, holding out his arm for her.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t.\u201d Paris grabbed her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re needed in that room.\u201d With his free hand, he pointed.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Was he planning revenge against her for forcing him to oil-wrestle Lysander? He hadn\u2019t mentioned it in the days since her return to Buda, but he couldn\u2019t be happy with her. He should be thanking her, for gods\u2019 sake. He\u2019d gotten to touch all of Lysander\u2019s hawtness.</p><p>Paris rolled his eyes. \u201cJust go before your boyfriend decides he\u2019s tired of waiting and comes out here.\u201d</p><p>Her boyfriend. Lysander? Couldn\u2019t be. Could it? But why would he have come? Heart drumming in her chest, she walked forward. She didn\u2019t allow herself to run, though she wanted to soooo badly. She reached the door. Her hand shook as she turned the knob.</p><p>Hinges creaked. Then she was staring into\u2014an empty room. Her teeth ground together. Paris\u2019s revenge, just as she\u2019d figured. Of course. That rat bastard piece of shit was going to pay. She wasn\u2019t just going to make him oil-wrestle. She was going to\u2014</p><p>\u201cHello, Bianka.\u201d</p><p>Lysander.</p><p>Gasping, she whipped around. Her eyes widened. In an instant, the chapel had been transformed. No longer were her sisters and friends inside. Lysander and his kind occupied every spare inch. Angels were everywhere, light surrounding them and putting Gwen\u2019s candles to shame.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded, not daring to hope.</p><p>\u201cI came to beg your forgiveness.\u201d His arms spread. \u201cI came to tell you that I am proud to be your man. I brought my friends and brethren to bear witness to my proclamation.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, still not letting hope take over. \u201cBut I\u2019m evil and that\u2019s not going to change. I\u2019m your temptation. You could, I don\u2019t know, lose everything by being with me.\u201d The thought hit her, and she wanted to wilt. He could lose everything. No wonder he had wanted to destroy her. No wonder he had wanted to hide her.</p><p>\u201cNo, you are not evil. And I don\u2019t want you to change. You are beautiful and intelligent and brave. But more than that, you are my everything. I am nothing without you. Not good, not right, not complete. And do not worry. I will not lose everything as you said. You have not committed an unpardonable sin.\u201d</p><p>She gulped. \u201cAnd if I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will fall.\u201d</p><p>Okay. A small kernel of hope managed to seep inside her. But no way would she let him fall. Ever. He loved being an angel. \u201cWhat brought this on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI finally pulled my head out of my ass,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>He\u2019d said ass. Lysander had just said the word ass. More hope beat its way inside and she had to press her lips together to keep from smiling. And crying! Tears were springing in her eyes, burning.</p><p>Could they actually make their relationship work? Just a little bit ago, she\u2019d been grateful\u2014or pretending to be grateful\u2014that they were apart, since so many obstacles existed.</p><p>\u201cI only hope you can love so foolish a man. I am willing to live wherever you desire. I am willing to do anything you need to win you back.\u201d He dropped to his knees. \u201cI love you, Bianka Skyhawk. I would be proud to be yours.\u201d</p><p>He was proud of her. He wanted her. He loved her. It was everything she\u2019d secretly dreamed about this past week. Yes, they could make this work. They would be together, and that was the most important thing. But she told him none of that.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d she screeched instead. \u201cYou decided to introduce me to your friends now? When I look like this?\u201d Scowling, she peeked over his shoulder at them and saw their stunned expressions. \u201cI usually look better than this, you know. You should have seen me the other day. When I was naked.\u201d</p><p>Lysander stood. \u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say to me?\u201d</p><p>She focused back on him. His eyes were as wide as hers had been, his arms crossed over his middle. \u201cNo. There\u2019s more,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cBut I will never live this yellow gown thing down, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBianka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I love you, too. But if you ever decide I\u2019m unworthy again, I\u2019ll show you just how demonic I can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal. But you don\u2019t have to worry, love,\u201d he said, a slow smile lifting those delectable lips. \u201cIt is I who am unworthy. I only pray you never learn of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know it already,\u201d she said, and his grin spread. \u201cNow c\u2019mere, you.\u201d She cupped the back of his neck and jerked him down for a kiss.</p><p>His arms banded around her, holding her close. She\u2019d never thought to be paired with an angel, but she couldn\u2019t regret it now. Not when Lysander was the angel in question.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready for me?\u201d she asked him when they came up for air.</p><p>He nipped at her chin. \u201cI\u2019ve been ready for you my entire life. I just didn\u2019t know it until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d With a whoop, she jumped up and wound her legs around his waist. A wave of gasps circled the room. They were still here? \u201cDitch your friends, I\u2019ll blow off my sister\u2019s reception and we\u2019ll go oil-wrestle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFunny,\u201d he said, wings enveloping her as he flew her up, up and into his cloud. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>THE AMAZON\u2019S CURSE</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>NOLA STOOD IN THE CENTER of the battle tent, watching as her sisters-by-race lined up. Each shifted eagerly from one foot to the other, clutching their weapon of choice. She spotted several axes, a few spears, but mostly swords. Anticipation thickened the air.</p><p>Mating season had officially begun.</p><p>Soon the females would break into groups, fighting each other for the right to whichever stolen slave they desired. Those slaves, eight in number, were currently chained to the far wall at the end of the spacious enclosure. Three dragon shifters, two centaurs, two male sirens and a vampire. All eight were muscled, beautiful...and all but one was grinning. The vampire.</p><p>Her vampire. Zane.</p><p>The men would be bedded this night and for several weeks to come. Then they would be freed, never to return. That was the way of the Amazons. Capture, breed and abandon. Of course the males were happy about this. All but Zane. His fury was palpable.</p> <p>Despite that fury, her gaze drank him in. Zane had dark hair, equally dark eyes and a body made for war. And sex. He had muscle stacked upon muscle and scars that laced his corded chest.</p><p>He also had the fiercest temper she\u2019d ever encountered. He didn\u2019t like to be touched and had actually injured many Amazons\u2014not an easy feat\u2014in his quest for freedom. Finally, in an effort to tame him, they had stopped feeding him the blood he needed for strength. Now he was physically weakened, only able to lean against the wall and wait for his mistress to be declared.</p><p>However, nothing could weaken his hatred\u2014or the promised retribution that radiated from him.</p><p>Nola had met him what seemed an eternity but had actually only been four months ago. He\u2019d desired her, for whatever reason, and had tried to win her affections\u2014and she\u2019d tried to kill him.</p><p>With the memory, guilt filled her. But in her defense, she hadn\u2019t known him then. Had only been concerned with her own survival. The gods had swept them to a remote island, along with several other creatures, and pitted them against each other, forcing them to fight. Worse, forcing them to watch helplessly as their friends were executed.</p><p>More than that, she\u2019d spent her entire life hating men and the pain they brought with them. As a young child, she\u2019d been sold by her own mother to male after male; she\u2019d been used, hurt, taunted...ruined. Zane\u2019s desire had frightened her, and she had lashed out.</p> <p>And now, she was paying for that.</p><p>No one could see her. No one could hear her. Though she was encircled by the bright, golden light seeping through the tent\u2019s apex, no one knew she was there, that she\u2019d been among them, month after month. The gods had cursed her with invisibility when she\u2019d been eliminated from their impossible contest\u2014and then chained her to this camp as surely as Zane was now chained.</p><p>The gods had seen to Zane\u2019s captivity, as well, gifting the vampire to the Amazons to use as they saw fit. And use him they would\u2014and had already. Because mating season had not begun until today, they had forced him to work their land, hauling boulder after boulder for the building of more tents. He\u2019d had to find sticks and sharpen them into weapons. They\u2019d even forced him to feed many of the women by hand. Of course, he\u2019d tried to escape, time after time, so they\u2019d resorted to starving him. That starvation had caused him to weaken unbearably, rendering him useless. Lately all he\u2019d been able to do was lie in place and curse.</p><p>She hated seeing him like this. Maybe because she no longer viewed him as an enemy. How could she? He suffered as she suffered. But now, they would never have a chance to explore their...feelings for each other. Yes, feelings, she thought. On her part anyway. Finally, she felt. A need to protect. A need to defend.</p><p>Yet she could do neither. And after the way she had treated him, rejecting his advances, he might not want her to try.</p><p>What did he see in me, anyway? She\u2019d never understood. That dislike of another\u2019s touch...he\u2019d possessed it even on the island. Even with his own king, Layel. Except with her.</p><p>Her, he had welcomed. Again, why? What made her so different?</p><p>And why had she not reveled in him while she\u2019d had the chance?</p> <p>Foolish girl. That\u2019s what her mother had called her every time she\u2019d complained about her abuse. Nola had never agreed. Until now.</p><p>\u201cIt is time,\u201d a commanding female voice suddenly boomed. \u201cStand before the slave you wish to claim.\u201d</p><p>A royal decree the warrioresses rushed to obey, breaking apart, rushing forward.</p><p>Kreja, the Amazon queen, stood at the edge of her royal dais, her gaze scanning, expectant. She was a lovely woman, with pale hair and light eyes, both of which gave her the appearance of fragility. But she possessed an iron core, a vicious nature. Which was why Nola had always served her well. She cherished order and had truly enjoyed being led by a woman who thought battles were to be won at any cost.</p><p>Now? Not so much.</p><p>Finally, the women were crowded around the males that tempted them.</p><p>Nineteen of the thirty-two females chose Zane.</p><p>Shocking. She had thought their aversion to biting and blood would deter them. She should have known better. Strength was prized among the Amazons, and Zane had nearly won his freedom. Twice. They wanted that strength for their offspring, which was the entire point of mating season.</p><p>Her hands curled into fists. Fists that would remain useless, for they could make contact with no one but herself.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Kreja said with a grin. She nodded to the ones standing in front of Zane. \u201cYou have chosen well. Though the vampire is a parasite, his daughters will be stalwart.\u201d</p><p>His daughters.</p><p>They should have been mine. Amazons only gave birth to girls. Nola didn\u2019t know why or how, only that it was so. And she wanted to kill anyone who would accept this man\u2019s seed.</p><p>\u201cAnd if our goddess is shining upon us,\u201d Kreja continued, \u201cwe will be able to train those daughters to consume something besides blood. If not...\u201d She shrugged, but Nola knew what she implied.</p><p>The daughters would be killed.</p><p>Zane snarled.</p><p>That delighted the women around him, edging them to a new level of eagerness.</p><p>Nola fought a wave of anger, of helplessness. He knows what Kreja plans, and does not like it. He wants to protect his children, even though none have yet been conceived. No, she should not have feared Zane. She should have enjoyed him, maybe run away with him.</p><p>Like him, she did not like being touched. Except by him. His was the first touch in the entire span of her life that had not filled her with disgust. There had been something almost...reverent in his every gentle caress. If she\u2019d welcomed him, he might have helped purge the demons of her past. He might have saved her from herself.</p><p>Now, she would never know.</p><p>Just as she\u2019d wondered what made her so different to him, she wondered what made him so different to her. That they were so alike? That they sensed, on a bone-deep level, the other\u2019s hurt? Because yes, every time she neared him, her heart squeezed and shuddered. Pain always rested in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFight for me if you wish,\u201d he said through sharp, gritted teeth, drawing her thoughts back to the tent, \u201cbut know that I will slay the winner with my bare hands.\u201d</p><p>He was not a man given to boasting, Nola knew. He promised\u2014and he followed through.</p><p>\u201cSo vengeful,\u201d someone twittered happily.</p><p>\u201cSo mine,\u201d another snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt is I who will win his seed,\u201d still another growled. \u201cI who will give birth to his offspring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will bear my child,\u201d he roared. \u201cI will die first.\u201d</p><p>He could not die!</p><p>He is not meant to be a slave, Nola longed to shout. He was too proud, too defiant. Traits she also possessed. Which was why she had finally risen up and slain her own mother. Which in turn was why she sometimes cried herself to sleep, wishing she could claw the bloody images from her mind.</p><p>Scowling, Nola strode forward and reached out, hoping that, for once, her fingers would do more than ghost through as she tried to shove the Amazons aside. As always, her hand slipped through their bodies as if she were nothing more substantial than mist.</p><p>A cry of frustration escaped her.</p><p>Still, no one paid her any heed.</p><p>\u201cThose of you who desire the vampire will now enter the arena.\u201d Kreja\u2019s hard voice silenced their arguments. Together they did as commanded, bypassing Nola, even stepping through her. \u201cHe shall be the first prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d she shouted. \u201cHear me!\u201d</p><p>Of course, they did not.</p><p>Shoulders slumping, she closed the distance between herself and Zane and sank beside him. Like the others, he did not act as if he noticed. But she could almost\u2014almost\u2014feel his warmth, and goose bumps broke out over her skin.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d Kreja called with a wave of her hand.</p><p>Lily, the child-princess who would one day rule this clan, stood from her throne atop the dais and walked to her mother\u2019s side, her little body draped in velvet robes rather than the leather straps and skirts worn by the warrioresses.</p><p>She had changed much in the past few months. No longer was this queen-in-training giddy and innocent. Once having run from camp to prove herself worthy of her people\u2014thereby inadvertently beginning a war between the Amazons and the dragons, a war she\u2019d once thought had caused the deaths of Nola and another Amazon, Delilah\u2014she was now solemn. She\u2019d even relinquished her right to claim Brand the dragon shifter, another of the gods\u2019 exiles, as her personal servant, and had offered him up to her people. He now sat among the other slaves.</p><p>\u201cYou will not fight to the death,\u201d Lily proclaimed in her soft voice. \u201cBut you will continue to engage each other until only one of you is left standing. It is she who will earn the right to bed the vampire.\u201d</p><p>And when that winner tired of him, she could pass him on to her friends if she so chose. Increasing Zane\u2019s humiliation.</p><p>Mating season had never bothered Nola before, but it bothered her now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leave. After Nola\u2019s own experience with the gods\u2019 cruel contest, she had no desire to watch another. For Zane, however, she would watch. And she would wish.</p><p>Every female in the ring assumed the battle stance.</p><p>There was only a slight pause before Kreja said, \u201cYou may begin.\u201d</p> <p>Immediately the women leapt into action. Metal clanged against metal, grunts abounded, and sand was flung in every direction. Seconds bled into minutes. Minutes to what seemed hours. An eternity. Bodies began collapsing, cries of pain echoing, one pink-haired female savagely working her way through the masses.</p><p>Soon, she was the only one standing.</p><p>Over. Done.</p><p>Nola wanted to vomit.</p><p>\u201cAnd so we have a winner,\u201d Kreja decreed proudly. She motioned to Zane with a wave of her hand. \u201cClaim your prize, beloved. Know that we are pleased with the strength and tenacity you have demonstrated this day.\u201d</p> <p>As the female approached, Zane trembled. In rage. Perhaps in fear.</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry, vampire. \u201cI won\u2019t let her have you,\u201d Nola vowed, though she knew there was nothing she could do to stop what was to come.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>THE FEMALE WAS GOING to kill him, Zane thought dazedly, dispassionately.</p><p>She\u2019d won him, however long ago she\u2019d fought for him\u2014one day? Two? Weak as he was, he\u2019d lost track of time. All he knew was that she\u2019d tried multiple times to bed him. But she needed a hard cock for that, and he hadn\u2019t given it to her.</p><p>Denying her had delighted him. Still did.</p> <p>Now two of those wretched Amazons stood around him, staring down at his naked body. If he hadn\u2019t been half-starved and teetering on the brink of total collapse, those stares would have sent him into a killing rage. He hated being looked at as much as he hated being touched.</p><p>He\u2019d spent too many centuries as the demon queen\u2019s whore, hers to use, hers to hurt. And hurt him she had.</p><p>Many times, she\u2019d forced him to drop to his knees and \u201cworship\u201d her with his mouth. Many times, she had forced him to clean each and every one of the horns covering her body. Again, with his mouth. Many times, she had forced him to do the same to others while she watched.</p><p>But the worst... He shuddered, hating to remember. But just then, his memories were all he had. They filled him up, consumed him, eating him bite by rancid bite. She\u2019d blindfolded him and bound him to her bed. He had not known who kissed and touched him. Male, female. Demon, another slave. He hadn\u2019t known. He hated, hated that there were people in Atlantis who knew of his humiliation and subjugation. He hated that those people had seen him naked, tasted him, brought him to climax in terrible ways, yet he did not know who they were.</p><p>Bile rose from his stomach into his throat. Demon whore. That\u2019s what he was, all he would ever be. Demon whore, demon whore. He squeezed his eyes shut. He wanted to cover his ears, but could not. His arms were tied, true, but even if he had been free, he was too weak to move.</p><p>Demon whore.</p><p>How could he have allowed such things? And he had. Allowed them. He could have walked away at any time. Yet he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>All for the love of a woman. A slave, as he was supposed to be now. Marina, that detestable queen, had promised to set his beloved free if Zane pleased her until she grew tired of him. But she\u2019d never grown tired of him, and Cassandra, his chosen mate, had begun to hate him as a result. For all he knew, she could have been forced to watch him with the queen.</p> <p>Demon whore.</p><p>Yet still he\u2019d stayed, determined to finally win his prize. His Cassandra. If he couldn\u2019t have her as a mate, he\u2019d at least wanted her to be happy. And as he well knew, no one could be happy without freedom.</p><p>But then, his actions hadn\u2019t mattered. Layel, the vampire king, had done the impossible\u2014what Zane had craved but had not yet had the strength to do\u2014and drained the demon queen, finally freeing both Zane and Cassandra. He\u2019d thought to earn back her love. However necessary. After all, everything he had done had been for her. Every hated touch, every blinded session. Only, she\u2019d fled him. For another man.</p><p>Demon whore.</p><p>Perhaps that had been for the best.</p><p>Zane was not the man he\u2019d once been. He eschewed females and wanted no part of them. Wanted no part of sex. He shuddered at even the thought of it, and sickness once again churned in his stomach. Had he eaten that day, he would have vomited.</p><p>One bright light. Remember your one bright light.</p><p>Nola.</p><p>Finally, his stomach calmed.</p><p>Nola had walked into his life, chasing away the darkness. Beautiful, passionate, fierce Nola. A woman who hadn\u2019t wanted him, who had rebuffed him. A woman he\u2019d craved with every ounce of his being despite what had been done to him. A woman the gods had taken from him. Why did he want her so damned passionately? He hadn\u2019t known then, and he didn\u2019t know now. Yet still he craved her. As if she were necessary to him. To his survival. As if, the first moment their eyes had met, hers as haunted as he knew his were, she had become a part of him.</p><p>Would he ever see her again?</p><p>He did not know if she\u2019d survived their island game or if the gods had set her free, but sometimes he would swear that he smelled her sweet scent, felt the gentle glide of her hands on him. A touch he still did not mind.</p><p>A touch he needed. She...soothed him.</p><p>And, actually, the first time he\u2019d seen her, he\u2019d thought her a gift from the gods. For why else would he have been able to endure\u2014no, enjoy\u2014her touch and no other? Now, he thought that perhaps she\u2019d been another curse. He craved her still, yet like Cassandra he could never have her.</p><p>What did I do to deserve this?</p><p>Demon whore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m strong,\u201d his owner said now, drawing his attention, \u201cso of course he desires me. I mean, look at what I did to my competitors! Eighteen against one, yet I owned that arena. But he\u2019s too weak to be claimed. That\u2019s the problem here. Surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Clearly he needs blood,\u201d another said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but if he\u2019s given blood, he\u2019ll be able to raise his head and bite me.\u201d</p><p>Both of the females shuddered.</p><p>Did these Amazons\u2014who abhorred the biting of flesh and the drinking of blood and who thought to rape him to steal a child from him\u2014not realize the child of a vampire would not be trainable, as the Amazon queen had said? A vampire needed blood. Blood was nourishment. Life. That was not something that could be \u201ctrained\u201d away.</p><p>And so, any child of his would be killed. That\u2019s what the foolish queen had implied.</p><p>His baby. Killed. Even through the haze of weakness, rage sparked inside his chest. He would kill them first, he thought, once again struggling against his bonds.</p><p>They expected him to leave his child behind, to be raised by them. Abused by them. Something he would never do. What was his, was his. He did not share. He did not abandon.</p><p>\u201cWeak, but still fighting,\u201d the pink-haired Amazon said with awe.</p><p>\u201cYet still no hardened shaft,\u201d the other tsked.</p><p>Calm. Or they will stop feeding you altogether. Though every bone in his body screamed for him to do otherwise, he relaxed against his pallet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to feed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But even now, I think he would bite me if I got too close. What is to happen when he\u2019s stronger?\u201d</p><p>Before his last escape attempt, they\u2019d kept him nourished by allowing him three small cups of blood a day. Who had donated the blood, he didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t care. He didn\u2019t like to take from a living source, only from those he\u2019d slain. So he\u2019d pretended the blood came from one of his victims.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s think this through, then. Perhaps there is another way. Did you try manipulating his rod?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. He\u2019s not my first slave, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, give him blood, then...bind his mouth. Yes, that might work. That way, he\u2019ll be strong enough to bed but unable to nibble on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, excellent idea! Grab a goblet.\u201d The pink-haired woman\u2014he hadn\u2019t cared to remember her name\u2014palmed one of her daggers, sliced a groove in her wrist and held the wound over the offered cup.</p><p>His mouth watered at the sight and smell of that crimson nectar; his fangs elongated. She was not dead, he couldn\u2019t pretend otherwise, but he would still take from her. Sacrifices must be made in times of adversity.</p><p>She approached him and held the cup to his lips. Thankfully, her skin did not brush his. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>As though in a trance, he obeyed, swallowing three precious mouthfuls. Instantly, warmth spread through him, followed on its heels by strength. So good...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s working. His color is returning.\u201d The goblet was removed from his mouth, and he found his gaze locked with that of his captor. She was pretty, if he cared for such things. He didn\u2019t. He only cared that she had pink hair rather than black, brown eyes rather than turquoise, and she did not smell like Nola. Like sea and storms and flowers.</p><p>There was a pause, then a purr of agreement. \u201cHe\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget he\u2019s mine,\u201d was the snapped reply.</p><p>\u201cWell, his cock is still flaccid, so you won\u2019t be claiming him any time soon,\u201d the other Amazon lashed back.</p><p>As the blood continued to work through him, the lethargy that had plagued him all these many days dissolved, leaving energy in his muscles, a sizzle in his bones. Escape, he thought, a growl working its way past his throat.</p><p>Both Amazons jumped away from him with a yelp.</p><p>\u201cHurry! Let\u2019s bind his mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d Growls intensifying, Zane jerked at the chains circling his wrists and ankles. He hissed and snapped, kicking as much as he was able as the Amazons maneuvered around him. \u201cNo touching! Do you hear me? I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Metal cut past his flesh, hitting those sizzling bones. Still he fought, imagining his blade slicing through both of these women. More blood would spill. He would lap it up. Strengthen even more. He would tear through their camp. No mercy.</p><p>Suddenly a golden ray of light spilled inside the tent, and he would have sworn he caught a glimpse of...no, surely not. Couldn\u2019t be. Yet...there she was. His Nola. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d He stilled, his heart slamming against his ribs. Couldn\u2019t be, he thought again. Unless...was she a hallucination? He\u2019d had them before, yet they never ceased to shock him.</p><p>His captor moved, reaching for his neck, blocking the vision.</p><p>\u201cOut of my way!\u201d he shouted, bumping his hip against hers and sending her toppling to her face. He\u2019d imagined Nola before, there in the battle tent. Sadly, that glimpse had lasted only a few heart-stopping seconds. How long would this one last?</p> <p>Had his captor already dispelled it?</p><p>If she had...</p><p>No. There Nola was again, a shimmering outline of long black hair, a glow of turquoise eyes. She was trying\u2014ineffectually\u2014to tug his captor away from him. He lost his breath. So lovely. His shaft hardened quickly and painfully. Nola. His sweetest tormentor.</p><p>Then the vision wavered, the air dabbled...gone. She was gone.</p><p>He wanted to scream and hurt and maim. To kill and be killed. The desire came too late, though, his stunned immobility costing him. The Amazon was able to leap to her feet and easily hook a thick strap of material around his useless mouth.</p> <p>\u201cFinally.\u201d Sighing with satisfaction, she leaned away from him, crouching on her haunches and smiling smugly. \u201cAnd just as I suspected, your rod is\u2014\u201d Her words halted and her smile faded as his cock withered before her eyes. \u201cBut...you were...why...\u201d</p><p>He had only imagined Nola; he knew that, but he couldn\u2019t stop his gaze from searching for another glimpse of her. To his dismay, he saw only furs, carved furniture and weapons.</p><p>Even as his captor and her friend attempted to arouse him once more, stripping for him, caressing him, he did not stop searching.</p><p>Finally, exasperated with him, the Amazons dressed and stormed from the tent, leaving him alone with his insanity.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>AS MANY TIMES AS NOLA had been chained and used in her life, she knew the humiliation, frustration and helplessness Zane was now feeling. He must want to kill Amelia, his new owner. She did.</p> <p>Hurting another Amazon went against every instinct Nola possessed, every rule she\u2019d ever been taught\u2014after she\u2019d escaped her mother, that is\u2014but she would have sliced the warrioress to pieces if she\u2019d been able to grip a blade. Exactly as she\u2019d done to her mother. Zane\u2019s eyes had been so wild, his snarls so desperate. And she\u2019d been unable to aid him, had only been able to watch in horror.</p><p>\u201cI will take his place,\u201d she shouted to the ceiling, not knowing if the gods were listening. Or if they even cared. But she had to try. Zane didn\u2019t deserve this. No one did. At least she had endured servitude before. She could do so again. And were she to actually take Zane\u2019s place, the women wouldn\u2019t rape her, of course, but they would work her and beat her. Neither of which would break her. Because she would know she had helped her man.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she shouted. \u201cSwitch us!\u201d</p><p>No response. But suddenly air was sucked through Zane\u2019s nostrils, and his body jerked. Then he began struggling against his bonds again. Her attention whipped to him. He was staring directly at her, his dark gaze boring into her.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d she said, rushing to his side and kneeling. \u201cShh, now. Shh. You\u2019ll only injure your wrists and ankles further.\u201d Already he was bleeding, losing the blood he\u2019d just been given.</p><p>He tracked her every movement.</p><p>Could he...no. Not possible. No matter how many times she\u2019d wished otherwise, she\u2019d remained as un-noticeable as the air he breathed. Besides, if he knew she was here, he would be fighting her as he\u2019d fought Amelia. Perhaps even more violently. She had not only rebuked his advances, she had tried to hurt him, too. Had called him vile names he had not deserved. All because she\u2019d been too frightened of her feelings.</p><p>I am not worthy of being an Amazon warrioress.</p> <p>Frantic, Zane rubbed his jaw against his shoulder until the material fell away from his mouth. \u201cNola,\u201d he rasped. \u201cNola, Nola, Nola. You are here.\u201d He could see her. Oh, gods. Oh, gods! Could she touch him? Her arm shook as she reached out, meaning to brush his hair from his face, but as always, her hand ghosted through him. She moaned in frustration.</p><p>He laughed, the sound full of sweet satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019ve finally slipped over the edge of sanity and I don\u2019t care.\u201d He relaxed against the blankets spread out beneath him. \u201cMy Nola, here to comfort me. As beautiful as ever.\u201d</p><p>His Nola? A shiver moved through her. Oh, if only... \u201cYou aren\u2019t imagining me, Zane. I\u2019m truly here. I\u2019ve been here since the day of your arrival.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t seem to hear her. His gaze was too busy drinking her in. \u201cOf course I would imagine you like this, soft and lush, but still not mine to possess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me. The gods cursed me, as they cursed you, only I am not to be seen, heard or felt.\u201d Until now. Why, why, why could she now be seen and heard but still not felt?</p><p>Finally, her words seemed to take root. His eyelids narrowed and his lips pulled tight against his teeth, revealing the tips of those deadly fangs. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed I remind you of the gods\u2019 powers?\u201d</p><p>His cheeks flushed. \u201cHow can I see you now, then?\u201d he asked, mirroring her thoughts. \u201cWhat has changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew,\u201d she said on a sigh. Would others be able to see her, as well?</p><p>He laughed without humor. \u201cSo. Another curse is to be heaped upon me. To see, but never to touch the only one I desire.\u201d He turned his head from her, as if he couldn\u2019t bear to look at her another second.</p><p>That was the treatment she\u2019d expected from him, but it still hurt. You deserve it. Take it like a warrior.</p><p>At least he no longer thought himself crazy.</p><p>\u201cYou...still wish to touch me?\u201d</p><p>A pause, heavy, laden with tension. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you with Brand?\u201d he demanded rather than answer her.</p><p>Brand, the dragon shape-shifter who had been cursed right alongside them. \u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d What? She liked Brand, but she wasn\u2019t concerned with his treatment. He had not fought his captivity like Zane. He had embraced the thought of a temporary Amazon owner.</p><p>Other than Lily, that is. Lily had been too young for him, and he\u2019d been nothing more than a maid for her. Since she\u2019d released him into the tender care of the other Amazons, though, he\u2019d looked nothing but content.</p><p>But even if he had not been enjoying himself, Nola still would have chosen to watch over Zane. His strength and determination, and even his wildness, drew her. Maybe because that wildness had never truly extended to her. Even when she\u2019d stabbed both of his shoulders with spears, he had not attempted to hurt her. He had cried out for her, wanting to be with her.</p><p>I hate myself for rejecting him.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you used your...gift to help you escape?\u201d she asked, ignoring his question as he\u2019d ignored hers. Much as this man had to hate her, despite the desire he\u2019d professed\u2014or had she imagined that?\u2014she wasn\u2019t ready to voice her softer feelings. Even she didn\u2019t understand her change from tormentor to tormented. And what if he were to reject her? Her already bruised and battered heart would not survive.</p><p>His cheeks heated in embarrassment, but still he did not face her.</p><p>He\u2019d once used that gift on her. Had slipped inside her dreams and showed her how good it would be between them. How he would kiss and taste every inch of her body, enjoy her, help her enjoy him.</p><p>\u201cYou can show the Amazons the destruction you will unleash if they fail to release you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gods stripped me of the ability when they sent me here,\u201d he finally admitted. \u201cI can no longer enter dreams. Or create nightmares. They also stripped me of my ability to transport myself to other locations with only a thought.\u201d</p><p>Damn them! \u201cThere has to be a way to free you. I wish I could leave camp and visit your king. Word has spread through Atlantis that he is wed now to my sister, Delilah. They would help you, I know it. And maybe, like you, they would be able to see and hear me. But I am bound to this camp, as surely as if I were shackled. I cannot leave its boundaries.\u201d</p><p>Or perhaps she could, now that part of her curse seemed to be lifted. She wanted to check, but couldn\u2019t force herself to move away.</p><p>Zane shifted even further away from her, his chains rattling. It was another stark reminder of their doomed circumstances. \u201cWhy would you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2014\u201d She peered down at her hands. Her fingers were twined together and twisting the leather of her skirt. They wanted to be on Zane\u2019s body, learning his every nuance. What would make him gasp in pleasure? What would make him moan? \u201cI owe you. I hurt you, and I\u2019m sorry for that. Sorrier than I can ever express. I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he growled, cutting her off. \u201cI don\u2019t want your apology. I never did.\u201d</p><p>Rejection. Even though she had not professed her new feelings. As she\u2019d suspected, her heart stopped. Literally stopped. Tears burned her eyes. She had not cried in years. Not since she was a little girl, huddled in bed, dreading the monsters who would visit her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted you...your body,\u201d he added in a croak. \u201cStill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Shocking. Need trembled through her. Welcome need. Beloved need. \u201cYes.\u201d Yes. \u201cI would rather give myself to you than give the apology, for I want you, too.\u201d There. Admission. Not as scary as she had thought. Freeing, actually. \u201cBut you can\u2019t touch me, and I cannot touch you. How...\u201d Hated need, she thought next. A craving that could never be satisfied.</p><p>\u201cWe will figure it out.\u201d Huskily said, softening expression.</p><p>How? she wanted to ask again, but didn\u2019t. No telling when Amelia would return. Their privacy was limited, and she did not want to spend it grasping for solutions they would never find.</p><p>Apparently, Zane did not either.</p><p>\u201cClimb on top of me,\u201d he beseeched. \u201cI want to see you there. Want to imagine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To her surprise, she obeyed without hesitation, eager, straddling his waist. His eyes closed, and he arched up. Imagine, he\u2019d said. He was imagining sinking inside her.</p><p>Yes, she thought. Yes. She would like that. Wanted that. She imagined his hard shaft entering inch by inch and moaned. A few times, the act had felt pleasurable rather than painful, but those times had left her wallowing in shame. How could she have liked being bedded by those disgusting males, even for a moment?</p><p>This time, however, there was no shame. Only acceptance. More.</p> <p>\u201cZane, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. Would you like me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The entrance to the tent flapped, and Amelia strode inside. \u201cWell, vampire. I have decided\u2014\u201d Her eyes widened, and she stopped. \u201cNola? What are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>Nola jumped up as though burned. She wanted to scream in frustration, but held her tongue. One question had been answered, at least. Others could see her. \u201cHello, Amelia.\u201d Did she sound as breathless to the warrioress as she did to herself?</p><p>\u201cWe thought you were dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought wrong.\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s dark gaze swung to Zane, then back to Nola. \u201cEither way, you will move away from my slave. If you wanted him for yourself, you should have been brave enough to return and fight for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want him for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d</p> <p>No. It wasn\u2019t. She refused to believe that.</p><p>\u201cNola,\u201d Zane said, and there was a warning in his tone.</p><p>A warning of what? Nola didn\u2019t face him, but squared her shoulders and forced her expression to harden. \u201cWell, I am here now. Amelia, I challenge you for the vampire.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>\u201cHURRY! SHE\u2019LL RETURN any moment, and she\u2019ll have others with her. Perhaps the entire army.\u201d</p><p>Zane watched as Nola tried and failed to jerk the head of his chains from the iron pole they were attached to, a pole that was anchored deep in the earth. As before, her fingers merely passed through the object.</p><p>His shock had yet to diminish. Nola was here; Nola wanted him; Nola thought to help him. After her announcement\u2014I challenge you for the vampire\u2014his captor had stormed out of the tent with every intention of speaking to the Amazon queen. And having Nola imprisoned.</p><p>No. He would not allow that.</p> <p>She was his.</p><p>Earlier when she\u2019d apologized to him, it had not been remorse thickening her voice. It had been desire. Then she\u2019d climbed on top of him without any uncertainty, had moaned when he\u2019d arched into her. He hadn\u2019t been able to feel her, but oh, just the thought of doing so had been enough for him. He\u2019d never craved a female more.</p><p>\u201cHow do you propose to fight her?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou cannot hurt her, and she cannot hurt you.\u201d Thank the gods. He would rather endure an eternity of slavery than watch this woman bleed.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to fight her. Well, I did, do, but know I can\u2019t. I just wanted time. And why are you just lying there?\u201d She peered down at him, hands on her hips, dark hair streaming wildly around her delicate face. \u201cFight free!\u201d</p><p>So lovely. Everything he\u2019d craved these many months of his captivity\u2014Nola, freedom, a chance to be together\u2014was now being offered to him. No longer did he feel cursed. Never had he been so blessed.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t feel her? So what. Being with her was more important.</p><p>\u201cYou will come with me? If I escape?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I can, yes. I want that more than anything,\u201d she added in a fierce whisper.</p><p>Again, there was no uncertainty. There was even a flicker of hope in her magnificent eyes. She truly did not hate him.</p><p>What had brought about this change in her?</p><p>Would she change her mind if she knew of his past?</p><p>Demon whore.</p><p>He squeezed his eyes closed, wishing once again that he could cover his ears.</p><p>\u201cZane, darling. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t tell her. Don\u2019t ever tell her. \u201cNothing.\u201d She would run from him as Cassandra had.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting,\u201d Nola said. She tapped on his chest, just above his heart. \u201cHere. Tell me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will escape,\u201d he said instead. \u201cYou will come with me.\u201d</p><p>He was suddenly fueled with a fervor he had never experienced before. He wanted this. Would have this. Just as...soon as...he broke...free. For what seemed an eternity, he pulled hard at his wrists and ankles, straining so forcefully his bones eventually gave way.</p><p>Out came both his ankles; out came both his wrists. The pain of it nearly bowled him over as he sat up, then stood to trembling legs. He didn\u2019t care about the pain, though. He was free at last.</p><p>Together. They could be together.</p><p>\u201cI hear them,\u201d Nola gasped. \u201cCome on.\u201d She made to grab him, but her hand misted through his body. \u201cDamn this!\u201d</p><p>There was no sensation, no chill, but the knowledge that she had tried to touch him caused him to shiver rather than shudder. From the very first, it had been that way. Others he ran from. Others he abhorred. Her, he only yearned for more of. Why? he wondered again.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d She raced to the far end of the tent. \u201cRaise the flap.\u201d</p><p>He lumbered to her, stumbling constantly, and did as commanded. All the while, his battered body screamed in agony, black winking over his vision, stomach threatening to heave. Vampires were fast healers, but he\u2019d been without blood too long, the few sips he\u2019d had earlier already used up.</p><p>Outside, light poured from the crystal dome surrounding all of Atlantis, heating and stinging his now-sensitive skin and making his eyes water. This kind of reaction had only happened once before. On that cursed island of the gods.</p><p>The reminder of his time there infuriated him and that fury gave him strength. He could do this. Tent after tent dotted the surrounding land. Amazons were scattered throughout. Some were bent over a fire and hammering at weapons; some were hanging animal hides.</p><p>\u201cWalk behind me,\u201d Nola said, \u201cas if you are my slave.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for his agreement, she moved forward, head held high. Behind him, he could hear a murmur of voices inside his captor\u2019s tent. Amelia had returned, and she had indeed brought an army with her. Zane kicked into motion. Thankfully, no one paid them any heed\u2014until a horn blasted. The Amazons around him straightened, a few even reaching for weapons.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Nola shouted, picking up speed. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>No longer content to remain behind her, he matched her pace. A forest loomed a few yards ahead, thick trees promising cover.</p><p>\u201cNola!\u201d someone shouted. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire,\u201d his captor screamed. \u201cNot another step. I will punish you.\u201d</p><p>Zane tripped over a rock. He lurched forward, his broken ankles unable to support him. When he hit the ground, he hit hard and lost every bit of oxygen in his lungs. Grimacing, he lumbered back up. Started running again.</p><p>All the while, Nola encouraged him. \u201cYou can do it. I know you can. That\u2019s the way. Just a little farther. You\u2019re so strong. You\u2019re so brave. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Sweeter words had never been spoken. Such encouragement... No one, not even his king, had offered it. He soaked it up, bloomed under it. His speed increased, his steps firmed.</p><p>But when they reached the trees, Nola stopped and screeched. \u201cNo! No, no, no.\u201d</p><p>He, too, stopped and faced her. He tried to grab her, but as before, encountered only air. \u201cCome. Now. We\u2019ll enter the forest and disappear.\u201d Together, he thought again, satisfaction filling him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s like a wall is blocking me.\u201d Frantic, she tossed a glance over her shoulder at the scowling Amazon warrioresses bearing down on them. \u201cGo. Please. Just go.\u201d</p><p>Still she could not leave the camp\u2019s boundary?</p><p>He remained in place, the screams in his head no longer for his bodily pain. He couldn\u2019t leave this woman behind. But he couldn\u2019t stay here, broken as he was. He was no good to either of them.</p><p>Damn the gods to Hades!</p><p>Demon whore. To think, even for a moment, that he\u2019d felt blessed. Foolish.</p><p>\u201cWill they attempt to punish you?\u201d he asked. He had to know. He would stay here, even broken as he was, even helpless as he was. Anything to protect her.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t hurt me. They might be able to see me, but I\u2019m untouchable, remember?\u201d She smiled, but it didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. \u201cNow go, before they take you. They will not be as gentle with you this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola...\u201d She is mine. I keep what is mine.</p><p>\u201cZane. Go. Please. Save yourself. You are not meant to be any woman\u2019s slave. Not even mine.\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked below his eye. \u201cI will come back for you. Soon as I\u2019m healed, I will come back.\u201d As he spoke, he walked backward.</p><p>\u201cI will think and dream of you always.\u201d</p><p>A goodbye? Oh, no. \u201cI will come back,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWatch for me.\u201d Only when she was blocked from his view did he spin and run.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>NOLA FACED OFF WITH HER sisters. They formed a menacing half-circle around her, each glaring at her.</p><p>\u201cYou freed my slave,\u201d Amelia growled, and several warrioresses booed and hissed at Nola.</p><p>She had always been something of a tribe outsider, so she wasn\u2019t surprised at the cold welcome. \u201cHe isn\u2019t yours, but yes,\u201d she said proudly. \u201cI freed him.\u201d And she would do so again. Anything for Zane.</p><p>I will come back, he\u2019d said. Twice. She shivered.</p><p>A frowning Kreja stepped forward, separating herself from the masses and placing herself nose to nose with Nola. \u201cI want five of my elite armed and hunting the vampire within the next five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps echoed as the warrioresses complied. They could look, but they wouldn\u2019t find him. He was too determined. I will come back.</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d the queen continued, \u201cyou know the punishment for stealing your sister\u2019s slave?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nola repeated. The punishment\u2014a savage, wish-you-were-dead whipping. Not that they could administer it. But even if she\u2019d been tangible, she would have risked it. Zane\u2019s freedom was worth losing the skin on her back. At the very least.</p><p>\u201cDelilah returned and told us you lived still, but that did not stop our worry for you. And now I find you here, working against us. Why would you do such a thing?\u201d the queen asked, sounding genuinely curious, slightly sad, rather than fully enraged.</p><p>\u201cThe vampire had endured enough at the hands of the Amazons. Like us, he is a living being with feelings. He is courageous, wild as the animals in this forest and fierce beyond imagining. We would have broken him.\u201d Or tried to.</p> <p>\u201cWise words.\u201d Kreja arched a brow. \u201cAnd yet, he left you here to endure punishment, even though you aided him. Do you find that a worthy trait?\u201d</p><p>I will come back.</p><p>And he would. She had no doubt. Never before had she trusted a man, but she trusted Zane. Having watched him these past few months, she knew he was not the kind of man who made vows lightly. She knew he did not say things simply to placate his audience. Oh, yes. He would return.</p><p>What they would do when he reached her, she didn\u2019t know. She only knew that she needed to be with him. To see his face and hear his voice. She could live with any curse, as long as he was alive and well and with her. \u201cI find him worthy,\u201d she finally replied.</p><p>Kreja sighed. \u201cThat does not change what you have done. Not only did you free a slave, you freed your sister\u2019s slave. For that, you will deal with Amelia in the battle arena. She will be armed. You will not. Afterward, if you survive, you will be whipped, as is our custom.\u201d</p> <p>The queen reached out\u2014and wrapped her fingers around Nola\u2019s suddenly solid forearm, dragging her toward the arena, Amelia marching close on her heels.</p><p>Nola gasped in shock. What...why...how was it possible? She could be touched now.</p><p>\u201cI will not go easy on you,\u201d Amelia snarled at her.</p><p>They can touch me. Which means they can hurt me, Nola realized, dread sweeping through her.</p><p>Would she be alive when Zane returned?</p><p>ZANE REACHED THE VAMPIRE stronghold and collapsed at its gates. His strength\u2014gone. His wounds\u2014unhealed. Followed as he\u2019d been, he hadn\u2019t been able to hunt for food. Broken as he was, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to capture a single animal and feed himself.</p> <p>Thankfully the guards recognized him. He was hefted over a shoulder and carted inside the palace. The touch disturbed him, but he didn\u2019t fight it. He was in too much of a hurry and knew this was the best way. By the time they reached his personal chamber, there was a buzz of activity, his name being whispered from everyone\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cBlood,\u201d he rasped as the guard lay him down on the bed.</p><p>That guard tilted his head, offering his own neck.</p><p>Zane shook his head and closed his eyes. \u201cGlass.\u201d He would not take from a living source. Still couldn\u2019t stomach the thought\u2014unless that living source was Nola. Once, when he\u2019d ensured she would welcome him by invading her dreams, he had tasted her. The sweetness of her blood...the decadence of her moans...he\u2019d reveled in every nuance of her. He would not overshadow that precious memory by taking from someone else, even in his desperation.</p><p>How did she affect him this way?</p><p>Would he always be forced to wonder?</p><p>Perhaps he did not mind her hands on him because he saw himself in her eyes. Every damned time he looked at her. He saw vulnerability and pain, fear and yearning.</p><p>Perhaps they shared a similar past; she\u2019d alluded to such a thing once before, when they\u2019d been pitted against each other on the island. Back then, he had been too wrapped in his newfound desire to pay much attention to her words. Never again, he vowed. What she said came first. Always. As did protecting her, defending her.</p> <p>And maybe she would feel the same about him.</p><p>He suddenly wanted to hug her close and tell her everything that had happened to him. Admit that he\u2019d once been the demon queen\u2019s willing sexual toy. She might...she might understand rather than run.</p><p>Demon whore.</p><p>How could anyone understand?</p><p>But for once, the taunt did not drive him to distraction. She might, and for now, that was enough.</p><p>Warm hands settled on his shoulders and shook him.</p><p>His eyelids fluttered open, a growl in his throat. When he saw that Layel loomed above him, glass in hand, he forced himself to relax against the feathered mattress. \u201cMy king, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo talking just yet. Drink,\u201d Layel said, placing the glass to his lips. Tall and leanly muscled, with white hair and blue eyes, he was an eerily beautiful sight that reminded Zane of both his rescue from the demon queen and the horrors he\u2019d later endured at the hands of the gods. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>Zane opened his mouth, and the sweet nectar of life poured down his throat. He swallowed greedily. Once again, warmth spread through him. Warmth and strength and determination.</p><p>He had not lied to Nola. He was going back for her. He would conquer that damn camp and everyone inside it.</p><p>Nola will not like that. Those women are her sisters.</p><p>Well, they damn well should not have tried to enslave him, he thought darkly. But he knew deep down that he wouldn\u2019t hurt them. Not really. For Nola, he would simply send them on their way, claiming the camp as his own and remaining there until she could leave it. And if she could never leave it, he would never leave it.</p><p>\u201cGood now?\u201d Layel asked.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d he said when the supply ran out. He\u2019d need every ounce of his strength to conquer the Amazons.</p><p>Layel cut his wrist, filled the glass with his own life force, and offered it up. This time, Zane was able to hold the glass on his own. Again, he drained every drop. When he finished, he licked his lips and faced the king.</p><p>\u201cI am ready to talk,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood. I have questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer mine first. You escaped the gods and their island.\u201d He grunted as his wrists and ankles popped back into place. \u201cDid you win their game?\u201d</p><p>The king\u2019s lips slowly lifted in a grin. \u201cDelilah did. She saved us both. We have been searching for you since the moment of our return, but the Amazons hid you well. We knew you were there, but we could find no sign of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you news of my sister?\u201d a female voice asked.</p><p>Zane looked past his king and saw Delilah standing in the doorway. She was petite in appearance, but as fierce as Nola on a battlefield. Her blue hair was falling around her shoulders, and worry was etched in the violet depths of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe is alive,\u201d he told her, and she expelled a relieved breath. \u201cAnd she is mine.\u201d</p><p>A pause.</p><p>\u201cAnd does she agree with that statement?\u201d Delilah\u2019s head tilted to the side as she rubbed at her slightly rounded belly. There was barely contained fury in her tone. She would slay him without mercy if he hurt Nola, that much was obvious.</p><p>Rather than plead his case, he focused on that belly. Slightly rounded. A baby? Layel was to become a father? An ache bloomed in Zane\u2019s chest. He\u2019d wanted children with Cassandra. Had dreamed of them. Yet that, too, had been denied him. Until...now? With Nola... You cannot truly touch her, you fool. That dream is still dead. He couldn\u2019t make himself care, however. As long as he had Nola, nothing else mattered.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Delilah insisted.</p><p>Did Nola wish to belong to him? she\u2019d asked. He thought so, yes. She had helped him. She had even wanted to go with him. But she was also a warrior to her core, an Amazon warrior at that, and they only tolerated men during mating season. He wanted far more than that. No matter the circumstances. He wanted what Layel and Delilah clearly had.</p><p>\u201cWe will see,\u201d Zane said, kicking his legs over the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou only just returned,\u201d Layel said. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get my woman.\u201d This one, he wouldn\u2019t let get away.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>GRUNTS, GROANS AND THE CLANG of metal against metal roused Nola from her troubled sleep. She wanted to rise, to see what was happening, but could not force her body into action. Her back was a mass of agony, the skin flayed completely. The rest of her, well, it had not fared much better during her battle with Amelia. Nola had won, her determination stronger than any weapon, but she had not emerged unscathed. There were deep sword slices all down her arms, stomach and legs.</p><p>She lay on her bed, her stomach pressed into soft blankets. Alone, always alone. No one was allowed to help her. Not in any way. Amazons healed as slowly as humans, so she knew she would suffer like this for many weeks to come.</p><p>Outside, a scream echoed. Her muscles were heavy as stones, and she didn\u2019t have the strength to drag herself upright. Or gather food. Not that she even had the strength to eat. She wanted to help her sisters, though. Despite what had been done to her, she loved them.</p><p>They had welcomed her into their fold when she\u2019d had nowhere else to go. They had despised her mother for what the woman had done to her.</p><p>\u201cYou will die for this, vampires!\u201d someone shouted.</p><p>\u201cNot by your hand,\u201d she heard a male voice say. The vampire king? That had sounded like his rough, cocky timbre.</p><p>Despite her pain, Nola grinned. Relaxed.</p><p>Zane was here.</p><p>For hours, the battle continued to rage. Nola didn\u2019t want her sisters injured, but neither did she want Zane to lose, and waiting proved difficult. She chewed at her cheeks, dug her nails into her palms and broke into a sweat, which caused her back to burn as if it had been set on fire as well as flayed.</p><p>Finally, the tent flap rose and light flooded inside. And then he was there, standing in front of her. Her vampire. Zane. Her heart knocked against her ribs.</p><p>\u201cKnew you\u2019d come,\u201d she said, her voice barely audible. She hadn\u2019t screamed during her whipping, hadn\u2019t made a sound, but holding her cries inside had scraped her throat raw.</p><p>\u201cNola...sweet...\u201d He approached her slowly, as if she were a trapped animal. \u201cWhat did they do to you?\u201d There was horror in his tone. He crouched beside her, reached out and smoothed her hair from her damp forehead. Then he froze. \u201cHow is this possible? I\u2019m touching you. Feeling your warmth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. Happened just after you\u2019d left.\u201d Any other time, she would have been mortified for him to see her like this: broken, helpless, naked but for a sheet covering her lower half. Her relief at seeing him alive and well, however, was simply too great.</p><p>\u201cI will destroy the gods for this. How dare they do this to you! Allow you to feel only when you will be injured. The cruelty such an act requires... I will find a way to raid the heavens and I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. This is a blessing. I\u2019ve had time to think, and I believe I know what\u2019s happening. Each time I admit something about you, like the fact that you did not deserve what was done to you, and that I trust you, I\u2019ve been given back a piece of my life.\u201d</p> <p>His brows furrowed together, and a spark of hope entered his eyes. \u201cCan you pass the camp boundary now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My sisters carried me there, meaning to toss me out after my whipping, but that invisible wall blocked them.\u201d</p><p>Fury replaced the hope. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hurt your sisters\u2014I knew you would hate it if we did, but now I wish I\u2019d sliced each and every one of them to pieces. They abandoned camp or I would see to it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here now. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d And it was. \u201cBut...how long will you be able to stay?\u201d Her nervousness returned. His king would want him back. And the Amazons would one day come back. This was not the first time their camp had been taken. They always came back. Angrier. Far more brutal. \u201cYou can\u2019t remain forever, and I can\u2019t leave. We\u2019ll be forced to separate again and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s all right, sweet. Do not worry yourself. Think only of healing. I\u2019m here, and I\u2019m not leaving without you. No matter what. You freed me. I will find a way to free you.\u201d</p> <p>The burst of strength her nervousness had given her drained, and she expelled a breath. \u201cAs long as I have you, I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d The words flowed freely. Talking about her feelings was becoming easier.</p><p>\u201cYes, you will.\u201d He stretched out beside her and angled his head, displaying his neck to her. The scent of him filled her nose. Dark spice and tree dew. She inhaled deeply, savoring. \u201cDrink,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d Even when they\u2019d been trapped on that island, he had not let anyone drink from him. Not from his wrist, and certainly not from his neck. \u201cDrink. I know biting and blood are distasteful to your kind, but you will heal faster if my blood flows inside your veins. I have watched others of my kind do this for their mates who were not vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t mind drinking from you. I just don\u2019t want to disgust you. I know you do not like such things being done to you.\u201d</p><p>Precious little lights flickered in his eyes. \u201cI want to give you everything, Nola. Even this. With you and no other. I need this, so please. Please.\u201d</p><p>Please, this proud, strong man had said. How could she deny him? She cried out as she edged toward him\u2014pain, so much pain\u2014and sank her teeth into his neck, hard as she could, cutting past skin and hitting vein. Blood instantly trickled down her throat.</p> <p>Once, the thought of doing this would have been distasteful to her, as he\u2019d claimed. But this was Zane. She wanted him inside her. Any part of him that she could get. And like him, she wanted him to have everything she had to give.</p><p>\u201cI never thought to allow someone to take from me again,\u201d he said, petting her head. \u201cI\u2014I have to tell you something. Something that may make you hate me. But you deserve to know.\u201d</p><p>Nothing could make her hate him. Nothing.</p><p>He did not give her time to tell him that. \u201cThe demon queen,\u201d he continued. \u201cI was her slave for many centuries. Her...bedmate. Willingly. She took from me whenever and however she desired. Her methods sickened me, but I allowed them because she had something\u2014someone\u2014my compliance was supposed to purchase.\u201d</p><p>Nola released his neck. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do not speak. Keep drinking. There is more I must tell you, but my courage will abandon me if your mouth is gone from me.\u201d</p><p>She sank her teeth back into his neck, the warmth of his blood spinning through her, lighting her up from the inside out.</p><p>\u201cWhen she died and I was freed, I thought to never endure such things again. You, though, I think I would allow to do anything to me. It has been that way from the first. I don\u2019t understand it, either. Your presence doesn\u2019t drown out the memories or take away my revulsion for this act. My...need for you simply overrides it. Even though I fear you will find me, a dirty demon whore, unworthy of you. I am unworthy of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, wrenching away. Blood trickled from the side of her mouth. \u201cYou are perfect. Wonderful.\u201d She snuggled into his waiting embrace, head cradled in the hollow of his neck. The action pained her, but only a little. She could feel the flesh weaving together on her back. \u201cNever say otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...you do not wish to leave me now?\u201d So hesitant. So unsure.</p><p>\u201cIf you are a demon whore, then I am an Amazon whore. When I was a child, my mother mated with a man and left the Amazon camp to live with him. They had no money and so they...sold me, time and time again,\u201d she said, heat spreading over her cheeks. \u201cI know the desire to never again be touched by another. Except you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweet. I am so sorry for what you endured. And you are not a whore. Never say such a thing.\u201d</p><p>That gentle tone brought tears to her eyes. \u201cIf I cannot, you cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d He wrapped his arm around her, careful of her injuries. \u201cYou once told me your family had destroyed you, that you had killed them for it, but until now, I had no idea they\u2019d done such things to you.\u201d</p><p>She flattened her palm against his chest, exactly as she\u2019d wanted to do all these months while watching him. His heart beat fast and hard. \u201cMaybe we remind each other of what we were like, before. Unafraid, untainted. Maybe we see the future in each other and the past ceases to matter.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply, which disappointed her. Instead, he settled her onto the blankets and sat up. Old fears surfaced. Did he not want a future with her? Was that what his silence signified? Did he\u2014</p><p>He traced a fingertip along her spine, and she shivered. \u201cAll healed,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cAnd now, all mine.\u201d</p><p>Thank the gods. She wasn\u2019t sure what she would have done if he\u2019d rebuffed her as she\u2019d once done him. You should not have doubted him. Even for a moment.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t. Not ever again.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me, Zane.\u201d She\u2019d never been with a man of her choosing. Never given herself completely. She was suddenly desperate to know what that was like. With this man. Only this man, who was surely a gift from the heavens, even amid her curse. \u201cPlease. Let us join.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>ZANE FLIPPED NOLA TO HER back so that she was peering up at him. A gasp escaped her, but she didn\u2019t try to scramble away, even though he loomed above her, dressed in his blood-splattered battle clothes while she was naked.</p><p>Her breasts were small but firm, perfectly tipped with hard pink nipples. Her stomach was flat, her skin sun-kissed and smooth. He could see every ridge of her ribs and knew she hadn\u2019t eaten since his departure six days ago. Damn her sisters! Had she not already been through enough torment, without her tribe adding to it?</p><p>He was going to burn away the images of what they\u2019d done to her. Burn away the memories of the men who had used her. He would replace both with thoughts of himself. He didn\u2019t care what he had to do to accomplish it.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever experienced pleasure in the act?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Up and down her chest rose with the force of her breathing. \u201cA few times. Perhaps a little. But it was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more. I understand.\u201d And he did. Even when you hated the person you were bedding, your body sometimes reacted.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Nola asked.</p><p>\u201cLong, long ago.\u201d He only prayed he remembered how to please his woman. With the demon queen, he hadn\u2019t cared to try. He\u2019d simply endured. Never had a female\u2019s enjoyment been more important to him. \u201cIf I scare you, do something you don\u2019t like, tell me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, nervously licked her lips. \u201cYou tell me, as well.\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to nod. Rather than suck on her nipples as he desired, he lifted himself off her, reached behind him and tugged off his shirt. He tossed the material aside. His boots and pants quickly followed, leaving him as bare as she was.</p><p>Nola\u2019s gaze traveled the length of him, and fire leapt inside her turquoise eyes. \u201cZane...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You won\u2019t hurt me. I just wanted you to know I like what I see. You are beautiful. So pale and strong.\u201d</p><p>Her trust emboldened him, as did her praise. Gently he eased atop her. Skin against skin, hardness against softness. They moaned in unison. Contact with anyone else, even his king, was hell. Contact with Nola was heaven. Her legs opened, allowing him a deep cradle.</p><p>So soft.</p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you now,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Only when she whispered her consent did he lean down and press his lips against hers. Softly at first, barely even a touch. But the sweet scent of her was in his nose, her nipples hard against his chest, her thighs pliant against his, and soon he had to have more. He licked at her, and her lips eagerly parted. His tongue glided past teeth to intertwine with hers.</p><p>He\u2019d had her blood, but he\u2019d never had her mouth. To his delight, this was even better. Sweeter, headier, not for living or healing or even to relieve hunger, but simply for pleasure. It was addictive, and he wondered how he\u2019d gone without this for so long.</p><p>Tentatively, she tangled her hands in his hair. And at first, her tongue was hesitant against his. Seeking, as if she wasn\u2019t sure what to do with it. But the more he explored her mouth, the bolder she became. Soon their teeth were banging together, their bodies writhing against each other. Sweat was beading over his skin, his blood heating as though lava flowed in his veins. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGoing to...suck your...breasts now,\u201d he managed to say between pants. \u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes.\u201d She, too, was panting. She, too, was sweating. Her eyes were closed and her head was thrashing from side to side.</p><p>I did that. Pride filled him as he lowered his head, fitting his lips around one tight little pearl. He laved it with attention before turning to the other one\u2014careful, so careful to deliver pleasure without any sting.</p> <p>When he kissed his way down her stomach, she quivered and gasped his name.</p><p>\u201cStop?\u201d he asked. It would be difficult, but he would find a way.</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>Thank the gods. Never had he been more determined in his life. He would know this woman, every inch of her. Nothing would be prohibited. Body, mind...soul. Mouth watering, he licked between her legs. Wet, wild, wanton.</p><p>A memory of doing this very thing to the demon queen slipped into his mind. Do not think about the demon. She has no place in this wondrous moment. He\u2019d once hated this act\u2014until he\u2019d tried it on Nola on that island. Oh, how he had enjoyed doing so, which had shocked him. Since then, he\u2019d craved it\u2014another shock. He wanted this to last forever. Nola was precious, a treasure, her cries a drug for his ears. \u201cLike?\u201d Please, please, please.</p> <p>\u201cMmm, yes. Before, they just ripped at my clothes and shoved their way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. None of that.\u201d As she\u2019d spoken, she\u2019d stopped writhing. Had released her death grip on his hair. \u201cThat does not belong between us. It\u2019s just you and me in this bed. You and me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were luminous as she nodded. \u201cBite me, then. Take my blood and remind me that my vampire is claiming me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you do not take from living beings?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cYou, I would gladly take from. Anytime you would have me.\u201d It was the truth. \u201cBut as I told you, I know your kind abhors that, and I will never ask you to do anything you do not want to do. I will find my nourishment elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d she shouted, and it was a soldier\u2019s cry. She might appear delicate, but she truly had the soul of a warrior. \u201cYou will only ever take from me.\u201d</p><p>A possessive warrior, he realized, wanting to grin. He crawled up her body, fit his cock against her moist entrance. \u201cI will only ever crave you, sweet. That much is true. Are you ready for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I need you inside me. I need to feel you, as deep as you can go. Your shaft\u2014and your teeth. Take all of me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that please... He\u2019d seen the way her expression softened when he\u2019d uttered that word. Now she thought to use it against him, bless her.</p><p>Inch by inch, he sank inside her, careful, meticulous. Never had he exercised such exquisite care. Finally, though, he was in her to the hilt. They were joined; they were one. She surrounded him, hot and tight and wet, and it was better than he\u2019d anticipated.</p><p>Tenderly he cupped her face. Her beautiful face. His thumbs brushed over her lips. He would care for her all the days of his life. He would ensure no one ever hurt her again.</p><p>\u201cReady for more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you? Always.\u201d</p> <p>He withdrew from her, almost all the way out, before sinking back in and groaning at the bliss. Her back arched, and her perfect white teeth nibbled on her bottom lip. Her head fell to the side, revealing the delicious plane of her neck. Still he did not bite her. He wouldn\u2019t. Wouldn\u2019t do that to her.</p><p>In and out he moved, in and out he savored her. He stared into her eyes the entire time, and she stared into his. It was as if they were each other\u2019s anchor. As if seeing each other kept them here, locked in the moment, just the two of them, safe and cherished. There was nothing else, no one else, the fruition of every secret yearning he\u2019d ever possessed.</p><p>\u201cBite,\u201d she commanded.</p><p>\u201cNo. You are still healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I am healed. You told me so. Bite me. I want it. I need it. Don\u2019t deny me this. Please, don\u2019t deny me this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Zane. Please. With you, nothing seems wrong. Don\u2019t make me beg.\u201d</p><p>He could not stand the thought of this strong woman begging for anything. He bit, fangs drilling into her neck. The sweetness of her taste exploded on his tongue, through his body, making his muscles quiver and his bones vibrate.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d she cried as her inner walls spasmed around his shaft. \u201cZane, Zane.\u201d Her hands clutched at his back, her nails digging into his muscles. \u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola!\u201d That was all his body needed to propel into its own release. He roared, shooting inside her, filling her up with everything that he was. In that moment, his entire existence made sense. He\u2019d been born to be this woman\u2019s mate. He\u2019d given himself to a demon to better understand this precious woman\u2019s pain. He\u2019d been chosen for the gods\u2019 cruel game to ensure this woman\u2019s survival.</p><p>He loved her. Would always love her.</p><p>And now, he thought, an idea springing to life, he would save her.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>NOLA CUDDLED AGAINST Zane\u2019s body, happier than she\u2019d ever been in her life. She\u2019d just made love. Truly made love. And it had been amazing. Her body had hummed with pleasure, and her mind had soared to the heavens.</p><p>Only once had she considered her past, and Zane had quickly defeated the memories, as only a strong, fierce warrior could. No one had ever made her feel as protected or as prized as this man had.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought such feelings possible, actually.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d she said, grinning. She was buzzing with joy, drunk with it, and just might smile for the rest of her life. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did do a good job, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>It was the first time he\u2019d ever teased her, and she liked it. A laugh bubbled from her; she couldn\u2019t hold it back. Soon she was laughing so hard, tears were streaming down her cheeks. Laughter.</p><p>Shocking.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips were twitching. \u201cSome men would take this as a criticism of their performance.\u201d</p><p>Only when her giggles subsided did she say, \u201cBut as you know you did a good job...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not one of them,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>They shared a grin. What a tranquil, amazing moment. The first she\u2019d ever had. But she knew it would be the first of many.</p><p>His arms tightened around her. \u201cYou said every time you admitted something about me, you were freed from some part of your curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Reminded of her plight, some of the happiness drained from her.</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cThen do you have something else to admit to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well... I\u2014\u201d Nola sat up and peered down at him. No longer did he appear so confident and joyous. His expression was blank. No, not blank. Fear was sparking in the depths of his eyes. For some reason, seeing it gave her courage. \u201cI love you. I love you so much I ache with it.\u201d The words tumbled from her; she couldn\u2019t stop them. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine my life without you in it. I want to make love to you every night and wake up to you every morning. And I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m saying this only because I wish to lift the curse. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are too honest for such a trick.\u201d He grabbed her and rolled her under him. \u201cAnd just so you know, I love you, too. So much I would die without you. You are my life, my heart, my everything. Wherever you are, that\u2019s where I want to be.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t dared dream of having a man like him, or a life like they would surely lead, not even as a child. It had seemed too much to ask, too unattainable, and she had preferred to wallow in her sorrows rather than risk hope.</p><p>\u201cThe gods didn\u2019t take your ability from you, you know,\u201d she said. \u201cNot completely. You can still create dreams. For the first time in my life, I see joy in my future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Nola. You are my joy.\u201d</p><p>With another laugh, she threw her arms around him and rolled him to his back. Her dark hair fell around him, forming a curtain that left only the two of them\u2014just the way she liked it.</p><p>They made love twice more and spent several hours simply talking and getting to know each other better, before dressing and emerging from the tent. Night had fallen, but vampire warriors still patrolled the area.</p><p>She froze in place. \u201cZane. I don\u2019t know about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must speak with Layel,\u201d he said, remaining beside her. \u201cInform him that you will be coming with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>He sounded confident. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou admitted you loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that might not be the admission needed to free me from this camp.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her, perhaps sensing there was nothing he could say to assuage her fears. \u201cNow, where is that king of mine?\u201d</p><p>Distraction. He did know her well. Nola spotted the king and her sister in front of the fire, and gulped. There was no love lost between herself and Delilah. Nola had once tried to murder Layel, after all. \u201cWill they...what if...\u201d</p><p>Zane captured her hand with his own and squeezed. \u201cThey will love and welcome you or we will find somewhere else to live.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to lose everything you hold dear because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola,\u201d he said, forcing her to look up at him. \u201cYou are all that I hold dear. Nothing else matters to me.\u201d</p><p>Tears burned her eyes. \u201cWhat did I ever do to deserve you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is I who is undeserving. But you have my word, I will do everything in my power to prove myself worthy of you.\u201d</p><p>She pressed a soft kiss to his lips. \u201cYou already have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola,\u201d she heard Delilah call.</p><p>Zane wrapped his arms around her, keeping her in the protection of his embrace as they started forward. The blue-haired warrioress was walking toward her, expression blank. Layel stayed close on her heels, a blade in his hand, as protective of his woman as Zane was of Nola. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are well?\u201d Delilah said, looking her over.</p><p>\u201cYes. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And then Delilah was there, grinning, pushing Zane aside to hug her tightly. \u201cI\u2019ve been so worried about you.\u201d</p> <p>Nola glanced at Zane and he gave her a nod of encouragement. Biting her lip, Nola hugged her sister back. Shocking, she thought again.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was going to have to burst into that tent and give Zane a stern talking-to,\u201d Delilah said, pulling back, grin widening. \u201cBut the moans were of pleasure rather than rebuke, so Layel was able to hold me back.\u201d</p><p>Nola\u2019s cheeks heated.</p><p>So did Zane\u2019s, she noticed. And for some reason, that eased her own embarrassment. They were in this together.</p><p>Layel slapped him on the back. Zane stiffened for a moment, then relaxed against Nola. \u201cGood man,\u201d the king said with a laugh. \u201cDoing our people proud.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, shall we go home?\u201d Delilah asked. She rubbed her belly, which Nola suddenly realized was not quite as flat as she remembered. \u201cAs protector of this little hellion, I am not the soldier I once was and prefer the comfort of my own bed.\u201d</p><p>A baby. Nola again glanced at Zane. He offered a soft smile\u2014one that promised they, too, would one day experience such a joy. \u201cCongratulations, Delilah. I am so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>Delilah beamed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The warrioress and her husband shared a tender smile before Layel escorted her a few feet away, to where the horses were chewing on grass. \u201cZane? Will you be joining us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Nola welcome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d No hesitation.</p> <p>\u201cThen, yes. We shall try.\u201d</p><p>Whether the king understood or not, he merely nodded. \u201cBack to the palace, men,\u201d he called.</p><p>Zane helped Nola atop his horse, then swooped up behind her. Nervousness skidded through her when they began moving. First Layel and Delilah disappeared beyond the trees, then the vampire troops. Soon their turn would come...soon she would know if she was still bound to the camp.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d she said, unable to keep the tremor from her voice.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word, just urged the horse into a quicker pace. And then they were past the trees, just like everyone else. They were in the forest, foliage surrounding them, heading away from their captivity.</p><p>\u201cWe did it! We\u2019re free! We\u2019re really free!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I knew we would be.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cThe gods are not the cruel monsters I imagined. How can they be, when they paired us together?\u201d</p><p>Thank you, she mouthed to the top of the dome. Not once did she look back. There was too much to look forward to. \u201cI love you, Zane. So much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I love you. It will be my pleasure to prove it to you, over and over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven when mating season ends?\u201d she teased.</p><p>He squeezed her tight. \u201cI have a feeling our mating season will last for eternity, sweet.\u201d</p><p>So did she. Oh, yes, so did she.</p><p>THE DARKEST PRISON</p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p>REYES, ONCE AN IMMORTAL warrior for the gods, now possessed by the demon of Pain and living in Budapest, entered his bedroom. He was drenched in sweat and panting from the force of his workout. Because he could not experience pleasure without physical suffering, the burn in his muscles had excited him. Was exciting him.</p><p>As always, his gaze sought out his woman, and he palmed the blade they preferred to use during their love-play. She was sitting at the edge of their big bed, lovely features drawn tight as she studied the canvas in front of her. A canvas she\u2019d propped on an easel and lowered so that she had a direct view. Blond hair fell to her shoulders in wild disarray, as if she\u2019d tangled her fingers through the thick mass multiple times, and she was chewing on her bottom lip.</p><p>Sex could wait, he decided then. She was troubled, and he would be unable to think of anything else until he\u2019d solved this dilemma for her. Whatever it was. He sheathed the blade.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong, angel?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lifted and landed on him, worry in their emerald depths. She offered him a small smile. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why don\u2019t I help you figure it out?\u201d Anything that bothered her, he would dispatch. No hesitation. For her happiness, he would do anything, kill anyone.</p><p>\u201cI would like that, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I shower before I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I like you just how you are.\u201d</p><p>Darling woman. But he didn\u2019t like the thought of dirtying her pretty clothes. He quickly grabbed a towel from the bathroom and rubbed himself dry. Only then did he settle behind his woman, his legs encasing hers, his arms wrapping around her waist. Breathing deeply of her wild storm scent, he rested his chin in the hollow of her neck and followed the direction of her gaze.</p><p>What he saw surprised him.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have. Her paintings were always vivid. As the All-Seeing Eye, an oracle of the gods and one of their most cherished aides, she could peer into heaven and Hell. And did, every night, though she had no control over what she witnessed. Past, present, future, it didn\u2019t matter. Every morning, she painted what she\u2019d seen.</p><p>This one was of a man. A warrior, clearly. With that muscle mass, he had to be. A gold collar circled his neck, cinching tight. He was on his knees, legs spread. His arms rested on his thighs, palms raised. His dark head was thrown back, and he was roaring up at a domed ceiling. In pain, perhaps. Maybe even fury. There was blood smeared all over his chest, seeping from multiple wounds. Wounds that looked as if his skin had been carved away.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d Reyes asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen him before.\u201d</p><p>Then they would reason this out as best they were able. \u201cWas he from heaven or Hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeaven. Definitely. I think he\u2019s in Cronus\u2019s throne room.\u201d</p><p>A god, then? A few months ago, Titans had overthrown the Greeks and seized control of the divine throne. So, if this man was in Cronus\u2019s throne room, chained up, hurt, and Cronus was leader of the Titans, that must mean the warrior was a Greek. A slave who had been punished, perhaps?</p><p>\u201cYou saw only this image?\u201d Reyes asked. \u201cNot what got him to this point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d Danika said with a nod. \u201cI heard him scream, though. It was...\u201d She shuddered, and his arms squeezed her in comfort. \u201cI felt so sorry for him. Never have I heard so much rage and helplessness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can summon Cronus.\u201d Cronus wasn\u2019t too fond of Reyes and his fellow Lords of the Underworld\u2014the very men who had opened Pandora\u2019s box, unleashing the evil from inside. The men who had then been cursed to carry that evil inside themselves. But the god king hated their enemy, the Hunters, more, because Danika had seen Galen, the leader of the Hunters, chop off Cronus\u2019s head in a vision. Now the god king was determined to kill Galen before Galen could kill him. Even if that meant soliciting the aid of the Lords. \u201cWe can ask him if he knows this man.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed while Danika pondered his suggestion. Finally, she sighed, nodded. \u201cYes. I\u2019d like that.\u201d Then she surprised him by turning to him and offering the sweetest smile he\u2019d ever seen. Well, all of her smiles were that way. \u201cBut it\u2019s too early in the morning to summon anyone, and besides, I think you had other things on your mind when you entered the room. Why don\u2019t you tell me about them?\u201d she suggested huskily.</p><p>He was rock hard in seconds\u2014that\u2019s what she did to him. \u201cThat would be my pleasure, angel.\u201d</p><p>She pushed him to his back, smile widening. \u201cAnd mine.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>\u201cBE STILL, NIKE. YOU\u2019RE ONLY making this worse for yourself.\u201d Atlas, Titan god of Strength, stared down at the bane of his existence. Nike, Greek goddess of Strength. And Victory, he inwardly sneered. She loved to remind him that many called her the goddess of Strength and Victory. As if she were better than him. In reality, she was his godly counterpart. His equal. His enemy. And an all-around grade-A bitch.</p><p>Two of his best men held her arms and two held her legs. They should have been able to pin her without incident. She was collared, after all, and that collar prevented her from using any of her immortal powers. Even her legendary strength\u2014strength that was not on par with his, thank you. But never had a female been more stubborn\u2014or more determined to fell him. She continually struggled against their hold, punching, kicking and biting like a cornered animal.</p><p>\u201cI will kill you for this,\u201d she growled at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m not doing anything to you that you didn\u2019t once have done to me.\u201d Motions clipped, Atlas tore his shirt over his head and tossed the material aside, revealing his chest, the ropes of his stomach. There, in the center, in big black letters spanning from one tiny brown nipple to the other, was her name, spelled out for all the world to see. N-I-K-E.</p><p>She\u2019d branded him, reduced him to her property.</p><p>Had he deserved it? Maybe. Once, he\u2019d been a prisoner in this bleak realm. In Tartarus, a divine dungeon. He\u2019d been a god overthrown and locked away, forgotten, no better than rubbish. He\u2019d wanted out, and he had been willing to do anything to see it done. Anything. So he had seduced Nike, one of his guards, using her amorous feelings for him against her.</p><p>Though she would deny it now, she truly had fallen a little in love with him. The proof: she\u2019d arranged his escape, a crime punishable by death. Yet she\u2019d been willing to risk it. For him. Only, just before she could remove his collar, allowing him to flash himself away\u2014moving from one place to another with only a thought\u2014she discovered that he had also seduced several other female guards.</p><p>Why rely on one to get the job done when four could serve him better?</p><p>He\u2019d counted on the fact that none of the Greek females would want their affair with an enslaved Titan known. He\u2019d counted on their silence.</p><p>What he should have done was count on their jealousy. Women.</p><p>Nike had realized she\u2019d been used, that his emotions had never really been engaged. Rather than throw him back into his cell and pretend he did not exist, rather than have him beaten, she\u2019d had him held down and marked permanently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For years he\u2019d dreamed of returning the favor. Sometimes he thought the desire was the only thing that kept him sane as he whiled away century after century in this hellhole. Alone, darkness his only companion.</p><p>Imagine his delight when the prison walls began to crack. When the defenses began to crumble. When their collars fell away. It had taken a while, but he and his brethren had finally managed to work their way free. They\u2019d attacked the Greeks, brutally and without mercy.</p><p>In a matter of days, they had won.</p> <p>The Greeks were defeated and now locked exactly where they\u2019d locked the Titans. Atlas had volunteered to oversee the realm and had thankfully been placed in charge. Finally, his day of vengeance had arrived. Nike would forever bear his mark.</p><p>\u201cYou should be grateful you\u2019re alive,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly, evilly. \u201cYou\u2019ve done that, remember?\u201d</p><p>Her struggles increased. Increased so viciously she was soon panting and sweating right alongside his men. \u201cYou bastard! I will flay you alive. I will torch you to ash. Bastard!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFlip her over,\u201d he ordered the guards over her curses. No mercy. Atlas didn\u2019t have the patience to wait until she tired. \u201cAnd a warning to you, Nike. You had best be still. I\u2019ll just keep tattooing until my name is clear enough to satisfy me.\u201d</p><p>With a frustrated, infuriated screech, she finally settled down. She knew he spoke true. He always spoke true. Threats were not something he wasted his breath uttering. Only promises.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d she rasped again.</p><p>He\u2019d been called worse. And by her, no less. \u201cThat\u2019s a good girl.\u201d Atlas strode forward and ripped the cloth from her back. The skin was tanned, smooth. Flawless. Once, he\u2019d caressed this back. Once, he\u2019d kissed and licked it. And yes, being with her had been more satisfying than being with any of the others, because she\u2019d looked at him with such adoration, such hope and awe. He\u2019d felt...humbled. Lucky to be there, touching her. But he would not be ruled by his dick and release her before branding her, all in the hopes that he could get her into bed again. He would do this.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I did to you,\u201d Nike growled. \u201cI didn\u2019t mark your back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou would rather I brand your lovely breasts?\u201d</p><p>At that, she held her tongue.</p><p>Good. He didn\u2019t want to mar her chest. Her breasts were a work of art, surely the world\u2019s finest creation. \u201cNo need to thank me,\u201d he muttered. He held out his hand and someone slapped the needed supplies in his palm. \u201cAt least you won\u2019t have to look at my name every day of your too-long life.\u201d As he had to do. \u201cEveryone else will, though. They\u2019ll see.\u201d And they\u2019ll know who mastered her at last.</p><p>\u201cEvery lover I choose, you mean.\u201d</p><p>He popped his jaw. \u201cNot another word from you. It is time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d she suddenly cried. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t.\u201d She turned her head and there were tears in her brown eyes.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a beautiful woman. Could barely be called pretty. Her nose was a little too long, and her cheeks a little too sharp. She had ordinary brown hair cut to hit her too-wide shoulders, and no true curves to speak of. Besides her breasts. No, she had the body of a warrior. But there was something about her that had always drawn him.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Atlas. Please.\u201d</p> <p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cDry the fake tears, Nike.\u201d And he knew they were fake. She wasn\u2019t prone to displays of emotion. \u201cThey don\u2019t affect me and they certainly don\u2019t become you.\u201d</p><p>Instantly her eyelids narrowed, the tears miraculously gone. \u201cFine. But I will make you regret this. I vow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to your attempts.\u201d Truth. Sparring with her had always excited him. She should know that by now.</p><p>Without a single beat of hesitation, he pressed the ink gun just below her shoulder blade. His grip was steady as he etched the outline of the first letter. A. Not once did she flinch. Not once did she act as if she felt a single ounce of pain. He knew it hurt, though. Oh, did he know. To permanently mark an immortal, ambrosia had to be mixed into the colored liquid and that ambrosia burned like acid.</p><p>She remained silent as he finished each of the outlines. Silent, still, as he filled in the letters. When he finished, he sat back on his haunches and surveyed his work: A-T-L-A-S.</p><p>He expected satisfaction to overtake him, so long had he waited for this moment. It didn\u2019t. He expected relief to overwhelm him; finally vengeance had been achieved. It didn\u2019t. What he didn\u2019t expect was a white-hot sweep of possessiveness, but that\u2019s exactly what he experienced. Mine.</p><p>Nike now belonged to him. Forever. And all the world would know it.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>NIKE PACED THE CONFINES of her cell. A cell she shared with several others. Knowing her temper as intimately as they did, they were careful to stay out of her way. Still. Roommates sucked. She could feel their eyes boring into her robe-clad back, as if they could see the name now branded there.</p><p>A-T-L-A-S.</p><p>If they dared say a single word about it... I will kill them!</p><p>There hadn\u2019t been enough cells to contain all of the Greeks, so they\u2019d been crammed into each chamber in groups. Male, female, it hadn\u2019t mattered. Maybe the Titans hadn\u2019t cared about the mixing of the sexes, or maybe they\u2019d done it to increase the torment of each prisoner. The latter was probably the case. Husbands had not been paired with wives and friend had not been paired with friend. No, rival had been paired with rival.</p><p>For her, that rival was Erebos, the minor god of Darkness. Once, Erebos had treated her like a queen. Once, she\u2019d really liked him. Had even considered marrying him. But then she\u2019d fallen in love with Atlas\u2014that womanizing, lying bastard Atlas\u2014so she\u2019d cut Erebos loose. Then she\u2019d discovered that Atlas had never really wanted her, that Atlas had only been using her.</p><p>Love had quickly morphed into rage.</p><p>The rage, though, had eventually cooled. She\u2019d forgotten him. For the most part. Liar. Now, with his name decorating her back, she hated him with every fiber of her being. Maybe\u2014maybe\u2014she\u2019d overreacted when she\u2019d done the same to him. Branded him forever. Impulsiveness had always been her downfall. For years, she\u2019d even regretted her decision. Not that she would ever admit such a thing to him. Regret was not what she felt now, however.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t lied to him. She would kill him for this.</p><p>First, she would have to find a way to remove the stupid collar around her neck. As long as she wore it, she was powerless. The thick gold did not remove her god-given abilities, but merely muted them. Substantially. Too substantially. Second, she would have to find a way to escape this realm.</p><p>The first, in theory, should have been easy. Yet she\u2019d already tried clawing and beating at it, and had even attempted to melt it from her neck. All she\u2019d done was cut her skin, bruise her tender flesh and singe her hair off. She should have known that\u2019s what would happen. How many times had she watched Titan prisoners try the same things? The second, in theory and reality, seemed impossible.</p><p>Her gaze circled her surroundings. After the Titans had escaped, they\u2019d reinforced everything. How, she didn\u2019t know. The prison was supposedly bound to Tartarus, the Greek god of Confinement who\u2019d once kept guard over the Titans, and when he\u2019d begun to weaken for no apparent reason, the realm had weakened, as well. Everything in it became structurally unsound. But now, Tartarus was missing. The Titans didn\u2019t have him and no one knew where he was. There was no reason the realm should be as strong as it was in his absence.</p><p>The walls and floor were comprised of godly stone, something only special godly tools\u2014tools she didn\u2019t have\u2014could break through. And yet, even without Tartarus\u2019s presence, there was not a crack in sight.</p><p>The thick silver bars that allowed a glimpse of the guard\u2019s station below had been constructed by Hephaistos, and only Hephaistos could melt such a metal. Unfortunately, he resided somewhere else. As with Tartarus, no one knew where. Still, without Tartarus, she should have been able to bend that metal. She couldn\u2019t; she\u2019d already tried.</p><p>\u201cCould you settle the hell down?\u201d Erebos grumbled from one of the cots.</p><p>Nike flicked him a glance. From his dark hair to his dark skin, from his handsome features to his strong body, he was the picture of unhappy male, and all of that unhappiness was directed at her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to plan an escape here.\u201d</p><p>They were always planning an escape.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he continued, \u201cyour ugly face is giving me a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo suck yourself,\u201d she replied. Though she\u2019d been the one to hurt him all those centuries ago\u2014unintentionally\u2014he\u2019d repaid her a thousand times over. Purposely. Not emotionally, but physically. He liked nothing better than to \u201caccidentally\u201d trip her, bump into her and send her flying, as well as to eat what little portion of food was meant for her before she could fight her way to the front of the line, starving her.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been wearing the collar, he never would have been able to do those things. She would have been too strong. And he would have been too scared. Another reason to despise her captivity.</p><p>\u201cSucking myself would probably elicit better results than when you did it,\u201d he retorted.</p><p>The handful of gods and goddesses around him snickered.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she said, as if the taunt didn\u2019t bother her. Except, her cheeks did flush. She was the epitome of Strength\u2014or she was supposed to be\u2014and she\u2019d always been more mannish than feminine. That was why Atlas\u2019s attentions had so surprised and delighted her. That gorgeous man could have won anyone, yet he\u2019d chosen her. Or so she\u2019d thought. And she\u2019d fallen for his act because he\u2019d somehow made her feel like a delicate, beautiful woman.</p><p>Stupid. I was so stupid.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she saw a black-clad male stride into the guard\u2019s station. She didn\u2019t have to see him to know who it was. Atlas. She felt him. Always she felt his heat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When her gaze found him, she discovered that he had his arm wrapped around a leggy blonde. A blonde who cuddled herself into his side as if she belonged there\u2014and had rested there many times before.</p><p>The thought angered Nike. It shouldn\u2019t have; she despised Atlas with all of her being and didn\u2019t care who he slept with. Didn\u2019t care who he pleasured. And yes, he would have pleasured the blonde with those talented hands and seeking lips. He was an amazing lover whose touch still haunted Nike\u2019s dreams. But there it was. Anger.</p><p>She didn\u2019t mean to, but found herself striding to the bars and gripping them for a better, closer look at him. Three other guards stood around him, all talking and laughing. While prisoners wore white, guards wore black, and he wore that darkness well. It was the perfect complement to his dark, chopped hair and sea-colored eyes.</p> <p>His face had been chiseled by a master artist, everything about him perfectly proportioned. His eyes were the perfect distance apart, his nose the perfect length, his cheeks the perfect sharpness, his lips the perfect shape and color and his chin a perfect, stubborn square.</p><p>He was perfect while she was nothing but flaws.</p><p>She should have known he was playing her the moment he\u2019d turned those dangerous eyes on her and they lit with \u201cinterest.\u201d Men just didn\u2019t look at her like that. Not even Erebos had, and he had loved her.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d she muttered, the curse for both the men in her past.</p><p>As if he heard her, Atlas lifted his gaze. The moment their eyes met, she wanted to release the bars. She wanted to step away, out of sight. But she didn\u2019t allow herself that luxury. That would have been cowardly, and this man had seen her weak one too many times.</p> <p>Just to taunt him, and hopefully make him feel as out of control as he always made her feel, she allowed her attention to fall to his chest, exactly where her name rested. She smiled smugly before raising her gaze and arching a brow.</p><p>Score. A muscle ticked in his jaw.</p><p>What does your lover think of your mark? she wanted to shout. What does the blonde think of my name on your body?</p><p>He jerked the stupid blonde deeper into his side and, without breaking eye contact with Nike, planted a lush, wet kiss on her mouth. Of course, the bitch reacted as any other woman would have. She wrapped her arms around him and held on for dear life. As Nike well knew, that man could make a woman come with the expertise of his kiss.</p><p>Nike\u2019s anger intensified. Had she been able, she would have stomped down there and ripped them apart. Then she would have killed them both. Not because she wanted Atlas for herself\u2014she didn\u2019t\u2014but because he was clearly using yet another woman. Passion did not glow from his expression. Only determination did.</p><p>Nike would be doing the female population a favor by snuffing him out.</p> <p>\u201cErebos,\u201d she called. \u201cCome here. I want to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he gasped out, his shock clear.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a kiss or not? Get over here. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>There was a rustling of clothing behind her and then her former lover was beside her. He was a prisoner, and sex was a rarity. He would take what he could get, even from someone he loathed. That much she knew.</p><p>Nike turned to him; he was already leaning down. Like the blonde, she wrapped her arms around her companion\u2019s neck and held on tight. Only, she didn\u2019t enjoy the kiss, familiar as it was. Erebos\u2019s taste was too...what? Different from Atlas\u2019s, she realized, and that ratcheted her anger another notch. No man should have that much power over her.</p><p>Still. She let Erebos continue. Atlas needed to realize that she no longer desired him. He needed to realize that he would never, never play her emotions again. She was not an idealistic little girl anymore.</p><p>He\u2019d made sure of that.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>RAGE. ABSOLUTE RAGE FILLED Atlas. He released his companion\u2014he couldn\u2019t recall her name\u2014and she gasped in protest at the abruptness of his actions. He didn\u2019t bother explaining what he was about as he stomped away from her. The rage continued to spread as he climbed the stairs that led to the prisoners\u2019 cages and to the cell holding Nike.</p><p>His name was on her back. How dare she allow another man to put his lips on her?</p><p>When he reached his destination, he raised his arm, and the sensor he\u2019d had embedded in his wrist caused the bars to slide open. Several prisoners were seated against the far wall. Rapturous longing colored their faces as they watched the minor god of Darkness and the goddess of Strength clean each other\u2019s tonsils. So absorbed were they, in fact, that they didn\u2019t rush Atlas and try to escape. Or maybe that had something to do with the pain they would feel if they did so. He had only to press a button, and their collars would ravage their brains.</p><p>Nike moaned, as if she really liked what was being done to her. Red flickered through Atlas\u2019s vision. How. Dare. She. Teeth grinding, he grabbed Nike by the collar of her robe and jerked her into the hard line of his body, away from Erebos.</p><p>A gasp escaped her. Unlike when the blonde had gasped, he did not remain unaffected. He wanted to swallow the sound\u2014and do something, anything, to cause Nike to make it again.</p><p>What\u2019s wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Erebos snapped, foolishly reaching for her to finish what had been started. \u201cWe were busy.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, Atlas kicked him in the chest. The smaller man flew backward, slamming into his fellow prisoners. The minor god jumped to his feet to attack, saw who had rendered the blow and stilled, nostrils flaring, hands fisting.</p><p>\u201cTouch her again,\u201d Atlas said calmly, though he was gritting the words out as if they were being pushed through a meat grinder, \u201cand I\u2019ll remove your collar. Right along with your head.\u201d</p><p>The god paled, perhaps even whimpered. \u201cI won\u2019t go near her. She wasn\u2019t worth it, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Atlas might kill him for such an insult, as well. Her kisses were heaven, damn it.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Nike demanded, suddenly coming to life and drawing his attention. She whirled on him, glaring up at him. \u201cI can sleep with whoever I want. And hey, guess what? I might even pick one of your friends. What do you think of that?\u201d</p><p>Despite her heated claims, she wasn\u2019t breathless as she would have been if Atlas had been the one kissing her, and her cheeks weren\u2019t flushed. Her nipples weren\u2019t even hard.</p><p>Finally, something cooled the hottest flames of his rage.</p><p>\u201cJust zip your mouth.\u201d He latched on to Nike\u2019s upper arm and dragged her out of the cell with him. Automatically, the bars closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she said again, tugging against his hold. She\u2019d never been one to obey him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you think you were doing?\u201d he countered. When he reached the bottom of the steps, he stopped. The blonde, who just happened to be the goddess of Memory\u2014damn it, what was her name? Kneemah? No, but close. Nee Nee? Closer. Mnemosyne. Yes, that was it\u2014Mnemosyne, as well as the three other warriors chosen to guard Tartarus today, were gaping at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he snapped. At least Nike stopped resisting him. She stilled at his side, attention darting from him to the others, the others to him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just remove a prisoner,\u201d Hyperion, god of Light, said. He was a handsome man, though as pale as his title suggested, and Nike had better not be eyeing him as a possible bedmate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not removing her,\u201d Atlas replied stiffly. \u201cI\u2019m relocating her.\u201d To a cell of her own, where no one could put their dirty, disgusting lips on her. Where no one could put their roving hands on her body. There was nothing...possessive about this decision, either. He simply didn\u2019t want her experiencing any type of pleasure. She didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Mnemosyne regarded him curiously, not a single thread of upset or jealousy in her expression.</p><p>Why? he wondered himself. Mnemosyne been eager to date him for months, summoning him constantly. Last night, she\u2019d even shown up at his home naked. She was beautiful, yes, and he\u2019d almost given in and slept with her. His body had been worked into a frenzy after what had transpired with Nike, after all, and he\u2019d been desperate for release. But before he sealed the deal, he\u2019d sent the determined goddess away. He\u2019d felt too guilty to continue. As if he were cheating on Nike. Which was ridiculous. The only relationship he had with Nike was one of hate.</p><p>Besides, who wanted to spend time with a female who would never forget your mistakes? A female who would remember your every transgression? A female who could spin new, false memories into your mind, making you believe whatever she wished. Not him. Yet he\u2019d flashed to Mnemosyne\u2019s home this morning and asked her to spend the day with him, just so he could bring her to the prison this morning. He\u2019d been strangely jubilant at the thought of parading her in front of Nike.</p><p>So again, he wondered why Mnemosyne did not feel as if Nike were a threat. Most females didn\u2019t, he knew. He\u2019d heard them talk. Nike was too tall, too muscled, they said. She was too hard, and too coarse. But those were the things that had first sparked his interest in her. She could handle his strength. She gave as good as she got. She would never wither under his glare. She would never run from his anger. She would always face him head-on. And he liked that. A lot. No other female he\u2019d ever encountered had that kind of courage. And she was pretty, he thought. Yes, only yesterday he\u2019d thought her barely so, but, just now, that seemed wrong on every level. Only a short while ago, when he\u2019d first walked into the prison, he\u2019d felt her gaze on him and had looked up. For a second, only a second, her defenses had been lowered. She hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d been watching her, so she hadn\u2019t guarded her expression. An expression that had been soft, wistful, her eyes luminous.</p><p>The sight of her had heated his blood as if he\u2019d been caught on fire.</p><p>That still didn\u2019t mean he desired her, his enemy. The fact that his name was spelled across her back was simply playing havoc with his mind, he was sure.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mnemosyne prompted.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Nike said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for an answer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShut up, prisoner,\u201d Mnemosyne snapped. She was sister to Rhea, the god queen, and an elitist. Always had been. She loved power and strength above all else, and viewed most people as beneath her.</p><p>He wanted to scold her for using that tone with Nike, but didn\u2019t. They were waiting for an answer to what? he wondered, thinking back over the conversation. Oh, yeah. Why was he moving Nike? He raised his chin, refusing to look down at her. Not that he would have had to look far. At six feet, she was nearly as tall as he was. \u201cI don\u2019t need a reason. I\u2019m responsible for this prison and everyone in it. Therefore, if I want to move you, I can.\u201d</p><p>The last was meant for the Titans. They would do well not to question him.</p> <p>Without another word, he dragged Nike away.</p><p>\u201cBut Atlas,\u201d Mnemosyne called.</p><p>He ignored her. Where should he take Nike? There were not many private places in this doomed structure. All of the cells were filled to capacity. That left\u2014his office, he decided.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t have that bastard slain,\u201d he said when they snaked a corner and he was sure the others couldn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>Nike didn\u2019t have to ask who \u201cthat bastard\u201d was. \u201cWhat for? He did nothing wrong.\u201d Nothing wrong? He touched what\u2019s mine. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have permission to consort with you.\u201d There. An answer to pacify. Truthful, yet misleading. Atlas snaked another corner, and there at the end of the hallway was his door.</p> <p>\u201cConsort with me?\u201d She laughed without humor. \u201cOh, wait. I get it. You can screw anyone you want, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Good. They were on the same page. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He pushed his way inside, kicked the door shut and finally released her. His hands itched to return to her, but he kept them at his sides. Rather than settle behind his desk, he faced her, placing them nose to nose. \u201cYou are to suffer in solitude.\u201d Gods, she smelled good. Like passion. Pure, white-hot passion.</p><p>\u201cAs if. I have more fun with myself, anyway.\u201d</p><p>The image those words evoked nearly sent him to his knees. He should back away from her. Before he did something foolish.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou haven\u2019t changed, you know. You\u2019re as much of an ass now as you were years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d he continued, as if she hadn\u2019t just insulted him. Foolishness be damned. She was here, and they were alone. \u201cIf you need to be kissed, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p> <p>And, godsdamn it, that was the absolute truth.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>THERE WAS NO TIME to protest. In less time than it took to blink, Nike found herself smashed into the wall, Atlas pressing against her, solid chest to soft breasts, his hands pinning her temples, his mouth slamming into hers. His tongue thrust deep, without warning, forcing its way past her teeth.</p><p>She could have bitten him. Wanted to bite him, actually, and not in affection. She wanted to draw blood, pain. Instead, her body instantly became his slave, as if centuries of hatred hadn\u2019t passed, and she welcomed him inside. She wound her arms around him and arched into his erection. Erection? Oh, yes. He was hard. Hard and long and thick. Just as she remembered.</p><p>His taste was decadent, wild and burning, like dark spices. His muscles were tensed under her palms. Up she moved them, until her fingers were tangled in his hair. The short spikes abraded deliciously, causing her to shiver.</p><p>Touch me, she wanted to shout. It had been so long, so damned long, since she\u2019d experienced this. Oh, she\u2019d been with other men since giving herself so foolishly to Atlas, because she\u2019d been searching for something as intense as what they had shared. Something to soothe her, heal her even. But each experience had left her hollow and unsatisfied. She\u2019d actually felt worse. And then she had been captured\u2014by Atlas himself\u2014and unceremoniously stuffed into this prison.</p><p>With the lack of privacy, there\u2019d been no opportunities to find companionship. Not that she would have wanted to or had even tried. No one drew her anymore. No one but Atlas, damn him.</p><p>Yes, damn him. Him. The man who had held her down only yesterday and etched his name into her flesh. What was she doing, allowing this? He would think she still cared for him. He would think she still pined for him, dreamed of him...craved him. That might be true, curse it, but she would never allow him to know it.</p> <p>Panting, she tore her mouth away. How dare you stop, her body cried. \u201cI don\u2019t want you,\u201d she lied. \u201cLet me go. Now.\u201d Hold me forever.</p><p>A low growl erupted from his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t want you, either.\u201d Once, twice, he rubbed his shaft against her. \u201cBut I\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Stupid body.</p><p>Tremors slid the length of her spine. Sweet heaven. He\u2019d hit her sweet spot, and sensation rocketed through her. Then one of his hands lowered and cupped her breast, and her knees almost buckled.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The word was a mere whimper. And why was she allowing him the choice? Why wasn\u2019t she ripping away from him? You are Strength. Act like it.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t I let you go?\u201d He rolled her hardened nipple between his fingers.</p><p>That was why she remained as she was, she thought, dazed. The pleasure was building, flowing through her veins, burning her up, recreating her into a new being. Someone who lived for satisfaction alone. Someone who didn\u2019t care that the one responsible for her desire was an enemy.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...I...\u201d Those fingers tightened, stinging her a little. \u201cJust shut up and kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied before she could stop herself.</p><p>Their mouths met again, and this time she rose on her tiptoes to meet him. As their tongues clashed and warred, he cupped her ass and lifted her feet off the floor. So strong he was. Forcing him to hold her weight would have been fun, but not nearly as pleasurable as winding her legs around his waist and pressing her needy core against his shaft.</p><p>Clever girl.</p><p>With her braced against the wall, he was able to tunnel both of his hands under her robe. Their bodies were too close together for him to reach her slick center, where she wanted him most, but having his hands on her cheeks, wanting skin against fiery skin, was almost as welcome. He was hotter than she remembered.</p><p>His lips left hers, but before she could moan her disappointment, he was kissing and licking his way down her neck.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped. \u201cYes. Like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d His nose nuzzled the golden slave collar as if it were a trinket rather than a device that could kill her. For once, she even liked the collar.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d More. At the moment, that was the only word she was capable of. Unless...did he think to make her beg?</p><p>Fury suddenly blended with desire. Well, she would show him. She would beg for nothing. Not even this. Especially this. Not for him.</p><p>\u201cThen more you shall have,\u201d he said, shocking her. She had not begged, yet he was giving her what she wanted. He tugged the fabric of her robe down, revealing her breasts. Air hissed through his teeth. \u201cSo lovely. So perfect.\u201d His tongue flicked out and circled the nipple he\u2019d pinched just a short while ago. \u201cSo mine.\u201d</p><p>Her head fell back, and her nails scratched at his back. So good. The heat...the wetness...the\u2014 \u201cYes!\u201d The suction. He was sucking at her so forcefully, her stomach muscles were quivering. No one else had been physically powerful enough to suit her. Their caresses had felt like whispers, barely there, utterly unsatisfying. \u201cAtlas,\u201d she groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d A command, not a plea.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d He straightened, his narrowed gaze suddenly pinning her in place far more effectively than his body. \u201cI want you. All of you.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to regain her breath. Her senses. \u201cYou mean sex?\u201d Yes, yes, yes. Here, now.</p><p>A clipped nod was the only answer she received. She opened her mouth to reply, but somehow found the strength to stop herself. She drank in the sight of him\u2014a sight that delighted her almost as much as it angered her. Angered? Why? Her delight should be all-consuming. His nostrils were flared, his lips pulled tight. He looked as if he barely had himself under control. Nothing like he\u2019d looked with Mnemosyne.</p><p>He truly wants me.</p><p>But...why? she wondered. Or was he merely that good an actor?</p><p>Yes, she mused darkly. He was that good an actor. And that was where the anger sprang from. He\u2019d looked at her like that once before, the last time they\u2019d had sex. That look had been the catalyst to her decision to free him, despite the consequences to herself. Consequences that could have resulted in a death sentence. But, she\u2019d thought, he truly loves me with the same intensity that I love him. She\u2019d thought anything worth the risk of freeing him. Of possibly being with him for eternity.</p><p>How they would have managed that, she hadn\u2019t known. But she\u2019d wanted to try. He had not.</p><p>Thank the gods she\u2019d encountered one of the members of his skank parade mere minutes after escorting him from the building and into the clouds outside, where he would have been able to flash away. He\u2019d still had his collar on\u2014she hadn\u2019t wanted to remove it until they\u2019d bypassed every single guard. That way, everyone who saw them walking together would have assumed she was simply moving a prisoner.</p><p>But outside, they\u2019d been seen. No one could flash out of or into the prison itself, so everyone had to walk through the front door. Aergia, the goddess of Laziness, of all things, had decided to come to work early, surprise, surprise\u2014just to be with Atlas again. She\u2019d stopped Nike to question where he was being taken.</p><p>I\u2019m taunting him with what he can never have again, Nike had claimed.</p><p>The goddess had frowned. Well, take him to my office when you\u2019re done.</p><p>Why?</p><p>The frown became a slow, sensual smile. So I can dish my brand of...punishment to him.</p><p>Dread had sparked inside her. And how do you punish him?</p><p>How do you think? But don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll leave him begging for more. I always do.</p><p>Atlas had tried to run then, mowing right over them both, but with his collar still in place, he hadn\u2019t gotten far. Nike had locked him back up and, suspicious, questioned all the female guards. Nearly every single one of them had had a go at him. And he\u2019d told them all the same thing: You are beautiful. I want to spend my life with you. All I need is my freedom, and I will be your slave for eternity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, have sex with him again? \u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d he snapped. His grip tightened on her, his fingers digging deep, bruising. \u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, she knew what this little make-out session was about. He planned to sleep with her, make her fall in love with him all over again, and then dump her. He\u2019d grind up her pride, spit it out and stomp all over it. Again. All to punish her, she was sure, for daring to tattoo him as she had. Marking her with his name clearly wasn\u2019t enough.</p> <p>\u201cWanting you dead and wanting your body aren\u2019t the same things.\u201d With a sugar-sweet grin, she patted his cheek. \u201cAnd I can promise you that while I do want the first, I was only teasing you about the second.\u201d Now who was playing who? \u201cSo...if we\u2019re done here...? I believe there is a minor god awaiting my return.\u201d</p><p>Atlas ran his tongue over his teeth. His arms fell away from her, and he stepped back. She nearly collapsed, but managed to shift her legs and absorb her own weight. Unaffected. That\u2019s how she had to appear.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done,\u201d he said, his tone clipped. \u201cWe are definitely done.\u201d</p><p>Good, she thought. So why did she suddenly want to cry for real?</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>ATLAS HAD TO EMPTY A CELL of its seven occupants and place those gods and goddesses within other, already cramped cells to make a place for Nike. The time and effort was worth it, though. He couldn\u2019t tolerate the thought of her with that bastard Erebos, doing the same things to him that she\u2019d once done to Atlas.</p><p>Not. Going. To. Happen.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>And maybe, perhaps, there was a slight chance it had nothing to do with punishing her and everything to do with the pleasure he\u2019d earlier denied. In her arms, he\u2019d come alive. That had happened last time, too, but he\u2019d written it off as prisoner insanity. Now, he couldn\u2019t write it off. He wasn\u2019t a prisoner; he was a warden. He\u2019d come alive, and he needed more. Of her, only her. Yet she claimed she\u2019d merely been playing him. Fucking playing him. He wanted that to be a lie more than he wanted to take his next breath. Which he really wanted to take. He didn\u2019t understand this. She was doomed to spend eternity hidden away, which meant they could not have any kind of life together. Not even if he freed her. He would then be locked away or put to death. Unlike her, that was not something he was willing to risk.</p><p>But that she had been, all those centuries ago...it was humbling. He still could not get over the emotion.</p><p>Surely she still wanted him.</p> <p>For a week, Atlas lamented his plight and pondered what to do. All the while, he stayed away from Nike\u2019s new cell. That didn\u2019t stop him from thinking about her, however. What was she doing? Did she think of him? Did she dream of him and that shattering kiss?</p><p>He did. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw the passion glowing from her face. A face that was exquisite. From barely passable, to pretty, to exquisite, all in a week\u2019s time. He shook his head in wonder. But she deserved the praise. Her lashes were long and as rich as black velvet. Velvet that framed sensual chocolate eyes. Her cheeks were smooth, perfect for caressing, and her lush, red lips were sweeter than ambrosia. And all that strength...his shaft filled and lengthened just remembering it. She\u2019d gripped and scratched him with savage abandon. He still bore the marks.</p><p>Fine. He had lied to her. They definitely weren\u2019t done. Not even close. He had to experience that again.</p><p>Finally, he could stand the separation no longer. Thankfully, his shift was over. A shift that had consisted of walking the prison halls, watching the prisoners inside their cells and ensuring everyone remained calm.</p><p>That should have bored him. After all, he was a warrior. But bore him it didn\u2019t. And that should have irritated him. After all, he\u2019d spent countless centuries in this place and had sworn never to return once he\u2019d escaped. But again, irritation was not what he felt. He\u2019d wanted this job to be close to Nike. To have his vengeance, he\u2019d once told himself. Now, he wasn\u2019t so sure. Today, and all week really, he\u2019d walked the halls invigorated, knowing all he had to do to catch sight of her was turn a corner.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t allowed himself to do so. Until now. Finally, he would see her.</p><p>The moment she came into view, his blood heated, blistering. His breath followed suit, flaming his lungs to ash. She sat atop her cot, arms gripping the rail, knees drawn up while she leaned slightly forward. Her hair was finger-combed to perfection, and her eyes were narrowed, shielding her irises and the emotion banked there, but at least he could see the shadows her lashes cast over her cheeks. Shadows he might trace with a fingertip. Or his tongue.</p><p>Oh, yes. She was exquisite.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your girlfriend?\u201d Her voice was smooth as silk. Just beneath that silk, however, he thought he caught a tendril of fury.</p><p>Was she mad that he\u2019d come? Or mad that he\u2019d stayed away so long?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a girlfriend.\u201d Though Mnemosyne was still trying to change that.</p><p>Even though he pushed her away every damn time.</p><p>Nike shrugged. \u201cToo bad for you that whores never commit.\u201d</p><p>He knew he was the whore that she spoke of, and popped his jaw. But he deserved that, he supposed. \u201cI did what I had to do to escape, Nike. That doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t feel\u2014\u201d No. Oh, no. He would not go down that road. He hadn\u2019t wanted to feel anything for her, but he had. That hadn\u2019t stopped him from using her, so she\u2019d never like what he had to say about the matter. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d do anything to escape, as well.\u201d</p><p>Her expression darkened, but she did not refute his words. \u201cSo, did you come to free me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here? We have nothing more to say to each other.\u201d</p><p>Because you\u2019re all I think about anymore. He never should have marked her. This might have been avoided. Or not. He might have slept with others all those years ago because he\u2019d been desperate to flee this place, but it had been her face he\u2019d imagined when he\u2019d done so.</p><p>Without looking away from her, he leaned back against the bar behind him and crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty to say. About the kiss.\u201d</p><p>She yawned, patting her beautiful mouth. A mouth he wanted all over his body. \u201cI\u2019d rather sleep.\u201d</p><p>So. She still wanted him to think she had been unaffected. Part of him believed it. An insecure part of him that had never really known how to deal with her, his equal in every way. Yes, even strength, though he often liked to deny it. The other part of him, the masculine part, knew she had liked everything he\u2019d done. She\u2019d shouted his name, for gods\u2019 sake, and he hadn\u2019t even made her climax.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying you don\u2019t want me?\u201d he asked as silkily as she had.</p><p>\u201cNot even a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He rested his fingers at the waist of his pants, twisting the button, and her eyes followed the movement. His cock was already hard, already straining, rising over the top. Moisture glistened there. \u201cNot even a tiny, tiny bit?\u201d</p><p>She gulped. \u201cN-no.\u201d The word was croaked. \u201cBut you are. Tiny, that is.\u201d</p><p>Liar. She did. She wanted him. And he was huge, thank you very much. He stretched her. The sense of possessiveness returned, all the more intense because it was joined by satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you yet, Nike. That I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...go away,\u201d she said, suddenly sounding almost...dejected. She eased to her side, then rolled to her back, facing away from him. \u201cWe\u2019re done with each other. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Wrong move. Seeing her back, even covered by that baggy robe, reminded him of what he\u2019d done and that set fire to his blood anew. Whatever he had to do, he was going to have this woman.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll find out,\u201d he told her before walking away.</p><p>To think. To plan.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>ATLAS PUSHED PAST the double doors that led into Cronus\u2019s throne room. Armed guards, immortal warriors Cronus himself had created, were stationed along the edges of the walls. Each held a spear, and swords swung from the sheaths at their waists. They stood at attention, waiting for an order or a threat. They would spring into action for both.</p><p>Of course, there were also warriors lining both sides of the purple lamb\u2019s fleece carpet that led to the bejeweled dais, crowding Atlas as he made his way forward. His weapons had already been removed, but they were taking no chances, eyeing his every movement with distrust.</p><p>He wondered if, when she had been a free woman, Nike had ever been summoned to this room, albeit to meet with Zeus, her king. And if she had, had it been for a reward or a punishment?</p><p>Stop thinking about her. Concentrate on Cronus. He\u2019s wily, that one. The god king was not the same man he\u2019d been before his incarceration. The thousands of years inside Tartarus had changed him; he was harder, harsher. Utterly unforgiving. Any weakness, he pounced upon.</p><p>Nowadays, Cronus refused to stay in the heavens without an army to shield him. But then, a man at war with his own wife couldn\u2019t be too careful. Especially when that wife was a queen with powerful abilities and allies of her own. A wife who\u2014</p><p>Dizziness spun through Atlas\u2019s head, fragmenting his thoughts, and he frowned. Frowned but didn\u2019t stop until he reached the end of the fleece. He kept his attention, foggy as it was, fixed on Cronus. What was wrong with him?</p><p>The king was seated atop a throne of solid gold. Dark strands were threaded through his silver hair, and his beard had thinned since the last time Atlas had seen him. Some of the age lines had even disappeared from his weathered features. He wore a long white robe, much like the prisoners of Tartarus. Why? Atlas had often wondered.</p><p>Only two explanations made any sense. Cronus had worn the garment for centuries and now felt most comfortable in it. Or he did not want to forget what he\u2019d once been\u2014and could be again if he weren\u2019t careful. Atlas had been more than happy to shed his own robe. Would Nike do the same, if ever she gained her freedom? Not that she would.</p><p>You\u2019re thinking about her again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A woman stood beside the throne. She possessed one of the plainest faces Atlas had ever seen, and had pale, freckled skin. She was reed thin, with dark, curling hair and delicate shoulders. Power did not hum from her. Rather, she seemed...insubstantial. Ethereal, as he imagined a ghost might look. There, but see-through. There, but wavering. Her eyes were shadowy, vacant, as if no one was home.</p><p>When she reached up and brushed a lock of hair from her brow, he could only gape. The elegance of the movement was awe inspiring. More graceful than a dancer, more delicate than a butterfly wing. Someone was indeed home, she just didn\u2019t care about what was happening around her.</p><p>Atlas pulled his attention from the female and studied the chamber. There were thousands of chandeliers overhead, each dripping with glistening teardrops. Multihued glitter sparkled in the air. Odd, he thought, head tilting to the side for a better view. That air was even sweetly scented with\u2014he inhaled deeply\u2014ambrosia. Ah. Now he understood the dizziness and the glitter. Dried ambrosia was being pumped through the room. To keep him docile?</p> <p>\u201cAtlas, god of Strength,\u201d Cronus said with a nod of greeting, drawing him from his musings.</p><p>Atlas bowed, as was proper. \u201cMy king. It\u2019s an honor to have this audience with you.\u201d</p><p>Cronus leaned forward, silver eyes bright with anxiety. \u201cAll is well in Tartarus, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost assuredly.\u201d</p><p>Relief instantly replaced the anxiety. \u201cWhy, then, did you request this meeting?\u201d</p> <p>There was no one who hated the Greeks more than this man, this Titan sovereign, and with very good reason. They\u2019d stripped him of his power, humiliated him in front of his people. Even Nike had been a participant.</p><p>Just tell him. Get this over with. \u201cI want to remove a woman from the prison and set her up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Stop there.\u201d Scowling, Cronus raised a hand. \u201cThere will be no removing anyone from Tartarus. It is too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d expected that answer. However, he persevered. \u201cPerhaps the reward is worth the danger. I would keep her locked inside my home, Majesty. I would never remove her collar\u2014\u201d well, except to whisk her to his home, for she couldn\u2019t be flashed out of Tartarus with it on, but he would recollar her the moment they reached their destination \u201c\u2014and she would be my personal slave. I would ensure her misery.\u201d His first lie of the day, but probably not his last. He only wanted to give Nike pleasure.</p><p>Had he forgiven her for what she\u2019d done to him? He wasn\u2019t sure. All he knew was that he no longer wanted to kill her when he thought about it. He would tire of her eventually, and he looked forward to the day. Until then, this was his only recourse.</p><p>The king ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cOf which her do you speak?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNike. Greek goddess of Strength.\u201d He did not allow a single bit of affection to lace his tone.</p><p>The king\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThe one who...\u201d Now those eyes dropped to Atlas\u2019s chest, where his shirt covered his tattoos.</p><p>\u201cYes. The very one.\u201d Hear my anger, only my anger. Except, what she\u2019d done no longer angered him. The marks were as much a part of him now as his were a part of her.</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Cronus leaned back in the throne, the picture of contemplation. \u201cDo you not think she is being made to suffer enough inside Tartarus?\u201d</p><p>Time for his second lie. \u201cNo. I do not.\u201d In truth, as dejected as she\u2019d sounded at their last meeting, the goddess was suffering. And he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you do to increase her suffering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch as she hates me\u2014\u201d desires me, he added inside his head, so that he wouldn\u2019t reveal the depths of irritation thoughts of her possible loathing elicited \u201c\u2014she will take particular displeasure in cleaning my home, preparing my food and warming my bed.\u201d</p><p>The king smiled up at the ghostly girl. \u201cWhat you\u2019d like to do to your Paris, eh, my Sienna? Make him your slave.\u201d</p> <p>Her expression never changed. She offered no response, either.</p><p>Paris, the demon-possessed immortal who used to haul new prisoners into Tartarus? Atlas wondered, and then shrugged. He didn\u2019t care. Nike was his only concern at the moment.</p><p>\u201cMy king?\u201d Atlas prompted. \u201cI lack only your permission to begin Nike\u2019s torment. My determination is unparalleled. You will not be disappointed in the results.\u201d</p><p>Cronus faced him once again, his smile falling away. A minute passed in silence, then another. Then the king sighed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my answer has to be no. While I like the thought of Nike\u2019s anguish intensified at your hands, I\u2019m unwilling to risk the removal of her collar, even for the few seconds required to flash her. She is Strength, and were she to somehow escape you and free her brethren, another heavenly war would erupt. I cannot afford to have my attention divided now. Well, not any more than it already is. I find I spend most of my time observing the Lords of the Underworld.\u201d</p><p>The Lords of the Underworld. So. The girl named Sienna did wish to enslave the immortal Paris. Atlas had never dealt with the man or any of his friends, as they\u2019d been his enemy and he\u2019d already been incarcerated before Zeus created them.</p><p>But he\u2019d heard stories and knew they were vicious...brutal.</p><p>\u201cMy king. If you will just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have declared my answer, Strength. I do not understand why you are still here.\u201d</p><p>Atlas\u2019s own sense of dejection\u2014and fury\u2014bloomed. He wanted to stalk up that dais, grab the king and shake him. How dare his request be denied? How dare his desires be discarded? Instead, he said, \u201cVery well, my king. I thank you for your time,\u201d and pivoted on his heel. To do otherwise would have invited punishment.</p><p>He strode from the chamber, his determination overshadowing all else. He\u2019d already decided that nothing would keep him from claiming Nike. Now he realized that not even this would do so. The king\u2019s will be damned. He would have his woman, just as he wanted.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>\u201cCOME WITH ME.\u201d</p><p>Nike\u2019s heart raced at the sound of that deep voice. Hesitant, she rolled over on her cot. Sure enough, her skin tingled when her gaze found Atlas. Gorgeous as ever, he stood at the bars\u2014bars that were now open. His hand was extended, and he was waving her over. There was fury in his too-tight expression.</p><p>What had she done this time?</p><p>She\u2019d tried to ignore him. She\u2019d tried to pretend that she felt nothing for him. Anything to stop the madness. But gods, she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about their kiss. She couldn\u2019t stop wishing she\u2019d allowed him to take her all the way. That she\u2019d have experienced everything before being taken back to nothing.</p><p>So what if he would have tired of her afterward? So what if he would have been smug about her capitulation? So what if he found someone else and paraded her before Nike? For a few blessed hours\u2014who was she kidding?\u2014for a few blessed minutes, because it wasn\u2019t as if either one of them would last beyond that, she would have known the joy of being with him again. Of simply feeling, giving, taking, sharing...loving.</p><p>Have all the rest, common sense piped up, but deny the love.</p><p>That would be my pleasure. But I have to get him to offer me the rest first. She still would not beg. A girl had her pride, after all.</p><p>Pride will not make you come.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>What did he have planned? Did it matter? Anything was better than this monotony.</p><p>Slowly she sat up. Her hair was in desperate need of a brush, and gods, the rest of her needed a shower. How long since she\u2019d had one? Prisoners were given a bowl of water each day and that was it. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>A muscle twitched in his jaw. \u201cDo you want to spend a few hours outside the prison or not?\u201d Wait. What? Leave Tartarus? She was on her feet before her brain could process what she was doing. Her knees almost buckled, she\u2019d spent so much time prone, bored, but she managed to stay upright. She even reached out and twined their fingers together. The heat of his skin should not have shocked her, but it did. The calluses should not have ignited a fire in her blood, but they did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking me outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But do not say a word when we reach the guard\u2019s station. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d This could be a trick. A trick to build up her hopes only to dash them cruelly, but she didn\u2019t care. If there was a chance, slight though it was, that he would actually stay true to his word, she would do anything he asked.</p><p>Without a word, he led her from the cell and down the hall. Other prisoners spotted her and gasped. Some began to murmur amongst themselves, gossiping as they\u2019d once enjoyed doing in the heavens. Some gripped their bars and simply watched her through wistful eyes.</p><p>Erebos even shouted, \u201cHey, where are you going with her now?\u201d</p><p>Atlas ignored him, and Nike followed suit. A sense of urgency pounded through her. If Atlas did this, took her outside, even for a few hours... Why would he do such a thing?</p><p>\u201cDid you get permission for this?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not at the guard\u2019s station yet, so it\u2019s okay that I\u2019m talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t get permission.\u201d His words were curt, clearly meant to end the conversation.</p><p>As if she\u2019d ever done what was expected of her. \u201cThen why are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I\u2019ll shut you up my favorite way.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. Did he mean he\u2019d shut her up with a kiss? Or by pushing a button on her collar and shooting painful lances through her brain? It was fifty-fifty, she thought. His proclamation had the desired results, however. She was too busy pondering his meaning to talk.</p><p>In the guard\u2019s station, two Titans were laughingly making bets about the prisoners. They looked up at Atlas and nodded politely in greeting\u2014only to freeze when they spotted her. As promised, she remained quiet.</p><p>\u201cShe try to escape?\u201d one demanded, obviously ready to beat her for doing so.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m taking her out for a bit,\u201d Atlas replied. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d the other gasped out. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer viper\u2019s tongue offends me. Therefore, she deserves a new punishment. To that end, I plan to taunt her with what she cannot have.\u201d</p><p>The very words she\u2019d once offered Aergia, the goddess of Laziness. He\u2019d remembered.</p> <p>Still the guard persisted. \u201cHas this been cleared with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in charge of this prison and the people inside it. Now shut up and do your job.\u201d With that, Atlas ushered her out of the building and into the daylight. No one else tried to stop him.</p><p>As the first ray hit her skin, she jerked free of his hold and stopped, simply basking in the moment. Clouds. Sun. She closed her eyes, head thrown back, arms splayed. The warmth, followed by a cooling breeze...the brightness\u2014her skin soaked them up greedily. Oh, how she\u2019d missed them. She would have loved to have seen temples and golden streets and people, as well, but she would take what she could get without complaint.</p><p>Strong arms suddenly banded around her. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Atlas whispered, his nose nuzzling her ear, practically purring. \u201cDo you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I look like.\u201d Her lashes fluttered open. The clouds enveloped him, creating a dream haze. Her heart was hammering against her ribs, and she couldn\u2019t have stopped herself from flattening her hands on his chest to save her life. His own heart was racing, she realized with astonishment. Was he...could he be as affected by her as she was by him? \u201cAnd beautiful is not a word that describes me.\u201d</p> <p>His head lifted, and he gazed down at her. Tenderness softened his expression, and she thought he\u2019d never been more appealing. \u201cThen you don\u2019t see yourself as I do.\u201d</p><p>How did he see her? As much as he hated her\u2014but did he hate her still? How could he, when he\u2019d just escorted her to paradise?\u2014she would have guessed he pictured her with horns, fangs and a tail.</p><p>She cleared her throat, too afraid to ask. \u201cWhy did you do this for me?\u201d A much easier question, with an answer that probably wouldn\u2019t destroy what little was left of her feminine pride.</p><p>\u201cI have my reasons,\u201d was all he said. \u201cNow, as much as I\u2019d love to stay in this exact spot with you, we only have a short amount of time. Do you want to spend it here or eating the food I\u2019ve prepared, as well as bathing? I know those are the two things I missed most during my tenure here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat...eating. Bathing.\u201d Was this really happening? Or was she merely dreaming about him again? Nothing else explained this change in him, in her situation.</p><p>He kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cThen food and a bath you shall have. Come. Since I can\u2019t flash you outside of this realm, and there are no homes, inns or shops here, I\u2019ve set up camp a mile north, out of view of the prison.\u201d</p> <p>Dreaming, surely. Perhaps a trick, as she\u2019d first supposed. But she allowed him to lead her through the clouds without protest.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>BY THE TIME THEY REACHED the camp he\u2019d set up, Atlas was hard and aching. Nike had been pressed against his side the entire mile, her female scent in his nose, her heat radiating into his body.</p><p>When she spied the tent he\u2019d erected, she gasped. Wide brown eyes flicked up to him with wonder before she raced forward, not slowing as she barreled through the front flap. He heard another gasp.</p><p>Grinning, Atlas followed her inside. He liked this softer side of her. She stood in the center, twirling, clearly trying to take everything in at once. He\u2019d spread furs on the floor and had even carted a small round table here and piled it high with her favorite foods. There was a porcelain tub already filled with steaming water, rose petals floating on the surface.</p><p>Never let it be said that the Titan god of Strength did not know how to romance a woman.</p><p>Nike\u2019s hand fluttered over her heart, her gaze glued to the plate of strawberries and feta. \u201cHow did you know I liked those?\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d always been hyperaware of her every action. He\u2019d watched her from his cell while she\u2019d eaten them with her friends and he\u2019d fumed that he was not the one with her, basking in her good humor. That was not something he\u2019d admit to, however.</p> <p>\u201cGood guess,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>She peered down at the rug and kicked out her bare, dirty foot. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re doing this, Atlas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us,\u201d he replied gruffly.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust enjoy it, Nike. It\u2019s all I can give you.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes fluttered up, and her gaze pinned him. \u201cBut why would you want to give me anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop analyzing my reasons. This isn\u2019t a ploy or a punishment, I promise you. And the food is not poisoned, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d He closed the distance between them, placed his hands on her shoulders and urged her to the table.</p><p>There, they ate in silence. The rapture on her face, rapture that increased with every bite, delighted him. The wine she savored sip by sip, moaning with every swallow.</p><p>Bringing her here was worth the risk of Cronus\u2019s wrath, he thought.</p><p>Although, to get technical, Cronus had merely ordered him to keep her in Tartarus. Which he had done. The clouds around the prison were part of the realm. So really, he had not broken any rules. Cronus, though, being Cronus, would not see it that way.</p><p>Still, Atlas couldn\u2019t regret it. He had never seen this joyful, eager side of the Greek goddess, and he found that he liked it just as much as he liked everything else about her. Which was way more than he should have.</p><p>When every crumb had been consumed, she turned her attention to the bath. \u201cThat\u2019s for me?\u201d Utter longing radiated from her, yet she didn\u2019t move toward it.</p><p>\u201cYes. But I can\u2019t leave you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>She chewed on her bottom lip and nodded. \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is, I can bathe with you watching or not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>He expected her to fight him on that. Hell, she could have refused outright. What he did not expect was for her to push to her feet and discard her robe without hesitation. At the sight of her nakedness, he hissed in a breath. Already he\u2019d thought her exquisite...but now, now... Holy gods. She was the finest creature the gods had ever produced.</p><p>Her skin, so golden and smooth, covered lean muscle and succulent breasts. Those breasts were soft, perfect for his hands, and her nipples were as pretty a pink as he remembered. His mouth watered for them.</p><p>She walked to the tub and stepped inside. Her ass, her back...his name. He was on his feet before he realized what he\u2019d done. He wanted to kiss those tattoos, something she would probably fight him over. He wouldn\u2019t apologize for having given them to her, though. Hell, no. He liked them too much.</p><p>Nike pivoted slowly, and her gaze met his as she sank into the water. There was no hiding the desire he felt\u2014it consumed him, ate him up and left him as bare as she was. Her expression, however, was blank.</p><p>Slowly, she worked the bar of soap he\u2019d brought her over her entire body. She seemed completely unabashed as the suds danced over her, sliding down those magnificent breasts hiding beneath the rose petals. She washed her hair, too, and soon the locks were dripping down her face and shoulders.</p><p>With every move she made, he inched a little closer to her. He just couldn\u2019t help himself. Finally she finished and stood. Another feast for his eyes. All the strength he craved more than anything else in the world was now wet, and he wanted to lick away every drop.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d she asked, stepping from the tub. Her voice was as devoid of emotion as her expression. Why?</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d he managed to croak past the lump in his throat.</p><p>Finally. A reaction. Relief and desire, such intense desire, claimed her, and she grinned a siren\u2019s smile. \u201cThen have me you shall.\u201d</p><p>They were a mimic of his earlier words, and completely unexpected. Why the change in her? Doesn\u2019t matter. As he\u2019d told her earlier, there was no good reason to analyze a change of heart. Not in either of them. Not now.</p><p>He had the distance between them defeated a split second later. Had his arms wrapped around her, jerking her into him, a second after that. Their lips met in a wild tangle, their tongues seeking, rolling together. On and on the kiss continued, drowning him in all that she was.</p><p>He hated to stop, even for a moment, but he had to remove his clothes. If he didn\u2019t experience skin-to-skin contact soon, he was going to ignite into flames. Panting, he tore away his shirt, his boots, then his pants.</p><p>She moaned. \u201cAtlas.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her back into his embrace. Finally. Blessedly. Skin to skin. Both of them groaned at the headiness. Her nipples rubbed against his chest, his tattoos, while their lower bodies thrust together. Then she was bending down, tracing those letters with her tongue\u2014and gods, he had never been happier that he had them.</p><p>After she\u2019d traced the last one, she kissed her way down his stomach. She dropped to her knees.</p><p>Was she going to\u2014please, please, please\u2014but she didn\u2019t like him enough to do it. Did she? \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She sucked his cock deep into her mouth.</p><p>His head fell back, and he roared. All that wet heat was ecstasy, surely the first he\u2019d ever truly known, for nothing had ever felt this damned good. Except her, that first time he claimed her. Up and down she moved, allowing him to hit the back of her throat.</p><p>\u201cGods! Don\u2019t make me come.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, pulled off and licked his sac. \u201cWhen have I ever listened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVixen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I make you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want inside you.\u201d With a growl, he dropped to his knees, as well. She could taste his seed. Later. He hadn\u2019t lied to her. More than anything, even more of that ecstasy, he wanted inside her, and he didn\u2019t want to have to wait for it. \u201cSpread your legs for me.\u201d</p><p>The moment she obeyed, he had two fingers buried deep. More wet heat. And to his delight... \u201cYou\u2019re ready for me.\u201d Never had he been more proud that he\u2019d brought a female to this point. And that he\u2019d done so with kisses, only kisses.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She trembled, had to grip his shoulders to remain upright. \u201cI\u2019m ready for you every damn time I see you.\u201d</p><p>And she didn\u2019t like it, he could tell from her tone, but he could only bask in the admission. \u201cIt\u2019s the same for me.\u201d</p><p>At first, she blinked, as if she couldn\u2019t allow herself to believe him. So vulnerable she appeared, so\u2014dare he wish?\u2014hopeful. Then she placed a sweet kiss on his lips and breathed him in. \u201cDon\u2019t say things like that,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not? I spoke true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they affect me.\u201d</p><p>Headier words had never been spoken. \u201cLet\u2019s finish this before I combust, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He was sweating, panting, as he settled back on his ass, reached out and cupped hers. He jerked her onto his lap, forcing her to wrap her thighs around his waist. As her hands tangled in his hair, he lifted her, placing her eager core at the tip of his erection.</p> <p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked hoarsely. This was it. The moment he felt he\u2019d been waiting forever for.</p><p>\u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>He thrust up and she pushed down, and then he was all the way in, surrounded by the very thing he had defied his king, his sovereign, to possess. It was better than he remembered, better than he could have imagined. He couldn\u2019t pause, couldn\u2019t give her time to adjust. Over and over he pushed in, pulled out, too overwhelmed by pleasure to do anything but ride out the storm. Perhaps it was the same for her. Her nails scored his back, and her moans rang in his ears.</p><p>Gods, he was close. On fire. Burning. Desperate. He reached between their bodies and pressed his thumb against his new favorite place.</p><p>\u201cAtlas!\u201d she shouted, her inner walls suddenly milking him.</p><p>She was climaxing, lost to all that he was, and the thought drove him over the last bit of the edge, as well. He jetted inside her, lost to all that she was, the most intense orgasm of his life claiming him.</p> <p>An eternity later, his spasms stopped. Together, they fell backward, onto the softness of the fur. He kept his arms around her, unwilling to let her go. Now...always?</p><p>Yes, always, he thought, and his eyes widened. He wanted her always. Wanted more of this. Had to have more of this. When he\u2019d forgiven her completely, he didn\u2019t know. When he\u2019d softened, he didn\u2019t know, either. He only knew that she\u2019d become an important part of his life. Perhaps she always had been; he\u2019d just been too foolish to realize it.</p><p>What the hell was he going to do?</p><p>They could be together each night after his shift, but they\u2019d never have privacy, and her pride would soon chafe at his amorous attentions, all while he refused to set her free. It would have been the same for him when the situation had been reversed. Besides, she was too precious to hurt in that way. But the problem was, he couldn\u2019t be without her. He\u2019d proven that already.</p><p>Damn, he thought next, suddenly sick to his stomach. Damn!</p><p>He\u2019d finally found the one woman for him, but they were doomed.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>SHE LOVED HIM, NIKE THOUGHT. Again. I\u2019m hopeless.</p> <p>He\u2019d just...he\u2019d been so amazing. He\u2019d whisked her away, given her everything she\u2019d craved: food, water and his body. Gods, had he given her that delectable body. She\u2019d savored every moment. Savored his taste, his touch, the feel of him pounding inside her.</p><p>Four days had since passed, but she craved more. Always she craved more. She\u2019d spent the time locked inside her cell, pacing, trying to think of ways for them to be together. If he still wanted her, that is. Atlas had come by at least once a day to make sure she was properly fed and that her basin of water was filled, but he\u2019d never said a word to her. Actually, they hadn\u2019t spoken since leaving the tent.</p><p>At the time, she\u2019d felt too raw, too exposed. She\u2019d feared her feelings for him had been shining in her eyes. He was everything she\u2019d ever wanted in a mate. His strength matched hers. She would never have to worry about hurting him. He was witty and charming. He was a protector, a warrior. He was deliciously vengeful, she knew firsthand.</p><p>She smiled, wishing she could reach between her shoulder blades and feel his name. She was certain the letters would be as hot as the man himself. But...</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he spoken to her?</p><p>Why didn\u2019t you speak to him?</p><p>Because she hadn\u2019t known what to say. Did he still want her? Did he feel anything for her? How would she react if he didn\u2019t, which was most likely the case? Part of her wanted to take anything he would give her. The other part of her knew her pride wouldn\u2019t allow her to do such a thing. But there at the end, when they\u2019d returned to Tartarus and he\u2019d closed the bars to her cell, she had thought she\u2019d glimpsed regret. Regret that he had to seal her inside. Regret that they couldn\u2019t spend more time together\u2014in bed and out.</p><p>Nike tugged at her collar and screeched. Damn this. She was the epitome of strength, yet was as helpless as a babe. How could she win a man\u2019s heart when she couldn\u2019t even win her own freedom?</p><p>ATLAS HEARD A SCREECH of frustration and knew immediately who had uttered it. Nike. His Nike. His beautiful Nike. He\u2019d deliberated about what to do, how they could be together, for four days. Well, the time for thinking was over, it seemed. She was close to her breaking point. She\u2019d tasted freedom; being sequestered now had to be a thousand times worse than before.</p><p>He hated that she was locked up, and he knew they could never be together while she was. He also knew they could not be together if he released her. She would most likely run, and he would most definitely be punished.</p><p>Maybe she loved him, maybe she didn\u2019t. Maybe she\u2019d stay with him. Or try to. She liked him and was attracted to him, he would go so far as to say. After everything that had transpired between them, she wouldn\u2019t have slept with him otherwise. But love? He wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>And it didn\u2019t matter, really. He loved her. Perhaps he always had. He\u2019d never felt so strongly about a woman. He\u2019d never wanted to spend his every waking minute with someone before, had never wanted to cuddle someone into his side for every sleeping minute. He\u2019d never wanted to eat every meal together. To talk and laugh about their days. To spar, verbally and physically. But he did with her.</p><p>And since they couldn\u2019t be together, no matter what way things panned out, there was only one thing to do.</p><p>Dread. That\u2019s what he felt as he pounded up the stairs and to her cell. Also...relief. She was banging a fist into the wall, plumes of dust forming around her. The sight of her nearly undid him. He wanted to kiss her, put his fingers all over her, sink inside her. Harden your heart. Do what is needed. His hand was shaking as he lifted the sensor.</p><p>She heard the slide of the bars and turned. A gasp parted her beautiful lips. Without a word, he held out his palm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take it.\u201d</p><p>She frowned as she accepted.</p><p>Still silent, he pulled her along the same path he had just taken. The same path they\u2019d taken those four days ago. No one tried to stop him this time. In fact, as he passed the guard\u2019s station, the two gods on duty rolled their eyes.</p><p>Outside, with the clouds all around him, he whirled on Nike. He still wanted to kiss her, but knew that if he did so, he would not be able to let her go. And he had to let her go.</p><p>\u201cAtlas,\u201d she said with a seductive grin. She tried to wrap her arms around his neck. \u201cAnother outing? I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and placed his fingers on the designated indentations in the collar. Cool metal met his touch. Then he leaned down and fit his lips over the center.</p><p>Her grin fell away. A tremor moved through her. \u201cWh-what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe still.\u201d He drew in a deep breath, held it...held it...and then slowly released it. As that breath slithered through the inside of the collar, the metal loosened...finally splitting down the center and tumbling to the ground. Such a simple thing, the removal. Touch and breath. Yet only an uncollared god could do so, a fact that had to taunt the incarcerated. Perhaps that\u2019s why the bands had been designed as they had.</p><p>Eyes wide, she reached up, felt her bare neck. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. They were the same words she\u2019d spoken before. He hadn\u2019t had an answer then. He did now. He loved her, but he could never tell her that.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said. \u201cFlash somewhere. Maybe earth. And whatever you do, stay hidden. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAtlas...no.\u201d She shook her head violently, even fisted his shirt. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. When they discover I\u2019m gone for good, and they will, you\u2019ll be charged with a crime. You\u2019ll be locked away, placed with the Greeks who hate you. Or, if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll be killed.\u201d</p><p>She felt, he realized, both amazed and saddened. She cared for him, which meant she would suffer without him. If anything, that only increased his determination to save her. She did not deserve a life behind bars.</p><p>He forced his expression to harden. Forced himself to jerk away from her. \u201cI can\u2019t stand to look at you anymore. I\u2019ve had you, and now I\u2019m bored with you.\u201d</p><p>Her arms dropped to her sides as if weighed down by rocks, but she quickly pulled them around her middle. \u201cThen keep me locked up and stay away from me. You don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p><p>Still willing to give up her freedom to be near him? Damn her. He fell a little more in love with her. \u201cGo! Did you not hear me? I can\u2019t stand the sight of you anymore. Don\u2019t you get it? You make me sick, Nike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Tears filled her eyes. Real godsdamned tears. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that. You can\u2019t mean that.\u201d The last was whispered brokenly.</p><p>His heart constricted painfully. Do it. Finish it. \u201cI\u2019d rather be killed or locked away than look at you another moment. Because every time I look at you, I\u2019m reminded of what we did and I\u2014I want to vomit. I was using you, wanting to punish you, but I took things too far. Even for me.\u201d Hating himself, he turned away from her. \u201cSo do us both a favor and go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a long while, she didn\u2019t speak. He knew she didn\u2019t flash away, either, for he heard no rustle of clothing. But then, he did hear a whimper. A sob. More of those tears must be falling.</p><p>Gods, he couldn\u2019t do it. He couldn\u2019t send her away like this. He spun, meaning to grab on to her and tell her the truth, to force her to listen. To make her leave another way. But she was gone before their eyes could meet and his hands encountered only air.</p><p>\u201cYOU INSOLENT FOOL!\u201d</p> <p>Atlas peered up at the fuming Cronus. Not like he could do anything else. His wrists were chained to poles, forcing him to remain on his knees. The very collar he\u2019d removed from Nike was now wrapped around his own neck.</p><p>He\u2019d known this would happen, but he hadn\u2019t cared. He still didn\u2019t. Nike was free, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>\u201cHave you nothing to say for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne Greek can raise an army. That army can attack us. Ruin us. I told you that, and still you defied me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNike won\u2019t do that,\u201d he said confidently. He trusted her to disappear. Even as angry as she had to be with him, she would not endanger herself to save people she had never truly liked.</p><p>Cronus slammed his fist against the arm of his throne, ever the petulant child. \u201cYou can\u2019t know that! You aren\u2019t my All-Seeing Eye.\u201d</p><p>Atlas arched a brow, refusing to be cowed. \u201cWould you risk being imprisoned again to help your fellow Titans? I may not be able to see all the secrets of the heavens and Hell, yet I know you would not. She will not, either.\u201d</p><p>The king had no response to that, but that didn\u2019t stop him from growling. \u201cYou disobeyed a direct order, and for that you will be punished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d He offered the statement without hesitation. It was the truth. He understood that the god king had to make an example out of him. Otherwise, others would see Cronus as weak. They would disobey him as Atlas had.</p><p>\u201cI think you actually do.\u201d Some of Cronus\u2019s fury abated. \u201cOnly this morning I saw a portrait of you. A portrait painted by my Eye. With it, she showed me exactly how to punish you.\u201d The king smiled evilly and looked to the ghostlike girl still standing at his side. \u201cYou know what to do, sweet Sienna.\u201d</p> <p>Sienna strode forward, a knife appearing in her hand. She stopped in front of Atlas and dropped to her knees, placing them eye to eye. So this was it, he thought. The end. As an immortal, he\u2019d never thought to reach this point. Still. He found he only regretted that he hadn\u2019t had more time with Nike, that he hadn\u2019t gotten the chance to apologize for his harsh words the last time they were together and that he would never have the chance to confess his love.</p><p>With absolutely no emotion on her face, the girl dug the tip of the blade into his wrist and cut out his sensor, rather than chop off his head. That\u2019s when he realized Cronus meant to lock him away rather than kill him. Good. More time to think about Nike and what could have been.</p><p>But then Sienna moved the blade to his chest and pressed, slicing. It stung, but that was not what made him struggle against her ministrations. No, it was the fact that she began carving away Nike\u2019s name. He roared loud and long, fighting for all he was worth. Guards were called over and hard hands settled over him, pressing him down, holding him steady. Still he fought, but in the end, they managed to remove all four letters.</p><p>As each person walked away from him, he glanced down at himself through burning, watery eyes. Blood poured down his chest and four open wounds stared up at him, the muscles torn, the skin completely gone. He might have hated that brand at one point in his life, but he\u2019d grown to love it as much as the woman who\u2019d given it to him. More than that, it had been the last remaining evidence of her presence.</p><p>His hands fisted, and his back straightened. Blood and sweat mingled, stinging further. Another roar burst from his lips, and he tossed it to the domed ceiling. He didn\u2019t stop until his throat was shredded from the strain.</p><p>\u201cAre you quite finished?\u201d Cronus asked him.</p><p>His gaze fell to the dais, narrowing. \u201cI will destroy you for this,\u201d his vowed brokenly. \u201cOne day you will die by my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot likely. Take him to Tartarus,\u201d the king told his guards, unconcerned. \u201cWhere he will rot for all eternity.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>IT TOOK HER TWO DAYS, but Nike finally located Atlas\u2019s home, a sprawling estate in Olympus. Or Titania, as Cronus had renamed the city. The amount of wealth Atlas had needed to acquire such a place astonished her\u2014and she knew exactly how much he\u2019d paid because she had once owned it. But then, she supposed he\u2019d considered every cent worth it. After living in a tiny cell for thousands of years, he\u2019d most likely wanted every bit of space he could get. And every amenity.</p><p>There was a swimming pool, more than thirty bedrooms, two winding, marble staircases and four fireplaces, and all the walls were comprised of solid gold. None of that interested her, however. Only his bedroom did.</p><p>There, she discovered more about the man who had sent her on her way. A man who would not have risked this just to avoid her face, as he\u2019d claimed. A man who would not have risked his life for anything other than love.</p><p>Nearly everything was as she\u2019d left it. A huge bed covered with black silk sheets. The walls were painted with murals of the sun and sky, and the furniture smelled of rich mahogany. There were multiple bookcases, each filled with leather-bound books. Her books. Beaded pillows were strategically placed along the floor. Places for him to lounge and read, as she had done.</p><p>What held her attention, however, was the only difference. A portrait hung above the hearth. A portrait of her.</p><p>He must have commissioned it after their time inside that tent, for she was reclined in a porcelain tub, bubbles sliding over her shoulders and chest, her hair soaked. She would have looked as plain and masculine as always, except he\u2019d had the artist add a sensual light to her dark eyes and a come-and-get-me curve to her lips.</p><p>Finally she knew how he saw her. As someone beautiful. He\u2019d once told her so, but she\u2019d had trouble believing him. Now...</p><p>Only a man in love would do such a thing. Only a man in love would keep such a thing in such a prominent place. Only a man in love would want to see a woman\u2019s portrait every night before he fell asleep, then wake up looking at it.</p><p>Oh, yes. He loved her. As she loved him.</p><p>There, outside of Tartarus, she\u2019d thought, hoped, that he did so, but she had let his words scrape against her already low self-esteem. How could so beautiful and sensual a man want her? she\u2019d wondered. But he did. He loved her. Proof: he\u2019d risked everything for her.</p><p>She could do no less for him.</p><p>Nike strode through the bedroom, knowing her lover would have a weapons case stashed somewhere\u2014and knowing exactly what to do with it.</p><p>ATLAS WAS NOT GIVEN A CELL of his own\u2014not at first. Still bleeding and frantic, fighting, he had been thrust into a cell with Erebos. Of course, that\u2019s who had been chosen as his cell mate, he\u2019d thought, rage filling him. A male who had once thought to claim his Nike. A male who had then stolen food from her, pushed her around and called her terrible names.</p><p>Atlas had seen it happen on numerous occasions. He hadn\u2019t done anything about it then, telling himself she deserved what she got, but he\u2019d wanted to. And there was no better time than now.</p><p>Even with his strength corralled by the collar and half his blood dried to his chest, even with his still-seeping wounds splitting open with every move he made, Atlas managed to defeat Erebos in record time. He punched, he kicked, he did not play fair, kneeing the god in the balls while he was down. In the end, a broken, bloody Erebos lay crying on the dirty floor, right alongside everyone who had tried to save him.</p><p>That\u2019s when Atlas was moved to the empty cell Nike had occupied. He stretched out on the cot, simply breathing in her lingering essence. His sweet, sweet Nike. He would have to spend eternity without her. Without even her brand. Once again, he roared.</p><p>What was she doing now? If she sought solace in the arms of another man, even in the years to come, he would tear this prison apart stone by stone and kill the bastard. As if. You sent her on her way to do just that. You want her happy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all the racket? Seriously.\u201d</p><p>Gods, he was hearing her voice now. Locked up two days, and he was already headed into insanity.</p><p>His bars rattled, slid open. He rolled to his side, determined to send whoever it was away. When he caught sight of his beloved Nike, he blinked. Oh, yes, he was indeed going insane. She stood before him, clad in a black leather bra top and black leather pants. Her hair was slicked back in a smooth ponytail. Blood splattered her cheeks. Never had she looked more beautiful, her strength there for all to see.</p><p>She was holding someone\u2019s arm. Without their body. For the sensor in the wrist?</p><p>His hallucinations were certainly detailed.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she said, clearly impatient. She tossed the arm aside. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to say anything?\u201d</p><p>Slowly he sat up. He didn\u2019t want this moment to end. Didn\u2019t want to lose sight of her. \u201cI missed you. So much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wanted an apology. Stupid me. I much prefer this.\u201d She grinned, practically beaming. \u201cI missed you, too, but we\u2019ll have to catch up later.\u201d Her gaze fell to his chest, and she gaped in astonishment. Then she growled. \u201cDid the god king cut my name off you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She was holding a knife, he saw, and her knuckles bleached of color. \u201cI. Will. Kill. Him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready promised to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do it together, then. After we get out of here.\u201d Her attention flicked behind her, urgent, before returning to him. \u201cCome on. We have to go before someone realizes what I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me look at you. Just let me enjoy this moment. Let me apologize for what I said to you. You said you wanted an apology, yes? I didn\u2019t mean it, not a word I said that last day, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She closed the distance between them and slapped him. Hard. The blow knocked him back against the cot and caused stars to wink over his vision. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once more, he blinked at her. \u201cYou hit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019ll do it again if you don\u2019t get your ass in gear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re real.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re real.\u201d He sat up, saying the words but not truly absorbing them. This couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>She dropped to her knees so that they were eye to eye. \u201cAgain, yes.\u201d Just as he\u2019d once done to her, she placed her fingers over his collar and blew into the center. As the metal softened, he finally understood what his brain had been trying to tell him. Nike was here. She was really here. And she was saving his life.</p><p>With a scowl, he jumped to his feet. \u201cI told you to go to earth, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, not the reaction I expected.\u201d She stood and pressed a swift kiss to his lips. \u201cGood thing I never listen to you. Now let\u2019s go. I\u2019ve already taken out the guards below. And no, I didn\u2019t kill your friends. Just made them wish they were dead.\u201d As she spoke, she latched on to his hand and dragged him out of the cell. \u201cCronus could realize what\u2019s going down at any moment and appear, and then we\u2019ll both be in trouble. As long as we\u2019re here, we\u2019re easy pickings.\u201d</p> <p>True. Nike was a fugitive now; he wanted her out of this prison, out of this realm, as soon as possible. \u201cYou risked your life to save me, you fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you risked your life to save me.\u201d</p><p>Down the stairs they pounded and, sure enough, all three of the guards were flat on their faces, motionless. One of them was missing an arm\u2014and he knew exactly where to find it. Not that he\u2019d take the time to tell. The arm, lost or not, would grow back. \u201cBut you were free. You had what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything,\u201d she threw over her shoulder.</p><p>Okay, wow. She\u2019d just admitted she wanted him more than freedom. Atlas couldn\u2019t help himself. He gave a tug, propelling her backward, into his arms. \u201cI love you,\u201d he finally proclaimed, and mashed their lips together. His tongue thrust deep, tasting, demanding. \u201cI mean it. I love you more than anything. Anyone.\u201d</p><p>She only allowed the kiss for a few seconds, her hands fisting his hair and taking everything he had to give, before she pulled away, panting. \u201cI love you, too. But let\u2019s get the hell out of here. I need your pretty head connected to your amazing body.\u201d</p> <p>Once again, they surged forward. Still, he almost couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. It was so much like a dream. \u201cI\u2019m going to spend the rest of eternity making up for what I did to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I think I\u2019ll like seeing you grovel. But just for the record, I love my tattoo and I know why you said those nasty things. Sure, I would have found a better way to get you to safety, but then, I\u2019m smarter than you are, so really, I can\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. Gods, he loved this woman. \u201cVixen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour vixen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine. Always. You\u2019ll mark me again just as soon as my skin heals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready planned on it.\u201d</p><p>Good. He wouldn\u2019t feel complete until she did. \u201cSo where are we going to live?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay in the heavens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ordered me to hide on earth. I thought we could do so\u2014together. Though I hate that you have to give up your amazing house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been there?\u201d He found he really liked the thought of her there, surrounded by his things, breathing in his essence. \u201cYou know where I chose to live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why did you? Choose there, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo feel closer to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re about to be a lot closer to me.\u201d</p><p>A laugh boomed from him. There was no woman more perfect for him. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ll miss from that house is the portrait of you. But now I have the real thing.\u201d He placed a swift kiss on her lips. \u201cBack to our new living arrangements. There are other gods out there, Greeks like you, who are in hiding. Cronus has never been able to find them. That means there are places he can\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll find them and join them. We are Strength, after all. And Victory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Victory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can succeed where he has failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, we might even try to find the Lords of the Underworld. Cronus mentioned being distracted by them. If they are his enemies, they might be good friends for us to have.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI know of whom you speak. They were Zeus\u2019s immortal warriors long ago, but now they house the demons once locked inside Pandora\u2019s box. Cronus will have his hands tied for a long, long time with them. They would be very good friends to have.\u201d</p><p>They reached the door and burst outside, all without incident. Clouds instantly enveloped them, the sun shining brightly. Nike whirled and threw herself in his arms, placing nips and kisses all over his face.</p><p>\u201cWe did it. Now take us somewhere. Anywhere. As long as we can be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said again, then did exactly as his woman had ordered. </p> </body></html>"]
