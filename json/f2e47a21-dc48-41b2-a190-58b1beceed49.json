Ali was the sensible one in the family. She\u2014unlike Shana\u2014wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of packing up her entire life, buying a pizza and ice-cream parlor and starting over in a new city. Oh, no, only someone completely and utterly in need of a change\u2014correction, a drastic change\u2014would do something like that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Shana, but you did agree to this parenting plan.\u201d</p><p>Her sister was a Navy nurse stationed in San Diego, and several years ago, when she\u2019d asked Shana to look after her niece if necessary, Shana had immediately said yes. It had seemed an unlikely prospect at the time, but that was before her sister became a widow.</p> <p>\u201cI did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d she muttered lamely as she stepped around a cardboard box. Her rental house was cluttered with the makings of her new life and the remnants of her old.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like I have any choice in the matter,\u201d Ali pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Pushing her thick, chestnut-colored hair away from her forehead, Shana leaned against the kitchen wall and slowly expelled her breath, hoping that would calm her pounding heart. \u201cI said yes back then because you asked me to, but I don\u2019t know anything about kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJazmine\u2019s great,\u201d Ali assured her.</p><p>\u201cI know, but\u2014but...\u201d she stammered. Shana wasn\u2019t sure how to explain. \u201cThe thing is, I\u2019m at a turning point in my own life and I\u2019m probably not the best person for Jazmine.\u201d Surely there was a relative on her brother-in-law\u2019s side. Someone else, anyone else would be better than Shana, who was starting a new career after suffering a major romantic breakup. At the moment, her life still felt disorganized. Chaotic. Add a recently bereaved nine-year-old to the mix, and she didn\u2019t know what might happen.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a choose-your-time type of situation,\u201d Ali said. \u201cI\u2019m counting on you, and so is Jazmine.\u201d</p><p>Shana nibbled on her lower lip, trapped between her doubts and her obligation to her widowed sister. \u201cI\u2019ll do it, of course, but I was just wondering if there was someone else....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t,\u201d Ali said abruptly.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s me.\u201d Shana spoke with as much enthusiasm as she could muster, although she suspected it must sound pretty hollow. Shana hadn\u2019t had much experience as an aunt, but she was going to get her chance to learn. She was about to become her niece\u2019s primary caregiver while her sister went out to sea on an aircraft carrier for a six-month deployment.</p><p>Shana truly hadn\u2019t expected this. When Ali filled out the \u201cworldwide availability\u201d form\u2014with Shana\u2019s name\u2014she\u2019d explained it was so the Navy had documentation proving Jazmine would have someone to take care of her at all times, ensuring that Ali was combat-ready. It had seemed quite routine, more of a formality than a possibility\u2014and of course, Peter was alive then.</p><p>Ali had been in the Navy for twelve years and had never pulled sea duty before now. She\u2019d traveled around the world with her husband, a Navy pilot, and their daughter. Then, two years ago, Peter had been killed in a training accident and everything changed.</p> <p>Things had changed in Shana\u2019s life, too, although not in the same unalterable and tragic way. Brad\u2014Shana purposely put a halt to her thoughts. Brad was in the past. They were finished. Done. Kaput. She\u2019d told her friends that she was so over him she had to force herself to remember his name. Who was he, again? That was how over him she was. Over. Over and out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much time,\u201d Ali was saying. \u201cThe Woodrow Wilson\u2019s scheduled to leave soon. I\u2019ll fly Jazmine up this weekend but I won\u2019t be able to stay more than overnight.\u201d</p><p>Shana swallowed a protest. For reasons of national security, Shana realized her sister couldn\u2019t say any more about her schedule. But this weekend? She still had to finish unpacking. Furthermore, she\u2019d only just started training with the former owners of her restaurant. Then it occurred to Shana that she might not be the only one upset about Ali\u2019s sudden deployment. She could only guess at her niece\u2019s reaction. \u201cWhat does Jazmine have to say about all this?\u201d</p><p>Ali\u2019s hesitation told Shana everything she needed to know. \u201cOh, great,\u201d she muttered under her breath. She remembered her own childhood and what her mother had termed her \u201cattitude problem.\u201d Shana had plenty of that, all right, and most of it was bad. Dealing with Jazmine\u2019s moods would be payback, she supposed, for everything her poor mother had endured.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, Jazmine isn\u2019t too excited about the move.\u201d</p><p>Who could blame her? The little girl barely knew Shana. The kid, a true child of the military, had lived on Whidbey Island in Washington State, then Italy and, following the accident that claimed her father\u2019s life, had been shuffled to San Diego, California. They\u2019d just settled into their Navy housing, and now they were about to leave that. In her nine years Jazmine had been moved from country to country, lost her father, and now her mother was shipping out for six long months. If that wasn\u2019t enough, the poor kid was being foisted on Shana. No wonder she wasn\u2019t thrilled.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Shana murmured, doing her best to sound positive. She didn\u2019t know who she was kidding. Certainly not her sister\u2014and not herself, either. This was going to be another in a long line of recent disasters, or life-changing events, as she preferred to call them.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s true you and Brad split up?\u201d Ali asked with a degree of delicacy. She\u2019d obviously been warned against bringing up his name.</p> <p>\u201cBrad?\u201d Shana repeated as if she had no idea who her sister was talking about. \u201cOh, you mean Brad Moore. Yes, it\u2019s over. We were finished quite a while ago, but either he forgot to tell me or I just wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Ali said.</p><p>The last thing Shana wanted was Ali\u2019s sympathy. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve rebounded. Everything\u2019s great. My life is fabulous, or it will be in short order. I\u2019ve got everything under control.\u201d Shana said all of this without taking a breath. If she said it often enough, she might actually start to believe it.</p><p>\u201cWhen Mom told me that you\u2019d decided to leave Portland and move to Seattle, I thought it was job-related at first. You never said a word.\u201d She paused. \u201cDid you move all those plants, too? You must have about a thousand.\u201d</p><p>Shana laughed. \u201cHardly. But yes, I did. Moving was...a spontaneous decision.\u201d That was putting it mildly. One weekend Shana had driven to Seattle to get away and to consider her relationship with Brad. She\u2019d finally realized that it wasn\u2019t going anywhere. For five years they\u2019d been talking marriage. Wrong. She\u2019d been talking marriage. Brad had managed to string her along with just enough interest to placate her. And she\u2019d let him until...</p><p>Unexpectedly, Shana had stumbled on Brad having lunch with a business associate. This so-called associate just happened to be a willowy blonde with a figure that would stop a freight train. It was a business lunch, he\u2019d claimed later, when Shana confronted him.</p><p>Yeah, sure\u2014monkey business. Shana could be dense at times but she wasn\u2019t blind, and she recognized this so-called associate as someone Brad had once introduced as Sylvia, an old flame. Apparently those embers were still very much alive and growing hotter by the minute, because as Shana watched, they\u2019d exchanged a lengthy kiss in the parking lot and drove off together. She was embarrassed to admit she\u2019d followed them. It didn\u2019t take her long to see where they were headed. Brad\u2019s town house\u2014and she didn\u2019t think they were there to discuss contracts or fire codes.</p><p>Even when confronted, Brad insisted his lunch date was a client. Any resemblance his associate had to Sylvia was purely coincidental. The more he defended himself, the more defensive he got, complaining that Shana was acting like a jealous shrew. He\u2019d been outraged that she\u2019d question his faithfulness when she was the one so often away, working as a sales rep for a large pharmaceutical company. He\u2019d been so convincing that\u2014just for a moment\u2014she\u2019d wondered if she might\u2019ve been wrong. Only when she mentioned that she\u2019d followed them to his town house did Brad show any hint of guilt or regret.</p><p>He\u2019d glanced away then, and the righteous indignation had been replaced by a look of such sadness she had to resist the urge to comfort him. He was sorry, he\u2019d said, so sorry. It had been a fling; it meant nothing. He couldn\u2019t lose her. Shana was his life, the woman he intended to marry, the mother of his unborn children.</p><p>For a few days, he\u2019d actually swayed her. Needing to sort out her feelings, Shana had driven to Seattle the next weekend. After five years with Brad she felt she knew him, but it now seemed quite clear that she didn\u2019t. He wanted her back, he told her over and over. He was willing to do whatever it took to reconcile, to make this up to her. He suggested counseling, agreed to therapy, anything but losing her.</p><p>That weekend, Shana had engaged in some painful self-examination. She desperately wanted to believe the afternoon rendezvous with Sylvia was a onetime thing, but her head told her it wasn\u2019t and that they\u2019d been involved for months\u2014or more.</p><p>It was while she sat in Lincoln Park in West Seattle, analyzing the last five years, that she concluded there was no going back. Her trust had been destroyed. She couldn\u2019t build a life with Brad after this. In truth, their relationship had dead-ended three years ago. Maybe sooner; she could no longer tell. What Shana did recognize was that she\u2019d been so caught up in loving Brad that she\u2019d refused to see the signs.</p><p>\u201cI was feeling pretty miserable,\u201d Shana admitted to her sister. Wretched was a more accurate description, but she didn\u2019t want to sound melodramatic. \u201cI sat in that park in West Seattle, thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn West Seattle? How\u2019d you get there?\u201d</p><p>Shana sighed loudly. \u201cI took a wrong turn when I was trying to find the freeway.\u201d</p><p>Ali laughed. \u201cI should have guessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ended up on this bridge and there wasn\u2019t anyplace to turn around, so I followed the road, which led to a wonderful waterfront park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ice-cream parlor\u2019s in the park?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s across the street. You know me and maple-nut ice cream. It\u2019s the ultimate comfort food.\u201d She tried to make a joke of it, but at the time she\u2019d felt there wasn\u2019t enough maple-nut ice cream in the world to see her through this misery.</p><p>\u201cBrad drove you to maple nut?\u201d</p><p>Shana snickered at Ali\u2019s exaggerated horror. After her decision to break off the relationship, she\u2019d grown angry. Okay, furious. She wanted out of this relationship, completely out, and living in the same city made that difficult.</p><p>\u201cActually, West Seattle is a charming little community. The ice-cream parlor had a For Sale sign in the window and I got to talking to the owners. They\u2019re an older couple, sweet as can be and planning to retire. As I sat there, I thought it must be a nice place to work. How could anyone be unhappy surrounded by ice cream and pizza?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you bought it? Shana, for heaven\u2019s sake, what do you know about running any kind of restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve worked in sales and with people all these years. I was ready for a break, and this seemed practically fated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could you afford to buy an established business?\u201d</p><p>Shana had an answer for that, too. \u201cI had a chunk of cash in savings.\u201d The money had originally been set aside for her wedding. Saving a hundred dollars a month and investing it carefully, she\u2019d managed to double her money. Just then, she couldn\u2019t think of a better way to spend it. Buying this business was impulsive and irrational but despite everything, it felt...right.</p> <p>That Sunday in the park she\u2019d admitted there would be no wedding, no honeymoon with Brad. Shana drew in her breath. She refused to think about it anymore. She\u2019d entered a new phase of her life.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cute place. You\u2019ll like it,\u201d she murmured. She had lots of ideas for fixing it up, making it hers. The Olsens had promised to help transfer ownership as seamlessly as possible.</p><p>\u201cYou rented a house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat very same Sunday.\u201d Once she\u2019d made her decision, Shana had been on a mission and there was no stopping her. As luck would have it, there was a house two streets over that had just been vacated. The owner had recently painted it and installed new carpeting. Shana had taken one look around the 1950s-style bungalow with its small front porch and brick fireplace and declared it perfect. She\u2019d given the rental agent a check immediately. Then she drove home, wrote a letter resigning her job\u2014and phoned Brad. That conversation had been short, sweet and utterly satisfying.</p><p>\u201cMaking a move like this couldn\u2019t have been easy,\u201d Ali commiserated.</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how easy it was,\u201d Shana said gleefully. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re curious about what Brad had to say.\u201d She was dying to tell her.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called him,\u201d Shana said without waiting for Ali to respond, \u201cand naturally he wanted to know where I\u2019d been all weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told him?\u201d</p><p>Shana grinned. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get a word in edgewise. He was pretty upset. He told me how worried he was, and how he\u2019d spent the entire weekend calling me. He was afraid of what I might\u2019ve done. As if I\u2019d do something lethal over him,\u201d she scoffed. Shana suspected that his concern was all for show, but none of that mattered now. \u201cWhen he cooled down, I calmly explained that I\u2019d gone for a drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA three-day drive,\u201d Ali inserted.</p> <p>\u201cRight. Well, he got huffy, saying the least I could\u2019ve done was let him know I\u2019d made plans.\u201d What came next was the best part. \u201cSo I told him I\u2019d made plans for the rest of my life and they didn\u2019t include him.\u201d</p><p>Ali giggled and it sounded exactly the way it had when they were girls, sharing a bedroom. \u201cWhat did he say then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I hung up and started packing stuff in my apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he try to phone you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for the first couple of days. He e-mailed me on the third day and I immediately put a block on his name.\u201d That must have infuriated him\u2014not that Shana cared. Well, she did, a little. Okay, more than a little. Unfortunately she didn\u2019t have the satisfaction of knowing what his reaction had been. In the past, she\u2019d always been the one who patched any rift. That was her problem; she couldn\u2019t stand conflict, so she\u2019d done all the compromising and conciliating. Over the course of their relationship, Brad had come to expect her to make the first move. Well, no longer. She was finished. Brad Moore was history.</p><p>Instead of kicking herself for taking so long to see the light, she was moving ahead, starting over...and, to be on the safe side, giving up on men and relationships. At twenty-eight, she\u2019d had her fill. Men weren\u2019t worth the effort and the grief.</p><p>\u201cI never was that fond of Brad,\u201d Ali confessed.</p><p>\u201cYou might\u2019ve said something.\u201d Shana realized her tone was a little annoyed. In the five years she\u2019d dated Brad, there\u2019d certainly been opportunities for Ali to share her opinion.</p> <p>\u201cHow could I? We just met once, and you seemed so keen on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d stayed in one place longer, we might\u2019ve gotten together more often.\u201d</p><p>Ali\u2019s sigh drifted over the phone. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re in the Navy. They own your life. Now honestly, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Shana paused to consider the question. A second later, she gave Ali her answer. \u201cHonestly? I feel great, and that\u2019s the truth. Yes, this breakup hurt, but mostly I was angry with myself for not waking up sooner. I feel fabulous. It\u2019s as if I\u2019ve been released from a spell. I\u2019ve got a whole new attitude toward men.\u201d</p><p>Her sister didn\u2019t say anything for a moment. \u201cYou might think you\u2019re fine, but there\u2019s a chance you\u2019re not totally over Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Again her sister hesitated. \u201cI remember what it was like after Peter died. The shock and grief were overwhelming at first. I walked around in a fog for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is different,\u201d Shana insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s less...important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is and it isn\u2019t,\u201d Ali fired right back.</p><p>\u201cBut you feel better now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. One day, out of the blue, I discovered I could smile again. I could function. I had to. My daughter needed me. My patients needed me. I\u2019ll always love Peter, though.\u201d Her voice wavered but eventually regained strength.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always love Peter, too,\u201d Shana said, swallowing hard. \u201cHe was one of a kind.\u201d Her brother-in-law had been a loving husband and father, and her heart ached for her sister even now. The situation with Brad didn\u2019t compare.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you my flight information for this weekend,\u201d Ali said, changing the subject.</p><p>Shana had nearly forgotten that she was about to become a substitute mother. \u201cOh, yeah. Let me find a pen.\u201d Scrabbling through her purse, she dug one up and found a crumpled receipt she\u2019d stuffed in there. Good\u2014she could write on the back.</p><p>She was looking forward to some time with her sister. They saw each other so rarely, thanks to Ali\u2019s career. This upcoming visit would be a brief one, but Shana hadn\u2019t seen Ali\u2014and Jazmine\u2014since the funeral.</p><p>\u201cYou and Jazmine will do just fine,\u201d Ali said warmly. \u201cJazmine\u2019s a great kid, but be warned. She\u2019s nine going on sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s an only child, she\u2019s rather...precocious. For instance, she\u2019s reading at ninth-grade level. And the music she likes is sort of\u2014well, you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for warning me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure this\u2019ll be easy for you.\u201d</p><p>Shana had her doubts. \u201cIf I remember correctly, that was what you told me when I asked if I could fly off the top bunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I know? I was only six,\u201d Ali reminded her. \u201cYou\u2019ve never forgiven me for that, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still remember how much it hurt to have the wind knocked out of me.\u201d It felt the same way now. Despite the assurances she so freely handed out, Shana was still struggling to recover her equilibrium\u2014to reinvent her life on new terms. No Brad, no steady paycheck, no familiar Portland neighborhood. Now, her niece was about to complicate the situation. The next six months should be very interesting, she thought. Very interesting indeed.</p><p>She vaguely recalled an old Chinese saying, something about living in interesting times. Unfortunately, she also recalled that it was intended as a curse, not a blessing.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Alison Karas couldn\u2019t help being concerned about leaving her nine-year-old daughter with her sister, Shana. This wasn\u2019t a good time in Jazmine\u2019s life, nor was it particularly opportune for Shana. Her sister sounded strong and confident, but Ali suspected otherwise. Despite Shana\u2019s reassurances, she\u2019d been badly shaken by her breakup with Brad, even though she\u2019d initiated it. Jazmine hadn\u2019t taken the news of this deployment well, and was reluctant to leave her newfound friends behind and move to Seattle.</p><p>But Ali really had no other option. Ideally, Jazmine would go to either set of grandparents, but in this case that wouldn\u2019t work. After the sudden loss of her father ten years earlier, her mother hadn\u2019t done well. She\u2019d never recovered emotionally and was incapable of dealing with the demands of a young girl. Peter had been an only child and his parents had divorced when he was young. Both had gone on to other marriages and other children. Neither set of paternal grandparents had shown any great interest in Jazmine.</p><p>Jazmine wandered into Ali\u2019s room just then and flopped down on the bed with all the enthusiasm of a slug.</p><p>\u201cAre you packed?\u201d Ali asked, her own suitcase open on the opposite end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d her daughter muttered. \u201cThis whole move is crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJazmine, watch your mouth!\u201d Ali refused to get into an argument with a nine-year-old. The truth was, she\u2019d rather not ship out, either, but for Jazmine\u2019s sake she put on a good front. This was the most difficult aspect of her life in the Navy. She was a widow and a mother, but she was also a Navy nurse, and her responsibilities in that regard were unavoidable. That was made abundantly clear the day she accepted her commission. When the Navy called, she answered. In fact, she wouldn\u2019t have minded six months at sea except for her daughter.</p><p>\u201cUncle Adam lives in the Seattle area,\u201d Ali reminded her. She\u2019d been saving that tidbit, hoping the news would make her daughter feel more positive about this most recent upheaval in their lives.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Everett,\u201d Jazmine said, her voice apathetic.</p><p>\u201cI understand that\u2019s only thirty or forty minutes from Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter revealed her first spark of interest since they\u2019d learned of the transfer. \u201cDoes he know we\u2019re coming?\u201d She sat upright, eager now.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Busy as she\u2019d been, Ali hadn\u2019t told Adam Kennedy\u2014her husband\u2019s best friend and Jazz\u2019s godfather\u2014that Jazmine would soon be living in Seattle.</p><p>\u201cThen we have to tell him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will, all in due course,\u201d Ali assured her.</p><p>\u201cDo it now.\u201d Her daughter leaped off the bed, sprinted into the living room and came back with the portable phone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have his number.\u201d Ali hadn\u2019t been thinking clearly; their phone directory had already been packed away and she simply didn\u2019t have time to search for it.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Once more her daughter made a mad dash out of the bedroom, returning a moment later. Breathless, Jazmine handed Ali a tidy slip of paper.</p><p>Ali unfolded it curiously and saw a phone number written by an adult hand.</p><p>\u201cUncle Adam sent it to me,\u201d Jazmine explained. \u201cHe told me I could call him whenever I needed to talk. He said it didn\u2019t matter what time of day or night I phoned, so call him, Mom. This is important.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ali resisted the urge to find out if her daughter had taken advantage of Adam\u2019s offer before now and decided she probably had. For Jazmine, it was as if the sun rose and set on Peter\u2019s friend. Lieutenant Commander Adam Kennedy had been a support to both of them since the accident that had abruptly taken Peter out of their lives.</p><p>It sounded so cut and dried to say a computer had malfunctioned aboard Peter\u2019s F/A-18. He hadn\u2019t had a chance to recover before the jet slammed into the ground. He\u2019d died instantly, his life snuffed out in mere seconds. That was two years ago now, two very long years, and every day since, Peter had been with her. Her first thought was always of him and his image was the last one her mind released before she went to sleep at night. He was part of her. She saw him in Jazmine\u2019s smile, in the three little lines that formed between the girl\u2019s eyebrows when she frowned. Peter had done that, too. And their eyes were the exact same shade of brownish green.</p><p>As an SMO, or senior medical officer, Ali was familiar with death. What she didn\u2019t know was how to deal with the aftermath of it. She still struggled and, as a result, she understood her sister\u2019s pain. Yes, Shana\u2019s breakup with Brad was different, and of a lesser magnitude, but it was a loss. In ending her relationship with him, Shana was also giving up a dream, one she\u2019d held and cherished for five years. She was adjusting to a new version of her life and her future. Shana had flippantly dismissed any doubts or regrets about the breakup. Those would come later, like a sneak attack\u2014probably when Shana least expected it. They had with Ali.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Jazmine cried, exasperated. \u201cDial!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Ali murmured, punching out the number. An answering machine came on almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t there?\u201d Jazmine asked, studying her. She didn\u2019t hide her disappointment. It was doom and gloom all over again as she threw herself backward onto the bed, arms spread-eagled.</p><p>Ali left a message and asked him to get in touch.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you think he\u2019ll call?\u201d Jazmine demanded impatiently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll make sure we get a chance to see him if it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s possible,\u201d Jazmine argued. \u201cHe\u2019ll want to see me. And you, too.\u201d</p><p>Ali shrugged. \u201cHe might not be back by the time I need to fly out, but you\u2019ll see him, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine wouldn\u2019t look at her. Instead she stared morosely at the ceiling, as if she didn\u2019t have a friend in the world. The kid had moved any number of times and had always been a good sport about it, until now. Ali didn\u2019t blame her for being upset, but there wasn\u2019t anything she could do to change her orders.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love living with your aunt Shana,\u201d Alison said, trying a new tactic. \u201cDid I tell you she has an ice-cream parlor? How much fun is that?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cI don\u2019t really know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will be your opportunity to bond.\u201d</p> <p>Jazmine sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bond with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will eventually,\u201d Ali said with forced brightness. Jazmine wasn\u2019t fooled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not glue, you know.\u201d</p><p>Alison held back a smile. \u201cWe both need to make the best of this, Jazz. I don\u2019t want to leave you any more than you want me to go.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter scrambled to a sitting position. As her shoulders slumped, she nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour aunt Shana loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYippee, skippy.\u201d</p><p>Alison tried again. \u201cThe ice-cream parlor is directly across the street from the park.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYippee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJazmine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d</p><p>Ali wrapped one arm around the girl\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThe months will fly by. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine shook her head. \u201cNo, they won\u2019t,\u201d she said adamantly, \u201cand I have to change schools again. I hate that.\u201d</p><p>Changing schools, especially this late in the year, would be difficult. In a few weeks, depending on the Seattle schedule, classes would be dismissed for the summer. Ali kissed the top of Jazmine\u2019s head and closed her eyes. She had the distinct feeling her daughter was right. The next six months wouldn\u2019t fly, they\u2019d crawl. For all three of them...</p><p>Shana wanted children, someday, when the time was right. But she\u2019d assumed she\u2019d take on the role of motherhood the way everyone else did. She\u2019d start with an infant and sort of grow into it\u2014ease into being a parent gradually, learning as she went. Instead, she was about to get a crash course. She wondered if there were manuals to help with this kind of situation.</p><p>Pacing her living room, she paused long enough to check out the spare bedroom one last time. She\u2019d added some welcoming touches for Jazmine\u2019s benefit and hoped the stuffed teddy bear would appeal to her niece. Girls of any age liked stuffed animals, didn\u2019t they? The bedspread, a fetching shade of pink with big white daisies, was new, as was the matching pink throw rug. She just hoped Jazmine would recognize that she was trying to make this work.</p><p>She wanted Jazmine to know she was willing to make an effort if the girl would meet her halfway. Still, Shana didn\u2019t have a good feeling about it.</p><p>Her suspicions proved correct. When Ali arrived, it was immediately apparent that Jazmine wanted nothing to do with her aunt Shana. The nine-year-old was dressed in faded green fatigues and a camouflage army-green T-shirt. She sat on the sofa with a sullen look that discouraged conversation. Her long dark hair fell across her face. When she wasn\u2019t glaring at Shana, she stared at the carpet as if inspecting it for loose fibers.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how good it is to see you,\u201d Ali told Shana, turning to her daughter, obviously expecting Jazmine to echo the sentiment. The girl didn\u2019t.</p><p>Shana moved into the kitchen, hoping for a private word with her sister. They hadn\u2019t always been close. All through high school, they\u2019d competed with each other. Ali had been the more academic of the two, while Shana had excelled in sports. From their father, a family physician, they\u2019d both inherited a love of science and medicine. He\u2019d died suddenly of a heart attack when Shana was twenty.</p><p>Within months, their lives were turned upside down. Their mother fell to pieces but by that time, Ali was in the Navy. Luckily, Shana was able to stay close to home and look after their mom, handle the legal paperwork and deal with the insurance, retirement funds and other responsibilities. Shana had attended college classes part-time and kept the household going. At twenty-two, she was hired by one of the up-and-coming pharmaceutical companies as a sales rep. The job suited her. Having spent a good part of her life around medical professionals, she was comfortable in that atmosphere. She was friendly and personable, well-liked by clients and colleagues. Within a few years, she\u2019d risen to top sales representative in her division. The company had been sorry to see her go and had offered an impressive bonus to persuade her to stay. But Shana was ready for a change, in more ways than one.</p><p>The last time the sisters had been together was at Peter\u2019s funeral. Shortly afterward, Ali had returned to Italy. Although she could have taken an assignment back in the States, Ali chose to finish her tour in Europe. As much as possible, she\u2019d told Shana, she wanted Jazmine to remain in a familiar environment. A few months ago, she\u2019d been transferred to San Diego, but no one had expected her to be stationed aboard the Woodrow Wilson, the newest and largest of the Navy\u2019s aircraft carriers. According to her sister, this was a once-in-a-career assignment. Maybe, but in Shana\u2019s opinion, the Navy had a lousy sense of timing.</p><p>\u201cJazmine doesn\u2019t seem happy about being here,\u201d Shana commented when they were out of earshot. She understood how the girl felt. The poor kid had enough turmoil in her life without having her mother disappear for six months.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Ali cast an anxious glance toward the living room as Shana took three sodas from the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cSure she will,\u201d Shana agreed, \u201cbut will I?\u201d</p><p>Ali bit her lower lip and looked guilty. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. These next six months will give Jazmine and me a chance to know each other,\u201d Shana announced, stepping into the living room and offering Jazmine a soda. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>The girl stared at the can as if it held nerve gas. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live with you.\u201d</p><p>Well, surprise, surprise. Shana would never have guessed that.</p><p>\u201cJazmine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shana said, stopping her sister from chastising the girl. \u201cWe should be honest with one another.\u201d She put down Jazmine\u2019s drink and sat on the opposite end of the sofa, dangling her own pop can in both hands. \u201cThis is going to be an experience for me, too. I haven\u2019t been around kids your age all that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d Jazmine frowned at the open door to her bedroom. \u201cI hate pink.\u201d</p><p>Shana had been afraid of that. \u201cWe can take it back and exchange it for something you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get it? Barbies R Us?\u201d</p><p>Shana laughed; the kid was witty. \u201cClose, but we can check out the Army surplus store if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>This comment warranted a half smile from Jazmine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll manage,\u201d Shana said with what she hoped sounded like confidence. \u201cI realize I\u2019ve got a lot to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJazmine,\u201d Ali snapped in frustration, \u201cthe least you can do is try. Give your aunt credit for making an effort. You can do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am trying,\u201d the girl snapped in return. \u201cA pink bedroom and a teddy bear? Oh, puleeeze! She\u2019s treating me like I\u2019m in kindergarten instead of fourth grade.\u201d</p><p>Shana had barely started this new venture and already she\u2019d failed miserably. \u201cWe can exchange the bear, too,\u201d she suggested. \u201cArmy surplus again?\u201d</p><p>Her second attempt at being accommodating was less appreciated than the first. This time Jazmine didn\u2019t even crack a smile.</p><p>Ali sat in the space between Shana and Jazmine and threw her arms over their shoulders. \u201cIf I\u2019ve learned anything in the last few years, it\u2019s that women have to stick together. I can\u2019t be with you, Jazz. That\u2019s all there is to it. I\u2019m sorry, I wish things were different, but they aren\u2019t. If you want, at the end of this deployment, I\u2019ll resign my commission.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine\u2019s head rose abruptly. \u201cYou\u2019d leave the Navy?\u201d</p><p>Ali nodded. This was as much a surprise to Shana as it was to her niece. From all indications, Ali loved military life and had fit into it with comfort and ease.</p><p>\u201cNow that your dad\u2019s gone, my life isn\u2019t the same anymore,\u201d Ali continued. \u201cI\u2019m your mother and you\u2019re far more important to me than any career, Navy or not. I won\u2019t leave you again, Jazmine, and that\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>At those words the girl burst into tears. Embarrassed, she hid her face in both hands, her shoulders shaking as Ali hugged her.</p><p>Ali seemed to be trying not to weep, but Shana had no such compunction. Tears slipped down her cheeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It would be so good to have her sister back again. If she had any say in the matter, Ali would move to Seattle so the two of them could be closer.</p><p>\u201cIf you get out of the Navy, does that mean you\u2019ll marry Uncle Adam?\u201d Jazmine asked with the excitement of a kid who\u2019s just learned she\u2019s about to receive the best gift of her life.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Uncle Adam?\u201d Did this mean her sister had managed to find two husbands while Shana had yet to find one? Ah, the old competitive urge was back in full swing.</p><p>\u201cHe was one of my dad\u2019s best friends,\u201d Jazmine supplied with more enthusiasm than she\u2019d shown since she\u2019d arrived. \u201cHe\u2019s cute and funny and I think Mom should marry him.\u201d</p> <p>Raising one brow, Shana turned to her sister for an explanation. Ali had never mentioned anyone named Adam.</p><p>\u201cUncle Adam is stationed in Everett. That\u2019s close to here, right?\u201d Jazmine demanded, looking to Shana for the answer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a drive.\u201d She wasn\u2019t entirely sure, never having made the trip north of Seattle herself. \u201cLess than an hour, I\u2019d guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Adam will want to visit once he learns I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he will,\u201d Ali murmured, pressing her daughter\u2019s head against her shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cYou like this guy?\u201d Shana asked her. Ali was decidedly closemouthed about him, which implied that she had some feelings for this friend of Peter\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cOf course Mom likes him,\u201d Jazmine said when her mother didn\u2019t respond. \u201cSo do I. He\u2019s totally fabulous.\u201d</p><p>Ali met Shana\u2019s gaze and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnother pilot?\u201d Shana murmured.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s a Supply Officer. You\u2019ll like him,\u201d her sister was quick to say, as if this man might interest her romantically. No way. Shana had sworn off men and she was serious about that.</p><p>\u201cHe said I can talk to him anytime I want,\u201d Jazmine went on. \u201cI can phone him, can\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you can.\u201d Shana was more curious than ever about this man her sister didn\u2019t want to discuss.</p><p>Shana turned to gaze at Ali, silently pleading for more information. Her sister ignored her, which was infuriating. Clearly, Adam had already won over her niece; he must be the kind of guy who shopped at the army surplus store.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>First thing Monday morning, Shana drove Jazmine to Lewis and Clark Elementary School to enroll her. Shana had to admit her stomach was in knots. The school yard was jammed with kids, and a string of vehicles queued in front, taking turns dropping off students. Big yellow school buses belched out diesel fumes as they lumbered toward the parking lot behind the building.</p><p>Shana was fortunate to find an empty parking space. She accompanied Jazmine into the building, although the girl walked ahead of her\u2014just far enough to suggest the two of them weren\u2019t together.</p><p>The noise level inside the school reminded her of a rock concert and Shana felt the beginnings of a headache. Or maybe it was caused by all those students gathered in one place, staring at Jazmine and her.</p><p>The school bell rang and like magic, the halls emptied. Within seconds everyone disappeared behind various doors and silence descended. Ah, the power of a bell. It was as if she were Moses, and the Red Sea had parted so she could find her way to the Promised Land, or in this case, The Office.</p><p>Wordlessly Shana and Jazmine followed the signs to the principal\u2019s domain. Jazmine was outwardly calm. She gave no sign of being ill at ease. Unlike Shana, who was on the verge of chewing off every fingernail she owned.</p> <p>\u201cThis is no big deal,\u201d Jazmine assured her, shifting the backpack she carried. It was the size one might take on a trek through the Himalayas. \u201cI\u2019ve done this plenty of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel good just leaving you here.\u201d They\u2019d had all of one day together and while it was uncomfortable for them both, it hadn\u2019t been nearly as bad as Shana had feared. It hadn\u2019t been good, either.</p><p>When they took Ali to the airport, Shana had been the one in tears. Mother and daughter had hugged for an extra-long moment and then Ali was gone. It was Shana who did all the talking on the drive home. As soon as they were back at the rental house, Jazmine disappeared inside her bedroom and didn\u2019t open the door for hours.</p><p>Dinner had been a series of attempts on Shana\u2019s part to start a conversation, but her questions were met with either a grunt or a one-word reply. Shana got the message. After the first ten minutes, she said nothing. And nothing was what Jazmine seemed to appreciate most. They maintained an awkward silence and at the end of the meal, Jazmine delivered her plate to the kitchen, rinsed it off, stuck it in the dishwasher and returned to her room. The door closed and Shana hadn\u2019t seen her again until this morning. Apparently kids this age treasured their privacy. Point taken. Lesson learned.</p><p>\u201cThis must be it,\u201d Shana said, pointing at the door marked Office.</p><p>Jazmine murmured something unintelligible, shrugging off the backpack and letting the straps slip down her arms. Shana couldn\u2019t imagine what she had in that monstrosity, but apparently it was as valuable to the child as Shana\u2019s purse was to her.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking you might want to wait a bit, you know,\u201d Shana suggested, stammering, unable to identify her misgivings. \u201cNot do this right away, I mean.\u201d The students she saw in the hallway didn\u2019t look particularly friendly. Jazmine was only nine, for heaven\u2019s sake, and her mother was headed out to sea for half a year. Maybe she should homeschool her. Shana considered that option for all of half a second. First, it wouldn\u2019t be home school; it would be ice-cream parlor school. The authorities would love that. And second, Shana was completely unqualified to teach her anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Jazmine said just loudly enough for Shana to hear.</p><p>Maybe so, but Shana wasn\u2019t completely convinced she would be. This guardianship thing was even harder than it sounded. The thought of leaving her niece here actually made her feel ill.</p><p>Jazmine\u2019s eyes narrowed accusingly. \u201cI\u2019m not a kid, you know.\u201d</p><p>So nine-year-olds weren\u2019t kids anymore? Could\u2019ve fooled Shana, but rather than argue, she let the comment slide.</p><p>Enrolling Jazmine turned out to be surprisingly easy. After Shana completed a couple of forms and handed over a copy of her guardianship papers, it was done. Jazmine was led out of the office and into a classroom. Shana watched her go, forcing herself not to follow like a much-loved golden retriever.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your first time as a guardian?\u201d the school secretary asked.</p><p>Shana nodded. \u201cJazmine\u2019s been through a lot.\u201d She resisted the urge to mention Peter\u2019s death and the fact that Ali was out at sea. Instinctively she realized that the less anyone knew about these things, the better for Jazmine.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll fit right in,\u201d the secretary assured her.</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d But Shana wasn\u2019t sure that was true. There were only a few weeks left of the school year. Just when Jazmine had managed to adjust, it would be time for summer break. And what would Shana do with her then? It was a question she couldn\u2019t answer. Not yet, anyway.</p><p>With reluctance she walked back to her parked car and drove to Olsen\u2019s Ice Cream and Pizza Parlor. She\u2019d thought about changing the name, but the restaurant had been called this for the last thirty years. A new name might actually be a disadvantage, so she\u2019d decided to keep everything the same for now.</p><p>Shana\u2019s day went smoothly after her visit to the school. She was on her own now, her training with the Olsens finished. They insisted the secret to their pizza was the tomato sauce, made from their special recipe. That recipe had been kept secret for over thirty years. Only when the final papers had been signed was Shana allowed to have the recipe, which to her untrained eye looked fairly unspectacular. She was almost sure her mother used to make something similar for spaghetti and had gotten the recipe out of a \u201cDear Abby\u201d column years ago.</p><p>There was a huge mixing machine and, following the Olsens\u2019 example, she went into the shop each morning to mix up a batch of dough and let it rise. Once the dough had risen, it was put in the refrigerator, awaiting the day\u2019s pizza orders. The restaurant opened at eleven and did a brisk lunch trade. How much or how little dough to make was complete guesswork. Shana\u2019s biggest fear was that she\u2019d run short. As a consequence she usually mixed too much. But she was learning.</p><p>At three o\u2019clock, Shana found herself watching for the school bus. Jazmine was to be dropped off in front of the ice-cream parlor. From noon on, she\u2019d constantly checked the time, wondering and worrying about her niece. The elementary students she\u2019d seen looked like a rough crowd\u2014okay, maybe not the first-and second-graders, but the ones in the fifth and sixth grades, who were giants compared to Jazmine. Shana just hoped the girl could hold her own.</p><p>Business was constant\u2014people waiting to catch ferries, high-school students, retired folk, tourists. Shana planned to hire a part-time employee soon. Another idea she had was to introduce soup to the menu. She\u2019d already experimented with a number of mixes, both liquid and dry, and hadn\u2019t found anything that impressed her. Shana was leaning toward making her own from scratch but her experience in cooking large batches was limited.</p><p>A bus rolled into view and Shana instantly went on alert. Sure enough, Jazmine stepped off, wearing a frown, and marched inside. Without a word to Shana, she slid into a booth.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Shana said, unable to disguise her anxiety, \u201chow was it?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her niece wasn\u2019t exactly forthcoming with details. Thinking fast, Shana asked the questions her mother had bombarded her with every day after school. \u201cWhat did you learn? Anything interesting?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDid you make any new friends?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine scowled up at her. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>That was said emphatically enough for Shana to surmise that things hadn\u2019t gone well. \u201cI see.\u201d Glancing over her shoulder, Shana sighed. \u201cAre you hungry? I could make you a pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>The bell above the door rang and a customer entered, moving directly to the ice-cream case. Shana slipped behind the counter and waited patiently until the woman had made her selection. As she scooped chocolate chip\u2013mint ice cream into a waffle cone, she realized something was different about Jazmine. Not until her customer left did she figure out what it was.</p><p>\u201cJazz,\u201d she said, startled, \u201cwhere\u2019s your backpack?\u201d</p><p>Her niece didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cDid you forget it at school? We could run by to pick it up if you want.\u201d Not until the parlor closed at six, but she didn\u2019t mention that. During the summer it wouldn\u2019t be until eight o\u2019clock; she didn\u2019t mention that, either.</p><p>Jazmine scowled even more ferociously.</p><p>Shana hadn\u2019t known how much fury a nine-year-old girl\u2019s eyes could convey. Her niece\u2019s anger seemed to be focused solely on Shana. The unfairness of it struck her, but any attempt at conversation was instantly blocked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was obvious that someone had taken the backpack from Jazmine. No wonder the girl wasn\u2019t in a happy frame of mind.</p><p>Feeling wretched and helpless, Shana slid into the booth across from her niece. She didn\u2019t say anything for several minutes, then gently squeezed Jazmine\u2019s hand. \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine shrugged as if it was no big thing, but it was and Shana felt at a loss. Without her niece\u2019s knowing, she\u2019d speak to the principal in the morning and see what could be done. She guessed it\u2019d happened on the bus or off school grounds.</p><p>\u201cCan I use your phone?\u201d Jazmine asked.</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine\u2019s eyes fleetingly met hers as she pulled a piece of paper from her hip pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s long distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not calling Paris, are you?\u201d</p><p>The question evoked an almost-smile. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d Shana gestured toward the phone on the back wall in the kitchen.</p> <p>Jazmine thanked her with a faint smile. This counted as profuse appreciation and Shana was nearly overwhelmed by gratitude. Despite their shaky beginning she was starting to reach this kid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m phoning my uncle Adam,\u201d Jazmine announced. \u201cHe\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d</p><p>This uncle Adam seemed to have all the answers. She hadn\u2019t even met him and already she didn\u2019t like him. No one could be that perfect.</p><p>On Monday afternoon, Adam Kennedy opened the door to his apartment near Everett Naval Station, glad to be home. He\u2019d just been released from the naval hospital, where he\u2019d recently undergone rotator cuff surgery. His shoulder throbbed and he felt so light-headed he had to brace his hand against the wall in order to steady himself. He\u2019d be fine in a couple of days, but at the moment he was still shaky.</p><p>The apartment was dark with the drapes pulled, but he didn\u2019t have the energy to walk across the room and open them.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be like this if he had a wife, who\u2019d be able to look after him while he felt so weak. This wasn\u2019t the first time that thought had occurred to Adam. He\u2019d never intended to be a thirty-two-year-old bachelor.</p> <p>Adam sank into his favorite chair and winced at the pain that shot down his arm. Leaning his head back against the cushion, he closed his eyes and envisioned what his life would be like if he was married. A wife would be fussing over him now, acting concerned and looking for ways to make him comfortable. Granted, if comfort was all he wanted, he could pay for it. A wife\u2014well, having a wife meant companionship and sharing things. Like a bed...It also involved that frightening word, love.</p><p>If he was married now, she\u2019d be asking how he felt and bringing him tea and caring about him. The fantasy filled his mind and he found himself smiling. What he needed was the right woman. His track record in that department left a great deal to be desired.</p><p>He\u2019d started out fine. When he graduated from college he\u2019d been engaged, but while he was in Officer Candidate School, Melanie had a sudden change of heart. Actually, she still wanted to get married, just not to him. The tearful scene in which she confessed that she\u2019d fallen in love with someone else wasn\u2019t a memory he wanted to reminisce over, especially now. Suffice it to say, his ego had taken a major beating. In the long run, though, Melanie wasn\u2019t that great a loss. If she had a roving eye this early in their relationship, it didn\u2019t bode well for the lengthy separations a Navy career would demand of their marriage.</p><p>The thing was, Adam wanted children. One of his proudest moments was when Peter had asked him to be Jazmine\u2019s godfather. He took his duties seriously and loved that little girl, and he\u2019d felt especially protective of her since his friend\u2019s death. He hadn\u2019t heard from her in a while and wondered how she was doing after the recent move to San Diego. He\u2019d have to get in touch with her soon.</p><p>Adam had envied Peter his marriage. He\u2019d never seen two people more in love with each other or better suited. They were about as perfect a match as possible. Adam suspected that fact had been a detriment to him in his own quest for a relationship. He kept looking for a woman as well suited to him as Ali had been to his friend. If such a woman existed, Adam hadn\u2019t found her, and he\u2019d about given up. It wasn\u2019t Ali he wanted, but a woman who was his equal in all the ways Ali had been Peter\u2019s. A woman with brains and courage and heart. At this stage he\u2019d take two out of three. Ali had brought out the best in Peter; she\u2019d made a good man better.</p><p>A sense of sadness came over him as he thought about Peter. Adam had a couple of younger brothers, Sam and Doug, and the three of them were close, but Peter and Adam had been even closer. They\u2019d met in OCS, Officer Candidate School, kept in contact afterward and later were stationed together in Italy. During weekend holidays, Peter and Ali had him over for countless dinners. The three of them had sat on their balcony in the Italian countryside drinking wine and talking well into the night. Those were some of the happiest memories of his life.</p><p>Then Peter had been killed. Adam had been a witness to the accident that claimed his best friend\u2019s life. He still had nightmares about it and experienced the same rush of horror, anger, frustration he\u2019d felt at the time. He\u2019d gone with the Casualty Assistance Counseling Officer to tell Ali that her husband was dead. In his heart, he\u2019d promised Peter that he\u2019d look out for both Ali and Jazz but the Navy hadn\u2019t made it easy.</p><p>Ali was currently stationed at the hospital in San Diego and he was in Everett. He phoned at least once a month to check up on them and Jazmine called him every now and then when she needed to talk. He always enjoyed their conversations. Peter would be proud of both the women in his life, he mused. Jazmine was a great kid and Ali was a wonderful mother.</p> <p>Adam noticed the blinking light on his answering machine. He knew there were more messages than he had the patience or endurance to deal with just yet. He\u2019d leave it until morning when he had a fresh supply of energy.</p><p>He sighed. He wasn\u2019t used to feeling like this\u2014despondent and weary. Coming home to an empty apartment underlined a truth he didn\u2019t want to acknowledge. Lieutenant Commander Adam Kennedy was lonely.</p><p>He stared blankly across the room, half toying with the notion of a romantic relationship with Ali. It didn\u2019t take him more than a second to realize it wouldn\u2019t work. He loved Ali\u2014like a sister. Try as he might, he couldn\u2019t seem to view her as a marriage prospect. She was his best friend\u2019s widow, a woman he admired, a woman he thought of as family.</p><p>Yet...he wanted what she\u2019d had, what she and Peter had shared, and the deep contentment their marriage had brought them.</p><p>By morning, he would\u2019ve forgotten all these yearnings, he told himself. He\u2019d lived alone so long now that he should certainly be accustomed to his own company. When he was at sea, it was a different story, since he was constantly surrounded by others. As a Supply Officer he was normally stationed aboard the Benjamin Franklin. Unfortunately the Franklin was currently headed toward the Persian Gulf. Until his shoulder healed, he\u2019d be twiddling his thumbs behind some desk and hating it.</p><p>After a while Adam felt better. His head had stopped spinning and the ache in his shoulder wasn\u2019t quite as intense. It would be easy to close his eyes and sleep but if he slept now, he\u2019d spend the whole night staring at the ceiling.</p><p>A wife.</p><p>It was something to consider. Maybe he should resume his efforts to meet someone, with marriage in mind. The time was right. His parents wanted more grandchildren and he was certainly willing to do his part. According to Ali, he was an excellent candidate for a husband and father. She\u2019d tried any number of times to fix him up, but nothing had ever come of her matchmaking efforts.</p><p>A wife.</p><p>He relaxed and smiled. He was ready. All he needed now was the woman.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Lieutenant Commander Alison Karas had been assigned as senior medical officer aboard the USS Woodrow Wilson. As much as she wanted to be with Jazmine and as difficult as it had been to leave her daughter with Shana, Ali was determined to fulfill her duty to the Navy. During her twelve-year career, she\u2019d never been stationed aboard a ship. Before Jazmine was born, she\u2019d done everything in her limited power to get such an assignment, but it hadn\u2019t happened.</p><p>So far, she\u2019d served in a number of military hospitals. And now, when she least wanted sea duty, that was exactly what she got. Still, she loved the Navy with the same intensity her husband had.</p><p>Her quarters were shared with another woman officer. There hadn\u2019t been time to exchange more than a brief greeting before they\u2019d each begun their respective assignments. The crew was preparing to set out to sea. Within a couple of days, the jets would fly in from Naval air stations all over the country. It was standard procedure for the F-14s to link up with the aircraft carrier.</p><p>Unlikely though it was, she hoped for an opportunity to watch, since the pilots\u2019 precision and skill were so impressive. Pilots were a special breed, as she well knew. Peter had wanted to fly jets from the time he was in grade school, according to his mother.</p><p>She smiled sadly at the thought of her husband. The pain of his loss remained sharp and\u2014as always\u2014Ali hoped he hadn\u2019t suffered. There must have been a moment of sheer terror when he realized he wouldn\u2019t be able to recover. She tried not to think of that.</p><p>Trite as it sounded, she\u2019d learned that life does go on. It hadn\u2019t seemed possible in the beginning, when she\u2019d been blinded by her grief. She was surprised to discover that everything continued as it had before. Classes were held in Jazmine\u2019s school; the radio still played silly love songs. People drove their cars and ate meals and bickered with each other. Ali hadn\u2019t been able to understand how life as she\u2019d once known it could go on as though nothing had changed.</p><p>Jazmine was in good hands. Shana would look after her well. Ali needed to reassure herself of that several times a day. Leaving her daughter had been traumatic, but for Jazmine\u2019s sake, Ali had tried not to let her emotions show. Before she returned to San Diego, they\u2019d talked, and Ali had a heart-to-heart with Shana, too.</p><p>She was still a little worried about Shana, but once they\u2019d had a chance to really discuss the situation, Ali accepted that this impulsive change in her sister\u2019s life was probably the best thing she\u2019d done in years. Shana needed a fresh start. The ice-cream parlor was charming and would undoubtedly be a big success. Jazmine had a bit of an attitude, but that wouldn\u2019t last long. And it helped that Adam was close by. The biggest disappointment of her stay was that they hadn\u2019t been able to reach him. Once he checked his messages, she knew he\u2019d get in touch with Jazmine.</p><p>Ali found her daughter\u2019s suggestion that she marry Adam downright amusing. Ali thought the world of her husband\u2019s best friend, but there was no romantic spark on either side. What was particularly interesting was the fact that Jazmine seemed ready to discuss bringing another man into their lives.</p><p>Despite that, Ali had no intention of remarrying. She hadn\u2019t mentioned that to either her sister or Jazmine because it sounded too melodramatic. And both of them would argue with her. But a man like Peter only came around once in a lifetime, and she wasn\u2019t pressing her luck. If, by chance, she were to consider remarrying, she was determined not to fall in love with a Navy man. She\u2019d already had one Navy husband and she wasn\u2019t going to try for two. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ali had never removed her wedding band. After all these years, that ring represented perhaps the most significant part of her life. And although shipboard romances were strictly prohibited, it was a form of emotional protection, too. As far as her shipmates knew, she was married and that was the impression she wanted to give.</p><p>After spending her shift in the sick bay checking supplies, Ali went to the wardroom, where the officers dined. Two other women officers were in the room but their table was full and they seemed engrossed in conversation. Sitting alone at a corner table, she felt self-conscious, although she rather enjoyed watching the men and women as they chatted. In a few weeks, she\u2019d probably be sitting with one of those groups. Life aboard a carrier was new to her, but eventually it would become familiar and even comfortable.</p><p>Just as she was finishing her dinner, the group that included the other women was joined by Commander Dillon. Ali read his name tag as he walked past her table. He acknowledged her with a stiff nod, which she returned. From the reception he received, it was clear that he was well-liked and respected by his fellow officers. She had no idea what his duty assignment might be.</p><p>Without being obvious\u2014at least she hoped she wasn\u2019t\u2014she studied Dillon. He was tall and lean with dark hair graying at the temples, which led her to believe he must be in his early to midforties. His most striking feature was his intense blue eyes. To her chagrin, she found herself looking at his ring finger and noticed it was bare. Not that it meant anything. Wedding rings were dangerous aboard ship, although she chose to wear hers. More than once Ali had seen fingers severed as a result of a wedding band caught in machinery.</p> <p>As soon as she\u2019d finished her coffee, Ali went back to her work space at the clinic and logged on to the Internet to write Shana and Jazmine a short note. Her sister and daughter would be anxious to hear from her after her first full day at sea.</p><p>Sent: May 19</p><p>From:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>To:</p> <p>[email protected]</p><p>Subject: Hello!</p><p>Dear Shana and Jazmine,</p><p>Just checking in to see how things are going with you two. It\u2019s a little crazy around here and I\u2019m still finding my sea legs. Not to worry, though.</p><p>Hey, Jazz, I was thinking you should help your aunt come up with ideas for ice-cream sundaes. Remember how we invented our own versions last summer? Hot fudge, marshmallow topping and crushed graham crackers? You called it the Give Me More Sundae. Not bad.</p><p>Shana, be sure to look over Jazz\u2019s homework, especially the math. Okay, okay, I\u2019ll stop worrying. Send me an e-mail now and then, okay? I\u2019m waiting with bated breath to hear how you two are surviving.</p> <p>Love ya.</p><p>Ali (That\u2019s Mom to you, Jazz!)</p><p>It wasn\u2019t much of a message, but Ali was tired and ready to turn in for the night. As she started back to her quarters, she met Commander Dillon in the long narrow passageway. She nodded and stepped aside in order to allow him to pass.</p><p>He paused as he read her badge. \u201cKaras?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt ease.\u201d He glanced down at her left hand. \u201cYour husband is Navy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d She looked self-consciously at her wedding ring. \u201cHe\u2014\u201d She\u2019d begun to explain that she was a widow, then stopped abruptly. Rather than make eye contact, she stared into the bulkhead.</p><p>\u201cThis is your first time aboard the Woodrow Wilson?\u201d The question was casual, conversational in tone.</p> <p>She nodded again. \u201cThis is my first time on any ship. I\u2019m wondering how long it\u2019s going to take before I get used to it.\u201d She laughed as she said this, because being on an aircraft carrier was so much like being in a building. Every now and then, Ali had to remind herself that she was actually aboard a ship.</p><p>Commander Dillon\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly as he smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I will. Thank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>That very moment, an alarm rang for a fire drill. All sailors were to report immediately to their assigned stations. A sailor rushed past Ali and jolted her. In an effort to get out of his way, she tripped and fell hard against Commander Dillon, startling them both. The commander stumbled backward but caught himself. Instinctively he reached out and grabbed her shoulders, catching her before she lost her balance and toppled sideways. Stunned, they immediately grew still.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she mumbled, shocked at the instant physical reaction she\u2019d experienced at his touch. It had been an innocent enough situation and meant nothing. Yet it told Ali a truth she\u2019d forgotten. She was a woman. And, almost against her will, was attracted to a man other than Peter.</p><p>He muttered something under his breath, but she didn\u2019t hear what he said and frankly she was grateful. Without another word, they hurried in opposite directions.</p><p>Ali\u2019s face burned with mortification, but not because she\u2019d nearly fallen into Commander Dillon. When her breasts grazed him and he\u2019d reached out to catch her, he could have pulled her to him and kissed her and she wouldn\u2019t have made a single protest. Her face burned, and she knew she was in serious trouble. No, it was just the close proximity to all these men. At least that was what Ali told herself. It wasn\u2019t the commander; it could\u2019ve been any man, but even as that thought went through her mind, she knew it was a lie. She worried that the commander might somehow know what she\u2019d been feeling. That mortified her even more.</p><p>The scene replayed itself in her head during the fire drill and afterward, when she retired to her quarters. Once she was alone, Ali found a pen and paper. It was one thing to send Jazmine an e-mail but a letter was a tangible object that her daughter could touch and hold and keep. She knew Jazmine would find comfort in reading a note Ali had actually written.</p><p>When Ali had first started dating Peter, they\u2019d exchanged long letters during each separation. She treasured those letters and savored them all, even more so now that he was gone.</p><p>On the night of their wedding anniversary last year, while Jazmine was at a slumber party, Ali had unearthed a stack and reread each one. She quickly surrendered to self-pity, but she had every reason in the world to feel sorry for herself, she decided, and didn\u2019t hold back. That night, spent alone in her bedroom, grieving, weeping and angry, had been an epiphany for her. It was as if something inside her\u2014a wall of pretense and stoicism\u2014had broken wide-open, and her pain had gushed forth. She believed it was at that point that she\u2019d begun to heal.</p><p>Oh, she\u2019d cried before then, but this time, on the day that would have been her twelfth wedding anniversary, she\u2019d wept as if it was the end of the world.</p><p>By midnight she\u2019d fallen asleep on top of the bed with Peter\u2019s letters surrounding her. Thankfully Jazmine hadn\u2019t been witness to this emotional breakdown. Her daughter had known the significance of the date, however, and had given her mother a handmade anniversary card the following afternoon. Ali would always love that sweet card. After she\u2019d read it, they\u2019d hugged each other for a long time. Jazmine had revealed sensitivity and compassion, and Ali realized she\u2019d done her daughter a grave disservice.</p><p>All those months after Peter\u2019s death, Ali had tried to shield Jazmine from her own pain. She\u2019d encouraged the child to grieve, helped her deal with the loss of her father as much as possible. Yet in protecting Jazmine, Ali hadn\u2019t allowed her daughter to see that she was suffering. She hadn\u2019t allowed Jazmine to comfort her, which would have brought comfort to Jazmine, too.</p><p>Later that same day, after dinner, Ali had shared a few of Peter\u2019s letters with Jazmine. It was the first time they\u2019d really talked about him since his death. Before then, each seemed afraid to say more than a few words for fear of upsetting the other. Ali learned how much Jazmine needed to talk about Peter. The girl delighted in each tidbit, each detail her mother supplied. Ali answered countless questions about their first meeting, their courtship and their wedding day. Jazmine must\u2019ve heard the story of their first date a dozen times and never seemed to tire of it.</p><p>Once Ali\u2019s reserve was down, not a night passed without Jazmine\u2019s asking about Peter. As a young child, her daughter had loved bedtime stories and listening to Ali read. At nine she suddenly wanted her mother to put her to bed again. It was so out of character for her gutsy, sassy daughter that it\u2019d taken Ali a couple of nights to figure out what Jazmine really wanted, and that was to talk about her father.</p><p>In retrospect Ali recognized that those months of closeness had helped prepare Jazmine for this long separation. Ali didn\u2019t think she could have left her with Shana otherwise.</p><p>Shana. An involuntary smile flashed across her face as she leaned back in the desk chair. These next six months would either make or break her strong-willed younger sister. She\u2019d taken on a lot all at once. Buying this restaurant on impulse was so unlike her. Shana preferred to have things planned out, down to the smallest detail. Not only that, this new venture was a real switch for her after her sales position.</p><p>If there was anything to be grateful for in Shana\u2019s sudden move to Seattle, it was the fact that Brad Moore was out of her life. Ali had only met him once, during a brief visit home, but he\u2019d struck her as sleazy, and she hadn\u2019t been surprised to hear about his duplicity. Ali wondered how he\u2019d managed to deceive her sister all this time, but whatever charms he possessed had worked about four and a half years longer than they should have. She supposed that, like most people, Shana had only seen what she\u2019d wanted to see.</p><p>Before she returned to San Diego, Ali and Shana were able to spend a few hours together. Jazmine was asleep and the two sisters sat on the bed in Shana\u2019s room talking.</p><p>She\u2019d seen how hurt Shana was by Brad\u2019s unfaithfulness. In an effort to comfort her sister, Ali had suggested Shana try to meet someone else as quickly as possible.</p><p>Her sister hadn\u2019t taken kindly to the suggestion. In fact, she hadn\u2019t been shy about sharing her feelings with regard to the male of the species. Shana claimed she was finished with men.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overreacting,\u201d Ali had told her.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d Sitting with her knees drawn, Shana shook her head. \u201cThe absolute last thing I want to do now is get involved again. I was \u2018involved\u2019 for the last five years and all I got out of that relationship, besides a lot of pain, is two crystal champagne glasses Brad bought me. He said we\u2019d use them at our wedding.\u201d Not that he\u2019d actually given her an engagement ring or set the date. \u201cThose glasses are still in the box. If he\u2019d thought of it, he probably would\u2019ve asked for them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel that way about men now, but you won\u2019t always.\u201d</p><p>Shana frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk. I don\u2019t see you looking for a new relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, neither of us is interested in men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPermanently,\u201d Shana insisted.</p><p>Ali had laughed then and said, \u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Funny, as she reviewed that conversation, Commander Dillon came to mind. It was unlikely that she\u2019d see him on a regular basis; with a crew of five thousand on this ship, their paths wouldn\u2019t cross often. Ali wasn\u2019t entirely sure why, but she felt that was probably a good thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>The next few days were intense for Shana. She insisted on driving Jazmine to school, and every morning she joined the long line of parents dropping off their kids at the grade school. If Jazmine appreciated her efforts to build a rapport between them, she gave no indication of it. The most animation she\u2019d witnessed in the girl had been after Monday\u2019s lengthy telephone conversation with her uncle Adam.</p><p>Shana, her aunt, a blood relative, was simply Shana, but Adam Kennedy, family friend, was Uncle Adam. The uncle part was uttered with near-reverence.</p><p>Okay, so she was jealous. Shana admitted it. While she struggled to gain ground with her niece, Jazmine droned on about this interloper.</p> <p>Tuesday afternoon, the school bus again let Jazmine off in front of the ice-cream parlor. Her niece had dragged herself into the shop, as though it demanded all her energy just to open the door. Then she\u2019d slipped onto one of the barstools and lain her head on her folded arms.</p><p>Wednesday afternoon, Shana watched the school bus approach and the doors glide open. Sure enough, Jazmine was there, but this time she leaped off the bus and hurried toward the restaurant.</p><p>Shana stopped and stared. No, it couldn\u2019t be. But it was. Jazmine had her backpack. From the size and apparent weight of it, nothing seemed to be missing, either.</p><p>The instant Jazmine stepped inside, Shana blurted out, \u201cYou\u2019ve got your backpack.\u201d It probably would\u2019ve been better to keep her mouth shut and let Jazmine tell her, but she\u2019d been too shocked.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jazmine dumped her backpack on the floor and hopped onto the barstool with a Bugs Bunny bounce, planting her elbows on the counter. \u201cCan I have some ice cream?\u201d</p> <p>Taken aback, Shana blinked. \u201cWho are you and what have you done with my niece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>Shana laughed and reached for the ice-cream scoop. \u201cCone or dish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDish. Make it two scoops. Bubblegum and strawberry.\u201d She paused, her face momentarily serious. \u201cOh\u2014and thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Bending over the freezer, Shana rolled the hard ice cream into a generous ball. \u201cWell,\u201d she said when she couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. \u201cThe least you can do is tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Jazmine asked, then giggled like the nine-year-old she was. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you noticed or not, but I was pretty upset Monday afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally,\u201d Shana said, playing dumb.</p><p>\u201cTwo girls cornered me in the playground. One of them distracted me, and the other ran off with my backpack.\u201d</p><p>Shana clenched her jaw, trying to hide her anger. As Jazmine\u2019s legal guardian, she wanted these girls\u2019 names and addresses. She\u2019d personally see to it that they were marched into the principal\u2019s office and reprimanded. On second thought, their parents should be summoned to the school for a confrontation with the authorities. Perhaps it would be best to bring in the police, as well.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get it back?\u201d Shana had given up scooping ice cream.</p><p>Looking more than a little pleased with herself, Jazmine straightened her shoulders and grinned. \u201cUncle Adam told me I should talk to them.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that brilliant. Had she been asked, Shana would\u2019ve told Jazmine the same thing.</p><p>\u201cHe said I should tell them it was really unfortunate, but it didn\u2019t seem like we could be friends and I was hoping to get to know them.\u201d This was uttered in the softest, sweetest tones Shana had ever heard from the girl.</p><p>\u201cThey fell for it?\u201d</p> <p>Jazmine\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI meant it. At first I thought they were losers but they\u2019re actually pretty cool. I think they just wanted to see what I carried around with me.\u201d</p><p>Frankly Shana was curious herself.</p><p>\u201cOnce they looked inside, they were willing to give it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not missing anything?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Muttering under her breath, Shana dipped the scoop into the blue bubblegum-flavored ice cream. The bell above the door rang, but intent on her task, Shana didn\u2019t raise her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have some of that myself,\u201d a male voice said.</p><p>\u201cUncle Adam!\u201d Jazmine shrieked. Her niece whirled around so fast she nearly fell off the stool.</p><p>Hearing his name was all the incentive Shana needed to glance up. She did just in time to watch Jazmine throw her arms around a man dressed casually in slacks and a shirt. From the top of his military haircut to the bottom of his feet, this man was Navy, with or without his uniform. His arm was in a sling and he grimaced when Jazmine grabbed hold of him but didn\u2019t discourage her hug. From the near-hysterical happiness the girl displayed, a passing stranger might think Shana had been holding Jazmine hostage.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Ali\u2019s sister,\u201d he said, smiling broadly at Shana.</p><p>She forced a smile in return. She\u2019d been prepared to dislike him on sight. In fact, she\u2019d never even met him and was already jealous of the relationship he had with Jazmine. Now he was standing right in front of her\u2014and she found her tongue stuck to the roof of her mouth. He seemed to be waiting for her to reply.</p><p>\u201cYes, hi,\u201d she said and dropped the metal scoop into the water container, sloshing liquid over the edges. Wiping her wet hand on her white apron, she managed another slight smile. \u201cYes, I\u2019m Ali\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>On closer inspection, she saw that he was tall and apparently very fit. Some might find his looks appealing, but Shana decided she didn\u2019t. Brad was just as tall and equally fit\u2014from spending hours in a gym every week, no doubt admiring himself in all the mirrors. Adam\u2019s hair was a deep chestnut shade, similar to her own. No. Not chestnut, she decided next, nothing that distinguished. His was plain brown. He might\u2019ve been considered handsome if not for those small, beady eyes. Well, they weren\u2019t exactly small, more average, she supposed, trying to be as objective as she could. He hugged Jazmine and looked at Shana and\u2014no.</p><p>But he did. He looked at Shana and winked. The man had the audacity to flirt with her. It was outrageous. This was the very man Jazmine wanted her mother to marry. The man whose praises she\u2019d sung for two full days until Shana thought she\u2019d scream if she heard his name one more time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Adam Kennedy.\u201d He extended his free right hand.</p><p>She offered her left hand because it was dry and nodded politely. \u201cYou mean Uncle Adam.\u201d She hoped he caught the sarcastic inflection in her voice.</p><p>He grinned as if he knew how much that irritated her. Okay, now she had to admit it. When he smiled he wasn\u2019t ordinary-looking at all. In fact, some women\u2014not her, but others who were less jaded\u2014might even be attracted to him. That she could even entertain the remote possibility of finding a man attractive was upsetting. Wasn\u2019t it only a few days ago that she\u2019d declared to her sister that she was completely and utterly off men? And now here she was, feeling all shaky inside and acting like a girl closer to Jazmine\u2019s age than her own. This was pathetic.</p><p>In an attempt to cover her reaction, Shana handed Jazmine the bowl of ice cream with its two heaping scoops.</p><p>\u201cUncle Adam wants one, too,\u201d Jazmine said excitedly, and then turned to him. \u201cWhat happened to your arm?\u201d she asked, her eyes wide with concern. \u201cDid you break it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing as dramatic as that,\u201d he said, elevating the arm, which was tucked protectively in a sling. \u201cI had a problem with my shoulder, but that\u2019s been taken care of now.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine didn\u2019t seem convinced. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be all right, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine before you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Jazmine said; she seemed reassured now. Taking Adam by the hand, she led him across the restaurant to a booth.</p><p>Shana could hear Jazmine whispering up a storm, but hard as she strained, she couldn\u2019t hear what was being said. Working as fast as her arm muscles would allow, she hurriedly dished up a second bowl of ice cream. When she\u2019d bought this business, no one had mentioned how hard ice cream could be. She was developing some impressive biceps.</p><p>She smiled as she carried the second dish over to their booth and hoped he enjoyed the bright teal-blue bubblegum ice cream. After she\u2019d set it down in front of him, she waited. She wasn\u2019t sure why she was lingering.</p><p>Jazmine beamed with joy. Seeing her niece this happy about anything made Shana feel a pang of regret. Doing her best to swallow her pride, she continued to stand there, unable to think of a thing to say.</p><p>Her niece glanced up as if noticing her for the first time. \u201cI was telling Uncle Adam about my backpack. He\u2019s the one who said those other girls just wanted to be friends. I didn\u2019t believe him, but he was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he was.\u201d Shana might have been able to fade into the background then if Adam hadn\u2019t chosen that moment to turn and smile at her. Ignoring him would be easy if only he\u2019d stop smiling, dammit.</p><p>\u201cThe girls gave it back?\u201d Adam\u2019s gaze returned to Jazmine.</p><p>Her niece nodded. \u201cMadison asked me to sit next to her at lunch today and I did.\u201d</p><p>Adam reached across the table and the two exchanged a high five. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything else?\u201d Shana asked, feeling like a third wheel. These two apparently had a lot to discuss, and no one needed to tell her she was in the way. Besides, she had a business to run. Several customers had come in; at the moment they were studying the list of ice-cream flavors but she\u2019d have to attend to them soon.</p><p>\u201cNothing, thanks.\u201d He dipped his plastic spoon into the ice cream. Then, without giving her any warning, he looked at Shana again and their eyes met. Shana felt the breath freeze in her lungs. He seemed to really see her, and something about her seemed to catch him unawares. His brow wrinkled as though he was sure he knew her from somewhere else, but couldn\u2019t place her.</p><p>\u201cHow long can you stay?\u201d her niece asked.</p><p>Adam turned his attention back to Jazmine.</p><p>Shana waited, curious to know the answer herself.</p><p>\u201cJust a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hours!\u201d Jazmine didn\u2019t bother to hide her disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to base for a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Shana said, diving into the conversation. \u201cHe has to go back to Everett. We wouldn\u2019t want to detain him, now would we?\u201d She didn\u2019t mean to sound so pleased about sending him on his way, but she wanted him out of there. Shana disliked how he made her feel\u2014as if...as if she was on the brink of some important personal discovery. Like she\u2019d told her sister, she was off men. For good. Okay, for a year. It would take that long to get Brad out of her system, she figured. Now, all of a sudden, there was this man, this uncle Adam, whose smiles made her feel hot, then cold. That wasn\u2019t a good sensation for her to be having. It contradicted everything she\u2019d been saying\u2014and it made her uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop by again soon,\u201d Adam promised, looking directly at her as he said it.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what happened to your arm,\u201d Jazmine insisted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSurgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Mom know?\u201d</p><p>Adam shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s got enough on her plate without worrying about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve talked to her?\u201d Shana demanded. She forgot that she was pretending not to listen to their conversation. Catherine, the woman who worked part-time, arrived then and immediately began taking orders while Shana handled the cash register.</p> <p>Adam shifted toward her. \u201cShe e-mailed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Embarrassed, Shana glanced away. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish the base were closer,\u201d Jazmine muttered.</p><p>\u201cEverett isn\u2019t that far and with light duty, I\u2019ll have more time to spend with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly how soon do you have to leave this afternoon?\u201d Jazmine pressed. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you please, please have your meeting tomorrow?\u201d</p> <p>This kid wasn\u2019t easily put off, Shana thought. While she was more than ready to usher Adam Kennedy out the door, her niece was practically begging him to stay.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really up to me. I\u2019ve got to go soon, but I\u2019ll visit as often as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s busy, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Shana said before his words sank into her consciousness. He\u2019d be back...often. In other words, she\u2019d better get used to having him around, and judging by that smirk, he intended to smile at her some more. Oh, great.</p><p>\u201cAs often as you can?\u201d Jazz repeated. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m here at least once a week to check up on my favorite girl.\u201d</p><p>Instead of shouting with happiness, Jazmine hung her head. \u201cOnly once a week?\u201d</p> <p>Once a week? That often? Shana\u2019s reaction was just the opposite. As far as she was concerned, weekly visits were far too frequent.</p><p>Ali\u2019s little sister seemed oversensitive, Adam observed with some amusement as Shana returned to the ice-cream counter. That wasn\u2019t the only thing he\u2019d noticed, either. She was beautiful with classic features, dark hair and eyes and a face he found utterly appealing. Ali was a beautiful woman, too, but in a completely different way. Although both had dark brown hair and eyes, the resemblance stopped there. Shana was the taller of the two and model-thin, whereas Ali had more flesh on her. If he were ever to say that out loud, she\u2019d no doubt be insulted, but it was the truth. Ali wasn\u2019t overweight by any means, just rounded in all the right places. In his opinion, the little sister could stand to gain a few pounds. He wasn\u2019t sure why he was concentrating on the physical, because his reaction to Shana was much more complex than that. He was attracted to her. Period. He liked what he saw and he liked what he didn\u2019t see\u2014what he sensed about her. Attraction was indefinable, more about the sum of a person than his or her parts. People called it chemistry, sparks, magic, all sorts of vague things. But whatever you called it, the attraction was obviously there.</p><p>Something else was obvious. She felt it, too. And she didn\u2019t want to. In fact, she seemed determined to make sure he knew that. He didn\u2019t go around ravishing young women, willing or unwilling, but he definitely got a kick out of her reaction to him. He couldn\u2019t keep from grinning as he headed into the heavy freeway traffic on I-5 North.</p><p>On second thought, he might be overreacting. Perhaps it was all those musings about his lack of female companionship following his release from the hospital. Pain could do that to a man. Maybe he was wrong about Shana\u2019s interest in him; maybe he\u2019d simply been projecting his own attraction and\u2014Damn, this was getting much too complicated.</p><p>That same evening, when Adam logged on to the Internet, he discovered two messages from Ali. In the first, she was eager to know if he\u2019d made contact with Jazmine; in the other, she asked if he\u2019d be able to give her sister a break now and then. He immediately e-mailed back that he\u2019d seen Jazz and everything seemed to be fine with her and Shana. He also said he\u2019d visit as often as he could. Several questions regarding Shana went through his mind, but he didn\u2019t ask them, not wanting Ali to get the wrong impression. He also feared she\u2019d relay his interest to her sister\u2014and he just wasn\u2019t ready for that.</p><p>An hour later, his phone rang. It was Jazmine, who spoke in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the closet.\u201d She was still whispering.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d So Jazmine wanted to talk to him without her aunt listening in. Interesting.</p><p>\u201cI hate it here and\u2014oh, Uncle Adam, it\u2019s just so good to see someone I know.\u201d</p><p>Adam wished he could be there to wrap his arm around the girl\u2019s thin shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019ll get better.\u201d He didn\u2019t mean to sound trite, but he couldn\u2019t come up with anything else to say. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me you\u2019d made friends with those two girls who took your backpack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess, but it isn\u2019t like California. Seattle isn\u2019t like anyplace I\u2019ve been. I miss my mom and...I just don\u2019t like it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel that way whenever I\u2019ve got a new duty assignment,\u201d he said, wanting to comfort her and not knowing how. \u201cI\u2019m in a new work environment myself and to be honest I\u2019d much rather be in Hawaii. It\u2019s the perfect duty station. But you do get used to wherever you are, Jazz....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to be with my mom,\u201d Jazmine said, sounding small and sad. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care where it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you getting along with your aunt?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine hesitated. \u201cShe tries, and I appreciate everything she does, I really do, but she doesn\u2019t know that much about kids.\u201d As if she felt bad about criticizing her aunt, the girl added, \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it was on Monday, but...\u201d</p><p>Adam wanted to continue asking questions about Shana, but he preferred not to be obvious about it. \u201cShe seems nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is, but she\u2019s got issues, you know.\u201d</p><p>It was difficult for Adam not to laugh outright at Jazmine\u2019s solemn tone. \u201cWhat kind of issues?\u201d he asked gravely.</p><p>Jazmine snickered. \u201cWhere would you like me to start? She has this old boyfriend that she dumped or he dumped her\u2014I don\u2019t know which\u2014but she won\u2019t even say his name. I heard her talking to Mom, and every time she got close to mentioning his name, she called him that-man-I-used-to-date. Is that ridiculous or what?\u201d</p><p>Adam murmured a noncommittal reply.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all. Shana used to have a regular job, a really good one for a drug company. Mom said she made fabulous money, but she quit after she broke up with this guy. Then she bought the ice-cream parlor. She doesn\u2019t know a thing about ice cream or pizza or anything else.\u201d</p><p>Still, Adam had to admire her entrepreneurial spirit. \u201cShe seems to be doing all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only because she phones the former owners ten times a day, and I\u2019m not exaggerating. She finally figured out she can\u2019t do everything on her own and she hired a lady to come in during the afternoons to help her. I\u2019m only nine-going-on-ten, and I figured that out before she did.\u201d Jazmine stopped abruptly, as if something had just occurred to her. \u201cYou\u2019re not attracted to her or anything, are you?\u201d</p><p>Adam relaxed in his chair and crossed his ankles. \u201cWell...I think she\u2019s kinda cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Jazmine said, more loudly this time. \u201cI was afraid this would happen. This is terrible!\u201d</p><p>Adam loved the theatrics. \u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShana,\u201d Jazmine cried as if it should all be perfectly logical. \u201cWhat about Mom? If you\u2019re going to fall in love with anyone, make it my mom. She needs you, and you\u2019d be a great stepdad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJazmine,\u201d he said, the amusement suddenly gone. \u201cI think the world of your mother. She\u2019s a wonderful woman, and I love her dearly, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He had no idea how to put this without upsetting her. \u201cYour mother and I, well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love her like a sister,\u201d Jazmine finished for him. She sounded resigned and not particularly surprised.</p><p>Adam almost wished he could fall in love with Ali. Perhaps if he\u2019d met her before Peter did, things would\u2019ve been different. But he hadn\u2019t, and now it was impossible to think of Ali in any other way.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty astute of you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s astute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine sighed heavily. \u201cNot really. I said something about you to Mom, and what she said is she loves you like a brother.\u201d</p><p>So it was a mutual feeling, which was a relief. \u201cDid your mother tell you she was ready for another relationship?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think she is,\u201d Jazmine replied after a thoughtful moment. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if she knows it.\u201d She hesitated, and he could almost see her frown of concentration. \u201cMom\u2019s been different the last few months.\u201d She seemed to be analyzing the situation as she spoke. \u201cShe\u2019s less sad,\u201d Jazmine went on. \u201cWe talk about Dad a lot, and Mom laughs now and she\u2019s willing to do things and go places again. I guess someone mentioned that to the Navy, because they decided to give her sea duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful your mother\u2019s feeling better about life. When the time\u2019s right, she\u2019ll meet someone special enough to be your stepdad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it won\u2019t be you.\u201d</p><p>Adam heard the sadness in her voice and regretted it. \u201cIt won\u2019t be me,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou are attracted to Shana though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d That was all he\u2019d admit. He found himself wondering about the man Shana had recently dumped or been dumped by.</p><p>\u201cSo this guy she used to go out with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were engaged, I think, but she won\u2019t talk about it.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cShe didn\u2019t get a ring, though.\u201d</p><p>Engaged? Even an unofficial engagement suggested this had been a serious and probably long-term relationship. Which could explain why Shana had seemed so skittish.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna ask her out, Uncle Adam?\u201d</p><p>Adam wasn\u2019t prepared to make that much of a commitment, not yet, anyway. \u201cUh, we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019d say yes,\u201d Jazmine said brightly. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Some women seem to need a man in their lives, but...\u201d His voice trailed off; he wasn\u2019t sure how to complete that thought.</p><p>Jazmine muttered a comment he couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJust remember, she\u2019s got issues\u2014lots and lots of issues.\u201d</p><p>Adam managed to stifle a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to keep that in mind. Listen, Jazz, do you feel okay now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...I guess I should come out before Shana finds me in here. Oh!\u201d</p><p>That small cry was followed by some muffled words, but he caught the drift of what was happening. Shana had just discovered where Jazmine had taken the phone.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like him, do you?\u201d Jazmine asked the next day as they drove home from the restaurant. She sat next to Shana with her arms defiantly crossed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shana knew better than to pretend she didn\u2019t understand that her niece was referring to Lieutenant Commander Adam Kennedy. \u201cI think your uncle Adam is...nice.\u201d The word was lame and the hesitation was long, which gave Jazmine cause to look at Shana intently. But really, what else could she say? Her unexpected attraction to this man had completely overwhelmed her. She could only hope it passed quickly. How could she be devastated by her breakup with Brad and at the same time, experience all the symptoms of extreme attraction toward another man? A man she\u2019d met for about five minutes and been determined to dislike on sight.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really cute, too.\u201d Jazmine seemed to feel obliged to remind her of this.</p><p>As if Shana needed a reminder.</p><p>\u201cHe is, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Jazmine challenged.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, he\u2019s cute.\u201d The words nearly stuck in her throat, but with no small effort, Shana managed to get them out. She didn\u2019t know why Jazmine was so insistent. The girl seemed to think she had a point to prove, and she wasn\u2019t letting up until she got Shana to confess she was interested in Adam Kennedy. She wasn\u2019t, of course. Okay, she was, but that was as far as it went. In other words, if he asked her out, which he wouldn\u2019t, she\u2019d refuse. Well, she might consider it briefly, but the answer would still be no.</p><p>Jazmine was suspiciously quiet for several minutes and then gave a soft laugh. \u201cI bet you\u2019re hot on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shana nearly swallowed her tongue. The last thing she needed was Jazmine telling Adam this. \u201cNo way,\u201d she denied vehemently. She could only pray that wasn\u2019t what Jazz had said to Adam in the closet.</p><p>One glance told her Jazmine didn\u2019t buy her denial. She shouldn\u2019t have bothered to lie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that because of your old boyfriend, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Shana protested. She stepped hard on the brake at a stop sign she\u2019d almost missed, jerking them both forward. Thank goodness for seat belts. Glaring at her niece, she asked, \u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine blinked wide eyes at Shana. \u201cI overheard my mom talking to you. I wasn\u2019t listening in on your conversation, either, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. I tried to find out from Mom, but all she\u2019d tell me was that your heart was broken, and that\u2019s why you moved to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>Shana was too tired to argue and too emotionally drained to be upset with her sister. If Ali had told Jazmine about Brad, then it was because she felt Jazmine needed to know. \u201cI\u2019m completely over Brad. I\u2019m so over him it\u2019s hard to remember why I even got involved with him.\u201d The words had begun to sound like a worn-out litany.</p><p>\u201cBrad,\u201d Jazmine said, and seemed satisfied now that she knew his name.</p><p>Shana struggled to hide her reaction. Even the mention of Brad\u2019s name irritated her. She might have worked the last twelve hours straight, and on her feet at that, but she had enough energy left to maintain her outrage toward Brad. Still, she would\u2019ve preferred never to talk about him\u2014or hear about him\u2014ever again.</p><p>\u201cYou still have a heart, though,\u201d Jazmine pressed. \u201cRight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I have a heart.\u201d Shana didn\u2019t know where this was leading and she didn\u2019t care, as long as it didn\u2019t end up on the subject of Adam Kennedy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re so hot on my uncle Adam.\u201d Darn.</p><p>\u201cI am not hot on your uncle Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJazmine!\u201d</p><p>Her niece laughed and despite her irritation, Shana smiled. This was not a conversation she wanted to have, but she\u2019d walked right into it and was determined to extricate herself as gracefully as possible. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d she said in conciliatory tones. \u201cI think he\u2019s a very nice man, but I don\u2019t want to get involved with anyone at the moment. Understand?\u201d</p> <p>Jazmine bit her lower lip, as if she wanted to argue, but apparently changed her mind. \u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>Shana decided to nip this question in the bud. \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat long?\u201d Jazmine threw her a crushed look. \u201cYou don\u2019t want children? That means I\u2019ll never have cousins!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, months and months, then.\u201d At this point Shana was ready to agree to just about anything.</p><p>\u201cMonths,\u201d Jazmine repeated. She seemed to accept that\u2014or at any rate ventured no further argument.</p><p>Shana parked in front of her house, grateful to be home. \u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t want to cook. Do you have any suggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can open a can of chili,\u201d Jazmine said. \u201cI\u2019m not very hungry.\u201d</p><p>Shana wasn\u2019t all that hungry, either. \u201cSounds like a perfectly good dinner to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me do it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jazz.\u201d Shana had no intention of turning down this generous offer. \u201cFabulous.\u201d Then considering her role as guardian, she felt obliged to ask, \u201cDo you have any homework?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>Now came the dilemma. A really good substitute mother would tell Jazmine to forget dinner; Shana would rustle up a decent meal while the kid did her schoolwork. A woman of character would insist on opening that can of chili herself. But not one with tired feet and the start of a throbbing headache, brought on by all this talk about Adam Kennedy.</p><p>Once inside the house, Shana left the front door open to create a cooling breeze. She lay back on the sofa and elevated her feet. It was little wonder the Olsens had been ready to sell their restaurant. This was hard work. For part of each day, Shana had her face buried in three-gallon containers of ice cream. Her nose felt like she was suffering from permanent frostbite.</p><p>Jazmine immediately went into the kitchen and started shuffling pans, clanking one against the other. \u201cDo you need any help?\u201d Shana felt she had to ask, but the question was halfhearted, to say the least.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is really very sweet of you.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine grumbled a reply and Shana realized she\u2019d failed again. A kid like Jazmine, who wore ankle-high tennis shoes to school, didn\u2019t take kindly to the word sweet. Sooner or later, Shana would need to develop a more appropriate vocabulary. Later, she decided.</p><p>A good ten minutes passed and if not for the sounds coming from the kitchen, Shana would be napping by now. Her head rested against the cushion, her feet were propped up and all was well. For the first time since she\u2019d arrived, Jazmine was talking freely with her. She wasn\u2019t sure whether she should credit Adam Kennedy with this improvement or not. She\u2019d rather think she was making strides in her relationship with her niece due to her own efforts.</p><p>\u201cUncle Adam says you need a man in your life.\u201d</p><p>Her peace shattered, and Shana\u2019s eyes sprang open. She sat up, swung around and dropped her feet to the floor. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine appeared in the doorway between the kitchen and the living room, wearing a chagrined expression. \u201cI...Uncle Adam said you\u2019re the kind of woman who needs a man in her life.\u201d</p><p>That did it. She\u2019d utterly humiliated herself in front of him, and he thought...he assumed she was making some kind of play for him. This was the worst possible scenario.</p><p>\u201cShana?\u201d Jazmine whispered. \u201cYou look mad.\u201d</p><p>She wondered if the smoke coming out of her ears was any indication. \u201cThat\u2019s ludicrous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he meant it as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>Shana doubted it, but gave her niece credit for some fast backtracking.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He did? Although it shouldn\u2019t have mattered, his comment gave Shana pause. \u201cHe said that?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine hesitated. \u201cWell, not exactly.\u201d</p><p>Okay, then. \u201cListen, it\u2019s not a good idea for us to talk about your uncle Adam right now.\u201d When she saw him next, she\u2019d have plenty to say, though.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d The kid was catching on fast.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk about Brad, either.\u201d</p><p>Right again. \u201cYou could say men aren\u2019t my favorite topic at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not,\u201d Jazmine said pensively. \u201cI won\u2019t mention either of them if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want.\u201d Her serenity gone, Shana gave up the idea of resting and joined Jazmine in the kitchen. Her niece\u2019s backpack was propped against the kitchen chair; she seemed to keep it close at all times.</p><p>Despite her intentions to the contrary, Shana gave the sexy lieutenant commander plenty of thought. What she had to do was keep her distance. She would be polite and accommodating if he wanted to spend time with Jazmine, but other than that, she\u2019d be cool and remote. Never again would she allow him the opportunity to suggest that she needed a man\u2014least of all him.</p><p>Jazmine stirred the chili with her back to Shana. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Shana was eager to drop the subject.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d Shana assured her.</p><p>\u201cYou look mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d</p><p>They both broke out laughing. Obviously Jazz remembered that this childish interchange had amused her earlier, and she wasn\u2019t above repeating it.</p><p>Shana had to admit it felt good to laugh with her niece; it was almost like having her sister there. Jazmine was a petite version of Ali and after she\u2019d lowered her guard, they got along well.</p><p>Shana wondered if she should clarify her position in case Adam asked Jazmine about her again or made some other ridiculous statement. No, she decided. She\u2019d enlighten him herself.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re not getting any younger,\u201d Jazmine said out of the blue.</p><p>Once Shana got over her shock, she had to acknowledge that the kid was ruthless in achieving her goals. She went directly for the jugular. But Shana kept her response light. \u201cAfter a day like this one, that\u2019s certainly true.\u201d</p><p>On Saturday morning, Jazmine agreed to come down to the ice-cream parlor with her. In fact, Shana had no choice but to bring her. Catherine, her employee, wouldn\u2019t be in until that afternoon.</p><p>At this point Catherine was only part-time, but with the summer traffic, business was picking up and she\u2019d need a second part-time employee. As the season progressed and the parlor was open later in the evening, she\u2019d add more staff. The Olsens had told her that her biggest expense would be the staff payroll and warned her not to hire more people than she needed. Shana had taken their words to heart, doing as much as she could herself.</p><p>\u201cCan I bring my Rollerblades?\u201d Jazmine asked, standing in the doorway of her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Shana hated the thought of Jazmine hanging around the restaurant all day with nothing to do. Since Lincoln Park was directly across the street, there\u2019d be plenty of paved sidewalks for her to skate. It would be a good opportunity to meet other girls her age, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By noon the parlor was crowded. Shana worked the pizza side and Catherine, a grandmotherly woman in her early sixties, dealt with the ice-cream orders. Catherine had been recommended by the Olsens and was great with kids. Shana had already learned a lot from her.</p><p>A young red-haired man with two children about three and five came in and ordered a vegetarian pizza and sodas. While Shana assembled the pizza, she watched the man with his kids, admiring the way he entertained them with inventive games.</p><p>Jazmine rolled into the parlor, stopped to take off her skates and before long was deep in conversation with the father and his two kids. Shana couldn\u2019t hear what was being said, but she saw the man glance in her direction and nod.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, Jazmine joined Shana in the kitchen, which was open to the main part of the restaurant.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d Shana said, sliding the hot pizza from the oven onto the metal pan. As she sliced it, the scent of the tomato sauce and cheese and oregano wafted toward her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Shana asked distractedly as she set the pizza on the counter. \u201cDo you want to take this out to the guy with the kids?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCan I?\u201d Jazmine beamed at being asked to help out.</p><p>Her niece carefully carried the pizza to the table and brought extra napkins. She chatted with the man and his children for a few more minutes, then hurried back to Shana, who was busy preparing additional pizzas. \u201cHe asked me to introduce you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine\u2019s eyes widened with impatience. \u201cI was telling you earlier. He\u2019s divorced and he wants to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? The guy over there with the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see any other guy in here?\u201d</p><p>The restaurant had any number of patrons at the moment, but the young father was the only man\u2014and the only customer looking in her direction. He saluted her with a pizza slice.</p><p>Flustered, Shana whirled around and glared at Jazmine. \u201cExactly what did you say to him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe? I didn\u2019t say anything\u2014well, I did mention that you broke up with Brad, but that was only because he asked. He said he\u2019s been in here before.\u201d</p><p>Shana didn\u2019t remember him.</p><p>\u201cI told him that my uncle Adam said you\u2019re the kind of woman who needs a man in your life.\u201d</p><p>Shana\u2019s heart stopped. \u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jazmine hooted with laughter. \u201cBut I thought it would get a rise out of you.\u201d</p><p>The kid seemed to think she was being funny, but Shana wasn\u2019t laughing.</p><p>\u201cAre you interested? Because if you are, let\u2019s go say hello to him. If you\u2019re not, it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>Shana needed to think about this. \u201cPromise me you didn\u2019t tell him I\u2019m single.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did, and I said you were looking for a husband,\u201d Jazmine said gleefully. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>Shana felt the blood drain out of her face. Slowly turning her head, she saw the father still watching her. She jerked around again and noticed that Jazmine was grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d she said and doubled over laughing.</p><p>Shana was glad someone found her embarrassment amusing.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Jazmine had her nose pressed against the living room window early on Sunday afternoon, waiting for her uncle Adam. He\u2019d phoned the previous Monday, promising to take her out for the day. He\u2019d mentioned the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, where there was a large Dale Chihuly exhibit.</p><p>Shana was almost as eager to see the lieutenant commander as her niece was, but for distinctly different reasons. She had a thing or two she wanted to say; he didn\u2019t know it yet, but the lieutenant commander was about to get an earful. How dare he suggest she needed a man! Every time she thought about it, her irritation grew\u2014until she realized she couldn\u2019t keep quiet for even one more day.</p><p>At twelve-forty-seven precisely, Jazmine dashed away from the window and announced, \u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Shana resisted the urge to race outside and confront him then and there. She\u2019d need to bide her time. She\u2019d waited this long\u2014ten whole days. What was another five minutes?</p><p>Jazmine held the screen door open, swinging it wide in welcome. \u201cYou aren\u2019t late or anything,\u201d she boasted so eagerly it was endearing.</p><p>\u201cHiya, kiddo,\u201d Adam greeted Jazmine and gave her a big hug. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too! It didn\u2019t seem like Sunday would ever get here.\u201d</p><p>Shana stepped forward, saying, \u201cHello, Adam,\u201d in cool, level tones.</p><p>He grinned boyishly and for an instant Shana faltered. But no, she wasn\u2019t about to let him dazzle her with one of his smiles. Not this time. Her defenses were up. As far as she was concerned, he had some serious explaining to do. Still, she had to admit this guy was gorgeous. Well, gorgeous might be a slight exaggeration, but with those broad shoulders and the way his T-shirt fit snugly across his chest, she couldn\u2019t very well ignore the obvious. His arm was out of the sling now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better grab a sweater,\u201d Shana suggested and Jazmine instantly flew out of the room, eager to comply so they could leave.</p><p>This was the minute Shana had been waiting for. \u201cIt\u2019s time you and I had a little talk,\u201d she said, crossing her arms.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said with another of those easy grins.</p><p>Again she faltered, nearly swayed by his smile, but the effect didn\u2019t last. \u201cI want you to know I didn\u2019t appreciate the comment you made about me being\u2014and I quote\u2014\u2018the kind of woman who needs a man.\u2019\u201d</p><p>To his credit, his gaze didn\u2019t waver. \u201cJazmine told you that, did she?\u201d</p><p>So it was true. \u201cAs a matter of fact, Jazmine has repeated it any number of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He glanced toward the bedroom door; Jazmine hadn\u2019t come out yet.</p><p>Shana sincerely hoped she\u2019d embarrassed him. He deserved it. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you get off making comments like that but I have a few things to say to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo right ahead.\u201d He gestured as though granting her permission to speak. That must be how it was in the military, she thought. These officers seemed to think they could say and do whatever they pleased\u2014and they got to boss other people around. Well, Shana wasn\u2019t military and she felt no restraint in speaking her mind. And she refused to call this guy by his title. He wasn\u2019t her commander.</p><p>\u201cAre you married, Mr. Kennedy?\u201d She already knew the answer and didn\u2019t give him an opportunity to respond. \u201cI believe not. Does being single make you feel in any way incomplete?\u201d Again he wasn\u2019t allowed to answer. \u201cI thought not. This might come as a shock to you, but I am perfectly content with my life as it is. In other words, I don\u2019t need a man and your insinuating that I do is an insult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShana\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finished yet.\u201d She held up her hand, cutting him off because she was just getting started. Before he left, she expected a full apology from Adam Kennedy.</p><p>\u201cBy all means continue,\u201d he said, his pose relaxed.</p><p>His attitude annoyed her. He acted as though he was indulging her, which Shana found condescending. \u201cSince you\u2019re single you must want a woman in your life.\u201d She gave him the once-over. \u201cIn fact, you look like a man who needs a woman.\u201d</p><p>To her horror, Adam simply laughed.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to make a point here,\u201d Shana said in as dignified a tone as she could manage.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said and made an attempt to stifle his humor.</p><p>That only served to irritate her further. \u201cNever mind. I can see my opinion is of little interest to you.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly they both turned to see Jazmine, who stood rooted in the bedroom doorway, a sweatshirt draped over her arm. \u201cI should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut, right?\u201d she murmured apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Aunt Shana might\u2019ve taken what you said the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I gathered.\u201d He looked down, but Shana saw that the corners of his mouth quivered.</p><p>\u201cShana\u2019s right, you know,\u201d Jazmine stated for Adam\u2019s benefit, as she moved toward them. \u201cYou do need someone special in your life.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s smile disappeared.</p><p>Aha! She wondered how he\u2019d feel being on the other side.</p><p>\u201cJazmine took your comments to heart,\u201d Shana primly informed him. \u201cShe tried to match me up with a divorced father of two.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s gaze shot to Jazmine.</p><p>\u201cWell...It didn\u2019t work out\u2014but I\u2019d be a good matchmaker.\u201d</p><p>As far as Shana could tell, Jazmine was completely serious. That had to stop. She certainly didn\u2019t need her niece dragging eligible bachelors into the pizza kitchen every chance she got.</p><p>\u201cHe might\u2019ve been interested, too,\u201d Jazmine added. \u201cHe seemed really nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help, thank you very much,\u201d Shana insisted.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Adam said, glancing from one to the other. He motioned at Jazmine. \u201cGo back to the beginning because I think I missed something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out he was single and I told him my aunt was, too, but that was all I did. She wouldn\u2019t let me introduce her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is entirely your fault.\u201d Shana felt it was important that Adam understand it was his comment that had begun this whole awkward situation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finished with Brad,\u201d Jazmine reminded her. She turned to Adam and added, \u201cHe\u2019s the guy previously known as the-man-I-used-to-date. Sort of like Prince. That\u2019s what Mom said, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Adam burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cThere is a point to this, isn\u2019t there?\u201d Shana asked her niece.</p><p>Jazmine nodded and threw one fist in the air. \u201cGet out there, Aunt Shana! Live a little.\u201d</p><p>Adam laughed even more.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is funny, don\u2019t you?\u201d Shana muttered. He wouldn\u2019t find it nearly as funny when Jazmine was busy selling his attractions to single women in the museum.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d But he didn\u2019t look it. For her niece\u2019s sake, she resisted rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time we cleared up this misunderstanding,\u201d he said and gestured toward the sofa. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we all sit down for a moment?\u201d</p><p>Shana didn\u2019t take a seat until Adam and Jazmine had already made themselves comfortable on the sofa.</p><p>To her chagrin, Adam smiled patiently as if explaining the situation to a child. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Jazmine read more into my comment than I intended,\u201d he began. \u201cWhat I said was that some women seem to need a man in their lives. I wasn\u2019t talking about you. Although, of course, any man in his right mind would be attracted to you. You\u2019re a beautiful woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It would be convenient if Shana could magically disappear about now, but that was not to be. \u201cI see. Well, in that case, I won\u2019t hold you up any longer.\u201d She sprang to her feet, eager to get them both out the door before she dissolved into a puddle at his feet. \u201cI\u2014that\u2019s a very nice thing to say...\u201d She stared at her watch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adam took the hint and stood, and Jazmine rose with him. \u201cIs there any special time you want her back this evening?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo...anytime is fine,\u201d she said, then quickly reconsidered. \u201cOn second thought, Jazmine has school tomorrow so she shouldn\u2019t be out too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have her here by seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Shana waited by the door as they left, her heart going a little crazy as she tried to regain her composure.</p> <p>\u201cBye, Aunt Shana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>She closed the door. She\u2019d hoped to put the mighty naval officer in his place and all she\u2019d managed to do was amuse him. Depressed, Shana sank into the closest chair and hid her face in her hands\u2014until she realized something. For the first time since Jazmine had arrived, she\u2019d called her Aunt Shana. Twice.</p><p>Apparently her status had been sufficiently elevated that the nine-year-old was no longer ashamed to be related to her. That, at least, was progress.</p><p>Adam waited until they\u2019d almost reached Tacoma before he mentioned the scene at Shana\u2019s. Jazmine had barely said a word from the moment they\u2019d left. Now and then she glanced in his direction, as if she was afraid he was upset, but really he had no one to blame but himself. He did know women who were lost without a relationship, although he didn\u2019t think Shana was like that. Intentionally or not, Jazz had misunderstood his remark and used it for her own purposes.</p> <p>\u201cYou really did it this time,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but your aunt was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but don\u2019t you be mad, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything. You and I should not have been discussing male-female relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you mean what you said about my aunt being beautiful and all that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d This was only the second time he\u2019d seen Shana; again, he\u2019d come away wanting to know her better. He might have ruined any chance of that, but he hoped not. When he\u2019d started out from Everett, he\u2019d considered inviting Shana to join them. But it hadn\u2019t taken him long to decide that today probably wasn\u2019t opportune.</p><p>\u201cWhat I told your aunt is the truth. She is a beautiful woman,\u201d he said casually as he headed south on the interstate.</p><p>\u201cShe likes you.\u201d</p><p>Adam chuckled.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. She\u2019s got the hots for you. I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Back to reality. Shana might be attracted to him, but she\u2019d never admit that now.</p><p>\u201cI know so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJazmine, listen...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, but can I say what I want to first?\u201d</p><p>Apparently she was taking lessons from her aunt Shana. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about what you said\u2014about not feeling sparks with Mom. But I thought you might with Aunt Shana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJazmine, you\u2019re far too interested in matters that are none of your concern. How do you know about this stuff, anyway? MTV?\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cWhy do adults always say things like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I want is for you to marry her and be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas the cat got your tongue?\u201d Jazmine teased. \u201cAdults say that, too. No, really, I am serious. If you married my aunt Shana, everything would be perfect. She needs a husband and you need a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a wife,\u201d he argued. \u201cAnd it\u2019s none of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d like to be married one day, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d she broke in.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said reluctantly. He\u2019d had the very same thought just recently, but he\u2019d credited that to feeling sorry for himself after the surgery. Granted, Shana was attractive but he didn\u2019t need a nine-year-old playing matchmaker. Although...He smiled involuntarily. Shana appealed to him, and he was more and more inclined to pursue the relationship. On his own schedule and in his own way.</p><p>\u201cI can help,\u201d Jazmine offered.</p><p>\u201cIt would be best if you left this between your aunt and me. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>After a moment, Jazmine nodded. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, now let\u2019s have a wonderful day, all right?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine turned a smile of pure joy on him. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>A surprise awaited him when they arrived at the Museum of Glass. The Dale Chihuly exhibit was in the Tacoma Art Museum and Union Station, not in the nearby Museum of Glass. Jazmine and Adam took the guided walking tour of his permanent display and were awestruck by the Bridge of Glass. The five-hundred-foot pedestrian bridge linked the Tacoma waterfront to Pacific Avenue.</p><p>Originally Adam had gotten information about Chihuly over the Internet when he was researching a destination for today\u2019s outing. Chihuly was known for his massive glass installations, but the man\u2019s talent was even more impressive than Adam had realized. Both he and Jazmine loved his vibrant use of color and unique style. Following the walking tour, they stopped at the Museum of Glass. Adam was in for a surprise there, too. The museum was huge: it contained thirteen thousand square feet of open exhibition space. Jazmine was enthralled by the Hot Shop Amphitheater, which was the building\u2019s most striking feature. Cone-shaped, it leaned at a seventeen-degree angle, and was ninety feet high and a hundred feet wide. The theater included a glass studio where a team of artists blew and cast glass. Afterward, Adam and Jazmine ate sandwiches in the museum caf\u00e9 and visited the gift shop. When Adam had suggested this, it had seemed like an entertaining thing to do, but he\u2019d quickly become caught up in the excitement and drama of watching the artists work.</p><p>By the end of the afternoon, he needed a break, and sat with a cup of coffee while Jazmine leafed through a book he\u2019d bought her.</p><p>Before they left, Jazmine bought a postcard of the Dale Chihuly glass flowers displayed on the ceiling of a Las Vegas casino to send her mother.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go back to your aunt\u2019s?\u201d he asked, sipping his coffee.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Jazmine said. \u201cBut only if you are.\u201d</p><p>Adam recognized a trap when he saw one. If he appeared too eager, little Jazmine might suspect he wanted to see Shana again. He did, but he sure wasn\u2019t going to admit it, especially to her.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>For Shana, having an entire Sunday to herself was sheer luxury. Catherine was working at the restaurant and this was the first day she\u2019d taken off since she\u2019d purchased the business. Shana intended to take full advantage of this gift of time.</p><p>Working as many hours as she did, she\u2019d been putting off a number of tasks and spent two hours doing paperwork. The Olsens had trained her well in every aspect of owning a restaurant, but they\u2019d failed to warn her how much paperwork was involved. Getting everything organized wasn\u2019t difficult but it was time-consuming. After working all day and handling the closing in the evening, she was exhausted, and making sense of anything more than the remote control was beyond her.</p><p>Once the paperwork was up-to-date, she polished her toenails, and between three loads of wash, she luxuriated in a new mystery she\u2019d been trying to read for weeks. She\u2019d been reading at night in fits and starts, but couldn\u2019t manage more than fifteen or twenty minutes at a time. The author was one of her favorites but to Shana\u2019s surprise her mind kept wandering away from the page. She supposed it was because she felt guilty about all the things she should be doing.</p><p>When she wasn\u2019t fretting over that, her thoughts were on Jazmine and Adam. She knew they were going to the Museum of Glass, but that couldn\u2019t possibly take all afternoon. Well, maybe it could; she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Finally Shana gave up and shut the book. This was Adam Kennedy\u2019s fault. Even when he was nowhere in sight, he wouldn\u2019t leave her alone.</p><p>When she could stand it no longer, Shana logged on to the computer and left her sister a message.</p><p>Sent: Sunday, June 12</p><p>From:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>To:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Subject: Adam Kennedy: Friend or Foe?</p><p>Dear Ali,</p><p>Just checking in to let you know that despite our rocky start, everything\u2019s going well with Jazz and me. She\u2019s a great kid.</p><p>The upcoming week is the last of the school year. I\u2019m thrilled at how quickly Jazmine has adjusted and how fast she\u2019s made friends. I guess she\u2019s had lots of practice. She\u2019s a tremendous help at the ice-cream and pizza parlor and insists on taking pizzas to the customers\u2019 tables, which I appreciate.</p><p>The other reason I\u2019m writing is that I\u2019ve got a question about Peter\u2019s friend, Adam Kennedy. I must have met him at Peter\u2019s funeral, but if so I don\u2019t remember. Jazmine seems to think you\u2019re romantically interested in him. Are you? You\u2019ve never mentioned him before\u2014at least not that I can recall. Before you make anything of this inquiry, I want it understood that I find him arrogant and egotistical. Jazmine, however, thinks the guy walks on water. They\u2019re off this afternoon to explore some glass museum. I\u2019d be grateful if you\u2019d tell me what you know about him. For instance, has he ever been married? If not, why? I don\u2019t want to give you the wrong impression or anything\u2014I do find him arrogant. But he sort of interests me, too. Fill in the blanks for me, would you?</p><p>Love,</p><p>Shana</p><p>At six Shana tossed a salad for dinner. The house seemed terribly quiet, and she turned on the television for company. That wasn\u2019t like her. In all her years of living alone, she\u2019d never once felt this lonely. At first she wondered if it was due to the breakup with Brad, but all she felt when she thought about him was regret for all that wasted time\u2014and anger. She was just plain glad he was out of her life. In fact, she rarely thought of him at all and that surprised her.</p><p>Jazmine had been with her for only a few weeks, and already Shana couldn\u2019t imagine life without her. She missed Jazmine\u2019s energy\u2014blaring her music or talking on the phone, or plying Shana with questions about all sorts of things. The difference between the unhappy nine-year-old who\u2019d arrived on her doorstep and the girl she was now\u2014well, it seemed nothing short of astonishing. She\u2019d become extroverted, interested and...interfering.</p><p>A little after seven, Jazmine burst into the house. \u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>Before Shana could issue a word of welcome, Jazmine regaled her with details of how they\u2019d spent their day. She talked about the walking tour and chattered excitedly about watching the artists work in the Museum of Glass. She\u2019d fed the seagulls along the waterfront on Rustin Way and then Adam had taken her for a quick visit to the zoo at Point Defiance Park. Shana could hardly believe the girl could talk so fast and breathe at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI guess you had a completely rotten time?\u201d Shana asked, teasing her. Shana realized as she spoke that the lieutenant commander was nowhere in sight. \u201cWhere\u2019s Adam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were kind of late and he had to get back.\u201d Jazmine\u2019s smile widened. \u201cDid you want him to come inside?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot really. I just thought he might like to...visit for a few minutes.\u201d Actually, after the way she\u2019d torn into him on his arrival, she didn\u2019t blame him for avoiding her.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably have a little talk,\u201d Shana said, slipping an arm around Jazmine\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Her niece stiffened. \u201cI have a feeling this is the same little talk Uncle Adam and I had, only now it\u2019s going to be the Aunt Shana version.\u201d</p><p>Her interest was instantly piqued. \u201cReally? And what did Adam have to say?\u201d</p> <p>Jazmine gave a long-suffering sigh. \u201cThat it would be a good idea if I left the two of you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d Shana was grateful Adam had taken it upon himself to explain this. Jazmine would accept it more readily coming from him.</p><p>\u201cHe also said I\u2019m concerning myself with matters that aren\u2019t any of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Obviously Adam had been very forthright during his version of the \u201clittle talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised him I wouldn\u2019t try matching you up with other men.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate that,\u201d Shana said solemnly.</p><p>Jazmine sighed again. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like it if you went around talking to boys about me.\u201d</p><p>That was exactly how Shana had planned to approach the subject herself. \u201cDid Adam make that comparison?\u201d</p><p>Her niece nodded. \u201cHe said it on the drive back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s smarter than he looks,\u201d Shana muttered. Then, because she felt her niece should know this, she added, \u201cA man and a woman can be friends without being romantically involved, Jazmine. It\u2019s called a platonic relationship.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang then, and without waiting for a second ring, Jazmine leaped like a gazelle into the other room. She ripped the receiver off the wall. \u201cHello,\u201d she said urgently. \u201cNo, she\u2019s here, you have the right number.\u201d Jazmine held out the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d</p> <p>Shana started to ask who it was, but didn\u2019t. Taking the receiver, she raised it to her ear. \u201cThis is Shana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShana. I can\u2019t tell you how wonderful it is to hear the sound of your voice.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in her life, Shana\u2019s knees felt as if they were about to buckle. It was Brad.</p><p>\u201cHello, Brad,\u201d she said evenly, amazed at her ability to respond without emotion. The man had guts; she\u2019d say that for him. \u201cHow\u2019d you find me?\u201d she asked coolly.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s taken me weeks.\u201d</p><p>She supposed she should be complimented that he\u2019d made the effort, but she wasn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, but there was a reason I kept my number unlisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe least you can do is listen to what I have to say,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s been said.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut Shana\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to say,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cAt least give me your address. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re living in Washington. Did you get a transfer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine was watching her carefully, eyes wide and quizzical as if she was hoping to memorize each word so she could repeat it.</p><p>\u201cI would prefer if you didn\u2019t phone me again.\u201d Shana was prepared to cut him off, but he stopped her, obviously guessing her intentions.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hang up,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cPlease, Shana, just hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t do any good.\u201d She\u2019d gone ramrod-straight, her resistance up. She didn\u2019t even find this difficult, although she had to admit she was mildly curious as to why he\u2019d sought her out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I need to get this off my chest. Just promise me you\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to encourage him with a response.</p><p>He continued despite that. \u201cYou told me you were leaving Portland, but I didn\u2019t believe you. Shana, I miss you. I need you. Nothing is the same without you. I feel so empty. You have no idea how awful it\u2019s been for me.\u201d</p><p>That was their problem in a nutshell. The entire relationship had revolved around Brad Moore and his needs. He missed her, he needed her. She was convenient, loyal and endlessly patient. Well, no more.</p><p>She rolled her eyes and made a circular motion with her hand as though to hurry him along.</p><p>Jazmine planted her hand over her mouth to smother her giggles.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening?\u201d he asked, finishing up a five-minute soliloquy about how much he missed all their special times. Translation: all the \u201cspecial\u201d times when she\u2019d been there to see to his comfort. He recounted the little ways she\u2019d indulged him\u2014the meals she\u2019d cooked according to his likes and dislikes, the movies she\u2019d watched because he\u2019d chosen them, the Christmas shopping she\u2019d done for him...Not once did he say any of the things that might have changed her mind, including the fact that he loved her.</p><p>So far, everything he\u2019d said reaffirmed her belief that she\u2019d made the right decision. It would always be about Brad and what he needed from her and how important she was to his comfort. Apparently Sylvia wasn\u2019t nearly as accommodating as Shana.</p><p>Finally she couldn\u2019t take it any longer.</p><p>\u201cAre you finished yet?\u201d she asked and yawned rudely to signal her boredom.</p><p>Her question was followed by a short silence. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed, Shana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she told him in a curt voice. \u201cYes, I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t love me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Shana noticed he hadn\u2019t even bothered to ask about the girl who\u2019d answered the phone.</p><p>Brad seemed shocked that she wasn\u2019t ready to race back into his arms just because he\u2019d made an effort to find her. A short while ago, she\u2019d been grateful for each little crumb he\u2019d tossed her way. Those days were over. Oh, this felt good. She felt good.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to my sweet Shana?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI woke up,\u201d she informed him, \u201cand I didn\u2019t respect the woman I\u2019d become. It was time to clean house. Out with the old and in with the new.\u201d</p><p>The line went silent as he absorbed this. \u201cYou\u2019re dating someone else, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The temptation to let him believe that was strong, and she might have given in to it, if not for Jazmine. With her niece listening to every word, Shana felt honor-bound to tell the truth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just like you to think that, but no, I\u2019m not seeing anyone else.\u201d She bit back the words to tell him she could if she wanted to. Well, there was that single father who might\u2019ve been interested\u2014and Adam Kennedy.</p><p>His relief was instantaneous. \u201cYou\u2019ll always love me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI won\u2019t. I don\u2019t. Not anymore. For your sake and mine, please don\u2019t call me again.\u201d</p><p>He started to argue, but Shana wasn\u2019t willing to listen. She should\u2019ve hung up the phone long before, but some perverse satisfaction had kept her on the line.</p><p>As she replaced the receiver, she looked over at Jazmine. Her niece gave a loud triumphant shout. \u201cWay to go, Aunt Shana!\u201d</p><p>They exchanged high fives. Shana felt exuberant and then guilty for not experiencing even the slightest disappointment. She was actually grateful Brad had phoned because this conversation had provided complete and final proof that she\u2019d reclaimed her own life.</p><p>\u201cCan I tell Uncle Adam about this?\u201d Jazmine asked happily.</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d Her suspicions immediately rose to the surface. \u201cWhatever for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Jazmine replied as if it should be obvious. \u201cHe should know that you really are over Brad. The door\u2019s open, isn\u2019t it? I mean, you\u2019re cured.\u201d</p><p>Shana liked the analogy. \u201cI am cured, but let\u2019s just keep this between us for now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine frowned. \u201cIf you say so,\u201d she said without enthusiasm.</p><p>The kid was certainly eager to get her and Adam together. Presumably she\u2019d abandoned her earlier hopes for Adam and her mother. \u201cI want your promise that you won\u2019t talk to Adam about any part of my conversation with Brad.\u201d</p><p>Muttering under her breath, Jazmine shook her head. Halfway to her room, she turned back. \u201cUncle Adam wanted me to tell you he\u2019ll be by next Saturday. That\u2019s all right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is.\u201d Not until later did Shana realize how dejected she was at the thought of waiting almost a week before she saw Adam Kennedy again.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Ali read Shana\u2019s e-mail a second time and smiled. This was exactly what she\u2019d hoped\u2014but didn\u2019t dare believe\u2014would happen. Although her sister was skirting the issue, she was interested in Adam; her e-mail confirmed it. Adam had definitely gotten Shana\u2019s attention.</p><p>It took half an hour for Ali to answer her sister. She worked hard on the wording for fear she\u2019d say too much or not enough. Adam was a lot like Peter in the ways that really mattered. He was loyal, compassionate, with a strong work ethic and an endearing sense of humor. Through the years, Peter had encouraged him to settle down and get married. Personally Ali didn\u2019t understand why Adam hadn\u2019t. Aside from the important stuff, he was good-looking. As far as she knew he dated, but obviously hadn\u2019t found the one woman with whom he wanted to spend the rest of his life. Could Shana be that woman? Far be it from her to suggest such a thing. Much better if a relationship developed without her meddling. From the sounds of it, they were getting all the romantic assistance they needed\u2014or didn\u2019t need\u2014from Jazmine.</p><p>Once she\u2019d finished her e-mail, Ali prepared for her shift. It\u2019d taken some adjustment, but she\u2019d become accustomed to life aboard the aircraft carrier. Routine helped pass the days, and being able to stay in touch with her daughter through the Internet eased her mind about Jazmine.</p><p>The hours went by quickly as she responded to small medical emergencies.</p><p>She was almost finished with her shift when Commander Frank Dillon entered the sick bay. His complexion was sickly pale, and his forehead was beaded with sweat. When he saw that Ali was the duty nurse, he attempted a weak smile but she noticed that his jaw was clenched and he was clearly in pain.</p><p>Ali remembered him from her first day in the wardroom. Since then, she hadn\u2019t seen him at all but thought about him often, reliving those few seconds when he\u2019d reached out to steady her in the passageway. Just seconds\u2014it couldn\u2019t have been more than that. She didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d read anything into such a minor incident. Still, she\u2019d fantasized about him an embarrassing number of times in the weeks since. No one had to remind her of the professional issues involved in fraternization aboard ship.</p><p>\u201cCommander Dillon,\u201d Ali said, coming forward to assist him. He held his hand pressed against his side. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong,\u201d he muttered. He looked as if he was close to passing out. \u201cI need a doctor.\u201d</p><p>Ali led him into an examination room, and learned that he\u2019d had a stomachache for the last couple of days. It\u2019d had grown steadily worse and now the pain had become intolerable. She alerted Captain Robert Coleman, the physician on duty, who examined the commander. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ali suspected it was his appendix, and apparently Dr. Coleman did, too. Following the examination, he ordered X-rays. Ali accompanied Commander Dillon while the X-rays were taken. The commander didn\u2019t utter a word, although she knew every touch, no matter how gentle, brought him pain.</p><p>One look at the film confirmed her fears. Time was critical; judging by the amount of pain he was suffering, his appendix could rupture any minute. Dr. Coleman scheduled emergency surgery, which he planned to perform immediately.</p><p>Ali helped prep the commander, explaining what was happening and why. She hooked up the IV and taped the needle in place. After checking the fluid bag, she glanced down and discovered him watching her. She smiled shyly, unaccustomed to such intent scrutiny.</p><p>Frank closed his eyes and drew in a deep breath.</p> <p>Ali squeezed his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll have you back to your command as good as new,\u201d she promised.</p><p>He was silent until just before he was rolled into the surgical bay. He gripped Ali\u2019s hand unexpectedly and with surprising strength. Half rising from the gurney, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s bad. Listen, if I don\u2019t make it...if there are complications...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to live to tell about this, Commander,\u201d she assured him. She gave his hand another squeeze and urged him back down. Their eyes met and she did her best to let him know that the medical staff would take good care of him and all would be well.</p><p>The commander dragged in another deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound fatalistic, but I don\u2019t have any family. My wife left me years ago\u2014no kids. My brother died a few years back and I\u2019ve never updated my will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your brother,\u201d she told him softly.</p> <p>His hand clutched hers. \u201cMoney to charity. Decide for me. Promise you\u2019ll decide for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, but, Commander...\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t listening anymore, she realized. The pain was too intense.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going into surgery with you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIf God decides it\u2019s your time, He\u2019ll have to argue with me first.\u201d Although she was certain he was past hearing anything, she thought she detected a faint smile.</p><p>As the surgery progressed, Ali wanted to chastise the commander for waiting so long to seek medical attention. He had risked his life because of\u2014what? Pride? Ignoring the pain hadn\u2019t made it go away. An infected appendix was not going to heal itself.</p><p>The surgery was routine until they found that, exactly as she\u2019d suspected, the appendix had burst. Extra time and care was needed to ensure that the infection was completely eradicated before it could spread to the entire abdominal area. Peritonitis could be fatal. Having a ruptured appendix wasn\u2019t as life-threatening as in years past, but it was serious enough.</p> <p>After the surgery, Commander Dillon\u2019s incision was closed and he was taken into Recovery. Lieutenant Rowland was sent in to replace Ali, whose shift had ended.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with him a bit longer,\u201d she told Rowland. Sitting at the commander\u2019s bedside, she took his blood pressure every twenty minutes until he woke from the anesthesia several hours later.</p><p>He moved his head instinctively toward Ali, who sat by his side.</p><p>She smiled and touched his brow. \u201cGod didn\u2019t put up much of an argument. It seems that neither heaven nor hell was interested in collecting your soul, Commander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d he whispered weakly. \u201cI thought this pain meant I was in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike someone hacked me open with a saw blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you something for the pain.\u201d She stood and reached for his chart to make a notation. \u201cRest now. Your body\u2019s had quite a time of it.\u201d That was an understatement, but she felt better knowing he was awake. His vital signs confirmed that he was out of immediate danger.</p> <p>Ali sat with the commander for another hour and then reluctantly turned her patient over to Rowland.</p><p>\u201cDo you know the commander?\u201d the lieutenant asked as she left the recovery area.</p><p>\u201cI met him our first day out.\u201d</p><p>Rowland seemed surprised that she\u2019d stayed with him. It surprised Ali, too. She was busy these days and got as little as four or five hours\u2019 sleep a night, but hadn\u2019t been able to make herself leave. One thing was certain: this man had her attention. Just as Adam had Shana\u2019s...</p><p>Frank Dillon was lost in a dark, lonely world. Every so often he heard a soft, feminine voice and it confused him. He couldn\u2019t figure out where he was. Then he remembered the pain, the surgery, the nurse\u2014that soft voice was the nurse talking to him. The one who haunted his dreams. He prayed it was her and in the same breath pleaded for God to send her away. Her touch was light, and on the rare occasions when he found the strength to open his eyes, she was standing by his side.</p><p>She smelled good. Not of flowers or perfume, but a distinct womanly scent. Clean and subtle and...just nice. It lured him unlike anything else he\u2019d ever experienced. He wasn\u2019t a man accustomed to the ways of women. He\u2019d lived his life in the Navy and for the Navy, and he\u2019d learned the hard way that he wasn\u2019t meant to be a Navy husband.</p><p>He\u2019d married at twenty-five and Laura had left him two years later. That had been nearly twenty years ago. His wife had walked out when she realized no amount of crying, pleading or cajoling would persuade him to resign his commission. She knew before they were married that he\u2019d made the Navy his career, the same as his father and grandfather had. Nothing was more important to Frank than duty and honor. Not his marriage, not Laura, not one damn thing. She hadn\u2019t been able to reconcile herself to that and he doubted any woman ever could. Other commitments took second place to military life. He\u2019d accepted that, and dedicated himself to his career. Not once in all those years had he regretted his decision. Until now\u2014and now he would willingly have sold his soul to keep this woman at his side. He needed her, wanted her and he didn\u2019t care what it cost him.</p><p>Some of his fellow officers had been against letting women serve at sea. Frank hadn\u2019t been one of them. Now he wasn\u2019t so sure his peers had been wrong. Senior Medical Officer Alison Karas had taken up far more of his thoughts than warranted. He\u2019d decided from their first, chance encounter to stay away from her; he wasn\u2019t risking his career for a shipboard romance. Avoiding her was easy enough to accomplish with five thousand sailors aboard the USS Woodrow Wilson. It was just his luck that she was the one on duty. Luck or fate? He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d like the answer.</p><p>A cool hand touched his brow, followed by Alison\u2019s quiet voice. Unable to make out the words, Frank thought it might have been a prayer. Apparently he was worse off than he\u2019d known, although she seemed to think she had some influence with the Man Upstairs. Her constancy touched him. No one had ever done anything like that before\u2014not for him.</p><p>The darkness didn\u2019t bother him anymore. He was at peace, even though a vague memory, something about Alison, hovered just out of reach. She was with him. He planned to tell her how much her presence meant to him.</p><p>If he lived through this.</p><p>The next morning, the USS Woodrow Wilson was hit by a raging storm. The massive ship had turned into the typhoon, and there was nothing to do but ride it out. Thankfully, Ali had never been prone to seasickness, but a number of men were sent to sick bay. She had her hands full the first day of the storm, but things had settled down by the second. During a quiet moment, she went in to check on Commander Dillon. He was sitting up in bed, still pale and not in the best of moods.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on topside?\u201d he demanded the moment he saw her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a typhoon, Commander.\u201d</p><p>He tossed aside his sheet and seemed ready to climb out of bed. \u201cGet me out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She prevented him from moving farther.</p><p>From the way his eyes widened, Ali could tell that it wasn\u2019t often anyone stood up to the high and mighty commander. \u201cI\u2019m the navigator and I\u2019m needed topside,\u201d he argued, his face reddening.</p><p>\u201cThis might come as a shock, Commander Dillon, but the Navy stayed afloat without you for more than two hundred years. They\u2019ll manage to survive for another day or so. Now stay in bed, otherwise I\u2019ll have you restrained.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes flared. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Although her heart was pounding, Ali didn\u2019t dare let her nervousness show. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s something you\u2019d like to find out. Your orders are to stay in bed until Captain Coleman says otherwise. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>His gaze challenged hers, but then, apparently reaching a decision, he nodded. Although he wasn\u2019t happy about it, he would abide by what he knew was best.</p><p>Ali was grateful. Under normal circumstances, the commander wasn\u2019t a man to cross; she\u2019d figured that out quickly enough. And if his scowl was any indication, he was on the mend. He\u2019d been in bad shape the first few days, but his improvement was steady. To show him how much she appreciated his cooperation, she patted his arm.</p><p>He stiffened as if he found her touch offensive and Ali quickly backed away. While he was under anesthesia, she\u2019d touched him many times. In an effort to comfort him, she\u2019d stroked his brow and talked to him in soothing tones. She\u2019d frequently taken his pulse and blood pressure and let her hand linger on his arm, hoping he\u2019d sense her encouragement and concern. Perhaps she\u2019d grown too familiar, too personal.</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d he muttered gruffly.</p><p>Embarrassed, Ali retreated an additional step. \u201cNo, the fault is mine\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201d By all rights, she should turn and leave. The clinic was busy. Sailors were waiting. She should get while the getting was good, as her grandmother used to say.</p><p>\u201cYou were with me in Recovery until I regained consciousness, weren\u2019t you?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She nodded, afraid they were taking a dangerous risk by acknowledging this attraction. Not since Peter\u2019s death had Ali allowed herself to feel anything for another man. In fact, she\u2019d been certain she never would and now...now she wasn\u2019t sure what to think.</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason you stayed with me all those hours?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ali didn\u2019t know what to tell him. Honesty might be the best policy, but there were times the truth was better avoided. This appeared to be one of those times.</p><p>\u201cYour appendix had ruptured, Commander. In such cases, there\u2019s a significant chance of complications. It was easier for me just to remain on duty than explain the situation to my shift replacement.\u201d Ali used her best professional voice, making it as devoid of emotion as she could.</p><p>He seemed to accept her explanation and answered with an abrupt nod.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I can do for you?\u201d she asked, moving away from his bedside.</p><p>\u201cNot a thing,\u201d he replied in clipped tones, and Ali knew he was referring to a whole lot more than his medical situation.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>As promised, Adam Kennedy was at the restaurant by ten on Saturday morning. Shana had anticipated this moment\u2014no, dreaded it\u2014all week. She might\u2019ve been able to push the lieutenant commander from her mind if it weren\u2019t for Jazmine, who found every excuse in the world to bring up his name. They could be discussing the migration habits of Canada geese, and Jazmine would somehow link the topic with her uncle Adam. It didn\u2019t matter what they discussed, Adam Kennedy became part of the conversation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shana didn\u2019t resent the fact that her niece called Adam her uncle anymore. It seemed natural for her to do so. What didn\u2019t seem natural\u2014or fair\u2014was the way he\u2019d infiltrated her thoughts. And, in all honesty, that wasn\u2019t just due to Jazmine.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Adam said as he marched into the restaurant with a crisp military gait that said he was ready for action. He wore black jeans and a casual denim shirt with the sleeves rolled up.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Her voice faltered a little. This was one attractive man, a fact she was trying hard to ignore. Nonetheless, her hands trembled as she reached for a paper towel and wiped them clean. \u201cJazmine brought her Rollerblades.\u201d Thankfully it was early enough that the ice-cream parlor didn\u2019t have any customers yet.</p><p>\u201cI saw. She put on a show for me in the parking lot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Now that was an intelligent response and Shana resisted the urge to kick herself. She intensely disliked the way Adam made her feel like an awkward teenager. Until recently, she\u2019d considered herself a competent professional, a woman who could cope with any social situation, and it irked her no end that this man could agitate her like this. \u201cWhere are you two headed today?\u201d she asked conversationally, hoping to hide her complete lack of a brain.</p><p>Adam sauntered up to the cash register, apparently in no hurry to leave. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet. I thought I\u2019d get some suggestions from Miss Jazz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Before she sent him off with Jazmine, perhaps she should enlighten him about her niece\u2019s continuing efforts to match up the two of them. \u201cDo you have a few minutes before you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He slid onto one of the stools.</p><p>Rubbing her palms against her apron, Shana took a moment to clear her thoughts. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed,\u201d she began, \u201cbut Jazmine seems to be working hard at, uh, getting the two of us together.\u201d She paused. \u201cThis is in spite of your...little talk.\u201d</p> <p>Adam leaned forward. \u201cI got the hint in our last phone conversation, when she started mentioning your name in practically every sentence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does that to you, too?\u201d Interesting. And, she supposed, predictable. \u201cYou\u2019re a frequent topic of conversation yourself.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s been e-mailing me updates on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpdates on what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t paid a lot of attention.\u201d</p><p>She was unexpectedly miffed by that but decided his indifference was probably for the best.</p> <p>\u201cBy the way, how\u2019s Brad?\u201d</p><p>Shana nearly bit her tongue in an effort to hide her reaction. \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t paying attention,\u201d she said. \u201cBrad isn\u2019t important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s curious because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something to discuss,\u201d she said, cutting him off before they both got sidetracked by the unpleasant subject of Brad.</p><p>\u201cHave at it,\u201d Adam said, gesturing toward her.</p><p>\u201cFirst, since we\u2019re both aware that Jazmine\u2019s busy playing matchmaker, it seems the best defense is to be honest with each other.\u201d She half expected an argument.</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>He seemed utterly relaxed; in contrast, Shana\u2019s nerves were as tight as an overwound guitar string.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, taking a deep breath. \u201cI think you\u2019re wonderful with Jazmine and...and mildly attractive.\u201d The man already had an overblown ego and she wasn\u2019t about to give him any encouragement.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He perked up at that.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted reluctantly, \u201cand there are probably a few other positive traits I could add.\u201d</p><p>He checked his watch. \u201cI have time.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him. \u201cBut without going into why I feel a relationship between us wouldn\u2019t work\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you being a little hasty?\u201d he asked without allowing her to finish.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m not interested.\u201d She wondered if a big red neon light spelling liar was flashing over her head. She was interested, but she suspected this whole attraction thing was just the result of being on the rebound. She needed to take it slow, ease into another relationship. Letting Adam Kennedy sweep her off her feet was definitely a bad idea.</p><p>He stared at her blankly. \u201cInterested in what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. I don\u2019t mean to be blunt or rude, but I felt I should be clear about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He shrugged, his expression unchanged.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d he assured her and he certainly didn\u2019t look put off by her confession.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that this isn\u2019t the right time for me to get involved,\u201d she rushed to add, confused now and more than a little embarrassed. She wished she\u2019d thought this through more carefully. \u201cI\u2019ve only had the business a short while, and all my energy and resources are tied up in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. That makes perfect sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with you personally.\u201d She was only digging herself in deeper now but couldn\u2019t seem to stop.</p><p>\u201cShana, it\u2019s not a problem. Don\u2019t worry, okay? If anything, it\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cWe should keep each other informed,\u201d he murmured. \u201cJust like you suggested. Jazmine is a sweet kid, but we both need to be aware of her game plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d She felt guilty about the things she\u2019d said. \u201cI hope I didn\u2019t offend you\u2014sometimes my tongue goes faster than my brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he told her patiently.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d It was probably ridiculous to be so worried about a nine-year-old\u2019s scheme and even more ridiculous to mention it to Adam. Thankfully he\u2019d taken everything with a sense of humor.</p><p>\u201cUncle Adam!\u201d Jazmine skated into the parlor and at one glance from Shana, sat down and removed her skates. \u201cAre you done yet? Can we leave now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Jazmine looked about as happy as Shana could remember seeing her. \u201cSchool\u2019s out for the year.\u201d She slipped on her tennis shoes without bothering to tie them.</p><p>Shana\u2019s cheeks still burned with embarrassment and she was eager to see Adam and Jazmine leave. \u201cYou guys have a great time,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>Adam slid off the stool and with Jazmine at his side, they ambled out. After the door closed, Shana felt oddly depressed, although she couldn\u2019t name the precise reason. She didn\u2019t want to analyze it, either.</p><p>Business was slow for a Saturday, but experience told Shana it would pick up around lunchtime. She had two part-time employees now in addition to Catherine, the retired woman the Olsens had recommended, who was Shana\u2019s most valuable employee. She moved easily between the ice-cream section and the pizza parlor, and she was fully capable of taking over if Shana wanted time off, which was reassuring. This was the one buffer Shana felt she needed now that she was Jazmine\u2019s guardian.</p><p>Around eleven, the young father Jazmine had talked to a few weeks earlier stepped into the restaurant. He was without his kids today. He strolled up to the pizza counter; from there he could see Shana in the kitchen, where she was busy stirring a vat of soup. She\u2019d discovered a brand of concentrated soups that tasted as good as homemade and was pleased with the results.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said casually, leaning against the counter.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Shana pretended not to remember him, which was the exact opposite of the way she treated her other customers. She worked hard at remembering people\u2019s names and creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. She knew his, too\u2014Tim\u2014but refused to acknowledge it.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you\u2019d be interested in dinner and a movie.\u201d</p><p>His invitation took her completely off guard. \u201cI\u2014I beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...well, actually, I was asking you out on a date.\u201d His voice was a monotone now, as if she\u2019d deflated his ego, and Shana instantly felt bad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour niece mentioned that you\u2019re single, and well, so am I and I was wondering, you know, if you\u2019d like to go out sometime.\u201d</p><p>Shana wasn\u2019t sure what to say. She hesitated, and then decided she could only be honest. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m flattered that you\u2019d ask, but I just don\u2019t have time to date right now.\u201d She motioned around her. \u201cThis is a new venture for me and I...have to be here.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIs there any particular reason you don\u2019t want to go out with me?\u201d</p><p>A couple of dozen quickly presented themselves but Shana couldn\u2019t manage to get out a single one. \u201cYou seem very nice, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the kids, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d she hurried to assure him. \u201cIt\u2019s like I told you\u2014the timing is wrong.\u201d That was the excuse she\u2019d used with Adam; it was also the truth. She\u2019d untangled herself from one relationship and wasn\u2019t ready to get involved in another.</p><p>\u201cYou mean I should\u2019ve waited until you were finished for the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>He wiped his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse me. I\u2019m new at this. My wife, I mean ex-wife, and I met in high school and well, it just didn\u2019t work out. I don\u2019t blame her. We were both too young, but Heather\u2019s the only woman I\u2019ve ever dated and\u2014I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m doing.\u201d He looked completely crestfallen by the time he\u2019d finished.</p><p>Shana felt even worse. \u201cUnder other circumstances, I\u2019d be happy to\u2014\u201d She stopped, afraid she\u2019d just make matters worse if she continued. \u201cWould you like a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and sat down on the stool. \u201cThat would be great, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tim, right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled dejectedly. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you remember.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d be shocked at everything she did recall about the last time he\u2019d been in the ice-cream parlor\u2014even if she preferred not to.</p><p>Shana made them each an espresso, double shot. If he didn\u2019t need it she did. When she set the tiny cups on the counter, Tim reached for his wallet. Raising her hand, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s on the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She waved off his gratitude. For reasons she didn\u2019t want to examine too closely, she felt guiltier than ever for rejecting him.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what I did wrong?\u201d he asked after the first tentative sip.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t you,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cIt really is because of the timing. My new business and looking after my niece and everything.\u201d</p><p>Over the next three hours, she heard the story of Tim\u2019s ten-year marriage and every detail of his divorce. The only time he paused was when she was bombarded with questions from customers or staff, or if the capable Catherine needed her assistance.</p><p>She also learned practically the entire story of Tim\u2019s life. He seemed to need a willing ear and she provided it, between serving ice cream in three dozen different flavors. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know, Tim, it seems to me you\u2019re still in love with your wife,\u201d she commented while he was on his third espresso.</p><p>His eyes flared and he adamantly shook his head. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but that\u2019s how I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould be, but it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re crazy about your kids.\u201d</p><p>He had no argument with that. \u201cThey\u2019re fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014what else can I do for you?\u201d she asked when he showed no sign of leaving anytime within the foreseeable future.</p><p>\u201cYou could always go to dinner with me,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Shana laughed, knowing she\u2019d be in for a repeat of his disagreement with the divorce attorney. She gave him an A for effort, though. \u201cI thought we already went over that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure you mean no?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>\u201cIf the lady says no, that\u2019s what she means,\u201d Adam Kennedy said from the doorway leading into the restaurant. He glared at Tim as if he wanted to teach him a lesson. His tone was friendly enough, but his demeanor wasn\u2019t. Shana sighed in exasperation. She was all too aware of the interest Catherine and the others were taking in this little scene. Tim was harmless, his self-esteem in shreds following his divorce, and he was counting on Shana to boost his confidence.</p><p>\u201cThank you very much, Adam,\u201d she said tightly, fighting the temptation to say a great deal more, \u201cbut the lady can answer for herself.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise Jazmine laughed outright. \u201cHello, Mr. Gilmore, remember me?\u201d</p><p>Tim looked as if he didn\u2019t know what to say. He got off the stool. \u201cI guess it\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a good idea to me,\u201d Adam murmured.</p> <p>\u201cAdam,\u201d Shana chastised, but his gaze didn\u2019t waver from Tim\u2019s face.</p><p>As soon as the other man was out the door, Shana whirled on Adam. \u201cThat was completely unnecessary and uncalled for,\u201d she said, trying to keep her voice down in deference to her staff and customers.</p><p>Adam looked away. \u201cPerhaps, but I wanted to be sure he got the message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly is the message?\u201d Shana demanded.</p><p>Adam grinned as if the answer should be obvious.</p><p>\u201cHands off,\u201d Jazmine supplied. \u201cYou\u2019re already spoken for.\u201d</p><p>With her shift over, Ali went to check on Commander Dillon one last time and discovered he was asleep. His face was turned toward her and in slumber his features had relaxed. He looked younger than she\u2019d first assumed.</p><p>As she stood there, Ali hesitated, resisting the urge to move closer. She longed to place her hand on his arm, to touch him and feel the warmth of his skin. A chill ran down her spine as she remembered he didn\u2019t want her anywhere near him. That had been made abundantly clear during her last visit.</p> <p>She wished she had someone she could talk to about the way she felt. This wasn\u2019t something she could discuss with the other women on board. She could be putting her career in jeopardy. Any hint of a romantic entanglement, and she could be in more trouble than she wanted to consider.</p><p>Before she left, Ali logged on to her computer.</p><p>Sent: June 20</p><p>From:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>To:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Subject: Hello!</p><p>Dear Shana,</p><p>Just wanted to see how you\u2019re doing this week. I think of you and Jazmine every day. I\u2019m doing well myself. We had an emergency appendectomy this week\u2014Commander Dillon. I might have mentioned him before. Before he went under, he seemed to think he might not make it, and asked if I\u2019d look after his affairs. I told him I would, but thankfully that wasn\u2019t necessary. He\u2019s recuperating nicely now. I think he\u2019s</p><p>Ali hesitated, remembering the intense look in Frank\u2019s eyes as he confessed he had no family. What a lonely life he must lead. Divorced and his brother dead. It didn\u2019t sound as if his parents were still living, either. He\u2019d wanted her to dispose of his earthly goods by giving whatever he had to charity. Ali told herself he didn\u2019t have time to ask anyone else; she\u2019d been handy, so he\u2019d reached out to her. Still, she sensed that he trusted her. They were basically strangers but he felt he could speak to her and that she would follow through with whatever he\u2019d requested. Had it been necessary, she would have.</p><p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Shana returned to her e-mail. She deleted the last three words and began a new paragraph.</p><p>Jazmine mentioned that Adam was stopping by on Saturday. How did that go? I know you think my daughter\u2019s trying to match the two of you up and I agree she has no business doing that. But the truth is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a bad idea.</p><p>Adam is a good man and while you might have a dozen excuses not to recognize what a find he is, look again. This is your big sister talking here. I mean it: take a close look at this guy. Adam is easy on the eyes (nice but not essential), he\u2019s intelligent and hardworking and wonderful with kids.</p><p>I just hope keeping Jazmine for the next six months will convince you that you want children of your own. I can tell how close the two of you are getting just from the e-mails. It\u2019s almost enough to make me jealous!</p><p>Your e-mails mean the world to me. Keep them coming.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Ali</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Ali to get a response. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was because of the time difference or if she happened to catch her sister at the computer.</p><p>Sent: June 21</p><p>From:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>To:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Subject: Commander, you say?</p><p>Dear Ali,</p><p>No, you didn\u2019t mention anyone named Commander Dillon. What gives? Is he all right? I assume he must be. But the fact that you\u2019re saying anything at all tells me you\u2019re interested in him. This is a development worth watching. I know, I know, all shipboard romances are strictly taboo. But tell me more!</p><p>I\u2019m afraid I made an idiot of myself in front of Adam this morning. Trust me, any romantic interest he might have felt toward me is deader than roadkill. I\u2019m such a fool.</p><p>All right, all right, I\u2019ll tell you what I did, but you\u2019ve got to promise not to mention it again. I decided he should be aware of Jazmine\u2019s little scheme. That seems only fair, don\u2019t you think?</p><p>In retrospect, I still feel it needed to be said but maybe I didn\u2019t handle it in the best possible way. When I assured him I wasn\u2019t interested in him, I came off sounding like...I don\u2019t know what. I keep saying it, but this isn\u2019t the right time for me to get involved. It really isn\u2019t, not with just starting this business.</p><p>And guess what? Another guy, who was recently divorced, came in later this afternoon and asked me out. I turned him down using the same excuse and felt terrible. (By the way, it\u2019s thanks to the little matchmaker that he knew I was single.)</p><p>Oh, and did I mention Brad phoned? Let me tell you that was a short conversation. If I needed confirmation that I did the right thing in breaking up with him, our conversation was it.</p><p>Hearing from you is wonderful. Both Jazmine and I miss you terribly. I never realized how much effort went into being a parent. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Jazz is one fabulous kid and I\u2019m crazy about her, but I didn\u2019t have any idea how much my life would change when she came to live with me.</p><p>You\u2019re right, Ali, I\u2019m absolutely certain now that I want to be a mother one day. That\u2019s a bit intimidating, though. With everything that\u2019s happened in the last few months, I\u2019ve pushed all thoughts of another relationship out of my mind. I still think I need to wait a while. Is that a biological clock I hear ticking? Not to worry, I have plenty of time. Lots of women have children when they\u2019re in their mid or even late thirties these days.</p><p>Nevertheless, I need a while to clear my head. Adam\u2019s attractive, for sure, and I might be interested in Tim if he wasn\u2019t so hung up on his ex-wife. (Tim\u2019s the divorced father I mentioned earlier.)</p><p>Write back soon and tell me more about this commander guy. He sounds like one of those mucky-muck officers. Is that good or bad?</p><p>Love ya,</p><p>Shana</p><p>Ali read the e-mail through twice and discovered she was smiling when she finished. She wasn\u2019t going to give up on Shana and Adam just yet.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s summer,\u201d Jazmine announced the first Monday after the end of school. \u201cUncle Adam\u2019s got three days off. We should all do something special to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>Shana hated to discourage Jazmine\u2019s enthusiasm, but she couldn\u2019t leave her restaurant on a whim. \u201cDo something?\u201d she repeated. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>That was all the invitation Jazmine needed. She hopped onto the barstool and rested her arms on the counter. \u201cWhen my dad was stationed in Italy, he took me to Florence right after school was out. We had so much fun, and I saw Michelangelo\u2019s David. It\u2019s really cool, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have some interesting museums in the area,\u201d Shana suggested, but her heart wasn\u2019t in it. Given her druthers, of which she had few, she would opt to visit Victoria, British Columbia. She\u2019d heard it was a lovely city and very English in style.</p><p>Jazmine sighed and shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve been to dozens of museums, but that feels too much like a school outing. This should be special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about an amusement park?\u201d Perhaps on Sunday Shana could stuff herself into a swimsuit, make Jazmine promise not to take her picture, and they could head for the local water park.</p><p>Again Jazmine was less than excited. \u201cI suppose, but I\u2019m looking for something that\u2019s not so...ordinary. Everyone goes to parks. This is a celebration. I survived a new school, made friends and Aunt Shana\u2019s still speaking to me.\u201d She giggled as she said this, and Shana laughed, too.</p><p>\u201cWe had a bit of a rough start,\u201d Shana acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cIt took me a while to adjust,\u201d Jazmine admitted in turn. \u201cUncle Adam helped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what, exactly?\u201d She recalled the backpack advice, and the fact that he\u2019d apparently told her to stop matchmaking\u2014hadn\u2019t he?\u2014but she didn\u2019t know what else he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Jazmine slid off the barstool. \u201cThat\u2019s an idea\u2014I\u2019ll call Uncle Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d Shana asked, but her question went unanswered as Jazmine hurried toward the phone.</p><p>\u201cYou should take a day just for the two of you,\u201d Catherine suggested, apparently listening in on their conversation. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here nearly every day for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew business-owners don\u2019t take days off,\u201d Shana said. It was true that she\u2019d spent every day at the restaurant, although she\u2019d taken brief breaks and nearly one whole Sunday the week before. She\u2019d felt like a new woman afterward. The thought of one entire twenty-four hour period when she didn\u2019t have her hands in pizza dough or her face in a three-gallon container of ice cream sounded heavenly. Getting away was just the respite she needed.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t for you as much as your niece,\u201d Catherine continued. \u201cKind of a reward for doing so well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shana knew she was right. Against the odds, Jazmine had succeeded in adapting to a new school and a new home, and she\u2019d made friends.</p><p>A few minutes later, Jazmine set the phone aside and raced over to Shana. \u201cUncle Adam suggested visiting Victoria, B.C.,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cI\u2019ve never been there and he said it\u2019s a wonderful day trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does sound nice,\u201d Shana said wistfully. She was astonished at the way Adam\u2019s suggestion reflected her own earlier musings about Victoria. It was almost eerie.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to talk to you,\u201d Jazmine said. She ran to get the portable phone and handed it to Shana.</p> <p>Shana walked into the back room, nervously tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. She\u2019d moussed it into submission that morning, but whole sections were already attempting a breakout.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said and hoped her voice didn\u2019t betray her feelings. She thought about this man far too often and had an intense love-hate relationship with him that he knew nothing about. She was attracted to him and yet she didn\u2019t want to be. The fact that he\u2014</p><p>\u201cShana?\u201d Adam said, cutting into her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she said primly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea of Jazmine\u2019s. You can come, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo Victoria, you mean? Ah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it a day trip. I\u2019m off until Thursday. I\u2019ll pick you and Jazmine up, then we\u2019ll take the Fauntleroy ferry over to the Kitsap Peninsula, drive to Port Angeles and take another ferry across the Strait to Victoria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m\u2014\u201d Shana hesitated when she saw Jazmine staring at her with pleading eyes. She\u2019d folded her hands as if in prayer, and Shana\u2019s resolve weakened. \u201cI\u2019ll need to check with Catherine before I take a whole day.\u201d Shana instantly felt guilty; she\u2019d invested her life savings in this business and she shouldn\u2019t be running off for a day of fun. She should be at work.</p><p>\u201cAsk her,\u201d Adam urged.</p><p>Shana turned away from the phone and came face-to-face with Catherine, who had her hands on her hips. \u201cGo. I\u2019ll manage just fine. It\u2019s only one day, for Pete\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAunt Shana,\u201d Jazmine said pulling on her arm. \u201cJust do it. We\u2019ll have a blast.\u201d</p><p>Shana wasn\u2019t nearly as sure. That night, long after Jazmine was in bed and she herself should have been, she e-mailed her sister.</p><p>Sent: June 24</p><p>From:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>To:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Subject: Jazmine, Adam Kennedy and me</p> <p>Dear Alison,</p><p>As you probably already know, I\u2019m going off on a day trip to Victoria, British Columbia, with Jazz and Adam. Basically I got talked into it, and I\u2019ll give you three guesses whose fault that is. Your daughter could talk circles around Larry King. Mark my words, that kid will have her own talk show one day.</p><p>Yes, Adam Kennedy will be there, too. I don\u2019t mind having him around anymore. I put up a good fight, let him know I wasn\u2019t interested in a relationship and even made a point of telling him about Jazz playing matchmaker. He listened politely and agreed with everything I had to say. The least he could\u2019ve done was argue\u2014just kidding! Without even trying, he\u2019s worn down my defenses. I have to admit I\u2019ve enjoyed the time I\u2019ve spent with him. Twice now, after he\u2019s visited Jazz, he\u2019s stayed for a cup of coffee and we\u2019ve talked. There hasn\u2019t been a hint of romance, although, yes\u2014I\u2019m attracted. I definitely feel we have some chemistry, but I\u2019m too preoccupied (and too scared!) to do anything about it.</p><p>Okay, I\u2019ve bared my soul. It\u2019s your turn. What\u2019s up with you and this Commander Dillon? I know you, Ali. You wouldn\u2019t have mentioned him at all if you didn\u2019t care, so I repeat\u2014what\u2019s up?</p><p>It\u2019s almost eleven and I should be in bed. Adam\u2019s arriving very early. I offered to drive over to his place, but he said it was no trouble coming to get us.</p><p>Write soon. Jazmine and I both look forward to your e-mails.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Shana</p><p>Less than twelve hours later, Shana was on a midmorning ferry that had left Port Angeles for Vancouver Island. An excited Jazmine jogged up and down the outside deck while Adam and Shana drank cups of coffee inside. They were seated on wooden benches, across from each other.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this,\u201d she muttered. The alarm had rung at four that morning and they were on the road by five.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the Olympic Mountains?\u201d Jazmine dashed inside shouting\u2014as if they could possibly have missed them. \u201cI learned in class that some of those mountains have never been climbed or explored.\u201d</p><p>This was news to Shana, but she wasn\u2019t much of an expert on Washington State history or geography.</p><p>\u201cDo either of you know about Point Roberts?\u201d Adam asked when Jazmine threw herself down on the bench, sitting next to Adam and across from Shana.</p><p>Both Shana and Jazmine shook their heads. \u201cNever heard of it,\u201d Shana said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little piece of the United States that is geographically part of Canada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jazmine frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe United States and Canada are separated by the 49th parallel at Washington and British Columbia. There\u2019s a small point of land that drops below it. That\u2019s Point Roberts. Maybe we can go there sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s in Canada but not really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a look at a map and you\u2019ll see what I mean.\u201d</p><p>While Jazmine walked over to examine the wall at the other end of the ferry, where a map of Washington was posted, Shana sipped her coffee and smiled at Adam. \u201cShe idolizes you, you know.\u201d</p><p>Adam shifted on the hard bench and crossed his arms. \u201cAs it happens, I think the world of her, too.\u201d</p><p>It was confession time for Shana, although what she had to say was probably no secret to Adam. \u201cI was jealous of that in the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s gaze held hers. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow...\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI appreciate the fact that she has you. She needs a strong male figure in her life, especially with her dad gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s come to love you, too, Shana. And it\u2019s all happened in remarkably little time. That says a lot for you, I think. You\u2019ve been patient with her and you\u2019ve managed to find just the right approach.\u201d</p><p>His praise brought a sheen of tears to her eyes. Embarrassed and wanting to hide the effect of his words, Shana quickly blinked them away.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Adam said, lowering his voice. \u201cThere\u2019s something I should probably tell you. There\u2019s a rumor floating around that several of us could be transferred to Hawaii. I\u2019ve wanted to go back for quite a while\u2014ever since I left, really. I just wish the timing was better. I should also tell you it could be soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shana cried, unable to hold back the automatic protest.</p><p>Everyone in the immediate vicinity seemed to stop and look in their direction.</p><p>Adam leaned forward and reached for her hand. \u201cDare I hope that response is for you as well as Jazmine?\u201d</p><p>Shana ignored the question. \u201cI guess I should congratulate you, then\u2014since this is an assignment you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Shana?\u201d he pressed. \u201cWill you miss me?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to drop this as easily as she\u2019d hoped. \u201cOf...course.\u201d The lump in her throat was growing as she dealt with the coming disappointment\u2014her own and Jazmine\u2019s. This would devastate her niece.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you and Jazmine, too.\u201d Adam\u2019s eyes held hers, and he brushed his thumb over her hand. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed our visits. Especially those talks over coffee.\u201d</p><p>As the old expression had it, hope sprang eternal. \u201cIt\u2019s not a for-sure decision, right? I mean, there\u2019s a possibility you won\u2019t be going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well,\u201d she said, doing her best to seem nonchalant about this unexpected turn of events. He\u2019d probably known for some time and was only now free to mention it. \u201cI guess that answers that.\u201d She tried to speak lightly, concealing her sense of loss.</p><p>He grinned sheepishly. \u201cI have to admit that Jazmine\u2019s matchmaking plans didn\u2019t upset me nearly as much as they did you.\u201d</p><p>Her responding smile felt a little shaky, which was exactly how she felt herself. During the last few weeks, she\u2019d come to like and trust Adam, and just when she was feeling comfortable with him, he made this announcement.</p><p>Adam switched seats so that he was sitting next to her. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have said anything about Hawaii yet, but I wanted you to know as soon as possible, so we can prepare Jazmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014you did the right thing.\u201d Until she\u2019d learned that he might leave, Shana hadn\u2019t realized how much she\u2019d come to rely on Adam. She and Jazmine would be on their own for the next four and a half months, and just then that felt like an eternity.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Jazmine said, running toward them. She flopped down on the wooden seat. \u201cI found Point Roberts on the map! It\u2019s really cool, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally cool,\u201d Adam agreed solemnly.</p><p>Shana didn\u2019t know how a whole day could pass so quickly. Victoria was everything she\u2019d heard and read. Although she\u2019d never been to England, she imagined it must be like this. They explored the harbor, rode a horse-drawn carriage through the downtown area, had high tea at the Empress Hotel and toured some quaint little shops. In one of them, Shana couldn\u2019t resist buying a made-in-England teapot covered in delicate little roses, while Adam got each of them a sweatshirt with maple leaves dancing across the front.</p><p>\u201cI loved the carriage ride best,\u201d Jazmine told them on the ferry ride back to Port Angeles. \u201cI wish we had time to visit Butchart Gardens.\u201d She waved a brochure she\u2019d picked up. \u201cThe pictures of the flowers are so beautiful. I always wanted a garden....\u201d She leaned her head against Shana and closed her eyes. Within moments she was asleep.</p><p>Shana carefully eased the girl off her shoulder and gently laid Jazmine\u2019s head down on the seat. Lifting the girl\u2019s legs, she set them on the bench, then covered Jazmine with her jacket. Her niece looked angelic, and Shana\u2019s heart swelled with love for this child. She felt protective and proud. Jazmine had taught her so many lessons about love.</p><p>Adam slid over so Shana could sit with him across from Jazmine. The day had been wonderful but, like Jazmine, she was tired. When Adam placed his arm around her, she gave in to the urge to rest her head against his shoulder. It was an invitation to intimacy, she realized, and she relaxed, comfortable and suddenly happy. \u201cThank you for such a special day,\u201d she whispered as he twined their fingers together.</p><p>His hold on her tightened momentarily.</p><p>Shana turned her head to look up at him\u2014and that was when it happened. She read the intention in his eyes and knew he wanted to kiss her. At first, she wondered if what she saw was a reflection of her own desire, but instinct told her he felt the same thing. For the briefest of moments, she had a choice\u2014she could either pull away or let him kiss her. Without rational thought, she closed her eyes, lifted her mouth to his and accepted his kiss. As soon as their lips met, Shana knew she\u2019d made the right decision. She felt his kiss all the way to her toes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His lips glided over hers in a slow, sensual exploration that had her nerves quivering. Luckily she was seated; otherwise she was sure her knees would have given out on her. Then his hands were in her hair, his fingers splayed as he positioned his mouth over hers. When he finally eased away, she needed a moment to regain her composure.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Adam whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again,\u201d Shana said, still caught up in the feelings his touch had aroused.</p><p>Adam slowly expelled his breath. \u201cOkay, now what?\u201d His eyes burned into hers, as if seeking answers to questions she had yet to form.</p> <p>\u201cNow...\u201d Shana hesitated. \u201cNow we know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to play this by ear?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her forehead against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve had enough piano lessons.\u201d</p><p>Adam grinned and kissed the top of her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m in no rush. We\u2019ll take this one step at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst piano lessons, and now we\u2019re out on the dance floor. Can\u2019t you just hold me for a few minutes and leave it at that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>For now, that was enough. As far as anything else was concerned, she\u2019d have to see what her heart told her.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Ali read her daughter\u2019s e-mail a second time and smiled.</p><p>Sent: June 26</p><p>From:</p> <p>[email protected]</p><p>To:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Subject: Guess what I saw</p><p>Hi Mom,</p><p>I had a great day and my favorite things were the carriage (our horse was named Silver) and having tea in a fancy hotel and watching Uncle Adam try to fit his finger in the handle of a little china cup. On the ferry home Uncle Adam and Aunt Shana sat next to each other and I was mostly asleep. They got real quiet and so I peeked and guess what? THEY WERE KISSING. Didn\u2019t I tell you they were falling in love? I knew because Uncle Adam comes by almost every day he has off now.</p><p>It gets even better. On the drive home, Aunt Shana had her head on his shoulder and then she didn\u2019t when I pretended to wake up. They were whispering a lot, too. I tried not to listen, but I couldn\u2019t help it. They were talking about Hawaii and I think it might be where they want to spend their honeymoon. Is this cool, or what?</p><p>Love ya,</p> <p>Jazz</p><p>Ali leaned back in her desk chair, feeling satisfied and more than a little cheered. Her daughter was full of news about the romance between Adam and Shana, and gladly accepted credit for it. She seemed convinced that Shana and Adam were just days away from an engagement\u2014or maybe an elopement. That certainly wasn\u2019t the impression Shana gave her, but she could see real change in her sister\u2019s attitude toward Adam.</p><p>In their last conversation, before Alison flew out of Seattle, Shana had told her she\u2019d completely sworn off men. Apparently she\u2019d reconsidered. This time, however, Shana had found herself a winner. Adam was as different from Brad as snow was from sun, and Ali hoped her sister realized it.</p><p>Her first indication of the possible romance had been the e-mail Shana had sent full of questions about Adam. Several more had followed the original; all had thinly veiled inquiries about him. Shana had become more open and honest, admitting she felt an attraction even if she hadn\u2019t decided what to do about it. Despite that, Alison saw the evidence of a growing relationship with every e-mail.</p><p>Glancing at her watch, she turned off her computer. It was time to relieve Rowland in medical. As she checked her schedule, her gaze fell on her wedding band and she paused. Should she switch it to her right hand\u2014or remove it entirely? She wanted to pass it on to Jazmine one day. Slipping the ring off her finger, she held it in the palm of her hand, weighing her options. No, she wasn\u2019t ready to give it up yet. She placed it on her right hand, instead.</p><p>The very fact that she\u2019d questioned wearing her wedding band was a sign. She would always love Peter but her life with him was over. She supposed her uncertainty about the ring had something to do with Commander Dillon, too. She didn\u2019t want him to believe she was married, but it might be safest if he did.... Still, moving the ring that represented her love for Peter to her right hand was a compromise.</p><p>As far as she could tell, this feeling of hers for Frank Dillon was completely one-sided. If he\u2019d noticed her lately, he hadn\u2019t given the tiniest hint. He couldn\u2019t. One thing she knew about Commander Dillon was that he lived and breathed for the Navy. He wouldn\u2019t go against regulations if his life depended on it, and Alison wouldn\u2019t want him to. But it made for an uncomfortable situation as they pretended there was nothing between them. Perhaps there wasn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t be sure, but in her heart she felt there was.</p><p>Commander Dillon was still recuperating in sick bay. He hated it, longed to get back to work and he was undeniably a pain in the butt. Her colleagues made their feelings known on a daily basis, but Alison simply didn\u2019t acknowledge his bad moods. As a result, the cantankerous commander didn\u2019t know what to think of her, and that was just fine with Ali.</p><p>While others avoided him, she saw as much of him as her busy schedule would allow, which was never longer than a few minutes at a time. Her feelings for him grew more intense with each day.</p><p>When she stepped into the infirmary, Lieutenant Rowland handed her his notes. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to the beast,\u201d he muttered under his breath. \u201cHe\u2019s been in a hell of a mood all day. Doc says he\u2019ll have him out this week, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s near soon enough to suit the commander.\u201d</p><p>That went without saying. When he\u2019d first arrived at the infirmary Frank Dillon had been in agony, which meant his attitude was docile\u2014at least compared to his current frame of mind. After reading Rowland\u2019s notations, Alison pulled back the curtain surrounding him. The commander sat up in bed, arms folded across his chest. He scowled when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve become a rather disagreeable patient, Commander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want out of here,\u201d he barked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no reason to yell. I believe you\u2019ve made your wishes quite clear.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his gaze.</p><p>\u201cAs it happens, Commander, you aren\u2019t the one making the decisions. You can huff and puff all you want, but it isn\u2019t going to do you a bit of good.\u201d She reached for his wrist and found his pulse elevated. Little wonder, seeing how agitated he was.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer is this going to take?\u201d he demanded gruffly.</p><p>As the lieutenant had reported, their patient was in a foul mood. Having her around hadn\u2019t eased his temper, either. \u201cI understand you\u2019ll be released this week,\u201d she said as she lowered the bed so that he was flat on his back. She needed to examine his incision. By now he knew the procedure as well as she did.</p><p>Ali carefully peeled back the bandage to check for any sign of infection. With the tips of her fingers she gently tested the area while the commander stared impatiently at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cThis is healing nicely,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cThen let me get back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t my decision.\u201d</p><p>He sounded as if he was grinding his teeth in frustration. \u201cI can\u2019t stand wasting time like this,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cCan I help in some way?\u201d she asked, thinking she could find him a book or a deck of cards.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he shouted, \u201cyou can get me out of here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that,\u201d she said reasonably. \u201cOnly a physician can discharge you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to do something before I go stir-crazy.\u201d He grimaced with pain as he attempted to sit up.</p><p>\u201cCommander, you\u2019re not helping matters.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her as though she was personally responsible for this torture. \u201cJust go. Get out of my sight. I don\u2019t want you around anymore, understand?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m responsible for your care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommander,\u201d she tried again, but he cut her off.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d He pointed at her. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>Alison swallowed down the hurt as she walked out of his cubicle. His words, harsh and vindictive, rang in her ears during the rest of her shift. He didn\u2019t want her anywhere near him and he wasn\u2019t afraid to say so. Her stomach twisted in a knot, and she felt like a fool for having made assumptions about mutual feelings that obviously didn\u2019t exist. Not on his part, anyway.</p><p>She didn\u2019t blame Frank for wanting to be back on duty, but he\u2019d taken all his resentment and anger out on her. That wasn\u2019t fair, and it added to the hurt Alison felt.</p><p>Silently she watched as the corpsman delivered his dinner tray. Dillon glanced at her, then turned away, as if he found the sight of her repugnant.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, when she walked past, she noticed that he\u2019d barely touched his meal. She considered reminding him that he\u2019d need his strength, but he wouldn\u2019t want to hear it. And she wasn\u2019t willing to risk another tongue-lashing.</p><p>Twice more during the course of her shift, Ali resisted the urge to check on him. Frank had been very explicit about the fact that he didn\u2019t want her company.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished, she returned to her quarters and curled up on her bed. After her shift she usually wrote Jazmine and her sister, but not tonight. Instead she reviewed the conversation with Frank.</p><p>She told herself it was silly to have her feelings hurt by his rudeness, that he didn\u2019t mean it, but she couldn\u2019t help taking it personally. Earlier she\u2019d always shrugged off his abrasive manner, and she couldn\u2019t understand why today was so different. Probably because she\u2019d let her attraction to him get out of hand.</p><p>Ali wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he was released the next morning, which was just as well. In a little more than four months, she reminded herself, she\u2019d be home with her daughter and soon after that she\u2019d be a civilian. This was an unsettling thought because Ali loved the Navy, but her resignation was necessary. Jazmine needed her, and Alison had given the Navy all she had to give, including her husband.</p><p>As she\u2019d suspected, Commander Dillon was released the following morning. Alison hated that his last words to her had been spoken in anger, but she tried to forget it. She wished him good health, but he was out of her life now, and it was unlikely they\u2019d see each other again. Perhaps in another time or place they might have made a relationship work. But not here and not now.</p><p>Of more interest was the romance developing between her sister and Adam Kennedy, and as soon as she could, Alison logged on to the computer to check her e-mail. She could count on hearing from Jazmine at least once a day.</p><p>To her delight, there was an e-mail from Adam, too, but as she read it, her pleasure quickly evaporated. Adam feared that now his shoulder had healed, he was about to be transferred. He\u2019d told Shana, but didn\u2019t have the heart to mention it to Jazmine until he got his papers. Almost in passing, he added how much he\u2019d enjoyed getting to know Shana.</p><p>This was dreadful! Jazmine would be devastated if Adam was transferred out of the area, and she wasn\u2019t the only one. Shana was going to be just as disappointed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a heavy heart she read her daughter\u2019s chatty e-mail next.</p><p>Sent: June 30</p><p>From:</p><p>[email protected]</p> <p>To:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Subject: Update\u2014sort of</p><p>Hi Mom,</p><p>Aunt Shana said we could plant a garden! She said we could grow vegetables and flowers. I don\u2019t want to plant green beans because then I might have to eat them. Zucchini would be all right, though. Will you give Aunt Shana your recipe for baked zucchini? Tell her to add more cheese than what the recipe calls for, okay? You had a good recipe for green peppers, too, didn\u2019t you? I could even eat those raw, but I like them better stuffed.</p> <p>I think a garden will be lots of fun, don\u2019t you? Uncle Adam said he\u2019d help. Isn\u2019t that great?</p><p>See you soon.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Jazmine</p><p>Alison didn\u2019t know where Shana would find time to start a garden. As it was, her sister worked from dawn to dusk, but the plans for this latest project showed her how hard Shana was trying with Jazmine. Somehow, the two of them had managed to talk Adam into helping. How much he could do was questionable, since he couldn\u2019t risk damaging his shoulder again, but he seemed a willing participant.</p><p>The last e-mail came from onboard ship. Not until she opened it did she see that it was from Commander Dillon. Ali stared at his name for a moment before she read his message. Five words said it all. Thank you for your excellent care. Commander Frank Dillon.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThank you, Commander.\u201d She had much to be grateful for. Because even if this was as far as it went, Frank had shown her that her heart was still alive.</p><p>Sheer weakness had prompted him to send Alison Karas that e-mail, Frank thought as he returned to his stateroom at the end of his shift. Frank was not a weak man, and he was irritated with himself for more reasons than he wanted to count.</p><p>He knew he wasn\u2019t a good patient. He just couldn\u2019t tolerate lying around in bed all day. He wanted to be back on the job, doing what he enjoyed most, contributing his skills where they were needed. If his appendix was going to give out on him, he would\u2019ve preferred it to happen while they were in port.</p><p>The worst part of his ordeal wasn\u2019t his ruptured appendix and the subsequent surgery. That he\u2019d come through with only minor difficulties. But he wasn\u2019t sure he would survive Lieutenant Commander Karas. After all these years on his own, without female companionship, committed to the Navy, he was finally attracted to a woman. Strongly attracted. She invaded his dreams and haunted his waking moments. Every day for damn near a week she\u2019d been at his bedside.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it. Just when his mind had started to clear and his system was free of those drugs they\u2019d given him, he saw something he hadn\u2019t noticed earlier. Her wedding ring. It shook him.</p><p>That first time they met, Alison Karas hadn\u2019t denied being married and she\u2019d worn a wedding ring\u2014on her left hand. He stared at the computer screen. Married. He\u2019d forgotten about it until this week. Then, when he\u2019d remembered\u2014and realized he was fantasizing about a married woman\u2014he\u2019d lost it. Even worse, she\u2019d moved the ring to her right hand. What did that say about her?</p><p>He\u2019d been impatient to get back to his duties before, but after he saw that wedding band, he was downright desperate to escape the infirmary. There\u2019s no fool like an old fool, as they said.</p><p>His anger had turned on Alison and he wanted her as far away from him as possible. Later he regretted that outburst. She\u2019d done nothing to deserve his tongue-lashing. But he found it difficult to be civil, and all because he\u2019d realized there was no hope of any kind of relationship, let alone a permanent one.</p> <p>He could accept that, but he wasn\u2019t a man who enjoyed temptation and this woman definitely fit that description. Still, he felt compelled to apologize for his rudeness. Seeing her again was out of the question, so he\u2019d decided to send an e-mail. He wrote a dozen versions before he settled on the brief and simple message, then hit Send before he could change his mind.</p><p>For better or worse, she had it now, and that was the end of it. He made his way to the first deck and lifting his head he scanned the horizon. All that stretched before him was ocean\u2014a huge blue expanse of emptiness. He saw his life like that and it bothered him.</p><p>Until now, it never had.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Adam was charmed by Jazmine\u2019s excitement about their little garden. He\u2019d managed to find someone to turn over a small patch at the back of Shana\u2019s rental house. Then Jazmine and her aunt had planted neat rows of red-leaf lettuce, peas, green peppers and three varieties of tomato. Although they\u2019d been warned by the man at the local nursery, they\u2019d purchased a number of zucchini plants, too. Apparently it did exceptionally well in the Seattle area and supplied an abundant crop. Jazmine claimed her mother had fabulous recipes for zucchini. Baked zucchini and zucchini bread and something else.</p><p>\u201cAround September if you see anyone buying zucchini in the grocery, you\u2019ll know that\u2019s a person without a friend,\u201d the nursery owner had joked as he hauled their plants out to the vehicle.</p><p>Once they were back at the house and the plants were in the freshly tilled soil, Adam watched Jazmine with amusement. Every five minutes, the girl was out in the garden checking on the plants\u2019 growth, making sure there were no slugs in the vicinity. God help them if they were. Just to be on the safe side, she carried a salt shaker.</p><p>The flower beds\u2014well, they were another story. He\u2019d lost track of all the seedlings Shana had purchased. Most of them he didn\u2019t even recognize. Pink ones and white ones, purple and yellow. They certainly made the yard look colorful. Pretty but...Women and flowers\u2014he never could understand what they found so fascinating. For himself, he thought practical made more sense than pretty, although he hadn\u2019t shared that reaction with Shana.</p><p>True, he\u2019d had a jade plant once but it died for lack of attention. Shana, predictably, had clusters of house plants\u2014on windowsills and tables\u2014but he couldn\u2019t begin to guess what types they were. Knowing Jazmine, he wouldn\u2019t have thought she\u2019d be too interested in this kind of thing, either, but apparently he was wrong. The kid loved it as much as Shana did.</p><p>\u201cAunt Shana said she\u2019d be home around eight,\u201d Jazmine informed him on Saturday at five. They\u2019d spent a quiet afternoon together. While he watched a Mariners baseball game on television, Jazmine tended the garden. He\u2019d found it relaxing, but he missed being with Shana. He would\u2019ve stopped at the ice-cream parlor, but he knew that Saturdays, especially in summer, tended to be busy.</p><p>Jazmine had patiently watered the rows of newly planted seedlings, being careful not to oversaturate the soil. She\u2019d examined every inch to check for weeds and had ruthlessly yanked up a number of small green plants; Adam suspected they were actually vegetables.</p><p>He glanced up from the post-game analysis and saw that Jazmine was standing in front of him. \u201cWe should make dinner,\u201d she announced. \u201cA real, proper dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d he muttered. In case Jazmine hadn\u2019t noticed, he wasn\u2019t the domestic type. Besides he had to protect his shoulder. Every meal in the last few weeks had come out of a microwave or in a pizza box.</p><p>\u201cWe could do it,\u201d Jazmine insisted, as if putting together a three-course meal was no trouble at all.</p><p>\u201cReally? I wouldn\u2019t mind getting takeout. Or maybe Shana could bring home a pizza. Wouldn\u2019t that be easier?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Jazmine shook her head. \u201cShe has pizza all the time. Besides, home cooking is better for you.\u201d</p><p>Adam wondered when she\u2019d become such an expert. \u201cYou\u2019re sure the two of us can do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Ah, the confidence of the young. Still, Adam had his doubts. \u201cYou should know I\u2019m kitchen-challenged.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine giggled. \u201cI cook a lot. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>If Jazmine knew her way around the kitchen, then perhaps this wouldn\u2019t be so complicated. He could supervise from in front of the TV.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to help, though.\u201d</p><p>He should\u2019ve known she wouldn\u2019t let him off scot-free. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe grocery store won\u2019t sell me wine, so you\u2019ll have to buy that.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. \u201cWine?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine nodded. \u201cAnd flowers,\u201d she said in a tone that brooked no argument.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Any particular kind?\u201d He resisted mentioning that there was a yard full of flowers outside, although they were mostly quite small.</p><p>\u201cI want you to buy roses and we\u2019re going to need candles, too. Tall ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d He bit his tongue to keep from reminding her that it wouldn\u2019t be dark until ten. \u201cShould I buy red or white wine?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jazmine stared at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cRed generally goes with meat and white wine is served with chicken or fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat goes with everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChampagne is good.\u201d</p><p>She grinned then, her decision made. \u201cBuy champagne and make it a big bottle, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you decided what you\u2019re cooking?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I have,\u201d she told him scornfully.</p><p>\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, as though she was a master chef dealing with obtuse underlings. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to cook my specialty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA surprise,\u201d she said without pause, using her hands to shoo him out the door. He watched her march into the kitchen. From the corner of his eye, Adam saw her pull several cookbooks off the shelf.</p><p>After he\u2019d finished his errands, Adam decided to visit the ice-cream parlor, after all. It was just too hard to stay away. As he\u2019d expected, Shana was doing a robust business. Catherine worked on the pizza side with a young assistant, while Shana and another part-time student served ice cream. They had at least a dozen customers waiting their turn. Adam took a seat and when Shana saw him, she blushed, fussed with her hair, then went back to helping her customers. Her self-conscious reaction pleased him. Ten minutes later, she had a chance to take a break.</p><p>After washing her hands, she joined him. \u201cHi,\u201d she said, offering him a shy smile.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t known there was a shy bone in her body until he\u2019d kissed her. That kiss had been a revelation to him. Their feelings weren\u2019t simple or uncomplicated, although he hadn\u2019t deciphered the full extent of them yet. He did know their kiss had changed them. Changed their relationship.</p><p>He\u2019d been attracted to her from the beginning and was sure she\u2019d felt the same way about him. They\u2019d skirted each other for weeks, both denying the attraction, and then all of a sudden, after that day in Victoria, it was there. Undeniable. Unmistakable. He no longer tried to hide his feelings and she didn\u2019t, either.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jazmine?\u201d she asked. \u201cIn the park?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAt home, cooking dinner. Her specialty, she says. I don\u2019t suppose you have any clue what that might be?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou left her alone?\u201d Shana\u2019s eyes widened with alarm. \u201cIn the kitchen with the stove on? Adam, she\u2019s only nine! Sometimes that\u2019s hard to remember, but she\u2019s still just a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed perfectly fine,\u201d he said, suddenly deciding Shana was right. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who sent me to the store.\u201d He slid out of the booth. \u201cI\u2019ll get back now.\u201d</p><p>Shana sighed, then stretched out one hand and stopped him. \u201cIt was good to see you,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>He gave her hand a small squeeze. \u201cYou, too. Don\u2019t be late for dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Once again Adam started toward the door, then paused and turned around. \u201cWhat\u2019s her specialty?\u201d</p><p>Shana grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s probably canned chili with grated cheese on top.\u201d</p><p>He dismissed that. \u201cI think it might be more involved. Whatever it is requires a cookbook.\u201d</p><p>Shana\u2019s grin faded. \u201cIn that case, you\u2019d better hurry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>Shana smiled again, and it reminded him\u2014as if he needed reminding\u2014how attracted he was to her. And just when their relationship was beginning to show real promise, he\u2019d be leaving the Seattle area.</p><p>She followed him to the front door. \u201cAny word on that transfer?\u201d she asked.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d think she\u2019d been reading his mind. \u201cNot yet.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be long, though. Hawaii was a dream assignment. Who wouldn\u2019t want to be stationed there? With its endless miles of white sandy beaches and sunshine, Hawaii had always appealed to him. Yet Seattle, known for its frequent drizzle and gray skies, was of more interest now than the tropical paradise.</p><p>\u201cDid you mention anything about the transfer to Jazmine?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. He couldn\u2019t make himself do it.</p> <p>\u201cCoward,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Adam shrugged lightly. \u201cGuilty as charged.\u201d</p><p>Shana glanced at her watch. \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving in about an hour and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll let Martha Stewart know.\u201d Feeling the need to touch her, he reached for her hand. Even with the restaurant full of customers, they entwined their fingers, and it was a long moment before either of them moved. He felt the urge to take her in his arms and she must have felt the same impulse because she swayed toward him before shaking her head and dropping her hand.</p><p>\u201cI should get back to work and you need to get back to Jazmine,\u201d she said, her voice little more than a whisper.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d Shana gave him a small wave. Adam heard the reluctance in her voice, a reluctance he shared.</p><p>Jazmine met him at the front door, took his bags and banned him from the kitchen. \u201cI can\u2019t be disturbed,\u201d she said grandly.</p> <p>Adam turned the television on again and sat with one ankle balanced on his knee, aiming the remote. He couldn\u2019t find anything he wanted to watch. \u201cNeed any help in there?\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later he repeated the offer.</p><p>This time Jazmine ignored him, but soon afterward, she asked, \u201cAunt Shana isn\u2019t going to be late, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d phone,\u201d Adam said, and hoped she would.</p><p>At three minutes after eight, Shana walked into the house. \u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d she said unnecessarily.</p><p>Adam stood and Jazmine hurried eagerly out of the kitchen. \u201cI hope you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamished,\u201d she said.</p><p>As if on cue, Adam\u2019s stomach growled.</p><p>With a sweeping gesture of her arm, Jazmine invited them into the kitchen. The table was covered with a tablecloth twice the right size. The cloth brushed the floor, and Adam wondered if she\u2019d used a floral printed sheet. The candles were stuck in empty Coke bottles\u2014apparently she hadn\u2019t found real candle-holders\u2014and were positioned on either side of the roses, which she\u2019d arranged in a glass bowl. The effect was surprisingly artful. There were place settings, including wine goblets, in front of the three chairs.</p><p>\u201cJazmine!\u201d Shana exclaimed, hugging her niece. \u201cThis is absolutely lovely.\u201d</p><p>The nine-year-old blushed at the praise and wiped her hands on her apron. \u201cUncle Adam helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d Adam protested.</p><p>\u201cWe can start now,\u201d she said with authority. \u201cPlease light the candles and pour the champagne. I\u2019m having soda in my glass.\u201d</p><p>He bowed slightly. \u201cAt your service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone, sit down,\u201d Jazmine ordered when he\u2019d finished. She gestured toward the table. \u201cI have an appetizer.\u201d Following that announcement, she brought out a bowl of dry Cheerios mixed with peanuts, raisins and pretzels.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Shana said, exchanging a look with Adam. They both struggled to maintain their composure.</p><p>\u201cThis is only the start,\u201d Jazmine promised, flitting about the kitchen like a parrot on the loose. \u201cI made all our favorites\u2014macaroni and cheese, Tater Tots and salad. Uncle Adam, there\u2019s no tomatoes in your salad and, Aunt Shana, no croutons on yours.\u201d</p><p>Shana\u2019s eyes met Adam\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s paying attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus macaroons for dessert,\u201d Jazmine added proudly.</p><p>\u201cMacaroons?\u201d Adam repeated.</p><p>Jazmine removed the bowl of Cheerios. \u201cYes, chocolate macaroons. Those are my favorites, so no complaining.\u201d</p><p>It was an odd meal, but Adam had no complaints and neither, apparently, did Shana.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do the dishes,\u201d he said when they\u2019d eaten. The champagne had relaxed him and Shana, too, because they lingered over the last glass while Jazmine moved into the living room.</p><p>\u201cThis really was sweet of her,\u201d Shana whispered.</p><p>\u201cVery sweet,\u201d Adam agreed. What happened next, he blamed on the champagne. Before he could question the wisdom of it, he leaned close to Shana, intending to kiss her.</p><p>She could\u2019ve stopped him, but didn\u2019t. Instead she shut her eyes and leaned toward him, too. The kiss was every bit as good as their first one. No, it was better, Adam decided. In fact, her kisses could fast become addictive\u2014a risk he\u2019d just have to take. He brought his chair closer to Shana\u2019s and she gripped his shirt collar as they kissed again.</p><p>She pulled away sometime later and pressed her forehead against his. It took him a moment to find his focus. He savored having her close, enjoyed her scent and the way she felt. Jazmine might see them, but he didn\u2019t care as long as Shana didn\u2019t\u2014and obviously she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou two need help in there?\u201d Jazmine called from the living room.</p><p>Like guilty teenagers, Shana and Adam broke apart. \u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d Shana answered.</p><p>Adam wasn\u2019t so sure that was true.</p><p>Sent: July 6</p><p>From:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>To:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Subject: My plan is working</p><p>Dear Mom,</p><p>I cooked dinner all by myself! You know what I like best about Uncle Adam? He doesn\u2019t treat me like a kid. He spent Saturday afternoon with me because Aunt Shana was at the ice-cream parlor and when I told him I was going to cook dinner, he let me. He even went to the store and left me by myself. I don\u2019t need a babysitter anymore.</p><p>When he got back, he said Aunt Shana was upset with him for leaving me all alone, but nothing happened. I made macaroni and cheese in the microwave and baked Tater Tots and made a salad. It turned out really good, and guess what?</p><p>Uncle Adam and Aunt Shana kissed again, and they didn\u2019t even care that I could see them. I pretended I didn\u2019t, but I really did. They said they wanted to wash the dishes and it took them more than an hour. Miss you bunches and bunches.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Jazmine</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>If Ali had been at home instead of aboard the USS Woodrow Wilson, she would\u2019ve turned to her favorite comfort food: cookie dough. It was that kind of day. Yes, she knew she shouldn\u2019t eat raw eggs. But when she reached this point\u2014of being prepared to scarf down a bowl of unbaked cookies\u2014salmonella seemed the least of her worries. Those ice-cream manufacturers knew what they were doing when they introduced cookie dough as a flavor. That, in her opinion, was the ultimate comfort food.</p><p>What had upset Ali, or rather who, was none other than Commander Frank Dillon. After managing fairly successfully to keep him out of her thoughts, he was back\u2014not only in her thoughts, but unfortunately, in sick bay.</p><p>Earlier in the day he\u2019d returned with a raging fever and an infection. Infection was the biggest risk with a ruptured appendix, and he hadn\u2019t been spared this complication. Ali was worried when she saw that his temperature was nearly 103 degrees. Furious, she\u2019d asked why he hadn\u2019t come in earlier.</p><p>He\u2019d refused to answer, but insisted that all he needed was a shot, and that once she\u2019d given it to him, he could go back to his duties as navigator. When she told him Captain Coleman had ordered antibiotics via IV, he seemed to blame her personally. In his anger and frustration, he\u2019d lashed out at her once again and questioned her competence.</p><p>As soon as he was hooked up to the antibiotics, and relatively free of pain, he slept for the remainder of her shift. Before leaving, she\u2019d checked on him, taking his temperature, which had fallen to just over 100 degrees.</p><p>She felt both irritated and sad. Irritated that he\u2019d delayed seeking medical attention. And sad because she suspected she might be the reason he\u2019d stayed away. According to his own comments, he wanted nothing to do with her. She couldn\u2019t help wondering if that was because of her wedding ring\u2014and yet how could it be? She\u2019d removed it from her left hand.</p><p>Anytime he\u2019d so much as glanced in her direction this afternoon, he\u2019d scowled as if he couldn\u2019t bear to be in the same room. That was ridiculous. Ali hadn\u2019t done anything to deserve this wrath. After all, he was the one who\u2019d sent her an e-mail thanking her for the excellent care. But from the way he regarded her now, anyone might think she\u2019d attempted to amputate his leg while he wasn\u2019t looking. She tried not to dwell on the things he\u2019d said to her, either today or during his first hospitalization, but she couldn\u2019t help that her feelings were hurt. She\u2019d misread the situation and now he was back and not happy about it, either.</p><p>Frank didn\u2019t understand or recognize how serious this infection was. With a fever that high, he must\u2019ve been terribly sick. Damn, he should never have waited this long!</p><p>Sent: July 7</p><p>From:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>To:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Subject: It\u2019s cookie time!!</p><p>Dear Shana,</p><p>I\u2019m tired and I want to come home.

I haven\u2019t heard you sound so down in ages. When you start talking about cookie dough, I know there\u2019s got to be a man involved. I figure this must have something to do with that commander you mentioned. I thought you said you wouldn\u2019t be seeing him again. But apparently you have and it didn\u2019t go well. Tell all!</p><p>Jazmine is fabulous, but the truth is, I had a miserable day myself. I worked from dawn to dusk, and financially it was my best business day ever, so I should be happy, right? I wasn\u2019t. I wanted to be with Jazmine and Adam, who were off at a community fair while I was stuck at the ice-cream parlor.</p><p>I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how much work is involved in owning a business like this. Catherine was the only employee willing to work this weekend and thankfully, her husband came in to lend a hand. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done otherwise. I really hated not being with Adam and Jazmine. They must\u2019ve known it, because they showed up to collect me the minute I closed for the night. I didn\u2019t have time to change my clothes or anything. Adam drove to a hilltop where we had a picnic, even though it was almost dark. Adam had bought deli sandwiches and salads. By the time we arrived home, it was after eleven. I\u2019m afraid I was exhausted and not much fun. Sometimes I wonder if buying this business was the wisest choice, but it\u2019s too late to think about that now.</p><p>Write soon.</p><p>Love,</p> <p>Shana</p><p>Alison read her sister\u2019s e-mail and tried to translate the message between the lines. Like Alison, Shana was tired. According to Jazmine, she worked long hours, starting early in the morning when she mixed the pizza dough and set it out to rise. She usually stayed until closing, which meant she often wasn\u2019t home until after nine. Thankfully her sister had had the wherewithal to hire Catherine, who\u2019d quickly become indispensable. Her other employees, mostly high-school kids, didn\u2019t seem all that reliable, but at least she had them.</p><p>Adam was spending a lot of time with Jazmine, and Alison knew very well that her daughter wasn\u2019t the only draw. He and Shana were definitely getting along, and that thrilled her. But if Adam was transferred to Hawaii, that might be the end of their relationship. Still, Alison couldn\u2019t worry about that when she had troubles of her own.</p><p>Fortunately, she had Lieutenant Rowland to talk to. He was waiting for her when she reported for duty the next afternoon.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the beast doing?\u201d she asked in a stage whisper. Compared to the commander, their other patients were downright jovial.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s responding grimace answered her question. \u201cSame. Bad-tempered as ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, great.\u201d</p><p>Rowland rolled his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly got a burr under his saddle\u2014and I think I know why.\u201d</p> <p>Alison did, too. \u201cHe hates being sick.\u201d No one enjoyed it, but the commander was worse than most. He resented every minute away from his duty station. What he didn\u2019t realize was that he wouldn\u2019t be released anytime soon. She wasn\u2019t going to be the one to tell him, either.</p><p>\u201cHis problem,\u201d Rowland said with an air of superiority, \u201cappears to be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she protested, flustered that Frank\u2019s ranting from the day before had obviously continued.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to keep you away from him.\u201d</p><p>Alison\u2019s face burned with mortification. \u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d she asked, her voice indignant despite her efforts.</p><p>Rowland\u2019s smile lacked humor. \u201cThat the United States Navy was fortunate to have you, and if he has a problem he should take it up with Captain Coleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and swallowed a painful knot of gratitude.</p><p>\u201cThe mighty commander didn\u2019t have anything to say after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Her anger simmering just below the surface, Alison squared her shoulders. \u201cI think it\u2019s time I faced the beast on my own.\u201d</p><p>Rowland\u2019s dark eyes flared. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d advise that.\u201d</p><p>Alison was past accepting her friend\u2019s advice. If Frank Dillon had even a clue what she was thinking, she\u2019d likely be up for court-martial.</p><p>Before common sense and what remained of her Navy career could stop her, she tore back the curtain to his cubicle and confronted the commander. Although he appeared to be sleeping, he must have heard her because his eyes fluttered open.</p><p>\u201cI understand you requested not to be under my care.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, and Alison was shocked to see that he refused to look at her. \u201cYou heard right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me, Commander. As far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re cantankerous and impatient and rude and...and more.\u201d</p><p>Barely controlled anger showed in the tight set of his mouth. No one with any desire to advance in the Navy spoke to a senior officer the way Alison just had.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Commander, no comment?\u201d Feet braced apart, she gave him a defiant glare.</p><p>\u201cIt would be best if you left now,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He frowned as if he\u2019d rarely been challenged, but Alison was beyond caring.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like me, Commander, and that\u2019s perfectly okay, but I would prefer to keep personalities out of this. I am a professional and I pride myself on my work. Not only have you insulted me but you\u2019ve\u2014\u201d Angry though she was, she couldn\u2019t complete the thought.</p><p>His eyes hardened, but he still wouldn\u2019t look at her.</p><p>Unable to bear another minute in his presence, she turned and walked away, feeling as though there was a huge hole in her stomach.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Shana was in much better spirits the following weekend. Her business continued to prosper, and she\u2019d hired a new part-time employee, a teenage boy this time, named Charles. Not Charlie, but Charles. Hiring, training and dealing with employees had proved to be her biggest difficulty to date. This was an area where she had little experience and it seemed her lessons were all learned the hard way. She\u2019d had to let the other two go and seemed to feel worse about it than either teenager. Charles was proving himself to be responsible and good-natured, and he and Catherine liked each other, quickly developing a bantering relationship. Shana couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine what she\u2019d do without Catherine.</p><p>After several weeks of hanging around the ice-cream parlor, Jazmine\u2019s entrepreneurial talent suddenly kicked in, and her ideas weren\u2019t bad. The kid had real imagination when it came to inventing sundaes and candy treats. She took long strands of red and black licorice and\u2014hands carefully gloved\u2014braided them, decorating each end with colorful ribbons. Then she enclosed the entire creation in cellophane wrap. She hung them everywhere she found space, creating a festive atmosphere. The price was reasonable and the kids who came into the parlor were intrigued by them, so they sold quickly.</p><p>Jazmine\u2019s creativity had sparked Shana\u2019s, and she made up and displayed small bouquets using colorful lollipops and ribbons. The candy business contributed only a small portion to the total revenue but was gaining in popularity.</p><p>Working long hours had one advantage, Shana decided; she didn\u2019t have time to think about Adam\u2019s leaving. She was afraid it would be soon, and if she allowed herself to brood on it, she\u2019d remember how much she enjoyed his company\u2014and how much she was going to miss him.</p><p>Adam still hadn\u2019t mentioned the possibility of a transfer to Jazmine. Shana didn\u2019t feel it was her place to tell Jazz, unless Adam wanted her to, but he agreed the news should come from him. He\u2019d promised he would last weekend, but then for one reason or another, he hadn\u2019t. Shana knew it would be hard to tell her and that he wanted to delay it until the transfer was official. She supposed it would be best to say nothing until he was sure. Her heart ached at the thought of Adam moving to Hawaii. Yes, it was a wonderful assignment and one he\u2019d sought out, but Shana wanted him in Seattle, selfish though that was...</p><p>At the height of the lunch business, when the restaurant smelled of baking dough and tomato sauce, and it was all Shana could do to keep up with the pizza orders, the phone rang. Catherine bustled over to answer it and her gaze flew to Shana.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d she said, holding out the receiver.</p><p>Shana finished slicing a sausage pizza still steaming hot from the oven. If it was Adam, she\u2019d call back the minute she had time to breathe. \u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAdam, I think,\u201d Catherine told her.</p><p>She realized he might have news; if so, she wanted to know as soon as possible. \u201cAsk him if it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>Catherine grabbed the phone and as Shana watched, the older woman nodded at her.</p><p>Her stomach tensed with anxiety. Shana could feel it coming even before he told her. Adam had received his transfer papers or whatever the Navy called them. That must be it; otherwise he would\u2019ve phoned her tonight.</p><p>Wiping her hands on her apron, she asked Charles to fill in for her while she answered the phone. \u201cCould you bring this pizza to table ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Shana walked to the other side of the room and took the phone from Catherine. \u201cAdam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you now.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the wall, hardly able to breathe.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said, and she could hear the regret in his voice.</p><p>She could think of no reason to delay his news, so she said it before he had a chance. \u201cYou got the transfer to Hawaii.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my orders hit the boards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re official. And I have to fly out almost right away. The officer I\u2019m replacing had an emergency.\u201d</p><p>There it was, what she\u2019d dreaded most. \u201cI see.\u201d Shana closed her eyes. Although she\u2019d known this was coming, she still felt a sense of shock. The tightness in her chest was painful, and she bit her lower lip to keep from protesting aloud.</p><p>\u201cI fly out in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d She\u2019d hoped they\u2019d have some time to say their farewells. At least one more chance to talk and decide\u2014not that there was really anything to decide. But it felt wrong for him to go like this, so quickly, without any opportunity for Jazmine or her to adjust.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She couldn\u2019t seem to say more than two words at a time. \u201cTonight?\u201d she managed through her painfully dry throat.</p><p>Despite her lack of clarity or detail, he understood the question. \u201cUnfortunately, I can\u2019t. There\u2019s too much to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Jazmine there?\u201d</p><p>Shana pressed her hand against her forehead. \u201cNo, she\u2019s at the park skating with her friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may need to tell her for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Shana\u2019s objection was immediate. \u201cYou have to do it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll phone if I can, but there are no guarantees. She\u2019s a Navy kid. She\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>Until recently Shana hadn\u2019t had much to do with the Navy. All at once she found her entire life affected by it, and frankly she was starting to get annoyed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch, I promise,\u201d Adam assured her. \u201cLeaving you and Jazmine like this isn\u2019t what I want, either.\u201d</p><p>His words didn\u2019t lessen the dejection she felt. She remembered, in an immediate and visceral way, the emotions she\u2019d experienced when she saw Brad and Sylvia together, knowing exactly what they were doing. The sensation that she\u2019d lost something vital had refused to go away. With Brad that was the signal she\u2019d needed, because what they\u2019d had wasn\u2019t real, not on his part, anyway. With Adam...with Adam all she felt was loss.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d She knew it was childish to say that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be able to visit. About Jazz\u2014I\u2019ve got meetings this afternoon, and tonight I have to pack. I\u2019ll phone when I can. If I can.\u201d</p><p>Shana knew what he was asking. She sighed wearily. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to put this on you, but if I don\u2019t reach her, you\u2019ll have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI meant what I said,\u201d he reiterated. \u201cI\u2019ll visit as often as I can.\u201d</p><p>While Adam might have every intention of flying in to see them, it would be time-consuming and complicated. Shana recalled that the flight between Hawaii and Portland was a good five hours. She\u2019d taken a brief vacation there with friends; it was the longest flight she\u2019d ever taken. Yes, his intentions were good but that was all they were\u2014intentions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got your e-mail address,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYours and Jazmine\u2019s, and I\u2019ll stay in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d She hated the fact that she still sounded like a thwarted child, but she couldn\u2019t pretend this wasn\u2019t hard.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014I promise.\u201d</p><p>Shana had no choice but to comfort herself with his word. Doing her best to seem reconciled to what was happening, she straightened. \u201cHave a safe flight, and don\u2019t worry about Jazmine. I\u2019ll explain everything to her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...Adam, thank you.\u201d Her voice cracked before she finished and she knew she had to get off the phone or she\u2019d embarrass herself further. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I really need to get back to work now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, but Shana, one last thing\u2014about you and me. We have to talk. Soon, okay?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. She couldn\u2019t. Replacing the receiver, she let her hand linger while she struggled to overcome her disappointment. With Adam stationed in Hawaii, she could forecast their future and she didn\u2019t need the aid of a crystal ball. For Jazmine\u2019s sake, he\u2019d stay in touch. Later, when Alison returned and Jazmine went back to live with her mother, he and Shana would both make an effort. At least in the beginning. Then their time together would dwindle until they were forced to face the inevitable. It was how long-distance relationships usually ended.</p><p>Shana had seen it with friends. Couples would e-mail back and forth, and on special occasions they\u2019d phone, just for the pleasure of hearing each other\u2019s voices. Adam could fly on military transports, so there might even be a weekend now and then when he\u2019d be able to visit the mainland, but she suspected those opportunities would be few and far between. They\u2019d both try, but in the end the obstacles would be too much.</p><p>Adam had been a brief season in her life. Instead of complaining, she should be grateful. The lieutenant commander had given her back her self-confidence; he\u2019d made her feel beautiful and...cherished. When she\u2019d met him, another relationship was the last thing on her mind. But Adam had proved there were still good men left in this world, and that not every man was like Brad.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Catherine asked, joining her. She rested a gentle hand on Shana\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWas it bad news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s all right,\u201d she said, shaking her head in order to dispel the lethargic feeling that had stolen over her. \u201cOr it will be soon,\u201d she amended.</p> <p>The look Catherine threw her said she wasn\u2019t convinced, and of course the older woman\u2019s instincts were accurate. Heaviness settled over Shana\u2019s heart. She didn\u2019t know why her relationships with men always fell apart. In retrospect, though, she realized she\u2019d carried the relationship with Brad. She\u2019d trusted, believed and held on. She refused to do that with Adam. She wanted a relationship of equals or not at all\u2014and she\u2019d grown increasingly sure that this was it. Her future. Good grief, she was reading a lot into a couple of kisses! It was just that everything had felt so right\u2014and now this.</p><p>An hour later, just when the pizza sales had started to diminish, Jazmine returned, her face red and sweaty from her trek around Lincoln Park on her Rollerblades.</p><p>\u201cI sold three more of your licorice braids,\u201d Shana told her, trying to act normal.</p><p>Jazmine shrugged, but Shana could tell she was pleased. Shana had managed to pick up quite a bit of the girl\u2019s body language. It wasn\u2019t cool to show too much enthusiasm if there was the slightest possibility someone her own age would see it.</p><p>As long as Shana remembered that, she was fine. But when she forgot, problems developed. However, if Jazmine and Shana were alone, or if it was Jazz with Shana and Adam, a completely different set of behavioral rules applied.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to make up a few more?\u201d Shana asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>This meant she\u2019d be happy to, but not if a friend came by and thought she\u2019d willingly agreed to do anything with or for an adult.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>At closing time, Shana counted out the money from the cash register, while Jazmine sat in a booth curled up with a book. Every now and then, Shana felt the girl\u2019s eyes on her. Catherine and Charles were finishing the cleanup in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I should know about?\u201d her niece asked as soon as they were alone. She laid her book on the tabletop, her elbows on either side of it, and stared at Shana.</p><p>Jazmine\u2019s intuition surprised her. Shana stopped in midcount and looked up. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I have the feeling you know something I don\u2019t. I hate that.\u201d</p><p>Shana wrapped elastics around the bills of various denominations, setting each stack aside. \u201cI always did, too,\u201d she said. After tucking the cash in the deposit bag, she joined her niece, sliding into the booth across from her.</p><p>\u201cSo there is something wrong.\u201d Jazmine\u2019s eyes seemed to grow darker. \u201cMy mom\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Her anxiety was unconcealed, and Shana wanted to reassure her as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes! No worries there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Her sigh of relief touched Shana\u2019s heart. \u201cThis has to do with your uncle Adam.\u201d How times changed. Only recently she\u2019d begrudged Adam the term uncle. At first, the word had nearly gotten stuck in her throat, but now it fell easily from her lips.</p><p>Shana was going to miss him so much, but at the moment she was furious that he\u2019d left the job of telling Jazmine up to her\u2014even if she\u2019d agreed to it. \u201cWhat about Uncle Adam?\u201d Jazmine\u2019s eyes seemed more frightened by the second. She scrambled out of the booth.</p><p>Shana stood, too, and placed her arm around Jazmine\u2019s thin shoulders, but her niece shook it off. In her need to comfort the girl, Shana had forgotten the rules.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me,\u201d Jazmine insisted.</p><p>Shana decided her niece was right. She\u2019d give Jazmine the news as clearly, honestly and straightforwardly as she could. \u201cThe Navy is reassigning him to Hawaii.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine spent a moment digesting the information. This was followed by a series of quickly fired questions. \u201cWhen\u2019s he flying out? He is flying, isn\u2019t he? Does he get leave first? Because he should. What about the garden? He said he\u2019d help and isn\u2019t there a whole lot more that needs to be done? Besides, he promised me he\u2019d be here and...and now he\u2019s breaking his word.\u201d As if she\u2019d said too much she covered her mouth with both hands.</p><p>Shana didn\u2019t know how to respond, where to start. \u201cHe phoned this afternoon to say his orders, uh, hit the boards and he had to leave first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine\u2019s eyes flared. \u201cAlready?\u201d She sounded shocked, disbelieving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just got the final word this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he must\u2019ve known something before now.\u201d</p><p>Shana nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe never said a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Shana could kick him for that, especially now that she was the one telling Jazmine.</p><p>Jazmine sat down again and glared at Shana suspiciously. \u201cHe told you before this afternoon, though, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Shana could probably talk her way out of this, but she didn\u2019t want to lie to her niece. \u201cHe did, or...well, he mentioned the possibility. But he dreaded telling you, so he put it off. Besides, he wasn\u2019t sure it would go through at all and certainly not this soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he made you tell me.\u201d Jazmine\u2019s anger was unmistakable, despite the softness of her voice.</p><p>Shana nodded. Adam would pay dearly for that, she suspected.</p><p>Jazmine considered this information for a couple of minutes, then casually tossed back her hair. Propping her chin on her palm, she sat very still. \u201cHow do you feel about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with it.\u201d Shana managed to sound almost flippant. \u201cBut to be on the safe side, I\u2019m bringing home a container of chocolate-mint ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Her niece gave her a confused look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m throwing myself a pity party,\u201d Shana explained. \u201cYou\u2019re invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do other than eat ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch old movies,\u201d Shana decided. The two of them could snuggle up together in front of the television, wearing their oldest pajamas.</p><p>\u201cSleepless in Seattle is one of my mom\u2019s favorites,\u201d her niece told her. Apparently the kid was familiar with this particular brand of mood therapy. Shana would have to ask Alison about it at the first opportunity. Perhaps tonight, when she e-mailed her sister.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any others we could watch?\u201d Jazmine asked. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Sleepless so often I can say all the lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Bridges of Madison County,\u201d she suggested, but sometimes that one made her angry, when what she really wanted was to weep copiously at a fictional character\u2019s tragic life. Pure catharsis, in other words.</p><p>\u201cMom said I was too young to see it,\u201d Jazmine muttered disgustedly, as though she no longer required parental guidance.</p><p>At times it was hard to remember that her niece was only nine. The kid was mature beyond her years. Alison was right about the movie, though. A story featuring infidelity hardly seemed appropriate for a child. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor her pity parties, Mom likes popcorn best. The more butter the better,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cWe had several of them after Dad died. But Mom didn\u2019t call them pity parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she call them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea parties, but we only had them when we were feeling sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways with buttered popcorn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt goes good with tea,\u201d Jazmine said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she had a name for them at first. I woke up one night and saw her crying in front of the TV, and she said sad movies always made her cry. Then I asked her why she watched them.\u201d</p><p>Shana already knew the answer to that. \u201cBecause she needed a good cry.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine nodded again. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what Mom said.\u201d The girl sighed heavily, then added in a small voice, \u201cI don\u2019t want her to be sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither, but it\u2019s part of life, Jazz. It\u2019s not good to be too sad or for too long, but being sad has its place. For one thing, sadness makes happiness that much more wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine looked at her thoughtfully, awareness dawning in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cNow, it\u2019s been a while since I had an official pity party,\u201d Shana said briskly. \u201cOne is long overdue.\u201d She\u2019d made a couple of weak attempts when she left Brad, but she\u2019d been too angry with him to do it properly. If anything, their breakup had left her feeling strong and decisive. That high hadn\u2019t lasted, and she\u2019d found it emotionally difficult to reconcile herself to the end of the relationship\u2014but only for a short time. Thanks to Adam...</p><p>She thought that breaking off her engagement\u2014or whatever it was\u2014with Brad did call for a party, but a real party with banners and food, champagne and music and lots of people. She smiled as she considered how far she\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Jazmine asked.</p><p>Shana instantly sobered. \u201cRemember a few weeks ago, when you said I had issues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of those issues was Brad.\u201d</p> <p>Jazmine rolled her eyes. \u201cTell me about it!\u201d</p><p>Shana laughed out loud. \u201cI was just thinking I never really had a pity party over him.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine cocked her head quizzically. \u201cDo women always throw these parties because of men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Shana had never given the matter much thought. \u201cYes,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s always about men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured.\u201d Jazmine shook her head sadly, as if this reasoning was beyond her.</p><p>They loaded up with chocolate-mint ice cream, and whipped topping for good measure, and headed out the door. Shana had to make a quick stop at the bank, but they were home before the ice cream had a chance to melt.</p><p>Within ten minutes, they were both lying on their backs, dressed in old flannel pajamas, studying the ceiling.</p> <p>\u201cRemember when Brad phoned you a little while ago?\u201d Jazmine asked.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Shana didn\u2019t want to dwell on Brad. She wanted to think about Adam and how much they were going to miss him. Brad paled in comparison to Adam Kennedy.</p><p>\u201cWhy did he call?\u201d</p><p>Shana rolled onto her stomach and raised her head. \u201cHe realized the error of his ways.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine rolled over, too. \u201cAre you going to take him back?\u201d</p><p>Shana didn\u2019t even need to think about it. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine solemnly agreed. \u201cHe had his turn.\u201d</p><p>Boy, did he!</p><p>\u201cUncle Adam is next in line.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to Shana to explain that pity parties were usually wakes for relationships. This wake was for Adam and her. Shana was cutting her losses now, doing her best to accept the likely end of their brief romance and move forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat if Brad came to Seattle?\u201d Jazmine asked excitedly, as if that were a distinct possibility. \u201cWhat would you do then?\u201d</p><p>Shana flopped onto her back again. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a single, solitary thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he offered you an engagement ring?\u201d</p><p>Shana grinned. \u201cFirst, I\u2019d faint from the shock of it, and then I\u2019d...I\u2019d ask to see his ID. Make sure this was really Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d turn him down, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Shana pulled herself into a sitting position. \u201cIs there any particular reason for all these questions about Brad?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine sighed loudly. \u201cI wanted to be sure you\u2019re really, really over that rat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Mom called him.\u201d</p><p>Shana smothered a giggle. \u201cHey, I thought we were throwing this party because of your uncle Adam,\u201d she said. It hadn\u2019t escaped her notice how cleverly Jazmine had changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why bring up Brad?\u201d</p><p>Her question was met with silence, and then Jazmine ventured, \u201cRemember how you knew Uncle Adam might be stationed in Hawaii and you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but what\u2019s that got to do with\u2014\u201d She hesitated and drew in her breath. \u201cIs there something you aren\u2019t telling me?\u201d she demanded, aware that she was repeating Jazmine\u2019s earlier question.</p><p>Her niece sighed dramatically. \u201cPromise you won\u2019t be mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJazmine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Brad phoned again. I answered and I told him you\u2019re seeing someone else now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Jazmine giggled. \u201cI did, and you don\u2019t want to know what he said about that, either.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean Brad phoned?\u201d Shana demanded. \u201cWhen? And why?\u201d Not that she cared. Okay, she did, but only a little. He\u2019d talked to her once, a few weeks ago, and she\u2019d been polite and stiff and frankly had never expected to hear from him again. At one time, she\u2019d dreamed about a big wedding with lots of bridesmaids all dressed in lovely pastel dresses of pink and yellow. Her sister and three of her best friends would\u2019ve looked like a neat row of huge after-dinner mints. At least she\u2019d spared them that.</p><p>\u201cHe called last week and I answered the phone,\u201d Jazmine muttered. \u201cWe...talked. For a while.\u201d</p><p>That sounded ominous. Shana could only imagine what Brad had to say to her niece\u2014and vice versa.</p><p>\u201cHe told me he wants you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he does,\u201d Shana muttered. That made sense. Now that she was out of his life, he missed everything she\u2019d done for him.</p><p>\u201cWhen he asked how your social life was these days\u2014that\u2019s exactly what he said\u2014I told him about Uncle Adam and he wasn\u2019t very happy,\u201d Jazmine continued.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shana agreed. \u201cHe probably wasn\u2019t.\u201d Just like Brad to pump a nine-year-old for information.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything,\u201d Jazmine muttered, \u201cbut I wanted Brad to know he lost out on the opportunity of a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>That was a typically grandiose Jazmine remark, and Shana smiled. Still, it was gratifying to know Brad missed her, even if it was for the wrong reasons. He must\u2019ve been shocked to learn she\u2019d met someone else.</p><p>\u201cI hope you aren\u2019t mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but...it isn\u2019t a good idea to be giving out personal information over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but he kept asking me about your social life and if you were seeing anyone, and it felt good to tell him you were and that Uncle Adam is a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy.\u201d This was said with a good deal of pride.</p><p>Shana bet that caused ol\u2019Brad to sit up and take notice.</p><p>\u201cI wish my mom was here,\u201d Jazmine confessed suddenly. \u201cI\u2019m worried about her.\u201d</p><p>Shana wrapped her arm around Jazmine\u2019s shoulders and drew her close. \u201cShe seems to be in good spirits.\u201d Or she had been until recently.</p><p>\u201cShe sounds happy when she e-mails me,\u201d Jazmine said. \u201cBut sometimes I wonder if she\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>The kid certainly had her mother pegged.</p><p>Jazmine leaned against Shana. \u201cThis has been good,\u201d she said decisively. \u201cIt\u2019s even better than a tea party. Except we didn\u2019t watch a movie or eat our ice cream\u2014but we can do that now. How about...the first Harry Potter movie? I\u2019ve got the DVD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss Uncle Adam,\u201d Jazmine told her sadly. \u201cIt won\u2019t be the same without him.\u201d</p><p>Shana could only agree.</p><p>Jazmine was asleep an hour later. She lay curled up on the sofa with an afghan covering her. Shana turned off the television set and logged on to the computer.</p><p>Sent: July 15</p><p>From:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>To:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Subject: My love/hate relationship with men!</p><p>Dear Ali,</p><p>I hope you realize what a terrific kid you have. Jazmine and I have just spent the last two hours sharing secrets (plus eating ice cream and watching a Harry Potter movie).</p><p>Adam got his orders for Hawaii and didn\u2019t even have time to say goodbye. Even worse, I got stuck telling Jazmine.</p><p>Trust me, I wasn\u2019t too happy with him. I would\u2019ve let him know how I felt about that, but I was in shock. Do transfers always happen this fast in the Navy? Never mind, he already explained that they don\u2019t. Getting back to Jazmine. She took the news about Adam fairly well. I wasn\u2019t sure what I expected and I know she\u2019s upset, but as Adam said, she\u2019s a Navy kid. She did ask if I knew in advance, and I had to confess that I did. Once I admitted I\u2019d been holding out on her, her own heavily guarded secret came out.</p><p>Are you ready for this? Our Jazmine had a conversation with Brad! Apparently he phoned and she informed him I was seeing someone else. I wish she hadn\u2019t.... Well, to be honest, that\u2019s not entirely true. He told Jazmine that he misses me. Interesting, don\u2019t you think? Not to worry, I\u2019d never go back to him.</p><p>Once we\u2019d both confessed our secrets, we talked about you and discovered we\u2019re both concerned. Jazz is afraid you\u2019re hiding your feelings from her\u2014and Alison, I have to tell you that your daughter has good instincts. I didn\u2019t say anything, but I know you\u2019ve been down lately. You refuse to answer my questions about Commander Dillon, and my guess is this involves him. I know, I know, you\u2019ve already said it a dozen times\u2014there\u2019s nothing between you. Technically I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true, but...there\u2019s more to the situation, isn\u2019t there?</p><p>What you say or don\u2019t say to Jazz is up to you, but she sees through you far too easily, so don\u2019t try to pull the wool over her eyes. Jazmine would rather deal with the truth than worry about what\u2019s troubling you. Oh, one last thing. The kid has graduated from tea parties to ice cream. You can thank me for that.</p><p>Keep in touch.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Shana</p><p>The following evening, when Shana arrived home from work exhausted, cranky and hungry for something other than pizza or canned chili, the phone rang. With unwarranted optimism, she opened the refrigerator and searched for inspiration\u2014something easy and fast that would pass for healthy. Or sort of healthy. The wilted green pepper, leftover Chinese fried rice and half can of clam chowder weren\u2019t appealing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The phone was still ringing and Shana looked around to see where Jazmine had disappeared. Normally she didn\u2019t need to worry about answering the phone because her niece leaped on it like a hungry cat on a cornered mouse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d she called out when she saw that the bathroom door was closed. Grabbing the phone, Shana cradled it against her shoulder and turned to the cupboard in a second attempt to find a supper solution.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d The cupboard, stacked with canned foods, offered little in the way of ideas.</p><p>\u201cShana.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAdam?\u201d In her excitement she nearly dropped the phone. She\u2019d hoped she\u2019d hear from him, but hadn\u2019t dared believe. He missed her, he said; he\u2019d been thinking about her. Instantly her heart went on alert. She was afraid to put too much weight on a single phone call and yet so pleased it was all she could do not to leap up and down.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my girl?\u201d he asked in a low, sexy voice.</p><p>Shana sighed and leaned against the wall. \u201cI\u2019m doing great.\u201d Especially now that she\u2019d heard from him.</p><p>\u201cI was asking about Jazmine,\u201d he teased.</p><p>Shana laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s great, too. I want you to know we had a pity party over you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind\u2014it\u2019s a girl thing.\u201d She felt so buoyant, so happy, she couldn\u2019t prevent a giggle from slipping out.</p><p>Adam went directly to the reason for his call. \u201cI got an e-mail from Jazmine and it started me thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou received an e-mail from her already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually she sent this before I flew out. Can I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJazz said that Brad phoned you recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d she asked lightly, dismissing the question because he had no reason for concern. It would be manipulative to play one man against another, and she refused to do it.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d he admitted with obvious reluctance. \u201cI need to know if you\u2019re serious about Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re phoning me all the way from Hawaii because you\u2019re afraid of a little competition?\u201d she asked. \u201cAdam, you should know better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompetition doesn\u2019t frighten me, but I have to know where I stand with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re talking about Brad,\u201d she said, letting her bewilderment show in her voice.</p><p>Adam held his ground. \u201cAccording to Jazmine, you have what she calls issues and one of those issues is Brad, and I figured\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad,\u201d she interrupted, \u201cis out of my life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApparently no one bothered to tell him that. I know of two times he\u2019s contacted you. Are there others?\u201d</p><p>Shana was completely dumbfounded now. \u201cYou men are all alike,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re so...so territorial. Why are we even having this conversation?\u201d She lifted the hair from her forehead and pressed her hand there as if to contain her outrage\u2014or her growing headache. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t work. She could think of only one reason Brad had revealed any new interest, and that was because he believed she\u2019d become involved with another man. He considered Shana \u201chis.\u201d Now Adam was doing the very same thing.</p><p>\u201cAre you upset with me?\u201d he had the audacity to ask.</p><p>\u201cYou must be joking.\u201d If she had to tell him, then there was something lacking in her communication skills. \u201cYes, Adam, I am upset. You don\u2019t seem to care about me. Your big concern is that I might be tempted to go back to Brad.\u201d</p><p>They both took a moment to let the sparks die down. Shana was afraid to say anything more, afraid the conversation would deteriorate further and they\u2019d reach a point of no return.</p><p>The bathroom door opened then and Jazmine stepped out, hair wrapped in a towel.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Shana said, shoving the telephone receiver toward her. \u201cIt\u2019s your uncle Adam. Talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShana, we aren\u2019t finished yet,\u201d she heard him yell.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, we are,\u201d she said loud and clear. She just couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>Jazmine tentatively accepted the phone, but the conversation was short. Angry, and uncertain how to cope with her anger, Shana paced across the kitchen floor to the window and stood there, staring out at the garden.</p><p>Jazmine turned to her after she\u2019d hung up the phone. \u201cShould I get out the ice cream?\u201d</p><p>Shana managed to smile. \u201cYou know, that doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Commander Frank Dillon figured he had to be the biggest jerk alive, but in his own defense, his behavior toward SMO Karas was motivated strictly by self-preservation.</p><p>A week after he\u2019d gone back to sick bay, he was released. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t soon enough. Every second he spent in close proximity to Alison was pure agony. More times than he wanted to admit, he had to remind himself that she was married. Married with a capital M. All he had to do was glance at the ring to remember she was off-limits. Granted, she\u2019d switched it to her right hand, but that act of deception actually bothered him more.</p><p>He\u2019d fallen for her, and fallen hard. Whenever he saw her, his heart did a free fall\u2014like a paratrooper diving from a plane\u2014until he saw that damned ring. Then he knew it was time to pull the rip cord and put an end to his ridiculous fascination with the woman.</p><p>This sort of thing didn\u2019t happen. Not to him. He was particularly confused by the fact that although Alison wore a wedding band, she\u2019d sent him some pretty clear signals\u2014signals that said she was interested and available. While he was undeniably tempted, Frank felt sickened by her lack of respect for her husband and her vows. He wanted nothing more to do with her.</p><p>Back on the bridge at the end of his shift, Frank knew the crew had been eagerly waiting for the USS Woodrow Wilson to make its port call in Guam. Shore leave had been granted.</p><p>During his years in the Navy, Frank had sailed all over the world, and his favorite destination was the South Pacific. He\u2019d read many accounts of the action here during World War II, as well as histories of the explorers.</p><p>\u201cYou headed ashore?\u201d Commander Howden asked, joining Frank on the bridge.</p><p>Frank, still feeling the effects of his surgery, had decided against leaving the carrier. There would be ample opportunity on other voyages. \u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few of us are talking about golf and dinner. Why don\u2019t you come along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll give it some thought.\u201d Frank wouldn\u2019t willingly admit it, but he felt too weak. A round of golf would probably do him in.</p><p>Howden started to walk away, then unexpectedly turned back. \u201cI met the senior medical officer the other day\u2014Alison Karas,\u201d he said casually.</p><p>Frank stiffened at the sound of her name.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good woman. I knew her husband.\u201d</p><p>Frank\u2019s jaw tightened at his use of the past tense. \u201cKnew?\u201d</p><p>Hal nodded. \u201cHe was killed a couple of years ago in a training accident. He\u2019d been aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln. You heard about it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014but I didn\u2019t make the connection.\u201d Frank spoke quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo reason you should, I suppose,\u201d Howden continued. \u201cI just realized it myself.\u201d</p><p>Frank felt angry with himself for the false assumptions he\u2019d made. Alison was a widow and all along, all this time, he\u2019d believed she was married and unfaithful. He hated everything he\u2019d been thinking about her, hated the way he\u2019d magnified her supposed transgressions in his mind. He knew why he\u2019d done it\u2014because he was afraid of what might happen.</p><p>As soon as possible, Frank went down to sick bay. He needed\u2014no, wanted\u2014to apologize. He couldn\u2019t explain his behavior, but he could let Alison know he regretted what he\u2019d said and done. Perhaps the best course of action was to leave things as they were, but he was unwilling to do that.</p><p>He found Lieutenant Rowland on duty in sick bay. Not an enviable task when the majority of his shipmates were touring paradise. The lieutenant snapped to attention when Frank came in.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you, Commander?\u201d</p><p>Frank returned the salute. \u201cAt ease. I\u2019m looking for Ali. Do you know where I might find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAli?\u201d The young officer couldn\u2019t hide his surprise. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, she\u2019s gone ashore.\u201d</p><p>Frank had guessed as much. \u201cDid she happen to mention where she was going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, but I suspect she\u2019s headed toward the Farmer\u2019s Market. A few of the other women officers mentioned they were planning to check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Frank said as he spun around. His energy had been waning, but adrenaline pumped through him now as he hurried off the ship. Fortunately, he was familiar with the island and grabbed the first taxi he saw, paying the driver handsomely.</p><p>The streets swarmed with sailors, tourists and locals. The carnival-like atmosphere was everywhere. Music played, chickens squawked and locals hawked their wares, eager to separate the sailors from their hard-earned dollars. The market was so crowded it was nearly impassable.</p><p>In this mass of humanity, Frank wondered if locating Alison was a lost cause. That didn\u2019t discourage him, but he knew his odds weren\u2019t good.</p><p>What he should do, Frank decided after a fruitless hour, was think like a woman. The problem with that was he didn\u2019t know how a woman thought. If he did, his marriage might\u2019ve lasted longer than two years.</p><p>Marriage. The word shot through his brain. Even if he located Ali, he wasn\u2019t sure exactly what he\u2019d say to her, or how she\u2019d react. He\u2019d apologize, that much he knew. He must\u2019ve been intolerable the entire time he was in sick bay, and he admired the way she\u2019d confronted him, admired her professionalism. It wasn\u2019t easy to admit he\u2019d been a colossal jerk; if for no other reason, Frank owed her an apology. Then, with his conscience clear, he\u2019d walk away and that would be the end of it.</p><p>Suddenly he saw her. She was with a group of female officers, examining a bolt of silk. A flower lei was draped around her neck and the sun shone on her gleaming dark hair. Gazing at her, Frank stood stock-still as the human traffic moved around him.</p><p>He watched Ali run her palm over the red silk and ask the proprietor one question and then another. Frank couldn\u2019t hear the man\u2019s response, but apparently she didn\u2019t like it because she promptly shook her head and left without further haggling.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen Frank, since she was moving straight toward him. He remained frozen, waiting for her to notice that he was there. The two women with her recognized him first. One of them, another lieutenant commander, tilted her head toward Alison and he saw Alison\u2019s eyes swing in his direction. Almost immediately she looked away, an expression of discomfort on her face.</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Commander Karas,\u201d he said crisply, stepping up to her. Perhaps she\u2019d think he was on official business. \u201cI need a moment of your time.\u201d</p><p>She blinked as if gathering her composure.</p><p>He scowled at her companions and they quickly took the hint.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll meet up with you later,\u201d one friend stated, setting off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The other lingered a moment, obviously concerned about leaving Ali in the company of the ogre patient. But at Ali\u2019s nod, she rejoined the first woman.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help you, Commander?\u201d Ali asked. Her shoulders were back as if she expected another ugly confrontation.</p><p>Frank wasn\u2019t good at apologizing. It wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d had much practice at. He began to speak, and then paused to clear his throat before he could get out even one short sentence. \u201cI want to apologize for last week.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flared briefly, but she didn\u2019t respond.</p> <p>\u201cI have no excuse for my rude and arrogant behavior,\u201d he went on, repeating the very words she\u2019d used to describe him. He despised humiliation in any form, but in this instance he deserved it.</p><p>\u201cApology accepted, Commander. No one likes being sick and helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he agreed, willing to accept her explanation.</p><p>His remark was followed by silence. Frank usually didn\u2019t have problems expressing his views, but just then, standing in a crowded market in the middle of a South Pacific island\u2014standing there with Ali\u2014he couldn\u2019t think of a single intelligent thing to say.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate everything you did to make my stay as comfortable as possible,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she said abruptly. She seemed eager to leave.</p><p>Frank didn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d she prodded when he didn\u2019t resume the conversation.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said without inflection, but he wanted to scream that there was. He just didn\u2019t know how to say it. Had they been anyplace else, he might have found the courage to let her know he admired her.</p><p>Without another word, she turned and walked toward her friends who stood at a booth, ignoring the proprietor and focusing their attention on him and Ali. Both women seemed to have plenty of opinions, because their heads were close together and they talked rapidly. Frank hated being the object of their scrutiny, but there was no help for it. He\u2019d done what he could; now he had to leave things as they were.</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Commander Karas,\u201d he called out sharply, stopping her.</p> <p>Alison glanced over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI heard\u2014I\u2019m sorry about your husband.\u201d</p><p>For the briefest of moments, in the second or two it took her to blink, Alison\u2019s eyes went liquid with grief. She quickly regained control of her emotions. \u201cThank you, Commander. Like you, Peter dedicated his life to the Navy.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and felt properly put in his place.</p><p>That said, Ali joined her friends. The three of them left and were swallowed up by the crowd.</p><p>If searching for Ali was out of character, what he did next was even more so. He returned to the silk merchant and purchased the entire bolt of fabric Alison had so recently examined. The hell if he knew what to do with fifteen yards of red silk.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you when you\u2019ve got a free moment,\u201d Catherine said as soon as Shana showed up for work Monday morning.</p> <p>Dread instantly filled her. It was said bad news came in threes. Adam had left for Hawaii, Brad wanted her back\u2014or so he\u2019d claimed\u2014and now she feared the worst calamity of all. Her most valued employee was about to quit. Shana could deal with just about anything except that.</p><p>\u201cN-now is convenient,\u201d she managed to stutter. It wasn\u2019t, but she\u2019d have an ulcer if she put this off.</p><p>Catherine joined her in the kitchen but kept an eye on the ice-cream counter in case a customer came in.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to quit, are you?\u201d Shana asked point-blank. Catherine had quickly become her friend and confidante. \u201cBecause if you do, I\u2019m throwing in the towel right now.\u201d</p><p>Catherine brushed aside her concern with a wave of her hand. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not quitting. I love my job.\u201d</p><p>Relief washed over her, and Shana reached out to hug the other woman. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful...I don\u2019t think I could take much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I thought we should talk,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to put my nose where it doesn\u2019t belong, but like I said when you interviewed me, I worked in the school cafeteria for almost fifteen years. We were a close-knit group and were able to discuss everything with one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to feel free to do the same here,\u201d Shana assured her.</p><p>A smile relaxed the older woman\u2019s features, and Shana could see that she\u2019d been worried. \u201cOkay. I have a couple of ideas I\u2019d like to try out, so we can take ice-cream requests in a more orderly fashion,\u201d Catherine said, \u201cbut I understand this is your business and I won\u2019t take offense if you don\u2019t think they\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you can suggest would be appreciated,\u201d Shana told her. \u201cYou\u2019re my most important asset, and I want you to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wrote everything out for you to read at your leisure,\u201d Catherine said, handing her an envelope.</p><p>Shana tucked it inside her apron pocket. \u201cPlease feel free to share any ideas you have with me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in all your suggestions.\u201d</p><p>Catherine positively beamed at the praise. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t want you to get the notion that I\u2019m taking over the shop or being dictatorial,\u201d she said.</p><p>That notion was laughable. \u201cI\u2019d never have survived the last couple of weekends without you and your husband.\u201d</p><p>Catherine\u2019s eyes brightened at the mention of her husband. \u201cLouis had the time of his life.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been wonderful with the customers and reminded Shana of the Olsens, who\u2019d owned the shop for all those years. Catherine and Louis were so natural with children and treated everyone like family. Shana envied their ability, and knew this kind of friendliness was a big reason her customers returned over and over again. She\u2019d been fortunate to hire Catherine, and Louis was a bonus...and a darling.</p><p>\u201cYou know who to call if you want another day off.\u201d Catherine smiled. \u201cIn fact, Louis said if you\u2019re ever looking to sell, we\u2019d like the right of first refusal, but I told him you\u2019d just bought the business and it wasn\u2019t likely you\u2019d be interested in selling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ll certainly keep that in mind.\u201d Shana had invested her entire financial future in this shop. So far, she was meeting payroll and keeping her head above water, but this was her busy season. The Olsens had warned her that the winter months could be a fiscal challenge. Shana hoped to find ways to stay afloat when the weather was dreary. Ice-cream sales would decrease in winter, but she hoped the pizza part of the business would continue to flourish. Thankfully, Lincoln Park was much-used year round.</p><p>\u201cAlso,\u201d Catherine added, sounding hesitant. \u201cI know this isn\u2019t any of my concern, but it seems to me you haven\u2019t been yourself the last few days.\u201d</p><p>So it was that obvious.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d the other woman asked gently, in the same way Ali might have done had she been there. Trading e-mails was better than nothing but they weren\u2019t a substitute for face-to-face communication.</p><p>Shana slumped against the wall and automatically shook her head. For three nights straight, she hadn\u2019t slept more than a couple of hours. When she did manage to drift off, she dreamed of Adam and then woke tired and depressed.</p><p>\u201cMan troubles?\u201d Catherine asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me, not unless you want. But sometimes just talking things out with someone else can help.\u201d</p><p>Shana nodded, reflecting that the school district had lost a wonderful employee. In Shana\u2019s opinion, Catherine was much too young to retire.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that, well...this is complicated.\u201d Shana wasn\u2019t sure how to explain without going into more detail than necessary.</p><p>\u201cDoes this have to do with Brad or Adam?\u201d Catherine prompted.</p><p>Shana\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cHow do you know about Brad?\u201d Her eyes narrowed and she answered her own question. It could only be her niece. \u201cJazmine.\u201d</p><p>Catherine nodded, folding her hands. She looked about as guilty as a woman can. \u201cJazmine and I are friends, and the truth of it is, she confided in me because she\u2019s worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is, is she?\u201d Shana couldn\u2019t wait to ask Jazmine about this.</p><p>\u201cJazmine is a dear girl and she meant well,\u201d Catherine said immediately.</p><p>\u201cWho else has she told?\u201d Shana demanded. Apparently her heart-to-heart with her niece hadn\u2019t been as effective as she\u2019d hoped. Jazmine seemed intent on spreading Shana\u2019s problems throughout the entire neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s mentioned it to anyone else,\u201d Catherine was quick to reassure her. \u201cCertainly not Charles. I can\u2019t be positive, of course, but...\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Shana echoed. Jazmine was a handful. Spending her days at the park with friends or in the ice-cream parlor with Shana wasn\u2019t the ideal situation, but it was the best that could be done for now. Unless Shana looked into some kind of summer camp for her...</p><p>\u201cThe only reason Jazmine said anything was because I asked her if she knew what was bothering you. So if anyone\u2019s to blame, it\u2019s me,\u201d Catherine insisted, her face reddening. \u201cI apologize, Shana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d But Shana decided she\u2019d still ask Jazmine later.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d Catherine offered. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m a good listener.\u201d</p><p>After several sleepless nights, Shana could use some advice. \u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed with a deep sigh. \u201cMy life\u2019s a bit of a mess at the moment,\u201d she said, then proceeded to tell Catherine about her five-year relationship with Brad and how it had ended. She described how he\u2019d been an important part of her life, and then he was gone; just after that, Jazmine had arrived and on the heels of her niece Adam Kennedy showed up.</p><p>Catherine nodded often during the course of their lengthy one-sided discussion.</p><p>\u201cAre you in love with Adam?\u201d she asked when Shana had finished.</p><p>\u201cYes. No. How can I be?\u201d She paused. \u201cGood grief, I\u2019m the last person who\u2019d know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love Brad, though?\u201d Catherine continued.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d This came without the slightest hesitation. \u201cAlthough I loved him at one time. At least, I believed I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think breaking off a relationship is ever as easy as we want it to be,\u201d Catherine said thoughtfully. \u201cWe invest our hopes and dreams in a particular relationship, and when that doesn\u2019t work out, we sometimes have difficulty admitting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Shana nodded, remembering the years she\u2019d devoted to Brad with such hope for a future together.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if what you really want is for Brad to recognize how much he wronged you.\u201d</p><p>Shana grinned. That was so true, it was almost painful.</p><p>\u201cIt gives women a sense of vindication,\u201d Catherine pronounced solemnly, \u201cwhen a man realizes the error of his ways.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shana nodded again. She wished she\u2019d talked to her friend weeks ago; Catherine saw everything with such clarity and insight.</p><p>\u201cAre you tempted to take him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all...\u201d She let the rest fade.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d The thought had only occurred to her now. \u201cUntil I talk to him...\u201d Even as she said the words, Shana knew that a telephone conversation wouldn\u2019t be enough. She needed to see Brad, talk to him in person, which she hadn\u2019t really done, not after that one dramatic scene when she\u2019d confronted him with what she knew about Sylvia. Then she\u2019d gone to Seattle to think. She\u2019d phoned him, but hadn\u2019t spoken to him in person. Shana had never honestly explained her dissatisfaction with the relationship\u2014aside from the Sylvia issue\u2014nor had she made clear that reconciliation was out of the question. Her severing of the relationship wasn\u2019t a ploy to get him back. And it wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d done on a whim.</p><p>Shana looked at Catherine.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Catherine said, \u201cI think talking to Brad is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too.\u201d Shana removed her apron and carelessly tossed it over the back of a chair. \u201cCan you take over for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d Catherine asked, seemingly surprised at how quickly Shana was acting.</p> <p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019ll take Jazmine to Portland with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to call Louis, but I\u2019m pretty sure he hasn\u2019t got anything planned for the next few days. Let me find out.\u201d She walked over to the phone, and after just a minute\u2019s discussion, replaced the receiver. \u201cHe said he\u2019d be delighted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Her decision made, her resolve strong, Shana went outside to collect Jazmine.</p><p>\u201cOne question,\u201d Catherine said, stopping her on her way out the door. \u201cWhat do you want me to say if Adam phones?\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t likely to happen, but she certainly didn\u2019t want her friend to divulge that she\u2019d gone off to see Brad. \u201cOur last conversation ended kind of badly, so I doubt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that earlier,\u201d Catherine broke in, \u201cbut I bet he\u2019ll be phoning soon. He probably regrets how things went as much as you do.\u201d</p> <p>Shana did regret it and although she hadn\u2019t said so, Catherine had intuitively known. \u201cTell him I\u2019m visiting an old friend out of town.\u201d It would be the truth, because she planned to call Gwen Jackson as soon as she got home. As she spoke, Shana absently watched a delivery truck pull into the parking space in front of the restaurant.</p><p>The bell above the door jangled cheerfully, and Catherine hurried out of the kitchen. Shana followed her, sorry their conversation had been interrupted.</p><p>All she saw was a large FedEx box.</p><p>\u201cShana Berrie?\u201d the delivery man asked.</p><p>Catherine gestured toward Shana.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Shana,\u201d she responded, trying to remember if she\u2019d recently ordered anything that would come by overnight courier. She couldn\u2019t think of a thing.</p><p>Jazmine trailed the delivery man inside. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked excitedly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Shana signed the clipboard and yanked the tab at the end of the box. The sender\u2019s name was that of a floral company in...It started with a W but a large smudge obscured the rest of the word.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably from Brad,\u201d Jazmine muttered disdainfully. \u201cI told you he wants you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Shana said, shaking her head. Anything he had to send her wouldn\u2019t come in a box. She\u2019d been waiting for a small jewelry box from him long enough to guarantee that.</p><p>When the carton was open, two orchid leis slid onto the counter. Waikiki\u2014that was it. Hawaii. Well, that was one puzzle solved. Catherine gave an immediate gasp of wonder at their delicate beauty.</p><p>\u201cUncle Adam,\u201d Jazmine burst out in a squeal of unrestrained delight.</p><p>\u201cIs there a card?\u201d Catherine asked.</p><p>Shana searched the inside of the box and found it. \u201cTo my two favorite girls. I miss you. Adam.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine draped one of the leis over her shoulders, beaming with joy.</p><p>Shana wasn\u2019t nearly as pleased. \u201cThat was a cowardly thing to do,\u201d she declared. Just leave it to a man to let flowers do his talking for him. Well, she\u2019d deal with Adam later, but at the moment she had another man on her mind, and that was Brad Moore.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Shana felt as if she was on a mission now. What Catherine had said was so true\u2014it was as difficult to let go of the expectations created by a relationship as the relationship itself. She needed to complete the process of disconnecting herself from Brad.</p><p>The minute she arrived home, Shana instructed Jazmine to pack an overnight bag.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Jazmine asked, catching Shana\u2019s enthusiasm. The lei still hung around her neck. Shana wore hers, too. She appreciated Adam\u2019s gesture, but not as much as she would have if he\u2019d e-mailed or phoned her first. She didn\u2019t want to think about him now, and yet it was impossible not to. The orchids wafted a lovely scent, reminding her of Adam and their shared kisses.</p><p>\u201cTo Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPortland?\u201d Jazmine moaned. \u201cWhy are we going there?\u201d</p><p>Shana already had her suitcase out of her closet and open on top of her bed. She didn\u2019t need much\u2014her pajamas, a set of clothes and clean underwear. Her toiletries and makeup. That was it.</p><p>\u201cAunt Shana...\u201d</p><p>She whirled around, almost forgetting Jazmine was in the room. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You asked me why we\u2019re going to Portland.\u201d The girl deserved the truth. \u201cI need to talk to Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad!\u201d Her niece spit out the name as if she had a bug in her mouth. \u201cWhy?\u201d she cried with such a shocked look that Shana nearly laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing Uncle Adam\u2019s lei and you want to visit Brad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d was all Shana could tell her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going back to him, are you?\u201d Jazmine\u2019s eyes pleaded with hers.</p><p>\u201cNo. Now pack an overnight bag. I want to head out as soon as we can.\u201d Shana had no intention of being away from the business for more than twenty-four hours. She\u2019d already called Gwen and left a message, asking if she could put them up for the night. If not, they\u2019d get a hotel room\u2014a reasonably priced one. The trip would be an adventure, and Shana would make an effort to see that Jazmine had fun. If there was time, they\u2019d stop at Jensen Beach to shop and play tourist. Her niece would enjoy that.</p><p>Jazmine hesitated in the doorway. \u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sure.\u201d This was a conversation she should\u2019ve had with Brad when she left him.</p><p>\u201cAre you still in love with Brad?\u201d Jazmine asked urgently, staring up at her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I told you that.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine frowned, apparently not entirely convinced. \u201cDo you always do stuff like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean act on impulse?\u201d Shana clarified. She didn\u2019t think she did, but she realized she was only beginning to know herself. Buying the ice-cream parlor had been the first impulsive thing she\u2019d done in years. Now this. Perhaps it came from a new sense of having control over her own life.</p><p>\u201cAre you packed?\u201d Shana asked, knowing very well that she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Her niece dawdled for another few minutes. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can leave,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cMy garden needs watering, and Uncle Adam said it\u2019s important to give the plants a drink every morning and every night.\u201d A smile raised the edges of her mouth. \u201cHe said I should sing to them, but nothing too fast or with a strong beat.\u201d</p><p>Shana smiled, too. \u201cI think they can go without water for a day. You can make it up to them later and give them an extra drink and sing a few lullabies.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine still hesitated, then finally appeared to reach a decision. She went into her own bedroom.</p><p>It seemed to take her niece forever to assemble what she needed. When she reappeared, she was dragging her backpack behind her as if it weighed fifty pounds. \u201cWe can go now,\u201d she said with an undisguised lack of enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Shana stood by the car, waiting impatiently. She wondered if Jazmine had transferred the entire contents of her dresser into her backpack, but decided against asking.</p><p>\u201cEverything locked up?\u201d Shana had checked the back door and the windows.</p><p>Jazmine nodded, climbed into the car while Shana heaved her backpack into the trunk, and fastened her seat belt. Then she sighed heavily.</p><p>Shana walked around to the driver\u2019s side. \u201cThink of this as an adventure,\u201d she said in a breezy voice.</p><p>Jazmine\u2019s chin drooped to her chest. \u201cAre you going to tell Uncle Adam what you did?\u201d</p><p>Involuntarily Shana fingered the lei. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Brad gets you to move back to Portland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen,\u201d Shana promised, hiding a smile.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so important for you to see him again,\u201d Jazmine whined. \u201cYou said it was over. You said you didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with him again. You said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I said.\u201d Shana cut her off, started the car and pulled away from the curb.</p><p>Jazmine was quiet for the first few minutes. \u201cWhere will we stay the night?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAt a friend\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGwen. You haven\u2019t met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she have kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shana murmured as she merged onto the West Seattle freeway and toward Interstate 5.</p><p>\u201cDo I get to come along when you talk to Brad?\u201d</p><p>Shana hadn\u2019t actually considered that, but the answer wasn\u2019t difficult. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine\u2019s shoulders slumped forward. \u201cThat\u2019s what I figured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJazz, this isn\u2019t what you think. I\u2019m going to see Brad to tell him something....\u201d Only now were her thoughts catching up with her actions.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jazmine asked, looking at her for the first time since she got into the car.</p><p>\u201cTo tell him I made the right decision when I left Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re not sure?\u201d Her niece seemed about to burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why are you so worried?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine stared out the passenger window as if the concrete freeway interchanges were the most fascinating scenery in the world. \u201cBrad phoned, and I told you and then...then you and Uncle Adam had an argument, and now you\u2019re driving to Portland. I\u2019m not stupid, you know. I can connect the dots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re looking at the wrong picture.\u201d Shana could understand why Jazmine had reached those conclusions but they weren\u2019t correct. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be concerned, Jazz. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to marry Uncle Adam. Don\u2019t you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me deal with one man at a time, okay?\u201d At the moment Adam was the last person she wanted to think about. \u201cOnce I talk to Brad, you and I can discuss your uncle Adam.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d Jazmine muttered. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain anything to me. I\u2019m just a kid,\u201d she said sarcastically.</p><p>Shana sighed. Jazmine really ought to enroll in a drama class because she clearly had talent. In fact, maybe they could find one when they got back....</p><p>\u201cDid you mention this to Mom?\u201d Jazmine asked after a precious few moments of silence.</p><p>Shana kept her eyes on the road. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t time to e-mail her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes your friend have a computer I can use?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Mom know where we are and what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Jazmine announced this with a great deal of satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Shana just bet the nine-year-old would delight in letting her mother know they were in Portland. Smiling, she wondered how Jazmine would embellish the tale.</p><p>\u201cWhat if he isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p> <p>Uh-oh. \u201cYou mean Brad?\u201d Not once had Shana stopped to consider that. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d This wasn\u2019t a situation in which she\u2019d be comfortable leaving behind her newly printed business card. If Brad learned she\u2019d come by his office, or even his condo, he\u2019d assume the wrong thing.</p><p>\u201cHe has to be there,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cHe just has to.\u201d</p><p>Adam checked his watch and calculated the time in Seattle. Three-thirty. The leis should have arrived by now, according to the delivery schedule. He imagined Shana\u2019s surprise and pleasure at opening the box and discovering the leis. The orchids were supposed to pave the way for part two of his reconciliation plan\u2014a phone call.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure how it had happened, but somehow his previous conversation with Shana had gone in completely the wrong direction. He certainly hadn\u2019t intended to become embroiled in an argument. He couldn\u2019t even figure out what kind of mistake he\u2019d made. Whatever it was, he sincerely hoped she was over it by now.</p><p>Adam had talked to one of his friends about Shana\u2019s reaction. John, another lieutenant commander, had said his wife always started an argument before he left. Apparently it was common among Navy wives. For whatever reason, women found it easier to send their men off to sea if they were upset with them about something. Adam didn\u2019t understand it, but John claimed their disagreement was simply Shana\u2019s way of letting him know she was in love with him.</p><p>That had taken Adam by surprise. Shana loved him? Shana loved him! He chose to believe it because he so badly wanted to. He wasn\u2019t much of a romantic, but the thought of Shana waiting for him back in Seattle made him happy in a way he\u2019d never experienced before.</p> <p>He hurried home to make the call in privacy. When he didn\u2019t think he could bear to wait another minute, he reached for the telephone and punched out the number for the ice-cream parlor. Leaning back on his sofa, feet stretched out on the coffee table, he listened to the ringing of the phone.</p><p>\u201cOlsen\u2019s Ice Cream and Pizza Parlor.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s voice shook Adam. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d the male voice echoed.</p><p>Adam dropped his stocking feet to the floor and leaned forward far enough to prop his elbows on his knees. \u201cIs Shana there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Who\u2019s calling, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Commander Adam Kennedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hello.\u201d The voice instantly became friendly. \u201cThis is Louis, Catherine\u2019s husband. I\u2019d better let you talk to her. Hold on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShould I call back later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine. Here\u2019s Cath.\u201d</p><p>A couple of seconds later, Shana\u2019s number-one employee was on the line. \u201cAdam, hello.\u201d She sounded slightly breathless. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually called to talk to Shana.\u201d</p><p>She paused a telltale moment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you missed her. Shana took Jazmine on a...short vacation.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s disappointment was keen. \u201cDid the leis arrive?\u201d Those had cost him a pretty penny, and he hoped they weren\u2019t sitting in a box wilting before Shana even had a chance to see them.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, and she was...pleased. Jazmine, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she mention where she was going?\u201d Perhaps he should try reaching her on her cell. He\u2019d just assumed she\u2019d be at the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, she did,\u201d Catherine said. She seemed distracted; either Adam had phoned at a bad time or she was reluctant to tell him exactly where Shana had gone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try her cell,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou could do that, of course,\u201d Catherine agreed politely. \u201cBut...but she might be out of reach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Did they drive into the mountains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d</p><p>Her hesitation made him suspicious. \u201cThe ocean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ah\u2014listen, I need to go.... There are customers waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatherine,\u201d Adam said softly. She was hiding something, and he wanted to know what.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Shana you phoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said Jazmine\u2019s with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she is,\u201d Catherine answered sharply.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on there?\u201d Adam demanded. \u201cWhere\u2019s Shana?\u201d</p><p>Catherine sighed deeply. \u201cI told her. The minute she said she was leaving, I told Shana you\u2019d phone. Sure enough, here I am, having to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShana\u2019s in Portland, visiting a friend. Gwen\u2014a female friend.\u201d She spoke with finality, as though she hoped that was the end of his questions.</p><p>\u201cPortland?\u201d A chill raced down Adam\u2019s arms, one that had nothing to do with the tropical breeze coming through the sliding glass door. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose this has anything to do with Brad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask her that.\u201d Catherine sighed again. \u201cI refuse to incriminate myself\u2014or her.\u201d</p><p>Adam snorted. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Dammit, he did see\u2014and he wasn\u2019t enjoying the view.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Shana\u2019s stomach tensed with anxiety. What had been a brilliant idea that morning seemed utterly ridiculous now. She waited inside the lobby of Brad\u2019s office building, pacing back and forth, trying to put words to the mangled feelings inside her head. She was not looking for a reconciliation. But Catherine\u2019s insight had made her aware that she\u2019d abandoned her previous life without really settling matters with Brad. There were things that had to be said...except now, all she could think about was Adam.</p><p>Thankfully Jazmine was safely ensconced at Gwen\u2019s. Her friend was a nurse who worked the night shift; she was up and about when Shana and Jazmine arrived on her front porch. As soon as she heard the reason for Shana\u2019s visit, she\u2019d sent her off with a pep talk. Gwen\u2019s encouragement had carried Shana all the way to downtown Portland.</p><p>However, Shana\u2019s resolve had quickly waned when she stepped inside the luxurious lobby. All of a sudden, her tongue felt glued to the roof of her mouth, and when someone casually walked past and greeted her, her returning \u201cgood afternoon\u201d came out sounding like \u201cgoonoon.\u201d</p><p>Mortified, Shana hurried into the ladies\u2019 room and locked herself inside a stall. She hadn\u2019t even bothered to change clothes. Filled with purpose, she\u2019d driven to Portland in shorts and a T-shirt with a smudge of chocolate ice cream on the hem. She was about to have one of the most important conversations of her life, and she resembled someone trying out for clown school.</p><p>Sitting on the toilet seat, Shana buried her face in her hands. What was she thinking? She was astonished at her own audacity and horrified at this latest example of impulsive behavior.</p><p>Her goal, when she left Seattle in a heated frenzy, had been to make Brad Moore realize what he\u2019d lost\u2014and whose fault that was. She was going to end the relationship properly, definitively, for her own sake, and ultimately for his, too. After coming this far, she refused to turn back. She\u2019d simply buy something appropriate. There was time.</p><p>That decision made, Shana walked into an ultra-expensive boutique in the lobby. Either the sales clerk took pity on her or she was afraid Shana was about to shoplift a mannequin, because she immediately shot out from behind the cash register.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you ever.\u201d Shana threw herself on the mercy of a complete stranger. \u201cI need an outfit that\u2019ll make a man rue the day he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more.\u201d The clerk raised her hand. \u201cI have just the dress.\u201d She looked Shana up and down. \u201cSize four?\u201d</p><p>Maybe ten years ago. \u201cSix,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cFour. This dress is expensive enough to be a four.\u201d</p><p>Shana laughed. She didn\u2019t care how much it cost; her ego was at stake.</p><p>Once she stood in front of the mirror, Shana barely recognized the woman staring back at her. The knee-length floral dress was simple yet elegant, fanning out at her waist in pleats that emphasized her hips and long legs.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she whispered, impressed. She didn\u2019t even glance at the price tag. It was better not to know.</p><p>The clerk nodded approvingly. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>Shana twisted around to take a gander at the back and decided that view was even sexier. She hoped Brad took a good, long look when she walked away.</p><p>Not wanting to show up clutching a bag with her shorts and T-shirt inside\u2014that kind of contradicted the classy image\u2014she ditched her old clothes.</p><p>The only unfortunate part of the new outfit was the matching shoes. The one pair left was a full size too small for Shana, but the slinky sandals were gorgeous. With a minimum of regret, she purchased them anyway. By the time she walked out of the boutique, her little toe on each shoe had squeezed between the narrow straps and escaped. She\u2019d be fine as long as Brad didn\u2019t look at her feet.</p><p>Shana was still testing her ability to walk when the elevator opened and Brad Moore entered the lobby. Swallowing her breath, Shana nearly choked when Brad saw her. He stopped abruptly, his shock unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cShana,\u201d he cried. He held out his arms to her, surprise replaced by delight. \u201cYou look fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Now wasn\u2019t the time for modesty, especially in light of what she\u2019d paid for this outfit. She tilted her head to one side and allowed him to kiss her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>No need to beat around the bush. \u201cI came to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to hide his enthusiasm. \u201cShall we have a drink somewhere and talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be fine.\u201d She played it cool, refusing to let him see how flustered she was.</p><p>Taking her by the elbow, Brad led the way out of the high-rise office tower. Shana struggled to keep up with him, the too-tight shoes pinching her feet unmercifully. Her little toes hung over the edge of the shoes and she prayed no one would notice. Thankfully there was a hotel bar across the street.</p><p>Brad led her to a small table, ordered them each a glass of merlot and grinned at her as if she were a delectable dessert.</p><p>The cocktail waitress brought their wine and Brad sent a flirtatious glance in her direction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once he\u2019d finished paying for their drinks, he smiled at her confidently. \u201cYou got my message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the one you weren\u2019t willing to say to me yourself?\u201d</p><p>He had the good grace to look embarrassed. \u201cI would have if you\u2019d been home. Who is that kid, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Shana was surprised Jazmine hadn\u2019t enlightened him. \u201cMy niece. You remember my sister, Alison, don\u2019t you? Jazmine is her daughter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI met your sister once, right?\u201d Brad raised both eyebrows. \u201cThe kid\u2019s got attitude.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen anything yet.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d he asked, but before she could respond he added, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>This was where\u2014according to his script\u2014she was supposed to tell him how lonely she\u2019d been without him and how much she regretted the things she\u2019d said and done.</p><p>He waited, and when she didn\u2019t immediately offer the desired response, he frowned. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. We have a lot to discuss.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI came because\u2014\u201d</p><p>Brad reached for her hand, stopping her. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to say it. We both made mistakes and we\u2019re both sorry. Let\u2019s leave it at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I made a mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She took her first sip of wine and let its smoothness flow over her tongue. \u201cI came because when I walked out on you, I was angry and hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel either of those things anymore. I wanted to look you in the eye, see what I used to find so attractive.\u201d She sighed. Whatever it was had long vanished. \u201cI really just came, Brad, to clear the air once and for all, and to do it properly.\u201d</p><p>Brad\u2019s expression changed and he stared at her. \u201cYou are coming back to Portland, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She loved this city and missed her job. The ice-cream parlor demanded constant attention and supervision. The hours were long and the financial compensation small. As a pharmaceutical salesperson, she\u2019d been able to leave work at the end of the day and not give her job another thought. Having a business of her own was a completely different proposition. The ice-cream and pizza parlor had seemed like an escape from an unhappy situation, but for the first time, she wondered if she\u2019d made the right decision.</p><p>\u201cShana?\u201d Brad asked, breaking into her musings.</p><p>\u201cPortland? I don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted honestly.</p><p>\u201cYou love me, don\u2019t you?\u201d He asked the question but she could tell he wasn\u2019t as sure of himself as he\u2019d been earlier.</p><p>Seeing the crack in his confidence weakened her resolve. \u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d Shana said. \u201cI loved you so completely and I was so sure you loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love you,\u201d Brad insisted. \u201cI know you were upset and you had every right to be. I was a fool, but I swear to you it\u2019ll never happen again. I regretted it immediately. I was sick that I lost you because of Sylvia.\u201d</p> <p>Shana didn\u2019t trust him enough to believe his promises.</p><p>He seemed to be debating how much of the truth to reveal. \u201cWe went out two or three times, but that\u2019s beside the point. It didn\u2019t take me long to realize I\u2019d made the biggest mistake of my life. It\u2019s you I love, Shana. It\u2019s you I want to be with.\u201d</p><p>The complete absence of the word marriage didn\u2019t escape her. In other words, they\u2019d resume their relationship exactly where they\u2019d left off. His script again\u2014but not hers.</p><p>Brad must have seen the strength and determination in her eyes. \u201cYou mean it, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked morosely. \u201cThis really is goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you loved me at one time. I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t now.\u201d</p><p>A sad smile formed but she refused to answer him.</p><p>His own smile returned. \u201cYou do love me. You wouldn\u2019t be here now if you didn\u2019t still have feelings for me.\u201d</p><p>Brad\u2019s gaze pleaded with her as he clasped her hand in both of his. \u201cYou do love me,\u201d he said again.</p><p>She remained silent, and all at once he seemed to realize she wasn\u2019t changing her mind. That was when he said the one thing that, a few months ago, might have swayed her.</p><p>\u201cI want to marry you.\u201d</p><p>Even that didn\u2019t elicit a response.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sincere, Shana. I couldn\u2019t be any more serious. You set the date and the time.\u201d</p><p>Rather than drag this out, she told him the truth. \u201cI met someone else.\u201d</p><p>Brad frowned. \u201cIs this the guy your niece mentioned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly didn\u2019t take you long, did it?\u201d he asked, sitting back. \u201cSo the real reason you\u2019re here is to rub my face in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Until this moment she hadn\u2019t planned to say anything about Adam.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were in love with me. Pretty fickle, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, knowing she\u2019d asked for that. \u201cI was in love with you, but that\u2019s over.\u201d She paused. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not laughing.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible to feel like this about a man on such short acquaintance. Adam\u2019s good to me and to my niece.... He\u2019s a family friend. That\u2019s how we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBully for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Brad.\u201d She hadn\u2019t expected to be this honest with him but it seemed important. She had no intention of being vindictive or mean-spirited. She might not love him anymore, but she didn\u2019t begrudge him happiness.</p><p>\u201cAnd what does Adam do?\u201d Brad asked, his words hard and clipped. \u201cOh, yes, I remember now. He\u2019s some big deal in the Navy.\u201d He lifted his brows dismissively. \u201cSo. Can you tell me exactly why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>Shana sipped her wine. \u201cI came here this morning, convinced I had to see you. I already told you why. I felt\u2014and still feel\u2014that I had to end this relationship properly.\u201d</p><p>Brad closed his eyes for a moment. \u201cOkay. Consider it ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said graciously. \u201cI even went so far as to buy this dress at a price so outrageous I\u2019ll be making payments for the next six months.\u201d She glanced down at her feet and tried to remember what size shoe her sister wore and hoped it was a seven.</p><p>\u201cSo this outfit was for my benefit?\u201d</p><p>Shana nodded. \u201cI wanted you to be sorry you lost me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes grew gentle. \u201cI was sorry before you got here. I\u2019ve been sorry for months.\u201d</p><p>Despite her mood, she smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the sweetest thing you\u2019ve ever said to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t come here to make me feel bad about you and Popeye?\u201d</p><p>Shana inhaled softly. She knew exactly why she\u2019d found it necessary to drive to Portland. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI came to say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Adam Kennedy wasn\u2019t having a good day. In fact, the entire week was down the septic tank, and he blamed Shana Berrie for that. If she was trying to make him jealous, it was damned well working.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what women do to you,\u201d his friend John told him. They sat across from each other at Navy Headquarters for the Pacific Fleet. \u201cThey mess with your mind and they make irrational demands. Take my wife, for example. Angie got upset with me because there was a cockroach in the house, as if it\u2019s my duty as her husband to rid the place of bugs. Can you believe it? She\u2019s afraid of a stupid bug, and if I don\u2019t deal with it, I might as well not go home tonight.\u201d</p><p>Barely hearing his friend\u2019s rant, Adam scowled. Shana certainly hadn\u2019t wasted any time giving up on him. As far as she was concerned, it seemed to be out of sight, out of mind. Well, fine, great, whatever. If she wanted to race back to lover boy, then that was perfectly fine by him.</p><p>The hell it was, Adam decided quickly. He hadn\u2019t slept well; his appetite was gone and he had a sick feeling that refused to go away. He didn\u2019t know how everything had fallen apart so quickly. In his view they\u2019d had a promising relationship, with emphasis on the past tense.</p><p>The phone rang and Adam left it for John. What he needed was a bout of hard exercise, but with his shoulder golf was still out of the question and swimming would be just as painful. He could always jog, he supposed, but it wasn\u2019t something he enjoyed.</p><p>John answered the phone, and Adam watched as his gaze shot across the room. He put the caller on hold. \u201cIt\u2019s for you. A woman. Says her name is Shana.\u201d He gave Adam a significant look, both eyebrows raised.</p><p>It took Adam a moment to assimilate that. His pulse accelerated and then immediately slowed. The call was most likely a courtesy to let him know she was going back to lover boy in Portland.</p><p>With that in mind, Adam reached for the telephone receiver. He responded in a crisp military tone, keeping his voice devoid of emotion.</p><p>\u201cAdam, hello,\u201d Shana said, her own voice friendly.</p><p>Adam nearly weakened, but he realized she was probably warming him up before she dropped the news. She\u2019d led him on, he mused darkly, and now she was going to make a fool of him.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to thank you for the leis. Jazmine and I were thrilled. It was so generous of you.\u201d</p><p>Adam kept silent, bracing himself.</p><p>After an awkward moment, during which he said nothing, Shana said, \u201cI feel badly about the way our last conversation went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Adam said in the same emotionless tone. He wanted her to think it hardly mattered to him. He should\u2019ve taken the hint then. Shana was trouble and he\u2019d best get out of this unpredictable relationship. But even as the thought went through his mind, he didn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cI blame myself,\u201d Shana added, \u201cfor picking a fight with you. I was just reacting to your leaving, I guess.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cWe had so little time, and I knew I was going to miss you so much. Jazmine, too, of course.\u201d</p><p>John had explained that this was the same reaction he got from his wife, but Adam couldn\u2019t really accept that. Why would Shana care whether he was stationed in Hawaii if she was going back to the guy in Portland?</p><p>She seemed to realize he wasn\u2019t responding. \u201cAre you upset about something?\u201d she asked tentatively.</p><p>\u201cShould I be?\u201d He answered her question with one of his own.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Her voice gained conviction, but gone was the sweet joy he\u2019d heard in her earlier. Now she sounded wary.</p><p>\u201cI understand you were out of town,\u201d he said, broaching the subject that was foremost on his mind.</p><p>His announcement was followed by stark silence. \u201cYou know about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. So if you\u2019re planning to tell me what I think you are, I\u2019d appreciate if you\u2019d just say it and be done with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want out,\u201d he said flippantly. \u201cSo let\u2019s just call it quits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re willing to end this without another word?\u201d She seemed shocked\u2014and annoyed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who drove down to visit an old lover.

It was a spur-of-the-moment idea. Jazmine and I spent the night with an old friend\u2014an old female friend,\u201d she added. \u201cI saw Brad and we talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d He didn\u2019t mean to ask and wanted to withdraw the question the moment it left his mouth.</p><p>She paused, taking a moment before she answered. \u201cI don\u2019t remember if I told you I moved to Seattle in kind of a rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might\u2019ve said something like that.\u201d He tried to play it cool, but the truth was, he hung on every word.</p> <p>\u201cSo I needed to see Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you did,\u201d he muttered, unable to disguise his sarcasm.</p><p>His comment generated a lengthy silence. \u201cWe had a chance to talk and to say certain things that needed to be said,\u201d she finally told him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t enlighten him as to what those things might be. \u201cSo you\u2019re back in Seattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I have to go now. The only reason I phoned,\u201d she said, \u201cis to thank you for the leis. Jazmine and I love them. Now I should get back to work.\u201d</p><p>Adam had to bite his tongue to keep from pleading with her to stay on the phone a bit longer. He wished they could start the entire conversation over.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jazmine?\u201d he asked, using the question as a delaying tactic.</p><p>\u201cFabulous...wonderful. Thank you again for the orchids.\u201d</p><p>And with that, the line was disconnected. He waited a few seconds while the buzz sounded in his ear. Adam replaced the receiver and glared at the phone as he replayed the conversation. He knew he\u2019d made a number of tactical errors, and that was because his ego had gotten in the way.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019d it go?\u201d John asked conversationally.</p><p>\u201cNot good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to hear that. I told you\u2014women mess with your mind. You should\u2019ve figured that out by now.\u201d</p><p>John was right; he should have.</p><p>The tension in Adam\u2019s stomach didn\u2019t diminish all day. At the end of his watch, he returned to his quarters to find the message light on his phone blinking. It was too much to hope that Shana had called him a second time. Holding his breath, he pressed the message button.</p> <p>Jazmine\u2019s voice greeted him. \u201cUncle Adam, what\u2019s with you? You\u2019ve really blown it now. Call me at the house when you get home. I\u2019ll make sure I answer.\u201d</p><p>Adam reached for the phone. Here he was, conspiring with a nine-year-old. That was a sign of desperation.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Ali was quite entertained by the tone of Shana\u2019s e-mails in the last week. Her sister was not in a good mood. She\u2019d only brought up Adam\u2019s name once, but Ali was well aware that the lieutenant commander was the sole source of Shana\u2019s irritation.</p><p>Thankfully, Jazmine had been able to fill Ali in. Apparently Adam and Shana had some form of falling-out. Shana had driven to Portland to say a final goodbye to Brad, and Adam was out of sorts about it. From what Jazmine said, they were currently ignoring each other.</p><p>Ali didn\u2019t usually meddle in other people\u2019s romances. She hadn\u2019t said anything when Shana was involved with Brad, and she wouldn\u2019t interfere now. At least she didn\u2019t think she would. But those two were perfect together, and it would be a shame if this relationship died because they were too stubborn to admit they were attracted to each other. Although Ali suspected that their feelings had gone way beyond attraction...</p><p>Preoccupied, she walked toward the wardroom. She generally ate with the other officers at six every evening, but tonight she was later than usual. Life at sea had grown monotonous, and the days seemed to run into each other without any real break to distinguish one from the next. When she entered the room, there were a few officers at various tables, but she noticed only one.</p><p>Commander Frank Dillon.</p><p>Ali hadn\u2019t seen or talked to him since they\u2019d met in the Farmer\u2019s Market in Guam. Just seeing him again gave her pause. She\u2019d thought about their brief conversation that very afternoon; even now she wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it. Her friends, too, were full of questions she hadn\u2019t been able to answer. Ali filled her tray and started for a table.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Commander,\u201d she said, greeting him.</p><p>\u201cAli.\u201d He didn\u2019t look any too pleased to see her, if his scowl was any indication.</p><p>She sat down several tables away, but facing him. It would be utterly rude to present him with her back. \u201cI do hope you\u2019ve sufficiently recovered.\u201d Ali knew she sounded stilted but couldn\u2019t help it. She avoided eye contact by reaching for the salt shaker.</p><p>\u201cI have, thank you. And you?\u201d</p><p>His question caught her unawares. \u201cI haven\u2019t been ill, Commander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d He stood as if he couldn\u2019t leave fast enough and disappeared with such speed, it made her head swim. Clearly she was the last person he wanted to see. Only this time, Ali didn\u2019t take offense.</p><p>She\u2019d come to the conclusion that she flustered Commander Dillon, which was a heady sensation. She recalled how gruff and rude he\u2019d been in sick bay and, thanks to their brief conversation on Guam, she finally understood the reason. He\u2019d thought she was married.</p><p>The next evening, Alison purposely delayed her meal and arrived at the same time as the night before. Sure enough Frank was there, sitting at the same table, lingering over coffee. He looked up and smiled uncertainly when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Commander.\u201d She greeted him the same way she had the previous night. After getting her meal, she chose a seat one table closer.</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Commander.\u201d His eyes held hers, and he didn\u2019t immediately leap up and run away.</p><p>\u201cI have a question for you,\u201d she said and again reached for the salt shaker. It was a convenient excuse to avert her gaze. She feared he might read her intense interest in him, which seemed to compound after each meeting.</p><p>He straightened. \u201cFire away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I frighten you?\u201d</p><p>He raised one eyebrow. \u201cTruthfully? You terrify me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>He expelled his breath. \u201cAs a matter of fact, there are several. Most of them would get me court-martialed if I mentioned them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She didn\u2019t really, but she was definitely curious.</p><p>\u201cDoes that amuse you?\u201d he asked, his face deadpan.</p><p>\u201cCommander, are you flirting with me?\u201d</p><p>This question seemed to take him aback, and he frowned. \u201cI can assure you I wouldn\u2019t know how. Is that what you think I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I do have another question for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I just hope it isn\u2019t as difficult as the first.\u201d A hint of a smile touched his eyes.</p><p>Alison dipped her fork into the creamy mashed potatoes. \u201cI wonder, do you know anything about a bolt of red silk that was delivered to the ship in my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed silk?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t an answer to my question, Commander.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his watch, and as if he\u2019d suddenly realized he was late for an important meeting, abruptly stood. He grabbed his coffee cup and took one last swallow before he excused himself and hurried away.</p><p>Alison hadn\u2019t known what to think when the silk had appeared in her quarters. She was able to track down the petty officer who delivered it, and learned that the man from the market had brought it to the docks. He\u2019d left instructions that it should be taken directly to her. Alison had badly wanted that silk, but the price was more than she\u2019d been willing to pay.</p><p>Just before she drifted off to sleep the night before, she\u2019d remembered haggling with the silk merchant just before she\u2019d run into Frank. He must have purchased it for her. It was the only thing that made sense\u2014and yet it didn\u2019t. But judging by the way he\u2019d reacted to her questions this evening, she had to wonder.</p><p>The following night when Alison arrived at the wardroom, Frank wasn\u2019t there. Her heart sank with disappointment. She really didn\u2019t have much of an appetite and ate very little of her meal. She\u2019d almost decided against coffee but it was her habit to end her dinner with a cup.</p><p>Just when she was ready to leave, uninterested in the remains of her cooling coffee, Frank rushed in, looking harried.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Commander,\u201d Alison said, smiling her welcome. Hiding her pleasure at seeing him had become impossible.</p><p>He poured himself a cup of coffee and joined her. This was progress. They\u2019d begun by sitting several tables apart and had drawn closer with each encounter.</p><p>He was silent for a few minutes, concentrating on his coffee, methodically adding sugar and cream, then stirring. \u201cYou have children?\u201d he asked unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cA nine-year-old daughter.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cJazmine is living with my sister in Seattle right now.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again. \u201cIs this the first time you\u2019ve been apart for so much time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Then, feeling it was only fair that she be completely honest, Alison said, \u201cThis will be my last duty assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving the Navy?\u201d He made it sound like an incomprehensible decision.</p><p>\u201cMy husband loved the Navy the way you do. He couldn\u2019t imagine civilian life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. But it\u2019s something I have to do.\u201d The Navy had shaped her life, but now she had to put Jazmine\u2019s welfare first. She was proud of how well her daughter had adjusted to a new environment, but a child needed roots and stability. Alison felt obliged to provide that, especially since she\u2019d become, however unwillingly, a single parent.</p><p>\u201cWhere will you settle?\u201d Frank asked.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet. I\u2019m considering Seattle. Jazmine seems to like it there, and it\u2019s where my sister lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSingle,\u201d Ali explained. \u201cBut she\u2019s romantically involved with someone.\u201d</p><p>Frank stared down into his coffee, cupped between his outstretched hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about romance.\u201d He took a swig of coffee. \u201cI\u2019m pretty much a failure in that department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re divorced, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She recalled that he\u2019d told her this.</p><p>\u201cA long time now.\u201d</p><p>Alison studied him as he sipped his coffee. \u201cGiven up, have you?\u201d</p><p>He raised his head, his gaze burning into hers. \u201cUntil recently I had.\u201d His shoulders rose as if he was taking in a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate to ask now, but I was wondering...I was thinking that in a few months, when you\u2019ve...resigned your commission, you might consider going to dinner with me. It wouldn\u2019t mean anything. I mean, there\u2019d be no obligation on either part, and if you\u2019re not ready\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCommander,\u201d Alison said, breaking into his soliloquy. This was the most he\u2019d ever said to her at one time. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He eyed her quizzically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be honored to have dinner with you.\u201d</p><p>He seemed tentative, unbelieving, and Ali smiled.</p> <p>\u201cMore than honored,\u201d she added softly and reached for her own coffee. She needed a sip to ease the dryness in her mouth and throat.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be for several months,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of that, Commander.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and looked away. \u201cDon\u2019t take this personally, but it\u2019s not a good idea for us to continue meeting here.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment hit her hard. \u201cWhy not?\u201d Their meetings were completely innocent. This was the third night in a row, and not once had they even touched.</p> <p>\u201cLieutenant Commander,\u201d Frank said, his voice barely above a whisper. \u201cYou tempt me and while I\u2019m a disciplined man, I don\u2019t think I can hold back my feelings for you indefinitely. Give me a date and a time I can meet you in Seattle and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Alison met his eyes and smiled. \u201cJanuary twenty-seventh. One o\u2019clock in the afternoon. At the bronze pig in Pike Place Market.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d chosen the date a bit recklessly, perhaps, but that was Peter\u2019s birthday, which made it easy to remember. And she was very sure Peter would approve....</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to call Uncle Adam?\u201d Jazmine was pestering Shana for about the hundredth time that week.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Shana muttered, scooping ice cream from the bottom of the caramel pecan container and packing what remained into a quart-size one. This was her life these days. For at least two hours every day, she risked frostbite with her face in the freezer.</p> <p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she said, righting herself and holding up the ice-cream scoop for emphasis, \u201cwhen I moved to Seattle, I decided I was finished with men. I didn\u2019t need a man in my life then and I don\u2019t need one now. I\u2019m better off without them.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine sat on the other side of the counter, her chin propped in her hands. Shana noticed that she was frowning.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t,\u201d Shana reiterated.</p><p>\u201cAt all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, technically we do, but only for reproductive purposes.\u201d This was definitely an area she didn\u2019t want to get into with a nine-year-old.</p><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t they kind of fun to have around?\u201d</p><p>She realized she was tainting her niece\u2019s mind because of her own negative experiences. That had to stop. Besides, Adam had potential\u2014or he did when he wasn\u2019t overtaken by jealousy. The thing was, he had absolutely nothing to be jealous about. It was almost as if he wanted to be upset with her. Fine, then, she\u2019d just let him.</p> <p>\u201cMen have their uses,\u201d Shana replied guardedly.</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked Uncle Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do...I did...I do.\u201d While Shana was still annoyed with Adam, she missed him, too. That was the point. She didn\u2019t want to think about him, but she couldn\u2019t help it\u2014which annoyed her even more.</p><p>\u201cYou should call him,\u201d Jazmine suggested again.</p><p>Shana refused to do that. \u201cI phoned last time. It\u2019s his turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her niece sounded distressed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Shana asked, unsure what had brought the woebegone expression to Jazmine\u2019s face.</p><p>Jazmine sighed deeply. \u201cI was just hoping you liked Uncle Adam the same way he likes you.\u201d</p><p>Now Shana was the one frowning. \u201cI do like him. It\u2019s just that two people don\u2019t always see eye-to-eye.\u201d This was difficult enough to explain to an adult, let alone a child. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s best to simply leave things alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d Jazmine squinted as though confused. \u201cIs that how you felt about Brad?\u201d</p><p>Shana thought for a moment, then nodded. \u201cYes, in the beginning. When I first broke up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you went to see him again \u2019cause you didn\u2019t like the way it ended, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I regretted the fact that I\u2019d run off in a fit of righteous indignation. It was over, and I wanted him to know that in a civilized manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t being impulsive now? About not phoning Uncle Adam?\u201d</p><p>Coming out from behind the counter, Shana slid onto the stool next to her niece. Sighing expressively, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re pretty smart for a kid.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine flashed her a bright smile. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just are.\u201d Her niece had told her what she needed to hear. She\u2019d refused to phone Adam strictly out of pride. Their last conversation had been painful. She\u2019d been lighthearted and hopeful when she called him, but his gruff responses had short-circuited her joy. He hadn\u2019t phoned her since and she hadn\u2019t phoned him, either. They were behaving like children.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Jazmine murmured, returning to her original pose, chin cupped in her hands, elbows splayed. \u201cYou went to talk to Brad, but you won\u2019t go see Uncle Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Hawaii.\u201d It wasn\u2019t like he was a three-hour drive down the interstate. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that easy to get to Hawaii.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they have ninety-nine-dollar flights there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d More than likely it would be five hundred dollars. Shana sat up. Then again, going to see him in Hawaii might help clear up this misunderstanding\u2014resolve this stalemate\u2014and she wanted that. She believed he did, too. One of them had to make the first move and it might as well be her.</p><p>Shana was shocked at herself. She was actually considering this. She\u2019d spent all that money on the dress she\u2019d worn to see Brad, and now she was about to spend more. She supposed she could always wear her new dress when\u2014if\u2014she went to see Adam. Why not?</p><p>\u201cYou could check the computer,\u201d Jazmine said confidently. \u201cThere are advertisements on TV all the time about airfare deals over the Internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I should?\u201d</p><p>Jazmine nodded eagerly. \u201cIf you find a cheap ticket to Hawaii, you should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t close the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to close it. Catherine ran it when we went to Portland,\u201d Jazmine reminded her. \u201cAnd that was just to see Brad.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to claim that seeing Brad was different. Well...it was and it wasn\u2019t. She\u2019d been willing to make arrangements and a few sacrifices in order to talk to him. And she cared about Adam a hundred times more than she did Brad.</p><p>\u201cRemember Tim, the single dad who wanted to go out with you?\u201d Jazmine asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him in the park. He\u2019s back with his wife and he said it was because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup\u2014he said you were the one who told him he was still in love with her. He knew you were right but the hardest part was telling Heather\u2014that\u2019s her name. He\u2019s really glad he did, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad, too. But why are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before Shana could finish the question, Jazmine blurted out her reply. \u201cBecause the hardest part is you telling Uncle Adam how you feel\u2014so do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Shana closed her eyes. She wanted this relationship with Adam to work. All the years she\u2019d been with Brad, friends and co-workers had said he didn\u2019t deserve her, and she\u2019d refused to listen. Now the people she loved and respected most were telling her that Adam was a dream come true\u2014and once again she hadn\u2019t been listening. But that was about to change.</p><p>\u201cIt all depends on whether Louis and Catherine can work while we\u2019re away,\u201d Shana murmured, biting her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cThey can,\u201d Jazmine said immediately. \u201cThey love it here. And if you marry Uncle Adam, they want to buy the business.\u201d She leaned close and whispered conspiratorially, \u201cI heard them talking about it.\u201d</p><p>Now that the idea had taken root, Shana was convinced it was the right thing to do. She knew that if she sat down with Adam for five minutes, they\u2019d get past the false impressions and false pride. She wanted him in her life; it was that simple.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Hawaii?\u201d Jazmine asked, her look expectant.</p><p>Shana smiled and slowly nodded. Yes, they were going to Hawaii. Adam might think this relationship was over, but she wasn\u2019t willing to lose out on her best chance for happiness yet. If everything went as she prayed it would, she just might end up with a Navy husband.</p><p>Adam\u2019s bad mood hadn\u2019t improved in a week. A dozen times, probably more, he\u2019d lifted the receiver to call Shana. This estrangement was his fault. But for reasons he didn\u2019t want to examine, he\u2019d been reluctant to phone.</p><p>Okay, it was time to own up to the truth. He\u2019d been waiting for her to break down and phone him. After more than a week, he might as well accept that it wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>\u201cYou feeling better?\u201d John asked when Adam arrived at the office Friday morning.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWhat do you think are my chances of hitching a transport to Seattle this weekend?\u201d</p><p>John perked up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see her?\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded. As best as he could figure, this was the only way he and Shana would ever make any progress. He was ready to take responsibility for his part in this fiasco and admit he\u2019d overreacted. After all, she\u2019d said it was over between her and this Bernie character.</p><p>From today, from this moment forward, he chose to believe her. His next task was to tell her he\u2019d been wrong. He didn\u2019t like apologizing, but having Shana in his life was worth a few minutes of humiliation.</p><p>\u201cThis is good news,\u201d John said, grinning broadly. \u201cFinally.\u201d</p><p>Adam leaned back in his chair. He\u2019d get to Seattle one way or another, even if it meant paying for a commercial flight.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to let her know you\u2019re coming?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to surprise her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I will,\u201d he said, already deep in thought.</p><p>He pictured the reunion: Shana would be at the ice-cream parlor with a dozen kids all placing their orders at once. She was great with kids, great with Jazmine, patient and generous.</p><p>She\u2019d be scooping ice cream for all those kids, and then she\u2019d look up and there he\u2019d be, standing in the doorway. He\u2019d wear his uniform. Women were said to like a man in uniform, and Adam decided he needed all the help he could get.</p><p>He returned to his imagined scenario. Naturally Shana would be astonished to see him; she might even drop the ice-cream scoop. Their eyes would meet, and everything else in the room would fade as she came around the counter and walked into his embrace. Adam\u2019s arms suddenly ached with the need to hold her. Until this very minute, he hadn\u2019t realized just how badly he wanted Shana in his life. He\u2019d felt the need to link his life with a woman\u2019s earlier that summer, and that need had grown stronger, more irresistible, ever since he\u2019d met Shana. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou really think surprising her is such a great idea?\u201d John asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Adam said. Why wouldn\u2019t it be?</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>\u201cI am so bummed,\u201d Jazmine muttered, sitting in front of the computer after e-mailing her mother.</p> <p>Shana was disappointed, too, but she tried not to let it show. She\u2019d spent half her day on the Internet, searching for last-minute bargain tickets to Honolulu. Apparently there was no such thing. It didn\u2019t matter what she could or would have been willing to pay. There simply weren\u2019t any seats available for the next few days. The best rates were for the following week.</p><p>\u201cWaiting a week won\u2019t be so bad,\u201d Shana assured her niece.</p><p>\u201cWe should let Uncle Adam know we\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>That meant Shana would have to pick up the phone and call him, which was something she hadn\u2019t managed to do in more than two weeks. Jazmine was right, though. It probably wasn\u2019t fair just to land on his doorstep and expect everything to fall neatly into place.</p><p>The doorbell rang and Jazmine was out of the computer chair and racing to the front door. Shana walked briskly behind her, uncomfortable with the girl flinging open the door without first checking to see who was there.</p> <p>Her worries were for nothing. Jazmine stood on the tips of her toes, peering through the tiny peephole. She stared for the longest moment, then her shoulders sagged and she backed away. \u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d she said in a disappointed voice.</p><p>Shana moved in front of her niece and opened the door. She was in no mood to deal with a salesman or a nuisance call. When she found Adam Kennedy standing on the other side, she was stunned into speechlessness.</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d His name was a mere wisp of sound. He looked good, no, better than good. Great. He was a thousand times more compelling than she remembered, and her heart felt in danger of bursting right then and there. If their disagreement had given him a minute\u2019s concern, his face didn\u2019t reveal it. He seemed rested and relaxed.</p><p>He smiled, and Shana\u2019s knees started to shake. It shouldn\u2019t be like this, the rational part of her mind inserted. She shouldn\u2019t be this happy to see him or this excited. But she was.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Jazmine was the one who answered. The nine-year-old slipped around Shana and held open the screen door. Judging by the broad smile on the girl\u2019s face, anyone might think she was ushering in Santa Claus.</p> <p>Shana frowned. \u201cYou knew about this?\u201d she asked her niece.</p><p>Jazmine shook her head, denying any knowledge. \u201cBut I fooled you, didn\u2019t I? You didn\u2019t guess it was Adam.\u201d Then she grinned at the man in question. \u201cWe were coming to see you, only we couldn\u2019t get a flight for this weekend. We have tickets for next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were flying to Hawaii to see me?\u201d Adam\u2019s eyes probed Shana\u2019s.</p><p>She nodded, and found the shock of seeing him in the room with her nearly overwhelming. Placing her hand on her chest, she felt her heart hammer against her palm. Even with the evidence standing right in front of her, she had a hard time taking it in.</p><p>Reaching for Adam\u2019s hand, Jazmine led him into the living room. \u201cYou can sit if you want.\u201d</p><p>Adam chose the sofa.</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Aunt Shana,\u201d Jazmine said, orchestrating events as though she were moving figures on a chessboard. She took Shana\u2019s hand next and led her to the overstuffed chair.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jazmine said, standing in the middle of the room between them. \u201cYou two need to talk. I can go to my room or I can stay and supervise.\u201d</p> <p>Shana\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t waver from Adam\u2019s. \u201cYour room,\u201d she murmured, hardly able to catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cYour room,\u201d Adam echoed.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jazmine\u2019s frustration echoed in her voice.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d Shana pointed down the hall, although her eyes were still on Adam. She was afraid that if she glanced away he might disappear.</p><p>Jazmine started to walk in the direction of her bedroom. \u201cI\u2019m leaving my door open, and if I hear any yelling, I\u2019m coming right back. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s mouth quivered with the beginnings of a smile. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>After Jazmine left, there was a moment of awkward silence\u2014and then they both started to speak at once.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot...\u201d Adam held up his hand and gestured for her to go first.</p><p>Shana moved to the edge of the cushion, clasping her hands together. \u201cOh, Adam, I\u2019m so sorry. I wanted to call you, I really did. I thought about it so many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of losing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen,\u201d she told him. \u201cDon\u2019t you know how I feel about you?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t reply, she said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to fall in love again, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>Shana hadn\u2019t meant to declare her feelings so soon, and certainly not like this. The way she\u2019d envisioned the scene, it would be a romantic moment over dinner and champagne, not in the middle of her small rental house, with her niece standing in the bedroom doorway listening to every word.</p><p>\u201cShe does,\u201d Jazmine answered for Shana. \u201cShe\u2019s been impossible ever since you went to Hawaii.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJazmine,\u201d Shana warned.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d the girl muttered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019d be best if you closed your door,\u201d Adam suggested.</p><p>Jazmine stamped her foot and shouted \u201cOkay,\u201d but when Shana\u2019s gaze shot down the hallway, she noticed that her niece\u2019s bedroom door was only halfway shut.</p><p>\u201cYou were saying?\u201d Adam said and motioned for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI forget where I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you\u2019d just declared your undying love for me. I\u2019d like to hear more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you would,\u201d she said, smiling despite their interruptions, \u201cbut I was thinking it would be good to hear how you feel, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will, I promise,\u201d Adam assured her, \u201cbut I\u2019d appreciate if you finished your thoughts first. You were saying you hadn\u2019t planned to fall in love...\u201d</p><p>Shana lowered her eyes. It was difficult to think clearly when she was looking at Adam. The effect he had on her was that powerful. \u201cI think sometimes love finds you when you least expect it. As you might\u2019ve guessed, my opinion of the opposite sex was somewhere in the basement when I came to Seattle. And then Jazmine arrived. At first I envied the easy relationship you two shared. And my sister couldn\u2019t stop singing your praises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t in the mood to hear anything positive about a man. Any man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Shana concurred. \u201cBut you were so patient with Jazmine and...you were patient with me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was attracted to you from the moment we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knocked my socks off.\u201d They both grinned at that. Then his expression grew serious again. \u201cHaving this surgery wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience.\u201d He pressed his hand gently to his shoulder. \u201cI was in pain, and my life felt empty, and all of a sudden you were on the scene. I felt as soon as we met that I could love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Her voice lifted with joy.</p><p>\u201cAnd I do love you. I recognized that I had to give you time. Coming out of a long-term relationship, you were bound to need an adjustment period. I understood that. But I don\u2019t think you have any idea how badly I wanted to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d she repeated, hardly hearing anything else he\u2019d said. \u201cYou love me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you wanted to marry Bernie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Brad, and no...not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll marry me.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine\u2019s bedroom door flew open. \u201cAunt Shana, say yes. I beg of you, say yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJazmine!\u201d Shana and Adam shouted simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d the nine-year-old moaned and retreated back inside her bedroom.</p><p>Adam hesitated only briefly. \u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean about us getting married?\u201d Just saying the words produced an inner happiness that radiated from her heart to every single part of her. \u201cBeing your wife would make me the happiest woman alive.\u201d</p><p>Adam stood and she met him halfway. Seconds later, they were locked in each other\u2019s arms and his mouth was on hers. From the way he kissed her, she knew he\u2019d been telling the truth. He loved her! After several deep kisses, Adam raised his head and framed her face with both hands. His eyes bored intently into hers.</p><p>\u201cOne question, and if my asking offends you, I apologize in advance. I need to know something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flickered with uncertainty. \u201cWhy was it necessary to talk to Ber\u2014Brad?\u201d</p><p>Shana sighed and kissed his jaw. \u201cI wanted to say goodbye to him properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you intended to see me next week.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then caught the lobe of his ear between her teeth and gently bit down on the soft flesh. The shiver that went through him encouraged her to further exploration.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you going to say to me?\u201d he asked, his voice a husky whisper.</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d she responded, her thoughts clouded with desire. \u201cHello, and that I\u2019m crazy in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood answer.\u201d Adam directed his mouth back to hers, and soon they were deeply involved in another kiss.</p><p>The sound of a throat being cleared broke into Shana\u2019s consciousness several seconds later.</p><p>\u201cDid you two forget something?\u201d Jazmine asked, hands on her hips. \u201cLike me?\u201d</p><p>Shana buried her face in Adam\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHowdy, squirt,\u201d he managed in a voice Shana barely recognized as his.</p><p>\u201cThis is all very good, but we have a wedding to plan, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wedding?\u201d Shana lifted her head and murmured, \u201cWe have plenty of time to work on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Jazmine insisted. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in Hawaii next week. We should do it then. Let\u2019s get this show on the road!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week?\u201d Shana looked questioningly at Adam, not sure that arranging a wedding in such a short time was even possible.</p><p>\u201cWould you be willing?\u201d he asked, catching Jazmine\u2019s enthusiasm.</p><p>Shana nodded. \u201cOf course, but only if Ali can be there. I want her at our wedding.\u201d</p><p>Adam brought her close. \u201cI do, too.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine applauded loudly. \u201cI know it isn\u2019t good manners to say I told you so,\u201d she announced with smug satisfaction, \u201cbut this time I can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let you,\u201d Adam said, his arms around Shana. \u201cBecause this time you\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d</p><p>Shana leaned against the man who would soon be her husband and sighed with contentment. She\u2019d never known that being wrong could feel so right.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Jazmine slammed into the bathroom of Shana\u2019s old house in West Seattle, where Ali was preparing for work. They\u2019d been living there for the last seven weeks, ever since her discharge from the Navy. Her life and that of her sister\u2019s had been a whirlwind for the past half year. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once Shana and Adam had decided on marriage, their wedding had happened fast, but not quite as fast as originally planned. Fortunately\u2014for the convenience of the guests\u2014it had taken place in Seattle, not Hawaii. No sooner had Ali returned to San Diego in December than she boarded a plane to Washington for the wedding. From everything she heard, in phone calls and e-mails, Shana and Adam were blissfully happy and enjoying life in Honolulu.</p><p>At the end of her tour, Alison had left the USS Woodrow Wilson and within a matter of weeks was released from her commitment to the Navy.</p><p>Because Shana had signed a lease on the rental house in Seattle, Ali was able to move there. Jazmine was back in the same school now and doing well. Ali liked Seattle and it was as good a place to settle as any.</p><p>The retired couple who\u2019d purchased Shana\u2019s ice-cream and pizza parlor had been accommodating and helpful when Ali arrived in Seattle. They loved her daughter and she loved them, too.</p> <p>\u201cMom,\u201d Jazmine repeated. \u201cDo you remember what today is?\u201d</p><p>As if anyone needed to remind her. \u201cYes, sweetheart, I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dad\u2019s birthday\u2014and it\u2019s the day you\u2019re meeting Commander Dillon.\u201d Apparently her daughter felt it was necessary to tell her, anyway. \u201cWhat time?\u201d she asked urgently.</p><p>\u201cOne o\u2019clock in Pike Place Market.\u201d Alison had arranged a half day off before she\u2019d been hired at West Seattle Hospital. Her hand shook as she brushed her hair. Frank and Alison talked nearly every day and sent e-mail messages when it wasn\u2019t possible to chat on the phone.</p><p>Because of Navy regulations, they\u2019d controlled their growing attraction and their intense feelings for each other while they were aboard the carrier. But now that Alison had been officially discharged, they were free to explore those emotions, and to express them. Circumstances had made that challenging; Alison had moved to Seattle and Frank was stationed in San Diego with the USS Woodrow Wilson.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to ask you to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJazmine!\u201d Overnight her daughter had turned into a romance expert. Given the success of her matchmaking efforts with Shana and Adam, the girl was convinced she had an aptitude for this.</p><p>\u201cMom, Commander Dillon would be a fool not to marry you.\u201d</p><p>Frank and Jazmine routinely chatted via the Internet, too. Maybe her daughter knew something she didn\u2019t, but Alison doubted it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in love with him,\u201d Jazmine said with all the confidence of one who had insider information, \u201cand he\u2019s crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJazmine!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYup, that\u2019s my name.\u201d</p><p>Alison put down her brush and inhaled a calming breath. \u201cI\u2019m very fond of Frank.... He\u2019s a wonderful man, but we barely know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like him,\u201d her daughter said.</p><p>\u201cI know and I like him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d Jazmine scoffed and shook her head. \u201cWho are you kidding? I don\u2019t understand adults. Every time I tell him he should marry you, Commander Dillon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Alison exploded, outraged that her daughter had this sort of conversation with Frank. Her face burned with mortification; she could only imagine what he must think.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go ballistic on me, Mom. You know Commander Dillon and I e-mail each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Jazmine asserted, shaking her head as if she were losing her patience. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal. You and Commander Dillon talk, and if you need me to sort anything out for you, just let me know. He\u2019s coming to dinner tonight, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invited him, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here.\u201d She kissed Alison on the cheek and added, \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go or I\u2019ll be late for the bus. Have a great day.\u201d With that Jazmine headed out of the bathroom. She grabbed her coat and backpack, and adjusted her hood against the January drizzle.</p><p>Alison followed her to the door and watched her daughter meet her friends and walk to the bus stop. Jazmine seemed utterly sure that this meeting with Frank would have a fairy-tale ending. Alison wished she shared her daughter\u2019s positive attitude. She was nervous and didn\u2019t mind admitting it.</p><p>In an effort to settle her nerves, Alison reached for the phone to call her sister. Remembering the time difference between the West Coast and Hawaii, she replaced it. Eight Seattle time was far too early to phone Shana and even if she reached her, Alison wouldn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>By noon when she left the hospital and drove into downtown Seattle her stomach was in a state of chaos. Jazmine knew her far too well. Alison did love Frank. She had for months, and now they were finally meeting at the time and place they\u2019d arranged last summer. Because she was no longer in the Navy, there were no official barriers between them. As for other kinds of obstacles...She didn\u2019t know.</p><p>After parking in a waterfront lot, Alison climbed the stairs up to Pike Place Market, coming in the back entrance. They\u2019d agreed to meet at the figure of the bronze pig in front. Her heart pounded hard, but that had little to do with the flight of stairs she\u2019d just climbed. A glance at her watch told her she was fifteen minutes early.</p><p>A part of her feared Frank wouldn\u2019t show. Shades of that old movie, An Affair to Remember.</p><p>It had started to rain and the sky was dark gray. This was an ominous sign as far as Alison was concerned. The fishmongers were busily arranging seafood on beds of crushed ice as tourists and shoppers crowded the aisles. With extra time on her hands, Alison could do a bit of shopping. But her nerves were stretched so tight she didn\u2019t think she was capable of doing anything more than standing next to the bronze pig.</p><p>To her surprise, Frank was already there, looking around anxiously. He seemed uncomfortable and unsure of himself, and almost immediately Ali\u2019s unease left her.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t come?\u201d she asked softly, walking over to meet him.</p><p>From experience, Alison knew Frank wasn\u2019t a man who smiled often. But when he saw her, his face underwent a transformation and he broke into a wide grin.</p><p>Alison wasn\u2019t sure who moved first, but in the next moment, she was in his arms. They clung to each other for a long time. It would be completely out of character for him to kiss her in such a public place, and she accepted that.</p><p>\u201cHave you had lunch?\u201d he asked, as she reluctantly stepped out of his embrace.</p><p>\u201cNo, but there\u2019s a great chowder bar on the waterfront,\u201d she told him. As they held hands, she led him down the same path she\u2019d recently taken from the parking area. She liked the feel of his hand in hers, and the way that simple action connected them.</p><p>They ordered fish and chips and ate outside under a large canopy on the wharf, protected from the elements. She felt too tense to be hungry. They talked very little.</p><p>\u201cThe ferry\u2019s coming in,\u201d Alison said and by unspoken agreement they walked to the end of the pier to watch it glide toward the dock.</p><p>Standing side by side, they gazed out over the choppy water of Puget Sound. After a few minutes, Frank placed an arm around her shoulders. Alison leaned against him, savoring this closeness to the man she loved.</p><p>Without warning, he turned her so that she faced him and then he kissed her. His mouth was gentle and she instinctively opened to him. Seconds later his hands were in her hair, bunching it as he slanted his lips over hers and his kiss grew more insistent.</p><p>With his arms around her, Frank rested his chin on her head. \u201cI told myself I wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cNot here, not like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I would\u2019ve died if you hadn\u2019t,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no bargain, Alison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean it, but God help me, I love you and I know I\u2019ll love Jazmine, too.\u201d</p><p>Alison smiled softly. \u201cShe\u2019s eager to meet you in person.\u201d</p><p>His arms relaxed as he brushed his lips against her temple. \u201cI have a week\u2019s leave, but then I have to head back to San Diego. It isn\u2019t much time to make an important decision, but I\u2019m hoping that by the end of the week you\u2019ll know how you feel about me.\u201d</p><p>Alison didn\u2019t need any time; her decision was made.</p><p>\u201cI know you loved Peter and that he\u2019s Jazmine\u2019s father,\u201d Frank continued.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always love Peter,\u201d Alison said.</p><p>\u201cI want you to. He was your husband and he died serving his country. I respect him and I have no intention of replacing him in your life or Jazmine\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank, what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>He inhaled harshly. \u201cI was hoping, praying actually, that by the end of this week you might know your feelings well enough...What I mean is that I\u2019d like you to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a week\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d he told her, \u201cwe both do.\u201d And he kissed her again with such abandon and joy that when he released her, Alison was convinced she\u2019d rather be in his arms than breathe.</p><p>A week later, just before Frank was scheduled to return to San Diego, the three of them planned dinner together. While Alison flitted about the kitchen checking on their meal, Jazmine set the table.</p><p>Before they sat down to eat, Frank pulled two small boxes out of his pocket and ceremonially placed them on the table.</p><p>Alison was carrying a large green salad and nearly dropped the bowl when she saw the velvet cases.</p><p>Frank glanced at her with a mildly guilty look. \u201cIf you\u2019d rather wait until after dinner, that\u2019s fine, but I know I\u2019d enjoy the meal a lot more if I had your answer first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I get to choose between two rings?\u201d she asked, wondering why he\u2019d brought two boxes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a necklace in one of them for Jazmine.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter came out of the kitchen clutching three bottles of salad dressing. It didn\u2019t take her long to assess the situation. \u201cThe answer is yes,\u201d Jazmine stated matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alison echoed, nodding vigorously.</p><p>Frank opened the first of the two velvet boxes and slipped the small single-pearl necklace around Jazmine\u2019s neck and fastened it. \u201cI felt it was important that I make a promise to you, too,\u201d he said to Ali\u2019s daughter. \u201cI wanted to assure you that I will love you. I plan to be a good stepfather and, most importantly, I vow to always love your mother.\u201d</p><p>Jazmine blinked back tears and so did Alison. \u201cI\u2019ll wear it every day and I swear I\u2019ll never lose it.\u201d Frank hugged the child.</p><p>Then he opened the second box and took out a large solitaire diamond ring. While Alison tried not to weep, he slipped it onto her ring finger.
