I\u2019m not really sure why that was. I mean, okay, I might have looked a bit intimidating if I was being truthful with you. I\u2019d changed since New York. New York represented a life that wasn\u2019t real, not truthfully, anyway. No, New York was the \u201cyoung, immature, in love, idiot\" side of Tom. The \u201cTie-Dye Tom of New York City\u201d didn\u2019t exist anymore. Tie-Dye Tom was dead.</p> <p>But that\u2019s okay because the new Thomas was happy with the new him. Kind of. Not really. At least he no longer looked like a douche bag. Well, I suppose that depends on your definition of douche bag.</p><p>For instance, if a tall, somewhat built, asshole is a douche to you than you probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten along with the new Tom because that\u2019s what he was. The only thing not drastically different from the old me was my given name. That\u2019s about it.</p><p>A couple of weeks after Callum married Harper, I discovered that I was in love with one of my best friends, Kelly Simsky. The idea hit me when I picked the ladies up to deliver them to The Bowery. I saw her in all her spritely glory, five feet one inch, barely reaching my waist, Kelly Simsky. Kelly Simsky with her short blonde hair, the blonde hair that met her chin and would drag forward when she laughed. Kelly Simsky, the tiny nymph of an actress who would sway and leap into a room and bow when she left. That Kelly Simsky. And damn, did I have it bad. I was forced to face the truth just about the time she met Carter Williams.</p><p>Speaking of douche bags. Carter Williams. Perfect Carter Williams with his perfect effing teeth, his perfect effing vocabulary, his perfect effing money, and his perfect effing sincerity. God, I hated that guy. He was my polar opposite in everything. Educated, born with money, and in possession of the one girl I wanted more than anyone. Perfect. Effing. Carter. Willams.</p><p>When Cherry and Charlie married, the band, my band, The Ivories, disbanded. I was pretty upset, but it was time. I knew it. We\u2019d been at it six years with little interest from labels. We had a massive following, but as we all know, that doesn\u2019t get you signed, and there\u2019s only so many nights you can play for a measly five hundred dollars before you get bored with your band, no matter how awesome they are.</p> <p>But that didn\u2019t mean my band didn\u2019t remain my family. No, it just meant we would have to find a different reason for hanging out on Friday and Saturday nights. And we did, but when Carter Williams began his ridiculous infiltration into my extended family, I was less than thrilled because that would mean I\u2019d have to watch him lay hands on Kelly, but it was okay, because I was just biding my time until Kelly kicked Trust Fund to the curb, until she realized I was the one she was supposed to be with.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t happen. No, in fact, six months later Kelly\u2019s ring finger was dressed with the biggest freaking diamond I\u2019d ever seen and that\u2019s when I\u2019d lost my chance. So when my friend Jason from Seven Seas, one of the biggest record labels in the United States, offered me a chance to move to Austin for a year as a talent scout, I jumped at the opportunity. Hell, I leaped at the chance.</p><p>In Austin, I immersed myself in the culture and that\u2019s what it was, a culture, and a beautiful one at that. God, I loved Austin. It was weird. So weird with amazing barbecue and it was made for me.</p><p>Scouting bands until late at night, I\u2019d still wake early not able to sleep because I wasn\u2019t over Kelly and she haunted my every thought, including my dreams. I\u2019d hit the gym for a few hours, then return home to my apartment, ready to see more bands and repeat the entire process day after day...after day. For an entire year I did this, aside from one tiny indiscretion. Needless to say, I was an expert at finding awesome bands. I was also built like a freaking brick house.</p><p>Which is why people crossed the street when they saw me coming. Well, that and the fact I didn\u2019t wear a color on my body that couldn\u2019t be confused with night. Layers, that\u2019s what I felt comfortable in. Dark tees, black jersey hoodies, dark jackets, and I wore these together. Anything that would help me keep the hate in, along with black boots heavy enough to weigh me back down to this earth, preventing me from drifting off into insanity. I buried myself in my hair too, kept it at my jaw, as well as on my jaw. Camouflage. \u201cNobody look at me. I\u2019m too busy being in pain.\u201d And I wanted the hate. I reveled in it, actually. I felt powerful and dangerous and pissed off, a perfect combination to intimidate the bands around me.</p><p>Soon, I had a reputation for being the guy with which one did not screw with. I also grew the reputation for being the scout you went to when you wanted to be taken seriously because I lived, breathed, and slept music. It was my only refuge from the hate I was drowning in and the only thing that kept the small sliver of flame that was the old Tom. I wanted that to burn slightly, to keep it around just to remind me of what I never wanted to go back to.</p> <p>I was Thomas Eriksson, talent scout for Seven and scorned in a one-sided love. An amazing job and a worthless state of mind.</p><p>January</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to pack your room, January. You\u2019ve procrastinated enough even for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Janet?\u201d Janet\u2019s my mom. None of us were allowed to call her mom because the word \u201cmom\u201d was \u201cintimidating\u201d and she wanted her kids to be able to freely go to her and tell her anything. Most of us called her Mom anyway just to bug her.</p><p>\u201cYes, my love?\u201d</p><p>Pull the Band-Aid. \u201cI\u2019m not going back.\u201d</p><p>My mom dropped the pan of tofu peanut butter cookies she was carrying to the table to cool.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, January?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said, I\u2019m not going back to Berkeley.\u201d</p><p>Janet grabbed the cracked linoleum countertop to balance herself. One of her signature dramatic moves that may have worked spendidly on me as a kid but held no real effect on me now that I was accustomed to nineteen years of her theatrics.</p><p>\u201cRalph! Ralph!\u201d She called to my dad from the kitchen.</p><p>I heard a slow moving almost sarcastic shuffle from Dad\u2019s office to the entrance of the kitchen.</p><p>My parents were what you\u2019d call made for each other. Mom and Dad met in college, ironically at Berkeley, and fell in love. They married, had ten kids, starting with me, January, and lived hectic lives of protests and pro bono law work all while towing us ten behind them. I loved them more than life itself, which is probably why I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell them that I was an anti-government, borderline anarchist. I felt like the less government was involved in my life, the better, because I\u2019d seen firsthand what it did from the programs my parents supported. I\u2019m not sure what my parents saw in government, but they were in love with it. Again, didn\u2019t have the guts to tell them that. Heart attacks are one of those things best left unprovoked.</p><p>\u201cRepeat what you\u2019ve told me, young lady! Tell him what you told me!\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and steadied myself. \u201cI\u2019m not going back to Berkeley.\u201d</p><p>Janet sucked in a squeal and my dad fell into the chair next to me at the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cNow, January, explain to me why you\u2019re not going back?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Another deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m not having fun there.\u201d</p><p>Janet went to the sink to clean because that was what she did when she felt overwhelmed or wanted to slap one of us or both. \u201cCleanse the violent tendencies,\u201d she\u2019d always say. Kind of liked that one.</p><p>\u201cFun,\u201d my dad asked incredulously. \u201cIt\u2019s Berkeley, January. Berkeley! Speak to me, love. Tell me why you don\u2019t want to return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to write my music, Dad. I don\u2019t do well with structure.\u201d</p><p>Janet turned back around, seemingly calmer, and sat next to my dad across the table from me. \u201cOh, January, I fear you\u2019re finally going to kill me this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanet, stop being dramatic,\u201d I told her, rolling my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll lose your scholarship! A full ride to Berkeley\u2019s Department of Music, Ralph! Gone!\u201d She straightened her slumped posture and looked me dead in the eye. \u201cHow are we going to tell Grandma Betty?\u201d</p><p>That was her last resort strategy. I knew she had topped off her desperate meter when she brought grandma into the conversation. That probably would have worked accept I\u2019d already told Grandma Betty. In fact, she\u2019s the one who encouraged me to follow my dreams. The day I told her I wanted to learn the piano, she encouraged me. It was no different when I phoned her with my intentions to quit Berkeley. She always supported me. Always.</p><p>\u201cJanet,\u201d I said, leaning over and grabbing her dish-gloved hand, \u201cI\u2019m not going back.\u201d</p><p>That night, I agreed to go to my friend Casey\u2019s show. I promised I\u2019d help him fine-tune a few of his songs so he could be ready for ACL in September in exchange for use of his couch since my parents kicked me out with a \u201chave fun.\u201d I was surprisingly unworried about my predicament. I knew something would come up for me. I had a gut feeling.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, doc?\u201d I asked Casey.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, baby girl?\u201d Casey said, lifting me up and spinning me around. \u201cEvery time I see you, you just get more and more beautiful, January MacLochlainn. Still single?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, ha, Casey. What are you playing tonight?\u201d I asked, as he led me back to his makeshift studio, otherwise known as his garage.</p><p>\u201cThought I\u2019d start with Pampered Life. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a strong start. Show me your list.\u201d</p><p>I sat down at his keyboard as I read over his list. We spent most of the afternoon cleaning up his set, then stopped by The Salt Lick and ate before heading toward Stubb\u2019s where his band, The Belle Jar, was opening for Circumvent.</p><p>Word around town was a talent scout for Seven Seas would be there to check out Circumvent. I really wanted The Belle Jar to be at their best. They were just as talented, if not more so, than Circumvent but had only been an Austin staple for about eight months.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d Casey said, nudging my shoulder with his. He pointed toward a blond guy wearing all black, but I could barely see him through the people crowding him.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Casey looked at me like I was a fool. \u201cThe Seven guy, doofus. Come on, we\u2019ll get closer. Try to edge in on him. Can I use your body to get me noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, by all means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, buttercup,\u201d Casey said, ignoring the bite in my words and disturbing the top of my hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot, Casey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, January. Fix your hair, it looks like shit.\u201d</p><p> I rolled my eyes at him and ran my fingers through my hair. We hedged through the crowd to AWOLNATION\u2019s Not Your Fault, finally finding this mystery guy slumped over the bar, again, surrounded by twenty people hoping to get his attention. Let me clarify, the twenty girls trying to get his attention.</p><p>When we got close enough and I could get a good enough view of him, I was forced to stop short. My heart beat wildly in my chest. My tongue swelled in my mouth and my chest felt constricted. My blood rushed through my veins, heating up my face and neck. He was unbelievably gorgeous. My hand flew to my neck to hide the obvious red I knew was painted there, a telltale sign that I was intrigued by something. Casey knew about this little trait I held and never let it down when it made an appearance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was tall, taller than most everyone in that room. He rested his forearms on the bar in front of him, a pair of callused hands, giving him away as a musician, nursing a pint on the flat wood before him. His hair reached just below his ears, which he tucked behind, and his goatee was a little scruffier than I usually liked but then again, I\u2019d never been attracted to an actual man before. Mostly, my silly crushes belonged to some fellow teenager and usually ended as quickly as they started. He was frightening yet compelling all at the same time. I felt like a moth to a flame. My hands itched to run my fingers through his hair and along his jaw line. My eyes were transfixed on his mouth.</p><p>Snap.</p><p>\u201cCome on, redneck.\u201d I cringed. \u201cYeah, didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see that, did you? Well, I did. Come on.\u201d But just as Casey reached him, the lead for Circumvent beat him to the punch. Casey retreated.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked him. \u201cGo up there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah, I can\u2019t move in when Stephen\u2019s there. I\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPansy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, redneck. Let\u2019s go catch up with the guys. You can help me tune my keyboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardy, har, har,\u201d I said absently, not able to take my eyes off the scout for Seven. I didn\u2019t move though. No, I dumbly stood there, staring like an idiot. I watched his beautiful mouth and teeth as he made conversation with Stephen. I imagined my own lips meeting his...Casey surprised me by throwing me over his shoulders and started to walk away, briefly distracting the Scout and Stephen from Circumvent.</p><p>The blush I knew was staining my entire body by that point boiled to an unnatural heat, and I tried to smile at the both of them but found my stare burning solely through the blue eyes that belonged to the scout. He eyed me with a hard expression, my insides came unglued a bit in alarm but also a little bit in excitement. I was Dali\u2019s melting clock personified at that moment. I felt like burning wax down Casey\u2019s back.</p> <p>Casey set me down backstage after an embarrassing walk through the bar, a walk where the scout\u2019s eyes never left mine until we\u2019d rounded a corner. I was humiliated.</p><p>\u201cGosh damn it, Casey!\u201d I said, slapping his shoulder repeatedly. My hits felt like being pelted with cotton balls apparently because Casey was red with laughter. \u201cYou made a fool out of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, calm down, January. He probably won\u2019t even remember you. He lives in this scene, remember? Sees that kind of nonsense all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, that\u2019s very comforting.\u201d I dropped my voice an octave. \u201cNo worries, January,\u201d I mocked. \u201cYou\u2019re not memorable enough to remember. You\u2019re invisible.\u201d</p><p>Casey\u2019s face softened. \u201cOh, baby girl, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, hugging me closely. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, idiot.\u201d</p> <p>Casey hugged me tighter. \u201cYou know you\u2019re memorable, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure,\u201d I said, fighting back stupid tears.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, bringing me out from under his arms, looking at me with a pained expression. \u201cI\u2019m serious, January. You\u2019re one of the most beautiful women I know, inside and out. If I wasn\u2019t in love with Sunny, I\u2019d be all over you like white on rice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I said grinning and shaking my head. \u201cLet\u2019s go tune your keyboard.\u201d</p><p>We walked to the band room The Belle Jar was readying for the show in and I helped the band learn a lot of the key changes we\u2019d made that afternoon. When I left to join the crowd at the bottom of the stage, I couldn't remember a time they sounded better to me. They were going to knock the scout\u2019s socks off the way he knocked me out of mine.</p><p>I positioned myself up front next to Sunny and we linked arms.</p><p>\u201cDid you see him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes! My God, Sunny. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen someone sexier than that scout.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cScout? I meant Casey, but now I\u2019m no longer interested in whether you\u2019ve seen Casey,\u201d she said, her eyes roaming the crowd around us. She pulled me closely. \u201cWho is this scout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven Seas has a scout here to see Circumvent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, Casey mentioned something like that to me.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her in wonder. \u201cI swear, woman! This is a huge deal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know! I remember now.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes playfully at her. We talked for a few minutes before The Belle Jar began to set up their instruments at eleven, readying for the show.</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m going for a water. You want one?\u201d I asked Sunny.</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay, save my spot, missus.\u201d</p><p>I ran toward the bar and stood behind a few people waiting to be served. I kept throwing a head over my shoulder to spot the scout. I\u2019m a freaking maniac! Why can\u2019t I get this guy outta my head? I need to focus!</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your poison?\u201d The guy next to me asked.</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cI don\u2019t drink. Still underage.\u201d I held up my black x-ed hands in proof. \u201cI\u2019m in line for water. Boring, I know.\u201d</p><p>This usually worked, but not with this guy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool. What are you doing out here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m here for The Belle Jar. I helped them clean up a few songs for tonight\u2019s show. There\u2019s a Seven scout in the audience for Circumvent tonight and I want them at their best. They\u2019re brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery cool. So, you\u2019re a musician?\u201d he asked as we inched closer to the bar. It was still ten feet away.</p><p>\u201cYeah, a pianist.\u201d I turned my head away and fought a private grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d he asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing. I-well,\u201d I said, facing him, \u201cit\u2019s just, I threw away a full scholarship to Berkeley for music to stay in town and help other musicians become successful. It just dawned on me how ironic that was. I find that hilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is...funny,\u201d he said, not finding it funny in the least.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not funny, ha-ha, it\u2019s funny, ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d He looked around a bit, decided he was bored enough to continue the conversation and asked, \u201cSo do you like Circumvent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t dare step on an Austin staple like Circumvent\u2019s toes but, yeah, they\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really, tell me. I don\u2019t know about them. First time seeing them, actually. Enlighten me.\u201d</p><p>I bit my bottom lip, contemplating ragging on this band that was merely okay. \u201cYou tell anyone I thought this, I\u2019d have to kill you, capiche?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLips are sealed,\u201d he said, leaning closer.</p><p>\u201cCircumvent,\u201d I began, \u201chave an incredible base which is fairly impressive, but I believe that\u2019s because of longevity mostly. Their talent is mediocre, their songs catchy but a bit too commercial, and their stage presence lacks. They\u2019re just, \u2018meh.\u2019 They lack the talent to really push themselves over the edge, to put them in a position to gain a national following.\u201d As I spoke, the guy was leaning closer and closer to me. He looked at me like he\u2019d just noticed me. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing for a living right now....?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jason,\u201d the guy said, holding out his hand.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Jason,\u201d I said, taking his hand before dropping it. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, currently unemployed,\u201d I said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cCool, cool. Don\u2019t go anywhere after the show, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, okay,\u201d I said, eyeing him strangely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a freak. I promise,\u201d he said. \u201cJust hang around in the crowd after the show. I\u2019ll find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked him as he stalked off outside, forgetting why he was standing in line.</p><p>\u201cTrust me. It\u2019ll be worth sticking around for.\u201d</p><p>This equally intrigued me as well as frightened me but not enough that I wouldn\u2019t find out what it was all about.</p><p>After I got my water, I headed back up front and squeezed my way through the crowd back to Sunny\u2019s side, but she was nowhere to be seen so I stood lamely by myself. I didn\u2019t care that much actually because I wanted a good \u201cseat\u201d for The Belle Jar. I wanted to be near the stage because there was a chance I needed to help cue Will on bass as he kept missing his new entrance on their third song.</p><p>Pampered Life shot out like a rocket from the beginning and blanketed the crowd around me, making everyone stunned by the power of it. It wasn\u2019t long before everyone realized that The Belle Jar was a force to be reckoned with. I was so proud of them, riding high on their talent right along with them.</p><p>Seemingly out of nowhere, my breath was wrestled out of my chest when I saw him inch closer to the stage, a quiet towering figure, eyes intent on the stage. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Breathe, January. Breathe. He watched The Belle Jar with rapt attention. As I looked on him, my feet pushed themselves closer on their own accord. I was being pulled toward him by an unseen force. I found my feet planted right next to him but couldn\u2019t bring myself to look up at him. He was too magnificent to behold, really. He smelled so delicious I could have eaten him with a spoon. He was all man, no boy in him at all. I peeked briefly at his hands and guessed he probably played the bass judging by the size and location of the calluses.</p><p>I wanted to take his hands in mine and study them for hours, rub my thumbs over the worn bits of skin and warm them with my touch. The attraction I felt for him was heady and nothing like I\u2019d ever felt for anyone before. My eyes followed his heavily clad feet, up his worn jeans, and around his wallet chain. I froze, not wanting to take it further, not wanting to know what I\u2019d do if I went any higher.</p><p>A minute passed before my gaze traveled over the little bit of wide leather belt exposed under his dark, weighty hoodie and jacket. My eyes stopped at his goatee and I felt his considerable stare on my own face. He\u2019d discovered me, but I was too enthralled to be embarrassed then. I reached up and met my eyes with his. They pierced me like an arrow, those ice blue eyes.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what came over me. I couldn\u2019t help myself it seems, and I watched my right hand travel up his arm slowly, glide over his shoulder, hesitate at his neck, but push further past the boundaries of sane as the back of my fingers trailed over the line of his jaw. I was pulled into the incredible magic this guy possessed over me. His skin was warm and surprisingly soft. His eyes closed at the feel of my hand, his jaw clenched slightly. I was distracted as his chest pumped with each deep intake of breath.</p><p>He surprised me when he turned more fully toward me and reached down, deliberately threading both his hands through my hair and bringing his face closely to mine. He narrowed his eyes, his brows furrowed slightly, conflict written in droves in the lines of his face. He took a deep breath in through his nose, languidly closed his eyes and exhaled slowly.</p><p>Sluggishly, I brought his beautiful mouth to mine. He tasted of mint and a little bit of yeast from the beer I saw him drinking at the bar earlier. It was the sweetest, most delicious flavor I\u2019d ever tasted and, God, I wanted more. There was no shame in my motions as I gripped the front of his hoodie in both my hands and delved my tongue deeper into his mouth. The kiss became feverish, dangerous, heated. He moved one of his hands from my hair to the back of my neck and traced his fingers down to the small of my back, pressing me deeper into his chest and hips, inciting a slight moan from me which only spurred him on more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly, his eyes shot open in realization. He broke it abruptly, pushed me away lightly and set me right on my feet. I felt bereft of something but didn\u2019t know what that something was. I didn\u2019t know this guy, didn\u2019t know his name, yet it didn\u2019t scare me or make me feel ashamed in any way. It felt right, so very right.</p><p>We both stared at the other deeply, panting from the exertion of our unbelievable kiss. I opened my mouth to speak but closed it, breathing deeper through my nose to control my nerves. Nobody had ever made me feel the way this stranger did. He was like electric fire on my skin. I needed to know his name but the silence between us seemed impenetrable, neither of us wanting to break the charged calm that separated us.</p><p>Unexpectedly, his eyes became hard, his stare admitting...disgust? His jaw clenched harshly. He turned and walked away from me into the crowd, leaving me alone with myself, alone with my thoughts. My eyes began to water as the final comprehension of what I\u2019d just done washed over me in shameful realization. I blinked and a single tear came cascading down my cheek. I wiped it away just as I looked back up toward the stage, Casey\u2019s face held an expression of concern, but I smiled at him just as I signaled to the bassist to begin his new entrance. Perfect timing, I thought absently.</p><p>I was no longer interested in seeing the rest of the set nor willing to endure Circumvent\u2019s. I didn\u2019t want to wait for the guy Jason from the bar either. I wanted out of there. I was humiliated and shunned and an idiot. Self-inflicted bad decisions seemed to be at the top of my list that day. I shoved my way through the crowd and finally broke free at the back on the verge of a sob. I went left into the bar just as someone grabbed the back of my shirt. I tried to ignore it, but the person insisted I turn around, so I did, ready to give them a few choice words but discovered the guy from the bar standing in front of me.</p> <p>\u201cI told you to stick around,\u201d he said in a friendly tone.</p><p>\u201cI know but I\u2019ve gotta jet. Something\u2019s come up,\u201d I said vaguely, tensing my expression to avoid shedding the tears that wanted so badly to come flooding at that moment.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re staying,\u201d he said, ignoring me and offering his arm. I opened my mouth to tell him to screw off, but he gave me a look that shut me up. \u201cTrust me, January,\u201d he whispered kindly. \u201cYou are not going to want to miss this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, a little peeved but more sad than anything. I took his arm and we worked our way to the edge of the crowd as The Belle Jar\u2019s set came to an end. The crowd went berserk. \u201cTold you,\u201d I said to Jason.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. They were different and talented.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to see Circumvent now. I want to confirm what you\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, furrowing my eyebrows in suspicion.</p><p>Jason\u2019s eyes lit up when he noticed someone behind me. \u201cAh, there you are,\u201d he said, physically turning me around to meet whomever he was talking to. My stomach dropped when I saw who he meant for me to meet. The scout from Seven. The asshole I kissed (who kissed me back!) and left me in the middle of a crowd. \u201cJanuary, this is Tom. Tom, this is the girl I was telling you about.\u201d</p><p>Tom\u2019s eyes grew sarcastic, his mouth tilted to one side. \u201cYou move fast, little girl.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped open in shock. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>All earlier sensations of sadness left me in a whoosh and replaced with anger. I could work with anger.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, a soft snort escaping. \u201cAre you seriously wasting my time with this, Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wasting your time, Tom.\u201d</p><p>My hand balled tightly formed before I could grasp what I was doing. Circumvent began playing just as I was about to bring my fist into Tom\u2019s mouth but Jason stopped my hand from shooting forward. He dragged me closer to the stage and away from Tom. \u201cDo you know Tom?\u201d he asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why - You know what? Never mind. I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>We listened to one song by Circumvent before Jason dragged me back toward Tom. We stood there, Tom and I, seething toward each other. I\u2019d offended this guy somehow. Since the kiss was burned so elegantly into my mind, I couldn\u2019t put my finger on why he was so pissed. I may have started the whole thing but he kissed me back. Trust me, he kissed me back, hard and without reserve. He has no reason to be so arrogant. So mean. So...so...so...ugh!</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Jason said, bringing me out of my hateful thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tom and I said in unison.</p><p>\u201cJanuary. She was right. Circumvent was mediocre, at best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Tom said shrugging. \u201cWe were here to see The Belle Jar, I told you that.\u201d This surprised me and my eyes widened briefly.</p><p>\u201cI know, but January offered me an honest opinion about Circumvent that bewildered me. She knows what she\u2019s talking about, maybe as much as you do, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure she did. She\u2019s just a talented, talented girl, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d I said, ready to throw that punch yet again.</p><p>\u201cJeez!\u201d Jason exclaimed, dragging my body against his to prevent Tom getting the beating I wanted to throw his way. \u201cWhat happened between you two? Do you know her?\u201d Jason asked Tom, ignoring my earlier answer.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell is up with you guys? You claim you don\u2019t know one another but you\u2019re at each other\u2019s throats. What? Did he hit on you, January, and you turned him down?\u201d</p><p>We both turned beat red, my throat and face heating to that unnatural red, giving me away.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Jason said, jumping to the wrong conclusion. I wasn\u2019t going to correct him, his scenario put me in a better light and shunned this guy Tom, but what surprised me was Tom didn\u2019t correct Jason, he just stared at me harshly. \u201cDude, January, if Thomas Eriksson hits on you, you let him down easy. He\u2019s got a broken heart the size of Montana.\u201d</p><p>Tom shifted uncomfortably in his place. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the fuck you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on! It\u2019s obvious, dumbass. In New York you\u2019re one person, you jump at the chance to move to Austin, you change everything about yourself here. You\u2019ve been screwed over. Bad, from what I can see.\u201d</p><p>I stood there, watching both of them exchange a conversation I could tell I wasn\u2019t meant to hear. Jason, realizing this, shook his head and turned toward me.</p><p>\u201cListen, January, Tom is a talent scout for Seven Seas. Ever heard of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a complete idiot,\u201d I answered.</p><p> \u201cThe jury\u2019s still out on that,\u201d Tom said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Tom\u2019s boss,\u201d Jason said quickly, hedging my reaction. \u201cThough, now I\u2019m not so sure anymore.\u201d Tom shrugged as if it meant nothing to him, this dream job, making Jason sigh. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019d like to offer you a position at Seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tom and I said together, again. We turned to each other in disgust, pissed that we picked the same word.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I continued on. I couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cSeriously. You\u2019d have to move to New York, though. Can you swing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m free as a bird.\u201d Tom snorted, but I ignored it.</p><p>\u201cGood, it\u2019s gopher work for right now, but eventually, with some grooming, you can start scouting with a veteran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, thank you, Jason,\u201d I said hugging him in a moment of unprecedented girliness. Jason was genuinely surprised and I felt a little embarrassed, my neck turning beet red.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool. I want you at this address,\u201d he said, handing me a business card, \u201cin two weeks. It doesn\u2019t pay shit but neither does scouting, just ask Tom here.\u201d He smiled but the smile fell when we looked on Tom. \u201cUh, anyway, it\u2019s worth it. You\u2019ve got an in with the execs and if you play your cards right, you can make some pretty decent cheese in time. Plus, it\u2019s a cool gig for musicians like yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo awesome. Thank you, Jason. I\u2019m stoked.\u201d</p><p>I shook Jason\u2019s hand excitedly and told him I\u2019d see him in New York in two weeks. I didn\u2019t even acknowledge Tom, turned and headed for the stage and let the crowd swallow me up, but somehow I felt Tom\u2019s stare, heavy and hot on the back of my neck and I clenched my hands.</p><p>Don\u2019t turn around. Don\u2019t turn around.</p><p>I turned around and there he stood, his eyes practically undressing me and I shivered from his hard stare. What do you want me from me? I begged him silently. I wanted him, this stranger, to want me as badly as I wanted him. I wanted him to part the crowd around me, scoop me up and drag me back to his car. I wanted his hands on my neck, my hair, my back, my body. I wanted his lips on mine. I wanted him with a fierceness I didn\u2019t find ladylike. I also wanted to sock him in the throat. What is happening to me!</p><p>His labored breath was visible from the twenty feet away I stood from him and when he was done perusing my body, he turned away in obvious disgust. Gah! My body shivered in reaction to his scrutiny. Even his stare set me on fire. What is wrong with me?</p><p>I shook my head and turned to meet The Belle Jar backstage. It didn\u2019t matter. In two weeks, I\u2019d be living in Jersey with Grandma Betty and commuting back and forth to the city that never sleeps and as far away from this guy as I could get.</p><p>New York City, here I come.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Something You Misplaced</p><p>Six months later....</p><p>Thomas</p><p>Jason signed The Belle Jar almost immediately which made me unusually happy, but that wasn\u2019t because I felt guilty about screwing over their friend, January. No, it was because they were a genuinely talented band and they were going to make the label millions, therefore making me indispensable. It wasn\u2019t because I thought about the kiss I\u2019d shared with January more than I thought about Kelly lately or that I found January to be the hottest chick I\u2019d ever seen. No, it was for the band. The band.</p><p>Even if I was into January, which I\u2019m not saying I was, because she was a virtual stranger, she was over seventeen-hundred miles away in New York City, ironically trading places with the old me it seemed. Jason talked about her nonstop, which made me extraordinarily uncomfortable. He teased me incessantly about how she turned me down and about how she blew through the label like a perfumed tornado when she arrived, impressing everyone and solidifying her as a label necessity. Oh, and that apparently she was dating the guy who delivered everyone\u2019s mail? Seriously, January? That guy doesn\u2019t even shower!</p><p>A year into Austin, Jason rung me to tell me to pack my bags. The Belle Jar\u2019s debut CD, Pick Your Poison, Miss Smith went platinum and the label was throwing a party. Also, he said I wouldn\u2019t be coming back to Austin. Supposedly, I\u2019d impressed Seven with my recent picks lately and they were sending me overseas. Dude, I was incredibly pumped and couldn\u2019t believe my luck. It was a dream come true for me. Now, if I can just endure Kelly\u2019s presence, just long enough to hop a plane over the Big Blue and leave her memory behind. Yeah, you\u2019re running from Kelly, dude. Kelly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I said under my breath as I picked up my luggage at the carousel and began the descent down the long corridor to catch a cab.</p><p>At the end, near the doors, stood Cherry, Charlie, Callum, Harper, and the rest of the gang, including Jason. Just to the right stood a bouncing Kelly on the arm of Carter. My stomach plummeted but not at the sight of Kelly, which shocked the hell out of me. No, it was because my eyes kept searching behind Jason for January, of all freaking people. January!</p><p>Marty held up a huge sign that read, \u201cMister Thomas Eriksson, Big Shot and All Around Badass.\u201d I dropped my bags and held out my arms. She ran to me and I picked her up, spinning her around, before setting her down and hugging all of my extended family.</p><p>\u201cLove the sign, M,\u201d I told her, squeezing her shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, my place or yours?\u201d I asked everyone, inciting a cheer.</p><p>\u201cOurs,\u201d Charlie said, gesturing to Cherry, as we all began to fall out the door, chatting amongst ourselves, excited and full of mischief.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019ve things been around here?\u201d I asked for the millionth time that week when Jason and I got a few feet ahead of everyone.</p><p>\u201cDude, you keep asking me that and I told you, everything\u2019s cool. Is there something in particular you\u2019re worried about? Because Europe is a done deal, my friend. I\u2019ve got your tickets all ready in my office. Chill.\u201d He eyed me warily before it dawned on him. \u201cOh, shit! It\u2019s the girl, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat girl?\u201d I feigned...badly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve still got it for January MacLochlainn, don\u2019t you? She is hot as shit, Tom, but what about the one responsible for this wardrobe malfunction you\u2019ve got going on?\u201d he teased. I peered over my shoulder at Kelly, surprised that I sort of forgot she was behind us. Jason looked as well and nodded discretely. \u201cAh, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that anymore.\u201d I shook my head in disbelief at that revelation. \u201cI guess I just needed time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, what, dude? I\u2019m confused. You\u2019ve been in my business hardcore lately and I\u2019m curious as shit.\u201d</p><p>I sighed deeply. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, man, really. I\u2019m at a crossroads in my life, I guess. I\u2019ve got this, though.\u201d I grinned. \u201cCome on,\u201d I said, wrapping my arm around his neck and nudging his head. \u201cLet\u2019s go get shit-faced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p> <p>The reason I\u2019d been harassing Jason, it seemed, though I wasn\u2019t aware of it until he\u2019d enlightened me, was because I was fishing for information about January. There, I said it. I wanted to know more about this girl, the girl who infected my thoughts with the insane kiss she also polluted my dreams with. I convinced myself that she wasn\u2019t as beautiful as I imagined her to be, that she wasn\u2019t as sexy as I conjured her up to be. I knew then that I\u2019d have to visit the label, and soon, to see for myself. Remind myself that she didn\u2019t affect me as much I thought she did, that I dreamed her up to help me get over Kelly. I was grateful for that little fact but needed to free all ties to her . I was ready to move on.</p><p>Then I remembered she\u2019d probably be at The Belle Jar\u2019s Platinum Party the following night. In the car ride to Charlie\u2019s, I sat quietly staring out the window. It felt so good to be home again, but it wasn\u2019t too long before I began to wonder what she\u2019d wear to this party, if she\u2019d wear her long dark brown hair up or down, if her ears were pierced or not, whether she was still dating the mail guy. Get a grip, Thomas! I ran a hand down the front of my face before turning my attention to the car conversation.</p><p>I thought my distracted mind escaped the notice of all but when I caught Cherry\u2019s gaze, I knew she saw right through me. She narrowed her eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cCallum, baby, switch places with me,\u201d she said.</p><p>Callum kissed his wife deeply, making me think about January again, before moving to shotgun.</p><p>\u201cSpill, Tommy. What\u2019s up with you? Aren\u2019t you happy to be home?\u201d she asked. She was the only one allowed to call me Tommy. I didn\u2019t feel like I was ten years old the way Cherry said it.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Cherry Bomb. I will never be able to be away from you guys for that long again,\u201d I said honestly, hugging her close.</p><p>\u201cThen why the long face, kemo sabe?\u201d</p> <p>Quick, think of something. \u201cIt feels bittersweet,\u201d I said. Not a total lie. \u201cI\u2019m leaving for Europe in just a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tom, you\u2019ll only be gone for the same. It\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, snuggling closely into my side. I wrapped my arm around her shoulder and squeezed, happy to be near my friends again.</p><p>That night we all got sloshed on wine and good food. The group sat around telling stories of the shenanigans I\u2019d missed since my last visit and I almost died laughing hearing them.</p><p>\u201cThis is a refreshing side,\u201d Jason said to me as we both settled into chairs on Charlie\u2019s patio.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked, my bottle resting on my knee.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re with these people,\u201d he said, gesturing through the window, \u201cyou\u2019re a different person, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I said, but even I knew that was a lie.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he answered. \u201cSo, I invited January tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, sitting up a bit, looking over my shoulder.</p><p>Jason smiled widely. \u201cNo, but I think I just figured out why you\u2019ve been so effing crazy lately.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head denying it before he\u2019d even spoken another word.</p><p>He ignored me. \u201cShe\u2019ll be at the party tomorrow, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured she\u2019d be,\u201d I said, trying to sound absent. I avoided eye contact. \u201cShe\u2019s good friends with Casey Donigan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she is, but she\u2019s also kind of responsible for the party arrangements. She practically did all the prep for it. She\u2019s a cool chick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d I said, trying to be that very word, but the curiosity was killing me. \u201cSo, uh,\u201d I said taking a swig of beer, \u201cis she still seeing that dude from the mailroom?\u201d Smooth.</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, she\u2019s free as a bird,\u201d he said, borrowing a line from her the night I\u2019d made a fool of myself.</p><p>\u201cOh, cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you idiot. Shall I just set a date at the church then because you\u2019re clearly infatuated with her. Just bite the bullet, Tom. Damn, never thought I\u2019d have to say that to you of all people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d he said, lifting up his six pack and heading for the window.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d I said under my breath.</p><p>Jason was right. I was clearly infatuated with her, but that was all. We shared an amazing kiss that nearly flayed the skin from my bones from the sheer razor-sharpness of it, but that was it. I was attracted to her but didn\u2019t want to get to know her. Besides, say, for hypothetical sake, I even wanted to get to know her, I was headed to Europe soon. I didn\u2019t have time to get to know her.</p><p>Saturday night was The Belle Jar\u2019s platinum party. That morning, I woke on Charlie\u2019s patio on one of his ridiculous chairs, my back aching like no other. I peeled myself through the window and stood straight in their dining room, stretching my body to rid myself of the kinks.</p><p>\u201cTom?\u201d I heard from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cherry. It\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the heck did you come from?\u201d she asked , laughing and rounded the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou left me out there all night. Some friend you are,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, maybe you shouldn\u2019t have fallen asleep out there, goofus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of here,\u201d I said, yawning.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? Stay for breakfast!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh uh. I\u2019ve got to get ready for this party tonight. You guys are coming, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, that was a dumb question,\u201d she teased. \u201cWhen have any of us denied the chance to dance and party, my friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that was dumb,\u201d I said, straightening a stack of papers on her bar top. \u201cSee you,\u201d I said, kissing her cheek and heading out the door.</p><p>My apartment was a few blocks down from Charlie and Cherry\u2019s. I\u2019d lived in Austin for a year, yeah, but the label still paid my rent here, and I had a roommate who didn\u2019t mind getting the apartment all to himself. I\u2019d dropped my bags there earlier when he wasn\u2019t home but could hear him in the kitchen when I walked in.</p><p>\u201cTom?\u201d I heard from around the foyer hall.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d my roommate Matt said, meeting me halfway. He gave me a slap hug. \u201cThought I\u2019d have to bring out the big guns,\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cYou got a gun?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo - I...never mind. Come in, asshole. Haven\u2019t heard from you in a couple of weeks. What\u2019s new, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing. Got a sweet deal from the label a few days ago. Going to Europe to scout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he said, his cereal-laden spoon stopped halfway to his mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d I said, heading toward the room I hadn\u2019t seen in a while.</p><p>\u201cI had Sal clean in there. That cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, before closing the door behind me.</p><p>My room was in perfect order and exactly as I\u2019d left it. I brushed my teeth in my attached bathroom, threw on my workout clothes and headed out into the New York streets to run a few miles. Working out in New York was definitely different than working out in Austin. The air was very different and I was finding it hard to adjust. I went five miles before turning around and heading back home, unable to go further. In Austin, I\u2019d run six before turning back. It probably didn\u2019t help that I drank so much the night before. I\u2019d come to be a lightweight. I only drank socially and usually had only one or two beers but that night I\u2019d gone a little overboard.</p><p>At home, I showered and tucked a towel around my waist before heading for my suitcases and dragging out a pair of boxers. I unpacked, putting everything up so I could see what I could scrounge up that was decent enough for the party. I was spoiled in Austin. It was such a laid-back city, there was no dress code for things like this.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t find anything, then decided I didn\u2019t care. I threw on a pair of jeans and belt, stuck my wallet in my back pocket, making sure the chain didn\u2019t hang weird, then picked a black t-shirt and hoodie and threw my green military jacket over that. I cleaned my boots up a bit and threw those on as well. Since I\u2019d woken so late at Cherry and Charlie\u2019s, and unpacking had taken forever, I\u2019d lost track of time. When I looked at my watch, I was actually fifteen minutes late.</p><p>\u201cShit! Nine-fifteen?\u201d I asked no one.</p><p>I rushed out the door, not because I was in a hurry to see what January looked like after all these months or to see what she thought of me. No, I was excited to meet my friends. Yeah, that\u2019s it. I hailed a cab but when the cabbie asked where to, I couldn\u2019t tell him. I\u2019d forgotten to ask Jason. I\u2019d flipped my cell open and rang him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason, where\u2019s this party at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Bowery.\u201d</p><p>Seriously? Did she do this on purpose?</p> <p>\u201cThe Bowery,\u201d I told the cabbie.</p><p>The Bowery was special to me for lots of reasons. I used to perform there all the time with my band, The Ivories, and Callum married Harper there. It was our place.</p><p>\u201cSee you there,\u201d I told Jason and hung up.</p><p>The cab pulled up in front and I could hear the dull bass from the club beat into the street. My stomach dropped a little and my heart jumped in my throat. Just go in there and chill out. I walked up to the doorman.</p><p>\u201cName?\u201d He asked.</p> <p>\u201cThomas Eriksson,\u201d I said.</p><p>The guy flipped through the list. \u201cSorry, you\u2019re not on here.\u201d His eyes lit up. \u201cIn fact, your name\u2019s under the \u2018Do not permit under any circumstance\u2019 list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a joke? What kind of list is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExclusively yours, it seems. Your name is the only one under it.\u201d He smiled smugly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re screwing with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet Jason Barrett out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it says right here...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it says. Just get Jason Barrett here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize, sir, but we can\u2019t,\u201d the bouncer said, stepping in, enjoying his position of authority a little too much.</p><p>\u201cScrew this,\u201d I said, reaching for my cell. I flipped it open and dialed Jason.</p><p>\u201cYo!\u201d I barely heard through the blaring music.</p><p>\u201cJason, come to the door!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d he screamed.</p> <p>\u201cCome to the door!\u201d</p><p>He hung up and I just hoped he\u2019d heard me correctly. Five minutes later, Jason walked out and signaled for the bouncer to let me in.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJanuary,\u201d I seethed.</p><p>\u201cOh, hoo, hoo,\u201d Jason laughed. \u201cThat is rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna let her get away with that?\u201d I asked, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah I am! She burned you and she didn\u2019t even have to be there. That girl, I swear,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>When I finally glimpsed into the ballroom, I couldn't believe my eyes. The music pumped loudly, which wasn\u2019t unusual, but what took my breath away was the swathes of billowy cloth that hung from the ceiling over our heads, giving the entire room an ethereal feel. I refused to give her credit for that. Probably someone else\u2019s idea. Jason had abandoned me, distracted by an issue at the front again, leaving me to my own devices.</p><p>That little punk ass. I searched the floor for her. I had a few choice words to lay into her. I wanted to be cured of her poisonous claws and burning me like that was one way to do it, thanks to her delightful butt. My eyes scanned the room around me. I almost hoped she was on the dance floor. I imagined myself dragging her off by her hair to the edge. No, too Neanderthal. She wasn\u2019t near the bar nor anywhere near the throngs of girls in the line for the restroom. I finally spotted her on stage, leaning over the DJ\u2019s tables.</p><p>But spotting her held the opposite effect I wanted it to have on me. In fact, all vexation I previously felt for her dissipated into puddles at my feet. Damn it! She was as beautiful as I\u2019d remembered. More so, in fact. She was bent over the tables, the hem of her short skirt riding slightly up her muscular thighs. Her long dark brown hair was down and cascaded over her shoulder, shielding her face. I hated how much I liked that she\u2019d worn it that way. She\u2019d curled it into waves and I thought back to how those strands felt sifting through my fingers.</p><p>She righted herself and laughed at something the DJ had said, making a slow jealous burn seep into my chest. My breath caught at the sight of her. Damn it! She turned and somehow found me at the edge of the dance floor. She narrowed her eyes at me, a cold stare seeping through the people around me hit me like an atom bomb and causing my stare match hers.</p><p>She walked with purpose off stage left, making a beeline straight for me. The heated anger emanating off this girl parted the waves of people dancing like the Red Sea. The cleared path in front of her gave me an excellent view of her swaying hips for which, I feel sad and pathetic to have to admit, I immediately imagined pinching between my thumbs and fingers.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mister Eriksson,\u201d January said, overly polite. Any stranger walking by would mistake it for the saccharine it appeared to drip, but I knew it for the acid it really was.</p><p>\u201cMiss MacLochlainn.\u201d</p><p>She stood comfortably in front of me, her hands laid gently at her sides, one hip cocked. \u201cI see you got in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes briefly flashed something wild. She was trying to bait me. I wasn\u2019t falling for it and that was obviously pissing her off. That made me smile.</p><p>She eyed me strangely for a moment. \u201cHuh. You do have teeth. Lost that bet.\u201d She stood a bit taller at the insult. \u201cListen, if you need anything and I mean anything, don\u2019t hesitate to ask. It\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d she said sarcastically and began to walk off. Don\u2019t let her have the last word, that would be too mature.</p><p>\u201cOh, I believe I\u2019ve had about all I could possibly want from you,\u201d I barely said, but it was enough to catch her attention.</p><p>She stopped, straightened, her hair shifted off her shoulders as she whipped back around and came stomping up to me like a five-year-old. I tried to fight the grin that spread across my face but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you say something?\u201d she asked, a foot from my face. I ignored the way my pulse raced at her proximity.</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d I said, leaning in further. \u201cI\u2019ll speak more clearly then. You couldn\u2019t give me anything you haven\u2019t already. You\u2019re quite the generous hostess, it seems.\u201d</p><p>And the facade finally breaks. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of nerve! You know that?\u201d</p><p>I fell to the back of my heels, wrapping my arms in front of me.</p><p>\u201cYou kissed me back!\u201d she continued. \u201cI was there! I know when someone kisses me back and you kissed me back, Thomas Eriksson!\u201d</p><p>I avoided eye contact, glancing to my right a bit, and noticed a waitress getting ready to pass with a tray of drinks.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, miss?\u201d I said, leaning around the statue that was January. The waitress offered me the tray and I took a cold Heineken. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>January\u2019s face and neck burned a bright red. At any moment, I suspected steam would start pouring from her ears.</p><p>I took a swig of beer before answering, still avoiding eye contact. \u201cI didn\u2019t kiss you back.\u201d</p><p>She leaned into me, inches from touching me, making my blood pressure spike to unhealthy levels. \u201cYou did. I felt you did,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTrust me, there\u2019s nothing you can do or say or even pretend that could convince me otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell yourself whatever you need to in order to make you believe that, January, if it makes you feel better. Justify slutty behavior however you wish.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled back, hit hard by my unfeeling words. I closed my eyes briefly. I immediately regretted hurting this virtual stranger. I felt physically ill at the lie. I didn\u2019t really feel that way, in fact. Truthfully, that girl just brought something out of me I couldn\u2019t control and it scared the shit out of me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole,\u201d she whispered, her eyes glassy. She turned and stalked away toward the stage once more.</p><p>I reached for her but didn\u2019t reach far enough. Every second she walked away I felt too ashamed to apologize to her. I was a coward. I knew it. Never too late to do the right thing. I started walking her direction but noticed she\u2019d walked straight up to Casey from The Belle Jar and started sobbing into his shoulder. Shit! I am an asshole! When Casey saw me coming, he sat January at the edge of the stage with his girlfriend Sunny and came at me like a bull and I was waving a red flag.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you, dude?\u201d Casey asked, fury built in his eyes.</p><p>I led him to a nearby table. \u201cListen,\u201d I began but he interrupted me.</p><p>\u201cNo, you listen,\u201d he said, incensed, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you helped my band get to where it is, and I also don\u2019t know what the hell you and January have going on. Frankly, I find it odd because she claims she doesn\u2019t know you, but somehow you can make someone I\u2019ve never seen cry in the three years I\u2019ve known her, cry and trust me, she\u2019s had plenty of reason to. Now why, I ask you, is she over there bawling her eyes out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason, truthfully. I owe her an apology. We...butt heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cNo reason. Haven\u2019t you ever met someone you didn\u2019t like?\u201d Or really liked but didn\u2019t want to?</p><p>\u201cI have but that person has never been January, for me or anyone else for that matter. What\u2019s wrong with you, Tom? January is literally the best girl I\u2019ve met in my life and I\u2019ve met a lot of girls in this business.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cSeriously, January MacLochlainn is a freaking saint.\u201d</p><p>The guilt started weighing hard on my chest then. I was taking my pissed off nature out on a beautiful, innocent, amazing girl for no other reason than I didn\u2019t want to find her beautiful, innocent or amazing. I wanted my hate back. I stood up and squeezed Casey\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll apologize to her. I\u2019m sincerely sorry for the shit I just pulled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, calming down. \u201cGod, Tom, I always knew you were a bit of an ass, but I\u2019ve never seen you do something so low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, dude. I\u2019m ashamed. I\u2019ll go apologize right now.\u201d</p><p>I walked January\u2019s direction. She saw me coming and stood taller, not wanting me to see I\u2019d affected her. She subtly wiped the tears from underneath her eyes, but it didn\u2019t help, they were still red, sending me down another shame spiral. I could do this. The old Tom could have done this with amazing ease.</p><p>\u201cJanuary,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked coldly.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you outside for a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d I begged her pathetically.</p><p>She sighed deeply. \u201cI guess,\u201d she said, letting me lead her outside.</p><p>When we reached the sidewalk, I led her a little farther down away from the noise of the club, stopping right underneath a street light. The light bathed her head like a crown. A saint, Casey had said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I said genuinely. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean any of the shit I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said a bit more warmly than her earlier tone, but she still refused to meet my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d I said, lifting her chin softly so her eyes would meet mine. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m an asshole. I\u2019ve been one for more than a year and I never realized just how bad I\u2019d gotten until I\u2019d met you. You bring out this insane side of me for some reason, and although I\u2019m still trying to decipher what that is exactly, I do want you to know I didn\u2019t mean a single word I said in there.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment, mulling over my apology. \u201cYou admit you kissed me back?\u201d she asked, a small grin tugging at the side of her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hated to admit it, but I knew I couldn\u2019t lie anymore. She\u2019d know. \u201cYes, January. I kissed you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d she said, a gleam in her eye. She abruptly turned from me and walked back to the club, abandoning me to the newly discovered harsh light of the street lamp.</p><p>\u201cShe played me,\u201d I said under my breath, shaking my head at the ground. I smiled the widest, shit-eating grin. \u201cShe played me.\u201d Probably wrong about that innocent part.</p><p>Chapter Three</p> <p>Betrayed by Bones</p><p>Thomas</p><p>A week later and I had yet remove extra space to see January since the party, which was just fine with me because the little wench had played me like a fiddle. As I was packing for Europe the next day, I heard my cell vibrate on top of my dresser. I scanned the caller ID and saw it was Jason.</p><p>\u201cYo,\u201d I said, tucking the phone between my chin and shoulder and continued to pack.</p><p>\u201cNeed you to come down to the label right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDude, are you kidding me?\u201d I asked, grabbing the phone again. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly prepared for this trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get down here,\u201d he said succinctly before hanging up.</p><p>I pressed end and leaned against the heavy wooden dresser, studying the phone, not sure why Jason needed me but feeling on edge at how short he\u2019d been.</p><p>I threw on my hoodie and jacket, tucked my keys in my pocket and headed for the door. Downstairs, I hailed a taxi, worrying my lip the entire ride there. Jason was waiting on the street, smoking a cigarette when I pulled up next to him. I paid the fare and got out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, man?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cNothing, what\u2019s up with you?\u201d he said, taking a last drag before putting it out with the toe of his shoe.</p> <p>I nearly punched him. \u201cJason, you sounded like something was up. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI\u2019m just about to head out for the night, but I wanted to hear them deliver this news to you first. I was in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Coming from you, that\u2019s a slight compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re just about to get planted on your ass is all. Excited? I am,\u201d he said, slapping his hands together and rubbing them together quickly.</p><p>\u201cJesus, what does that even mean, Jason?\u201d I asked as we walked briskly to the elevator.</p><p>Inside, Jason leaned against the railing after pressing the button for the fifteenth floor. \u201cHave fun at the party?\u201d he asked breezily.</p> <p> I joined him on the railing on the other side of the car. \u201cNot really,\u201d I answered. I eyed him in the reflection of the doors. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no reason.\u201d</p><p>Shit. He definitely knows something.</p><p>The doors silently fell open and I followed Jason past the receptionist\u2019s desk, long abandoned for the evening, down the long corridor to the executives\u2019 suites, passing the large plaques of albums gone gold and platinum on the walls. I had a hand in half the bands\u2019 successes, which is probably the only reason they put up with me as well as paid me anything decent. A well paid scout was unheard of in this industry. And I knew it. I was nervous as hell that they were about to cut me loose, not that Jason would\u2019ve been happy about that, which is why I was only partially nervous.</p><p>We entered the president of Seven, Peter Weathervane\u2019s, office a moment later. His massive corner office had a cool mid-century modern feel, courtesy of wife number three. His last wife decorated in an African motif after they\u2019d returned from Safari. Apparently his wives couldn\u2019t leave any trace of the last, making me wonder what number four had in store for him.</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d the man said, startling me. He was hidden behind a high back office chair, facing the city below him. He turned around slowly, a subtle smile gracing his face. \u201cI\u2019m glad Jason got you here. Sit down,\u201d he said, gesturing to the sleek leather chairs in front of his desk.</p><p>We both sat. \u201cSo, what\u2019s up Mister Weathervane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, how many times do I have to tell you, Tom? It\u2019s Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Peter, how\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing well,\u201d he answered, standing up and walking to his bar. \u201cAnything?\u201d he offered. Jason and I both shook our heads. \u201cI called you here because there\u2019ve been some developments. Turns out, our R&amp;D Rep (Relations and Development Representative) has decided to call it quits. I\u2019m looking for a replacement.\u201d</p><p>I sat up in my chair a little, swiping the palms of my hands on thighs.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he continued, sitting back down with a straight whiskey, his usual. \u201cWe\u2019re considering you for the position.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t get too excited. He\u2019d said \u201cconsidering\u201d and that word means a hell of a lot when Peter Weathervane says it.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhom else is being considered?\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up a bit. \u201cYou were always quick, Tom. Jonah White.\u201d</p><p>Of course it was Jonah White.</p><p>Jonah White had been a friendly/unfriendly rival of mine from day one. He\u2019d been doing this gig longer and he\u2019d been pretty damn good at it, but I learned how to do it better. He was beloved by every single person within the label though, and that\u2019s why he was being considered as well. Plus, he knew the industry a little better than I did. He just didn\u2019t possess the ear I did and it was only a matter of time until I passed him up, I knew it. He knew it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good,\u201d I said, offering nothing else.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Peter said, goading me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to think so,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deciding factor?\u201d I asked, shifting slightly.</p><p>\u201cEurope,\u201d he said succinctly.</p><p>\u201cI see. I\u2019m game if he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready got the green light from Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNow, get out of here. I bet you haven\u2019t even packed.\u201d</p><p>I offered him a genuine smile and stood. I shook his hand and Jason and I left together toward the door.</p><p>\u201cThree, two, one...\u201d Jason said under his breath. I eyed him warily.</p><p>\u201cOh, and one more thing,\u201d Peter added, before lighting up a cigar. We stopped just outside his door. \u201cJanuary MacLochlainn will be shadowing you.\u201d</p><p>I knew my mouth must have hung open from the look Peter gave me, but he had shocked the hell out of me. Jason quietly shut the door behind us. I bent quickly to open the door, to assure Peter that she would not, but Jason held me back.</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d Jason said. \u201cDon\u2019t be hasty. Do you really want to ruin any chance of a permanent position in a permanent city?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated slightly but reached for the door again.</p><p>\u201cStop it, you idiot,\u201d he said, pushing me toward the elevator.</p><p>We rode in silence, a ridiculous grin plastered on Jason\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is so funny?\u201d I asked him, pissed beyond belief.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Like I\u2019ve said all night, nothing.\u201d</p><p>I tossed and turned that night, unable to sleep thinking of the fact that I was going to have to share tight quarters with the minx from Austin, enduring her hellishly beautiful face and her sharp tongue. Why did life have to be so damn complicated for me lately? She was going to make it impossible to concentrate. I didn\u2019t want to have to train her, endure her, and fight for the position Peter was lording over my head, all the while running into Jonah at the festivals, particularly Paris\u2019 \u201cWindmill Music Festival,\u201d I knew we both would immediately consider for new talent.</p><p>After a measly three hours sleep, I awoke groggily and extremely irritable. I showered, attempted to let the hot water seep away my terrible mood but it didn\u2019t work. I dressed in my usual attire, tossed my oversized canvas duffel bag over my shoulder and headed for the train. I sat relaxed on the train, listening to my iPod and shuffled through songs but stopped short when I heard a song I\u2019d never put in my queue. I sat up a bit and listened carefully.</p><p>Neil Sedaka\u2019s Calendar Girl played, making me curse myself when the line \u201cJanuary, you start the year off fine...\u201d rang clearly through my ears.</p><p>Damn it, Jason!</p><p>I took my cell out and began a text.</p><p>REALLY, JASON? HOW DID YOU EVEN ORCHESTRATE THAT? JUST REMEMBER, PAYBACK\u2019S A BITCH</p><p>Five minutes later, my cell buzzed with the simple message.</p><p>HA HA HA HA HA</p><p>Jerk.</p><p>The airport was surprisingly packed for four a.m., but I still had no trouble whatsoever finding January. She stood a head taller than every woman there. She was also more beautiful than any other woman there. I approached her slowly before I noticed the equally tall asshole standing beside her. Not the mailroom guy, though. Still, jealousy burned through me with a vengeance, pissing me off even further.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I heard her say before hugging the guy fiercely around the neck. \u201cI love you. I\u2019ll ring you when I get there.\u201d</p><p>The guy kissed her cheek before leaving her through the sliding doors. Ha! A peck on the cheek! Sucker!</p><p>That\u2019s when she noticed me and she checked her glassy eyes. She stood taller, her back erect, and followed me with cold, hard eyes.</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d she gritted, the word polluted with hate. I involuntarily cringed.</p><p>\u201cJanuary,\u201d I said politely, trying desperately not to rock the boat.</p><p>We stood in line to retrieve our tickets.</p><p>\u201cAre you two together?\u201d The attendant at the end of the line asked us.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d January said with conviction just as I said, \u201cYes.\u201d I eyed her harshly. This would go a lot easier if she chilled.</p><p>\u201cJust step up to one of the unmanned kiosks,\u201d the guy said.</p><p>I did and to my absolute shock, January followed. I ran my driver\u2019s license through the machine, answered a few stupid questions, and retrieved my boarding pass. I checked my bag and stood aside for January to do the same. She did but with absolutely no word spoken to me.</p><p>We walked in silence through security and all the way to the plane and sat on opposite sides of our gate\u2019s seating area. I watched as she worried her lip, flipped through a magazine, and returned a few texts. No doubt to that asshole I saw outside.</p><p>Watching her full mouth brought me back to that night at Stubb\u2019s, the feel of her hands threading through my hair, the taste of her lips against my tongue. I cautiously licked my lips as if I could still taste her. She drove me crazy in so many freaking ways.</p><p>I\u2019d kissed a lot of girls in my life. Hundreds probably. It was the perk of being in a band. It wasn\u2019t until Kelly that I realized I didn\u2019t want that life anymore. At twenty-two, I\u2019d admittedly grown old, a lifetime of experiences fulfilled by a sensory overloaded New York City. I was looking for something substantial by then, until she killed that dream for me by agreeing to marry someone else. Sure, I was over her and that still shocked me, but I realized something after Kelly, no one was worth feeling like shit for...not like that, ever. I\u2019d resigned myself to loner-hood long before I\u2019d met the kitten fiddling with the necklaces choking her throat. Damn January MacLochlainn and her intriguing face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLoading zones ones and two,\u201d I heard over the intercom. That was us. I stood and she followed suit, taking a long stride for each one of mine. We stood silently side by side but her carry-on carry-on was obviously too heavy for her because she kept struggling with trying to handle the awkward bag as well as her oversized oversized purse. God, what does she have in there? Every step forward was an overexerted effort, so I took the carry-on carry-on from her without asking. She held fast to it as the line moved, but I refused to let her have it back. We stood there, silently fighting over her ridiculous carry-on until the guy behind us cleared his throat. I yanked it from her hands. She huffed and straightened her clothing, puffing her disheveled hair from her face. We boarded the plane without a single word. People probably thought we were both crazy.</p><p>Unfortunately, we were forced to sit coach because the label, although made of money, apparently didn\u2019t like to spend it. Row eight, seat B, loomed ahead of me like a dentist\u2019s chair. Seven hours of pure hell laid ahead of me.</p><p>\u201cYou can have the window seat,\u201d I said, gesturing to the inside seat. \u201cI\u2019ll take the aisle.\u201d Try to keep the peace.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d rather sit in the aisle, thank you.\u201d</p> <p>I stuffed her carry-on above us then took a deep breath to compose myself. \u201cSeriously, I don\u2019t mind giving up the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you, I don\u2019t want it,\u201d she gritted.</p><p>My blood was beginning to boil now. \u201cJanuary, I\u2019m trying to be cool with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that and I said thank you but no thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I gritted back. I sat in the window seat, opened the plastic shade and watched the men below load our bags with the utmost care you\u2019d expect those men to handle your bags. Yeah.</p> <p>By the time the plane, took off, I was asleep.</p><p>January</p><p>Tom fell asleep before we even left pavement, for which I was grateful because I didn\u2019t want to have to explain to him my most inconvenient problem. I was allergic to traveling. Well, not allergic so much as just extremely susceptible to motion sickness. It didn\u2019t matter what I was traveling in, be it plane, train, or automobile. I had a genetic predisposition of ralphing everything in my stomach each time I barely set foot on any form of transportation. It\u2019s why I argued over keeping the aisle seat, I needed to have better access to the lavatory.</p><p>As soon as Tom drifted off, I swallowed down the motion sickness pills my doctor prescribed me with my bottle of water. These I only took when I would be able to sleep for hours because they made me sleepy as hell.</p><p>While I waited for the pills to take effect, I took out the tattered paperback I\u2019d brought from home and settled into my seat but couldn\u2019t bring myself to bend the barely-there cover. I worried that my motion sickness issue would become just that, an issue for Tom. Scouting involved an astronomical amount of traveling, and although I knew this going into it, I wasn\u2019t going to let my little problem stop me from doing it. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity and the job was made for me. There was nothing I loved more than music. Music kept my heart beating, my mind clear and my soul deep.</p><p>Drowsiness took over and my head started to feel heavy on my neck. Before I knew it, my book had slipped from my fingers, tumbling to the floor at my feet.</p> <p>Thomas</p><p>I vaguely remember falling asleep but I definitely remembered waking up. I was staring at the top of January\u2019s head, her long, silky brown hair laid arranged across my chest. She\u2019d accidentally fallen asleep on me and I grinned at that. She\u2019d flip her shit if she knew she\u2019d done that. I studied it. There were red highlights throughout and it gleamed in the sunlight that shone through the window. I shut the window to keep myself from running my hands through it. I breathed deeply to keep myself in check, but that only magnified the problem because it kicked up whatever perfume she was wearing and my head began to swim.</p><p>I tried to shift her but she groaned. I was stuck. I dared not disturb her because I enjoyed this peaceful side of the girl I knew nothing about but somehow felt I knew better than anyone else. I needed a distraction. I slowly reached for my iPod in my jacket pocket and brought it out. I put the buds in my ears and an old Dashboard came on. While Where There\u2019s Gold played, I tried hard not to let the lyrics remind me of the dreams I\u2019d lost. I tried, but failed. Bitterness began to paint my thoughts with the poison only bitterness could infect with. Regret. Lots and lots of regret.</p><p>A few months before The Ivories disbanded, I knew it was over. Things were taking place that simply gave it away. Cherry started to miss practices to hang out with Charlie, not that any of us had cared, we all had things to do that seemed more important. Our songs suffered for it and our sizable following recognized it, so they simply stopped showing up.</p><p>I started to become obsessed with Kelly, making up excuses to hang out with her. This made Carter incredibly nervous, rightfully so, and she had to end our little private dinners and lunches and movies. I knew it wasn\u2019t right for me to take advantage of Kelly\u2019s naivety like that. I knew I was wrong, but I still felt an added cover of bitterness creep into my heart that Carter didn\u2019t want her to do as she wished. Another thin veneer of bitterness was added on top of my growing layers as well because it felt like she had started to feel the same way about me as I did for her. I knew if we could\u2019ve had another month or so, she would\u2019ve been mine.</p><p>That\u2019s when I took the Austin gig. I thought it would\u2019ve helped me move on, find solace in a career worth taking solace in but being alone only magnified how much my heart had hardened and before I knew it, it\u2019d turned to stony ice to keep from hurting so damn badly.</p><p>That\u2019s why I resented January so much. That night, that embrace, that unbelievable kiss cracked my carefully guarded, steeled heart. She reminded me of what I didn\u2019t want to remember wanting anymore. I didn\u2019t want to know the comfort of someone\u2019s touch or kiss. I just wanted to be alone, regardless of what that would cost my life because nothing was as costly, in my opinion, as a broken heart. Nothing.</p><p>January</p> <p>I woke to the faint sound of Tom\u2019s iPod in my ear. Damn, he\u2019s playing that loudly. Doesn\u2019t he know he\u2019s gonna remove apostrophe lose his hearing at that decibel? I inwardly sighed. Why should you care, January?</p><p>Something felt off though. That\u2019s when I realized that he wasn\u2019t playing it loudly....at all. In fact, I\u2019d only heard it so well because I was practically on top of his lap! My face and neck flamed red, of course, and I silently thanked God that my hair was fanned across my face, hiding my reaction. I smiled lightly. Hmm, while I\u2019m here... I took him in. His chest was hard and wide and so incredibly warm. I inhaled deeply, making sure to keep my breathing even so it wouldn't give me away, and smelled his astonishingly yummy smell. Oh my Lord, he was built like an Abercrombie model. I felt it underneath the ridiculous layers of clothing he hid himself in. I wanted to lift his hoodie and run my fingers down his washboard abs. Then I panicked and adrenaline began to pump through my veins...because I was a drooler. I know, I know, not exactly the most ladylike admission but I was nonetheless. I carefully pressed my lips together to feel for excess moisture. Dry. Thank God.</p><p>It\u2019s time, January. I needed to pretend to wake and act astonished that I was laying across his chest and that I didn\u2019t enjoy it. If I was going to pull it off, I\u2019d need to channel my inner Meryl Meryl Streep. I slowly stirred. Good, you\u2019re doing good. Now, rise. Awesome. If I survive, I should get an Academy Award for this. But when my eyes met his, my body had other plans. It flamed a bright red, crept right up my neck and colored my ridiculous face. God, how I hated that I had no control over this part of myself.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sunshine,\u201d he said sarcastically. \u201cHave a nice sleep, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said sheepishly, averting my eyes slightly. I caught the attention of a guy two rows up from me. He mistook my blush for being caught staring at him, which I wasn\u2019t, obviously. He winked and I rolled my eyes, making me blush deeper.</p><p>I noticed Tom eyed me carefully. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked harshly.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t help it, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp what?\u201d I asked, shrinking into myself.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d he said, gesturing subtly toward the idiot two rows up.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you implying?\u201d I gritted out. What was it about this guy that brought out the cynical in me?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not implying anything, January. I\u2019m simply making an observation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, enlighten me, Tom. What exactly did you observe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat men fly to you like a bug to a zapper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely. That\u2019s a lovely analogy. Yes, I\u2019m a man-eater, Tom. You\u2019ve pegged me completely and, what, you\u2019ve come to this conclusion all from one stupid kiss? All because I made the gargantuan mistake of pressing my lips to yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep talking about that? I never brought that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s safe for me to assume that\u2019s where you\u2019re drawing all your reference from since the kiss has been our only real interaction with one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget The Belle Jar party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you flew to me like a bug to a zapper that night, did you? From what I remember, you called me a slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not call you a slut, January! I said what you\u2019d done was slutty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Same thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not, and I apologized for that already. I told you I didn\u2019t mean any of it.\u201d He exhaled loudly. \u201cBesides! You weren\u2019t exactly innocent either! You played me that night! You dragged that confession out of me! God! I was such a sucker for it, too! I had no idea I\u2019d fallen into your web until it was too late.\u201d He pointed at himself and said, \u201cBug!\u201d Then pointed at me. \u201cZapper!\u201d</p><p>I smiled smugly and crossed my arms, happily burying myself into my seat. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t, femme. Sure you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I asked. \u201cListen, I just want to clear this up now, although I don\u2019t why because I don\u2019t owe you any kind of explanation, but if it\u2019ll make you stop being such a supreme ass with me, I\u2019ll fess up. I am not the kind of girl who kisses strange men. It was a one-time offense and you happened to be the victim, as you so seemingly are implying. I\u2019ve only kissed two guys my entire life and you happened to be the second. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry and it won\u2019t ever happen again. I swear on my life.\u201d</p><p>Tom narrowed his eyes briefly before fixing his expression to one of cool indifference. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the flight was met with uneasy silence.</p><p>Thomas</p><p>She\u2019s only kissed two guys? I almost couldn\u2019t believe her. She was so gosh damn beautiful, there was just no way that could be possible. I watched her. She bit at the side of her thumbnail as she argued with herself internally over whether or not her outburst was smart . It was. She put me in my place and I deserved it, not that I\u2019d let her know that little fact nor would I let her know that her confession did a bit more than that. It made her even more intriguing, if that was possible. Get a grip on yourself, Tom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When we exited the plane, January let me shoulder her carry-on without so much as a peep. I followed her up the Jetway out into the airport.</p><p>\u201cHave you been to Ireland before?\u201d I asked, my attempt at peace yet again.</p><p>She looked at me warily before deciding to answer. \u201cThe only places I\u2019ve ever been are New Jersey where Grams lives and Austin. We\u2019d visit New York City every now and then growing up, but that\u2019s about it. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve traveled some,\u201d I answered vaguely.</p> <p>We approached the customs counter and answered their questions.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d She pressed as we exited the main part of the airport and headed toward the luggage carousel. I held the door for her.</p><p>\u201cJapan and all over Europe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, when was this?\u201d she asked, well aware as I was of this white flag moment.</p><p>\u201cI was in a band before I joined Seven.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo kidding. Who? Would I have heard of y\u2019all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d I smirked as we came to a still before the empty revolving carousel. \u201cWe were called The Ivories.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open and she blinked lazily.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut the hell up! You were not part of The Ivories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d I laughed.</p><p>She cleared her throat and her face burnt a bright red. I got it just then. Her face would always betray her. I tried not to do a little dance at that new development. \u201cYou guys were, uh,\u201d she swallowed, her face burning even brighter. She gently stamped her foot in frustration at the giveaway. \u201cAmazing,\u201d she finished. \u201cReally,\u201d she said, turning my way and looking me dead in the face. \u201cI seriously loved the hell out of your music. I was so disappointed when I heard you disbanded.\u201d</p><p>She shocked me at that profession. \u201cHow did you even know about us?\u201d I asked in disbelief.</p><p>A smile turned up at the corner of her mouth before she looked away then at the ground. \u201cI made it my job to know good music, Tom. It\u2019s why I\u2019m here...with you.\u201d</p><p>She made me smile but I turned away so she couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>The revolving carousel was now full of suitcases but we hadn\u2019t been paying attention.</p><p>\u201cLet me know which one\u2019s yours,\u201d I gently commanded.</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she conceded easily.</p><p>My duffel came into view and I reached to grab it, tossing it near our feet.</p><p>\u201cThat one,\u201d she said, pointing to another canvas duffel almost identical to mine but in a paler shade of green.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d I said.</p><p>An unguarded smile spread across her beautiful face and my hand slid slowly to my chest as a crackling feeling set deep within began to pop and shiver, another icy layer melting away.</p><p> January was like the freaking sun.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Kiss With a Fist</p><p>Thomas</p><p>The label had a car waiting for us courtesy of a driver carrying one of those absurd signs with our names on it. Overkill. There was no one else around, but the guy held the sign up as we approached him like his job depended on it.</p><p>\u201cMister Eriksson?\u201d A boy probably not much older than January dressed in a black suit asked in the thickest Irish brogue I\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d January exclaimed jauntily, reminding me she was definitely from Texas. She stuck her hand out, surprising the boy. \u201cSo nice to meet you!\u201d she added.</p><p>The boy\u2019s face turned from surprised to exceedingly pleased as he drank her body in. He shook her hand vigorously. \u201cA pleasure, miss. Here, let me,\u201d he said, dropping her hand and grabbing her bag.</p><p>I narrowly avoided a facepalm. Bug to a zapper.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re so nice here,\u201d she said to me under her breath as the boy led us to the car.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why he\u2019s being so nice,\u201d I said, but she didn\u2019t catch the sarcasm.</p><p>The boy-driver opened the back door to a black Mercedes. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell January that this was the last decent piece of transportation she was going to see on our entire scouting adventure. She slid in and placed her hand on the back of the front seat ahead of her, her grip nervous. I slid in beside her as the driver placed our bags in the backseat.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, her face contorting oddly as she forced a smile. Terrible liar.</p><p>The driver got in on the right side of the vehicle throwing me off for a moment.</p><p>\u201cUh, about how long to our hotel?\u201d she asked the driver.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told to take you to Dublin HQ. Is that all right, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, sure, of course. About how long?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I almost laughed as I turned my body slightly toward hers and took in her awkward body language.</p><p>\u201cRight \u2019bout twenty minutes usually, Miss. But there\u2019s likely traffic on the M50 \u2019bout this time \u2018a day. I\u2019d guess we\u2019d arrive closer to half past, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay,\u201d she said, wringing her hands. \u201cCan I-Could I sit up there with you then?\u201d</p><p>The boy looked at me briefly but his eyes lit up when they hit January\u2019s hopeful glance. \u201cAll yours, miss.\u201d</p><p>January floored me when she grabbed her bag and left me in the backseat on my own. I\u2019m ashamed to say my mouth gaped. I was flabbergasted at the little minx.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, settling in beside him.</p><p>\u201cNo problems, miss.\u201d He smiled at her and I stifled the urge to knock his block off.</p><p>January rummaged through her purse as the boy pulled out of the airport and onto the M1. She pulled out a bag of ginger candies and offered me one.</p><p>I waved it away with one hand. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d I said, still staring at her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like one...I\u2019m sorry, I never asked your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAilin, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary,\u201d she offered, smiling. \u201cWould you like a piece of candy, Ailin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, miss. I\u2019d love one.\u201d</p><p>I sat stock-still when her hand reached over and handed Ailin a paper-wrapped ginger candy. My hand practically crushed the iPod I was holding when his fingers grazed hers. She turned her attention back to the sights around her but Ailin was having trouble paying attention to the road.</p><p>\u201cOy!\u201d I said, startling Ailin back to the present. \u201cIs this all you do for Seven?\u201d I asked him through the rearview. His eyes met mine briefly and with a silent, cold, hard expression, I told him to let January go because, well, because I wanted him to.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a gofer for them, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d January exclaimed, turning back to Ailin.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked excitedly before meeting my eyes again, swallowing hard. \u201cReally?\u201d he asked again but with less enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d January answered. \u201cAt first, I only fetched coffee and that sort of crap, but with time, they gave me a few more responsibilities and were impressed. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve been given the chance to become an apprentice of sorts with Tom here,\u201d she said, glancing back my way.</p><p>That and Jason thought it would be a fun game to throw us together, I thought.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, don\u2019t give up,\u201d she said, patting his free hand, making me red in the face. Calm down, Thomas! \u201cIt\u2019ll pay off.\u201d She smiled warmly.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, slipping his hand from underneath hers. She frowned but didn\u2019t think more of it. Ailin\u2019s eyes met mine and I nodded.</p><p>We met all the necessary people at Seven, before Ailin drove us to the inn the label had set us up in. January sat up front again, inadvertently pissing me off.</p><p>\u201cWe should go out tonight,\u201d January said, surprising me.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she continued, stepping around the front of the car to stand in front of me while Ailin unloaded our duffels. She looked up into my face and that\u2019s when I saw it. Innocence. She was going to kill me, I just knew it. \u201cAilin said a couple of his pals are going to Temple Bar tonight if we\u2019d like to join them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d I asked her, eyeing Ailin as he hurriedly shuffled our bags inside without so much as a glance my way. \u201cHe included me in this invitation?\u201d I asked, turning back her way.</p><p>She furrowed her brows as if what I\u2019d asked was ludicrous. \u201cOf course you\u2019re invited, Tom. I think it was mostly for you, anyway, and I was just included as a top off.\u201d</p><p>Sure. Zap. Zap.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Temple Bar is a blast,\u201d I admitted. \u201cWe can fish around for a few little bands as well, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell yeah! What a good idea.\u201d</p><p>I let January lead me into Anchor House, the inn the label had set us up in. It was charming, like most places in Dublin, and was just a short walk to Temple Bar, which would work out nicely for us. January was situated in the room directly across from mine and we each had a private bath, which was practically unheard of in little inns like these, but I was grateful because I wanted January\u2019s first night abroad to be a comfortable one. Why do you even care?</p><p>We agreed to meet at nine o\u2019clock downstairs and would walk to Oliver St. John Gogarty\u2019s because Ailin wanted January to visit somewhere authentic for her first night. I kid you not, those were his exact words. He seemed pretty smug when all was said and done, but when I \"accidentally\" intercepted his hug goodbye to January, he seemed to get my message clearly, not that that would stop him, cheeky bastard. Didn\u2019t matter, I liked competition. I mean, not competition. I meant that - I just - you see - I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea for either one of us to get involved with people when we\u2019re supposed to be doing a job.</p><p>At six, I decided that I\u2019d rather go run than eat because it\u2019d been more than twenty-four hours since my last run and I was jonesing bad. I threw my garb on, a pair of Adidas track pants and a t-shirt, and went downstairs. Outside, I began to stretch against the railing.</p><p>The door opened, but I was too involved in my stuff to pay attention. That is, until I caught the whiff of January\u2019s perfume.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, looking confused. Her eyes raked up and down my body. For some reason, this made me self-conscious. I\u2019m assuming because she hadn\u2019t seen me in anything other than baggy jeans and heavy hoodies but I\u2019m not sure why I gave a shit. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were a runner.\u201d</p><p>I took in her jogging outfit and thought the same. \u201cNeither did I. You - that is, I meant to say, I didn\u2019t know you ran.\u201d Smooth. Very smooth.</p><p>\u201cMind if I join you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, but amended, \u201cbut I don\u2019t talk when I run. That\u2019s when I listen to a lot of new music, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d she said, holding up her iPod. This girl was all surprises.</p><p>Without another word, we began our jog. Since I\u2019d been in Dublin before, for several weeks actually when I traveled with The Ivories (we\u2019d had a crazy following here for some reason) and I was familiar with the strange cobblestone streets, I signaled for January to follow me. We jogged the River Liffey past Temple Bar for approximately two miles before crossing the bridge over the river and jogging Liffey the way back to Anchor House. The buildings were a pretty mix of old and new architecture. It fit Dublin so well. A city of old, cherished tradition but the people weren\u2019t afraid of progress either. God, I loved Ireland. The last half-mile or so, I slowed down some to slow our heart rates. I was extremely impressed that January could keep up with me. It certainly explained the shape her legs were in. I\u2019d yet to really see them, since it was dark at The Bowery, but their long, lean shapes definitely couldn\u2019t be hidden by the pair of jeans she\u2019d been wearing the night we\u2019d kissed. I\u2019d noticed. I hated that I did but, all the same, I did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked over at her transiently throughout the run. I found her to be one of the most beautiful women I\u2019d ever met and that included Kelly, I was loath to admit. I couldn\u2019t deny it anymore, not when every male within a five-mile radius could sense her coming and would have jumped in front of a bus to make way for her. Every guy we passed, I wanted to punch in the gut for glancing her way. God, I\u2019m a mess. For her, I was a slobbering mess. I hated it and loved it all at the same time.</p><p>She was a good five feet ten inches, possibly taller. She met my chin, which was practically unheard of. She had ridiculously long dark brown hair and blue eyes the color of the Atlantic. She was lean and beautiful and apparently talented according to Jason. He said she\u2019d given up a full scholarship to Berkeley for piano. I was beginning to become enthralled with her and I absolutely hated it. I had to fight it. Had to.</p><p>When we reached Anchor House, we both leaned against the wrought-iron railing to catch our breath. We sat for a good five minutes before we were able to acknowledge each other.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind of a hoss,\u201d I admitted.</p> <p>\u201cSo are you, actually,\u201d she said, wrapping the cord of her earbuds around her iPod. \u201cHear anything good?\u201d she asked, gesturing to my own iPod.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I was partial to a couple of indies who were too good to want a label\u2019s interference, I think. There was one,\u201d I said, thinking, turning her way. \u201cA band in Paris. Feel like crossing the channel?\u201d I asked with a slight smile.</p><p>\u201cUh, um, of course,\u201d she said too cheerfully, even for January.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, skeptical.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s their name?\u201d she asked, changing the subject.</p> <p>\u201cAll The Pretty Girls,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cLame,\u201d she said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but if all bands with terrible original names were turned down, we wouldn\u2019t have The Beatles or even Led Zeppelin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Johnny and the Moondogs and the New Yardbirds would probably be playing pathetic hotel lounges right about now,\u201d she said, then snorted, shocking the shit out of me.</p><p>\u201cYou - how did you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you?\u201d She rolled her eyes and jogged up the steps into the Anchor House and up to her room, leaving me with my jaw flush on the concrete below.</p> <p>Zap.</p><p>After dozing off a bit after my run, I woke flustered to someone pounding on my door. I turned on my back, tired as hell from the time difference, and pulled my cell out. Eight-thirty. Damn. Wait, I wasn\u2019t supposed to meet January until nine. I dragged myself off the bed and threw the door open.</p><p>January stood at my feet, absolutely breathtaking and in one of the sexiest outfits I\u2019d ever seen. The kicker? She was practically covered from head to toe, go figure.</p><p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d she asked, frantic.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, dazed from her sheer presence.</p><p>\u201cIs this okay? For tonight? I have no idea what\u2019s appropriate anymore. People in the city don\u2019t dress like we do in Austin, Tom.\u201d I got a kick out of the fact that she associated me with Austin although I\u2019d lived in New York my entire life. \u201cSo, I figured it was the same for Dublin.\u201d Her face bunched. \u201cHelp me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is fine,\u201d I said, not exactly telling the truth. The truth was, she made me want to rethink wanting to be alone. If she were my girl, Temple Bar could suck it and I\u2019d just stay here, in this room with her, memorizing her face with my fingers and mouth.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d I stepped inside and she followed, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruthfully? You woke me up. If you hadn\u2019t stopped by, I would\u2019ve probably missed meeting you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did you want to bail?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t mind going alone.\u201d</p><p>Not if you paid me a million dollars, I thought, sinking another nail into my coffin.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m cool now. I want to get out and listen to a few bands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll meet you downstairs then.\u201d</p><p>I closed the door behind her and showered and dressed for Temple Bar quickly. I sat in front of the small mirror above my sink and wondered what the hell I was doing. I had no intention of looking for bands that night. I just wanted to stare at January. Oh, yeah, and make sure Ailin or anyone else for that matter, didn\u2019t. I took a long look at myself in the mirror. I was twenty-two years old and appeared thirty, but that wasn\u2019t because I physically looked thirty. It was because I wore my bitterness on my face like a second coat. I briefly thought for a moment if January could help me shed that coat but shrugged it off. I needed to remember that January would more than likely hurt the hell out of me and then I\u2019d be an even bigger jerk than I already was and, to be honest, I was tired of being a jerk. It was wearing.</p><p>I took the stairs into the lobby below. The friendly desk clerk pointed outside. I opened the door and found January sitting on the stoop below me so I joined her.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d She stood and wiped the dirt off her black skinny jeans. She carefully balanced herself down the steps on her ridiculous black heels.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna break an ankle,\u201d I observed before grabbing her arm. A thick, syrupy heat spread through my hand and laced its way up into my chest, making another icy layer crack and spit in anger.</p><p>When she reached the walk, I let go like my hand had been at a hot stove. We walked in silence to Gogarty\u2019s, my hand repeatedly wanting to guide her by her lower back around potholes or stumps. I had to ring my arm in every time it reached out.</p><p>Gogarty\u2019s was packed even for a Friday from what I could remember, all tourists, but the unbelievable traditional music there was enough to wrangle even a few locals. The door swung open and we were hit with the fragrance of classic Irish cuisine, in other words, a bunch of meat and potatoes, and yeast but the music, the music that filled the pub was truly tangible. It rang in the air and swept over each expectant ear, swirling to the rooftop and guided back down. It was beautiful, incredibly beautiful.</p><p>Ailin saw us from across the bar and waved us over. We weaved our way through and he gestured to two empty seats beside him. January sat directly next to him and I next to her, but I got right back up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll you have?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d she said, looking around, unsure.</p><p>My brows narrowed. \u201cDo you drink, January?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she shrugged sheepishly. \u201cJust get me whatever you\u2019re drinking.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think you want what I\u2019m having, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCondescension. Nice touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, lifting my hands in surrender. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a pint of Guinness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said smugly, making me smile like a dumbass.</p><p>I leaned down into her ear. \u201cWhatever you do, January, don\u2019t take a damn thing from these clowns. You hear me? We don\u2019t really know them.\u201d Her eyes were round in her head but she nodded. I sat back up and gestured to the others. \u201cPint, boys?\u201d They shook their heads, their glasses over half full. Not half empty. Twenty-two years of Tie-Dye Tom couldn\u2019t be erased so swiftly after all.</p><p>I approached the bar and ordered two pints of Guinness instead of my usual McEwan's Scotch Ale. She would have been toe up from just the smell of it if I\u2019d ordered her that. I gathered the pints and made my way back to January, setting the stout in front of her face and waited for her reaction. She smiled widely and picked up the pint. She hesitated, looking at me before bringing it to her lips.</p><p>\u201cDrink up, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said, furrowing her eyebrows. \u201cStop ordering me around.\u201d</p><p>I sighed deeply.</p><p>She took a long, deep swig of the stout and her face contorted to impossible angles, making me laugh my ass off.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI - I like it,\u201d she answered, her face still slightly knotted.</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a dirty look and I backed off, deciding to finally focus on the band playing that night.</p><p>They were just finishing up a lively tune when they shifted things a bit and started a deep, dark lament. January shot upright in her chair and grabbed my arm. \u201cMolly B\u00e1n,\u201d she whispered to me, never taking her hand from my bicep.</p><p>Molly B\u00e1n is a song of sad fates, a warning of sorts, meant for all young men.</p><p>Come all ye young fellows</p><p>That handle a gun</p><p>Beware of night rambling</p><p>By the setting of the sun</p><p>And beware of an accident</p><p>That happened of late</p><p>To young Molly B\u00e1n</p><p>And sad was her fate</p><p>She was going to her uncle\u2019s</p><p>When a shower came on</p><p>She went under a green bush</p><p>The shower to shun</p><p>Her white apron wrapped around her</p><p>He took her for a swan</p><p>But a hush and a sigh</p><p>'Twas his own Molly B\u00e1n</p><p>He quickly ran to her</p><p>And found she was dead</p><p>And there on her bosom</p><p>Many salt-tears he shed</p><p>He ran home to his father</p><p>With his gun in his hand</p><p>Saying \"Father, dear father</p><p>I have shot Molly B\u00e1n\"</p><p>Her white apron wrapped around her</p><p>He took her for a swan</p><p>But a hush and a sigh</p><p>'Twas his own Molly B\u00e1n</p><p>He roamed near the place</p><p>Where his true love was slain</p><p>He wept bitter tears</p><p>But his cries were in vain</p><p>As he looked on the lake</p><p>A swan glided by</p><p>And the sun slowly sank</p><p>In the gray of sky</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it?\u201d I whispered into her ear. Her body shivered. Did I do that?</p><p>She swallowed before answering. \u201cMy, uh, my Maime\u00f3 used to sing this to us when we were small.\u201d A small tear threatened from her glassy eye making me uneasy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Maw-mo?\u201d I asked, curious as hell.</p><p>\u201cMaime\u00f3 is what we call my grandmother. She\u2019s born and bred Irish. Came to the United States, Jersey, in the sixties carrying my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains the name MacLochlainn,\u201d I said, a slight grin tugging at my lips.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Americans assume I\u2019m Scottish because of the whole \u2018Mac\u2019 thing but I\u2019m one hundred percent Irish. My mother\u2019s family is Irish as well, but they came to the U.S. during the potato famine.\u201d That\u2019s when I realized that this must be like coming home for January.</p><p>\u201cIt also explains the red highlights,\u201d I blurted out without realizing. I almost slapped my hand over my mouth.</p><p>Her mouth began to form the question, but out of nowhere a man lifted me from my seat, saving me...possibly.</p><p>\u201cAh, it is you!\u201d He exclaimed loudly for the whole pub to hear. He slapped me on the back, making me choke. \u201cRight! Let\u2019s get pissed, ya\u2019 bastard!\u201d He bellowed making everyone cheer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, as he pushed me toward the bar, \u201cdo I know you?\u201d</p><p>The guy had about ten seconds before I lost my cool.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, friend! I know your band! The Ivories! Ah, right, see this here, I know your music. You were here, were ya\u2019 not, two years past?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was.

He smiled after a moment, making me nervous. My hand formed a fist in preparation. \u201cIt was my lady! Agh! Did she have it bad for ya\u2019!\u201d I tensed nervously. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with ya\u2019! Loosen up, man! What\u2019s ya\u2019 drink?\u201d</p><p>The guy was all over the place. \u201cWhat the hell!\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll take a scotch, McEwan's.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ya\u2019 hear this, boys? The Yank drinks scotch! \u2019Round here, them\u2019s fightin\u2019 words!\u201d He said, pinching my shoulder hard. I tensed again. \u201cI\u2019m just joshin' ya\u2019, boy!\u201d He laughed heartily and slapped me once more on the back.</p> <p>I downed the scotch in one gulp, wincing as it burned its way down my throat.</p><p>\u201cAnother?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019ve still got a pint at the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your table there, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not, mate! You\u2019re drinkin\u2019 with us tonight!\u201d</p><p>I peered over my shoulder at January who had arched her back and leaned toward us, trying to listen in. When I caught her doing it, she righted herself, resting her chin in her hand on the table and pretended to be interested in Ailin\u2019s boring ass conversation.</p><p>\u201cIs she with you?\u201d The guy asked when he caught sight of January.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, that\u2019s January, but we\u2019re here with those guys,\u201d I said, though I don\u2019t know why I even mentioned it. This guy seemed infinitely more interesting than dumbass Ailin.</p><p>\u201cThey can come along then. Shane,\u201d the guy said, offering his hand.</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d I answered, swiftly shaking his hand with enough grip to let him know I wasn\u2019t the type to take crap. This made him smile.</p> <p>I tossed my head toward Shane\u2019s table, gesturing for January to follow and she stood. Ailin grabbed her wrist and for a split second I almost cocked back and hit the guy square in the jaw. She played it off with all the Southern charm I didn\u2019t know she possessed, picked up our pints and followed me over, making me feel smug and a little bit stupid all at the same time.</p><p>\u201cAilin\u2019s angry,\u201d she teased with a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this guy?\u201d she asked, nodding toward Shane.</p><p>\u201cApparently not a fan of The Ivories,\u201d I answered vaguely, making her brows furrow.</p><p>When we reached the table, Shane introduced us to his friends. \u201cTom, January,\u201d he said, smiling at her by way of introduction to which she beamed back, \u201cthis is Cillian, Douglas, Niam, Rowan, and,\u201d he beamed, \u201cmy lass, Siobhan.\u201d Together, these men were five of the most formidable men I\u2019d ever come across in my entire life.</p><p>\u201cA pleasure,\u201d January said, immediately sitting next to Siobhan, an instant friend, it seemed.</p><p>I nodded my greeting. I sat next to January and we got to know those strangers better than I would have ever thought.</p> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re Irish, then,\u201d Shane inquired of January after an hour of drinking. We were all warm and friendly by this time but I mostly observed...January.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2019sir,\u201d January slurred through a slight buzz. I was cutting her off.</p><p>\u201cBy what parts, miss?\u201d Douglas asked.</p><p>\u201cBy Killarney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your hole!\u201d Cillian said, slamming his heavy hand on the table, making January jump then laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s me family\u2019s town! What\u2019d ya\u2019 say your last name was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, but it\u2019s MacLochlainn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Mary, and Joseph! I know your Uncle Donovan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of town!\u201d January exclaimed, eyes bright, and leaned Cillian\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cBy the heavens, I knew you looked familiar. You\u2019ve got your family\u2019s eyes, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Twasn\u2019t meant as a compliment,\u201d he teased but she slapped his shoulder in retribution, making him laugh.</p><p>\u201cMy head\u2019s reelin\u2019,\u201d Cillian said, looking on January. \u201cDonovan MacLochlainn\u2019s niece in my very presence. By God, I\u2019ve heard nothing but talk of your talent from here to kingdom come for years. The town\u2019s sick of it, but he carries on and on.\u201d He sat up and looked around. January grabbed my arm, making me wish I could glue her hand there, but I was too distracted to dwell because she appeared nervous. \u201cJames!\u201d Cillian yelled across the room. \u201cJames! Have you your board tonight?\u201d he asked one of the band members near the bar top.</p><p>\u201cAye!\u201d James answered back.</p><p>\u201cBut I have a gift for you, James! A Yank! A bloody Yank who can play like an angel apparently.\u201d</p><p>Cillian grabbed January\u2019s arm and hauled her to her feet, the look of surprise on her face made my heart race. I stood and grabbed her other arm.</p><p>\u201cCome, darlin\u2019, none of us bite,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cBut - I haven\u2019t prepared anything. I haven\u2019t played Maime\u00f3\u2019s songs in years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like riding a bicycle, lass. \u2019Sides, you\u2019re Irish. It\u2019s in your blood!\u201d</p><p>I was right in step beside January. \u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d I asked, worried.</p><p>She sighed but smiled. \u201cThe worst thing that can happen is that I forget and they boo me, right? Not so bad,\u201d she said, wringing her hands.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I said, taking her warm hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I think I can do this. They don\u2019t call it liquid courage for nothing, right?\u201d</p><p>I smiled.</p><p> January took the keyboards and began playing softly before winking my direction.</p><p>\u201cAn Irishman walks into a pub,\u201d she begins and the bar went silent. \u201cThe bartender asks him, \u2018What'll you have?\u2019\u201d Her Irish accent was spot on. \u201cThe man says, \u2018Give me three pints of Guinness, please.\u2019 The bartender brings him three pints and the man proceeds to alternately sip one, then the other, then the third until they're gone. He then orders three more.</p><p>\u201cThe bartender says, \u2018Sir, no need to order as many at a time. I\u2019ll keep an eye on it and when you get low, I'll bring you a fresh one.\u2019 The man replies, \u2018You don't understand. I have two brothers, one in Australia and one in the States. We made a vow to each other that every Saturday night we'd still drink together. So right now, me brothers have three Guinness stouts too, and we're drinking together.\u2019</p><p>\u201cThe bartender thought this a wonderful tradition and every week the man came in and ordered three beers.\u201d January\u2019s playing and voice became more solemn, dramatic. \u201cBut one week, he ordered only two.\u201d The crowd oohed and ahhed. \u201cHe slowly drank them,\u201d she continued darkly, \u201cand then ordered two more. The bartender looked at him sadly. \u2018Sir, I know your tradition, and, agh, I'd just like to say that I'm sorry for your loss.\u2019</p><p>\u201cThe man looked on him strangely before it finally dawned on him. \u2018Oh, me brothers are fine - I just quit drinking.\u2019\u201d</p><p>The pub erupted in laughter as January played briskly through their whoops and hollers and when they\u2019d quieted down, she stopped only to immediately start a heart-stopping rendition of Cooley\u2019s Reel. The pub kept beat on the wooden bar tops with their fists and the drummer joined in on the bodhr\u00e1n.</p><p>I watched her. God, how I watched her. She was in her element, totally immersed in her playing and from the look on her face, probably didn\u2019t have any idea people were even listening. I knew that feeling. I reveled in that feeling when I was with The Ivories. She was amazing, breathtaking, actually, and that\u2019s when the realization hit me like a two-ton bomb. I was in the deepest of troubles.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>One Foot</p><p>January</p><p>When Cooley\u2019s Reel came to an end, I awoke from my piano-induced stupor to shouts and applause. I was rushed in that moment, not really even aware what people were so happy about. I searched the crowd for Thomas to see what he thought of my performance but came across Ailin\u2019s face first. He gave me a thumbs-up, so I smiled back. I continued my search but fell upon the wrong person\u2019s face again in Cillian.</p><p>\u201cBy heavens, lass! You are everything your uncle claimed you to be and more! I will never give him shite again!\u201d He kissed the top of my head in drunken amazement before turning to talk to James, the Alba whistle player.</p><p>I searched the crowd again, almost frantic this time, for no real reason I could fathom other than I just wanted to see Tom\u2019s face. I smiled and shook hands politely, scanning the crowd until I caught his face in the back, standing by the tables we\u2019d sat at earlier with Shane\u2019s friends.</p><p>He grinned softly at me, making my heart palpitate in my chest, my blood boil. No one and nothing had ever made me feel the way he did every time he looked upon my face. I felt the warmth of his gaze from the tips of my hair to the tips of my toes. My smile pulled on one side as I lifted my shoulders softly in a shrug. His grin got bigger and he shook his head at me. My nose crinkled and my smile began to match his, reaching both sides of my mouth. He gestured toward the door and we moved in unison until we met at the entrance. I pushed through the doors first and spilled out into the late night air.</p><p>Outside, I stood underneath the soft lamplight, reminding me of the scene from New York, the one where he thought I\u2019d played him but, in truth, hadn\u2019t. I\u2019d been just as surprised by his confession as he was. I just chose to let him think I wasn\u2019t. In hindsight, knowing how cynical he was, I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I was new to flirting and obviously so terrible at it he mistook my playfulness for cruelty. I was too embarrassed to correct the misunderstanding.</p><p>Tom approached me slowly and met me under the light on the stone walkway. He leaned over me so closely, my neck craned to see his face. His expression was one of confusion as he studied my own.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it about you?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>I gulped. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I whispered, closing my eyes and swallowing again, my breaths becoming labored.</p><p>He lifted his hand and dragged the backs of his fingers across my jaw so lightly I barely felt them, but they made me feel dizzy all the same.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be this extraordinary, January MacLochlainn?\u201d He leaned closer, a look of pure frustration and anger lit his eyes and pressed his lips. \u201cAnd why couldn\u2019t I have met you before I realized I didn\u2019t want anyone...ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, astonished.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, jerking me down the walk, but I pulled back.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to walk you back to the inn,\u201d he said, with no feeling at all.</p><p>\u201cNo, stop. Just, stop for a second,\u201d I said, feeling like crying but not really sure why, I had no real reason to. I laid my hand over my pumping chest. \u201cWhat did you mean by all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, coldly staring right through me.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, searching his face for something more. \u201cNothing,\u201d I repeated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he reiterated.</p><p>Oh God, what is this pain in my chest? \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I said, barreling past him.</p><p>\u201cJanuary!\u201d We heard loudly, swinging both our attentions toward Gogarty\u2019s. Cillian. \u201cWhere\u2019re ya\u2019 goin', lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got an early start tomorrow,\u201d Tom said, answering for me, which angered me beyond belief, but I had some sort of strange indigestion and my chest hurt so I let him win that one.</p> <p>Cillian stumbled down the steps toward us and grasped me in a fierce hug. \u201cIt was so nice to meet ya\u2019, January,\u201d he said into my ear, making the tears I\u2019d been holding back fall. I\u2019d been like that since I was young. Whenever I was struggling not to cry, the second someone touched me, the emotion would come spilling out of its own volition.</p><p>\u201cIt was a pleasure, Cillian,\u201d I said truthfully. I hugged him back to gain some time and eventually, God willing, some state of composure. Ironically, the same touch that made them spill is usually the same touch that helped me reel them back in. A strange dichotomy, I know.</p><p>Cillian pulled me away from him just as I gained control, but I averted my eyes to hide the rawness in them. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in town next, lass, you look me up, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZap,\u201d I heard Tom curiously mutter under his breath but didn\u2019t acknowledge it.</p><p> \u201cOf course I will, Cillian.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust ya\u2019 ask any of the blokes in this bar, they\u2019ll point ya\u2019 my direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Cillian,\u201d I said, hugging him quickly before pulling away and waving goodbye as cheerfully as I could. Cillian watched us walk away for a moment before turning back to Gogarty\u2019s.</p><p>Tom and I walked in silence the entire distance to Anchor House and it was beyond deafening. When it came within sight, I practically sprinted down the walk and up the steps toward the door but, distracted by the pain in my chest, I fell and scraped my hands on the fourth step\u2014completely humiliating me. The tears I\u2019d gained control of thanks to Cillian now spilled in embarrassment, the pain in my chest pierced me tenfold. I felt Tom\u2019s breath catch before he reached for me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d I whimpered like a ten-year-old. \u201cPlease,\u201d I added, clearing my throat, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>I stood and carefully walked up the steps with my head held as high as I could get it, stiffening my back to the point it was almost painful. I felt Tom\u2019s presence behind me the entire time but that only served to magnify the pain in my chest exponentially. Without so much as a glance his direction, I stuck the key in my door with a tight \"Goodnight, Tom\" and steered my way inside. The bed beckoned to me and I found myself answering with a soft sob in its pillows.</p><p>I woke to a pounding head. No, not a pounding in my head, I realized, it was a pounding at my door. I got up, not bothering with my hair, though I knew it was a glorified mess. I swung the door open.</p> <p>\u201cPaybacks?\u201d I asked a stoic Tom.</p><p>\u201cHardly. I\u2019ve rented a car for our journey to London today. The ferry leaves at eight forty-five. Meet me downstairs in fifteen.\u201d And with that, he turned and walked back downstairs.</p><p>I saluted his back. \u201cGood morning, January. Nice to see you. Have a nice sleep, did you?\u201d I closed the door. \u201cJerk.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes doesn\u2019t mean jack crap to me in the mornings. It takes me that long to pee. Seriously. I\u2019m like a snail in the mornings. I supposed I\u2019d have to get used to things like that on the road. I sighed loudly and ran to the bathroom, turning on the shower. I glanced in the mirror and noticed I still had my clothes on from the night before. That probably made Tom cluck his tongue at me. He was such a \"judger.\" God! I stripped and landed in the shower, washing my hair and shaving my legs in less than five minutes. Another two minutes for my teeth. Three minutes later, I was stuffing everything into my duffel after dressing in a thermal, one of my The Belle Jar t-shirts, jeans, and black boots.</p><p>Hair wet, no makeup, I slammed my hotel door home, ran down the stairs, and skidded to a halt in front of Tom checking us out at the front desk.</p><p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d The clerk greeted me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d I answered cheerfully back. \u201cSo nice to see a friendly face this early in the morning!\u201d I added, staring straight at Tom with the largest smirk on my lips.</p><p>I hauled ass past his glare and down the stairs, arriving at what I assumed was our rental since it was just across the street and in the back laid Tom\u2019s duffel. Copycat. I tossed mine beside his and shut the hatch to the impossibly tiny rental. God, I\u2019m going to have to share this with him! There\u2019s barely enough room for one, let alone his gigantic ass! I tossed my purse/hobo-bag/lifeline on the hood of the car and rummaged through my bag for my makeup. Leaning over and peering into the window, I applied a little rouge, mascara, and lip gloss. Just enough for myself to appear somewhat human then turned my head over and brushed my long hair, trying so hard to keep the tangles out of its impractical length. I flipped it back over and detangled from there. I threw my brush back into my bag and ran my fingers through it, trying to get it to dry as quickly as possible. I was done.</p> <p>I looked at the tiny car and the potential proximity and thought twice. I reached back into my bag and spritzed a tiny bit of perfume, enough to tickle the nose but not enough to suffocate you in the car, then applied a bit of color to my lips and a thin layer of liner to my eyes. I shook my hair out and checked my reflection. Almost. I reached back in my bag and grabbed a small rubber band as well as a black chopstick. I loosely braided a French braid waterfall at the top and side of my head, leaving a few tendrils loose, tied it off, then wrapped the entire thing and all the loose hair into an unkempt bun at the side of my nape opposite my braid, stabbing it together with the chopstick. The effect was a sweeping look and it was beautiful. It always got me compliments. Ahem. Always. Good enough. Good enough? Good enough for whom, January? Oh, shut up!</p><p>Tom exited Anchor House at the precise moment I turned around. He stopped dead, dropped whatever papers he was holding and his keys but the kicker was when he bent to retrieve them, his eyes wouldn\u2019t leave mine, that\u2019s when I knew I had him. His hands rummaged the concrete below him haphazardly, making him flustered when they turned up empty. Eventually he pulled away to find what he\u2019d dropped. Ha! I\u2019ll take that compliment, thank you very much, Thomas Eriksson.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said, stepping in front of me.</p><p>I turned around and started to open the door. Tom\u2019s hand reached out at my ear and kept me from opening it, heating me up from the inside at his proximity.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, making me turn around. His nose was inches from mine. He smelled like soap, aftershave and wintergreen Altoids.</p><p>I breathed deeply. My eyes felt heavy. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the driver\u2019s side, remember?\u201d he said, waking me from my trance.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said sheepishly. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>I slipped out from underneath his arm and rounded the car to the passenger side. I opened the door, sat, and put on my seatbelt. I stared out the window, chewing my thumbnail and cursing myself for tying up my hair. The red blush I felt coming hit me with a vengeance and there was nowhere to hide. Stupid blood.</p><p>Thomas</p><p>Good God, January was a beautiful woman. When she came down the stairs, all fresh, no makeup, hair damp and down her back, I thought I was going to keel over at how feminine and natural she looked, but when I came outside and saw that she\u2019d braided her hair like she was ready for a red carpet event in the five minutes I\u2019d been away from her, I was definitely floored. Or, \"concreted\" depending how you looked at it.</p><p>I blundered around like an idiot at my own feet staring at her incredible face. I\u2019d given her fifteen minutes\u2014not actually thinking she\u2019d only take the fifteen minutes. Weren\u2019t women supposed to take twice as long as the time limit given them? She was supposed to take longer, and then I was supposed to give her shit for it. After all that, she was supposed to put me in my place. That\u2019s how it was supposed to work. She made me feel like an idiot in so many ways. Particularly in this moment because we were going to be hella early and it was all because I put a ridiculous time limit on this gorgeous girl just because I felt like being an ass. And I was.</p><p>I got in the car and belted myself in. I glanced January\u2019s direction and noticed her neck was a flaming red. All I could do was smile like an imbecile at that knowledge. She was flushed and I\u2019d deciphered that she only became beet red for one of two reasons. One, she was flustered because she was embarrassed or, two, she was flustered because she was attracted to whomever she was talking to. My smug ass was sure this flush was the latter because, well, I was attracted to her in the previous moment, but that didn\u2019t make me feel as pissed off as I\u2019d been when it had happened before. No, it made me excited and hopeful, therefore making me pissed off at myself for not being pissed off. I\u2019m an idiot.</p><p>I started the car and put it in drive before jetting off onto the cobblestone road and taking a left on Beresford. We were at the port in less than fifteen minutes. Luckily, there were cars lined up to board the ferry, which essentially looked like an overgrown speedboat, if I was being honest. That made me slightly nervous, but apparently the Dublin Swift would take us to Holyhead in North Wales in less than two hours and that would work out perfectly for time as we could be in London by five in the evening, leaving us just enough time to rest and go out that night. There were three bands the label wanted us to look at.</p><p>\u201cCouple of things,\u201d I said, breaking the silence. January jumped. I cleared my throat. \u201cSorry. Anyway, um, we should be in London by this evening. There\u2019re three bands there Seven wants us to look at and I know of two for sure that I have been wanting to see since meeting them both in New York when I was with The Ivories.\u201d</p><p>She turned her alluring head my direction and I bit my lip to keep myself from rushing across the tiny space and kissing off her face. \u201cFive bands in one night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know it\u2019s the pits, but they don\u2019t like paying our bills if it doesn\u2019t prove worth it, catch me? This is a hard job, January. It doesn\u2019t pay shit. You get no job assurance, no perks, no sleep. When you do get to sleep, it\u2019s in some shady places sometimes, but it\u2019s worth it for most of us because we get paid to listen to music. You think you can hang?\u201d</p><p>She furrowed her brows at me. \u201cAnything you dish my way, I can take. Trust me. I\u2019m a big girl.\u201d</p><p>Good thing the car was in drive or I would have lifted her into my lap at that last comment. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can,\u201d I said, not able to help myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, whipping her head back around.</p><p>\u201cNothing, I mean, we don\u2019t have to stay for all the songs in their sets, you know. We can get a feel for them and if we don\u2019t like it, we can move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay, that\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>As the line to board our car inched closer to the ship, I noticed January\u2019s hand twisting in circles. She kept worrying her lip and pinching her brows. Her breathing got deeper and she actually started to worry me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I asked, concerned.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, turning my way again, her lips pursed.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I said, laughing. \u201cYou look ready to jump ship and we haven\u2019t boarded yet. You afraid to sail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, something like that,\u201d she said, fretting at her hands.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not going to lie to you, it\u2019s a bit of a rocky ride but it\u2019s completely safe.\u201d A small squeak sounded from her side of the car. \u201cJanuary?\u201d I asked.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t answer me because we were asked to follow the line ahead of us to board. I obeyed the guy\u2019s gesture up the ramp and parked behind the long line of cars. January and I both got out and after I locked the car doors, we headed up the steel grate stairs into an elaborate lobby, similar to something you\u2019d see on a cruise ship but much smaller in size.</p><p>I pointed to a lounge area where a few people were already mingling about and we sat. January plopped her purse on her lap and started sifting through its contents, lazily at first but grew more frantic as time passed.</p><p>\u201cJanuary?\u201d I asked but she didn\u2019t answer. \u201cJanuary,\u201d I said a bit louder but still no response. \u201cJanuary!\u201d I practically yelled.</p><p>She looked up at me and her eyes were wide and distraught. \u201cMy medicine,\u201d she said as if I\u2019d understand.</p> <p>\u201cYour medicine,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes, my medicine. I - I need it and it\u2019s not here. I must have packed it in the duffel.\u201d She stood up, right as the captain was making his announcement we were leaving port.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go down there, January. All the doors to the cars will be locked. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to become overwrought at that news and I felt like my heart was going to pound out of my chest. Oh my God, what if these pills are a matter of life and death.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I said, grabbing her hand in mine. Instead of the usual warmth I\u2019d felt before, they were ice cold. As we walked, I couldn\u2019t stop myself from warming them between my own. \u201cWhat,\u201d I said, before taking a deep breath, bracing myself for news she had some crazy heart condition or something. \u201cWhat are the pills for?\u201d I tried to ask breezily.</p><p>\u201cMotion sickness,\u201d she said, shocking me. The adrenaline I\u2019d felt preparing myself for bad news turned to anger.</p> <p>\u201cWhat!\u201d I asked too loudly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you,\u201d she said, fidgeting near the door. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she asked a ship employee, \u201cbut I\u2019ve left something in our car. Is it possible to retrieve it?\u201d</p><p>The employee, a young man, probably my age, frowned at her, looking like it broke his heart that he couldn\u2019t help this damsel in distress. Zap. I wanted to punch him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, miss, but once the ship leaves dock, these doors go on automatic locks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay,\u201d January said, deflated. The man walked away but not without glancing back once more.</p><p>\u201cJanuary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d she asked, distracted.</p><p>\u201cYou have motion sickness. Like, when you sail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, not exactly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I get motion sickness on everything. Car, train, boat, plane. You name it, I get sick...and not just a little sick either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary MacLochlainn,\u201d I said, scrubbing the back of my neck in frustration. \u201cHow the hell did you think you were going to do this job, huh? It\u2019s nothing but traveling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, this isn\u2019t a handicap, okay? I can travel, I just need meds to do it.\u201d Her eyes went wide and she placed her hand over her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s happening,\u201d she said as the boat tipped and weaved in the water, ready to sail.</p><p>\u201cOh no, it\u2019s not,\u201d I said, grabbing her hand and heading to the shops on the ship. \u201cGod, I should have known when you offered that ridiculous ginger candy that only my grandmother would eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t mention food,\u201d she whined.</p><p>I could only sigh my frustration.</p><p>Truthfully? I was more upset that she was in any kind of pain. For some reason, the idea of this girl in agony made my stomach twist. In the nearest shop, I ducked inside and got a lemon-lime carbonated drink that looked like Sprite and a few boxes of seasick meds. I slid Seven\u2019s credit card because I\u2019d forgotten my own back in the car. I didn\u2019t want to think about how I was going to explain these weird charges to Jason. He could just suck it, January was ill.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I said to a very green looking January. She leaned on me, which let me know just how ill she was. I knew her well enough to know she wouldn\u2019t have done it unless things were dire. She\u2019d wanted me to think she hated me. I dragged her to a window seat and sat her down. I tore off the cap to the soft drink as quickly as possible and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cStart sipping,\u201d I said. She took it and brought her trembling hands to her mouth.</p><p>I ripped open the box of what I thought looked the most promising, relief-wise, in the shop and handed her the two pills. She downed them quickly and I sat beside her, reading the label to the other box to make sure I could mix the medicines if the other didn\u2019t work. I picked up her bag and dug out her ridiculously ginormous bag of ginger remedy/old lady candy and unwrapped a piece.</p><p>\u201cTake it,\u201d I said, handing it to her.</p><p>She shifted her body around so she wouldn\u2019t be facing the ocean. I dragged her closer to me and made her lean her head on my shoulder. I rubbed up and down her arm until she seemed to feel better, her breathing becoming steady again.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said to the air in front of us.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. I hate seeing you hurt. I\u2019m sorry for hurting you last night. The look on your face speared my icy heart. I wish I could take it all back. But like a coward, I didn\u2019t say any of it. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to say the words.</p><p>She sat up, leaving my side bereft of her warmth. \u201cDo you know why you\u2019re with me here, January?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m being punished by God?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being groomed,\u201d I told her, ignoring her jab.</p><p>\u201cPass me that banana, will ya\u2019?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you\u2019re feeling better. It was touch and go there for a while,\u201d I joshed back.</p><p>She smirked. \u201cSo you\u2019re grooming me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor my job,\u201d I said.</p><p>Her brows creased. \u201cWhy? Are you leaving Seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m being considered for a position on the upper floor. Management, baby,\u201d I said, not realizing I\u2019d said baby until it was too late. Her eyes popped wide for a moment. I cleared my throat. \u201cManagement. Mom would be so proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit. When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not when it\u2019s if. Jonah and I are both vying for the same position. This little international excursion is a test, a competition.\u201d</p><p>January thought for moment before the most mischievous look on her face crossed her features. \u201cWe\u2019ll beat \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>She made my heart pound. \u201cWe will?\u201d I shifted my feet around a bit.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI know your ear for music and I know his. We\u2019re going to beat him.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re going to beat him, she\u2019d said. \u201cIf you say so,\u201d I said, turning my head toward the water but feeling an ache in my chest the likes I\u2019d never felt before. I barely stopped my hand from grabbing at my heart.</p><p>January fell asleep on my chest half an hour into our journey and I hated how much I loved looking at her as she slept.</p><p>January</p><p>Thomas thought I\u2019d fallen asleep on his chest. I knew this because after I\u2019d taken the liberty of using his chest as a pillow and a few minutes had passed in silence, I\u2019d opened my mouth to tell him what an incredible ass I thought he was but was struck mute when he tentatively began to rub my arm. I fought the goose bumps threatening to betray me and paid great attention to the movement of his hand.</p><p>At first, he used only the tip of his index finger, experimenting with a mere graze here and there. I guessed when he felt like I was properly asleep because I felt the weight of all his fingertips explore the surface of my arm, but he always remained above the elbow, still testing the waters it seemed. He traced the contours of my arm over and over almost driving me insane but just when I was about to shiver uncontrollably, he placed his entire warm palm on my arm and guided it down to my wrist then back up.</p><p>It was the sexiest thing I\u2019d ever experienced and it was only my bleeping arm. He stopped and I wanted to cry out for him to continue, but he surprised me when I felt his warm palm cross my nape and throat. He guided his hand up to the back of my neck and back down to my shoulders. My breathing got deeper and I fought to regulate it, swallowing as silently as possible so not to scare him off.</p><p>\u201cSo soft,\u201d he barely breathed, making me melt at this unseen side of him.</p><p>His hand followed my arm down again until he reached my hand. He picked it up and rubbed his thumb over the back of my hand before threading his fingers through my own, holding them there. I wanted so badly to squeeze his grip, to let him know I knew and that it was okay, but couldn\u2019t bring myself to ruin the amazing moment. The moment I discovered Thomas Eriksson was nothing but a fake. His river ran much deeper than I imagined, and I knew this from his careful and remarkably affectionate touch. He was a master at the game of pretend, but I knew all his secrets in this tiny slip of his guard and I planned on disarming him completely...by Paris. Careful, Thomas. I thought. I\u2019ve got your number.</p><p>That\u2019s when my eyes closed in sincerity. I\u2019d never fallen asleep so easily and I had Tom to thank for that.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to sleep on me very easily,\u201d Tom said, waking me.</p><p>I turned over in his lap and looked up into his face, smiling like I knew something he didn\u2019t. \u201cGood morning?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s close to eleven now. We\u2019re docking soon. Now, actually. We should be able to get to our car within the next fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and stretched, still smiling. He\u2019d let me sleep on him the entire ferry ride.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, suspicious.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, checking my stupid grin.</p><p>People were lining up at the doors to access their cars and we followed suit. Inching closer and closer as the Dublin Swift\u2019s employees guided everyone to their vehicles. We weren\u2019t allowed to start our cars until they\u2019d opened the lift to the dock so we sat in absolute silence, waiting.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you played the piano?\u201d Tom asked, drumming his fingers on the wheel of the car.</p><p>\u201cSince I was four...so, about fifteen years. My grandmother taught me at first when she lived in Austin, before she relocated back to Jersey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that where you learned Cooley\u2019s Reel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know a bunch of silly Irish tunes like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talented,\u201d he said, making me blush to my toes.</p><p>\u201cThank you, but you don\u2019t have to lie,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he bit out, very serious and startling me. \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he repeated, softer. \u201cYou\u2019re truly gifted, January.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTh-thank you,\u201d I said, staring at him in astonishment. \u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed at that. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBull. Shit. You are talented. You forget, I knew your band before I knew you. I know who wrote all your songs. It was your name on almost every track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah and a fat lot of good that got me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may not have gotten you signed, but that\u2019s the luck of the draw in my opinion. You and I both know there are a million bands out there that didn\u2019t make it but are just as, if not more, talented than those who have. Maybe that\u2019s why you\u2019re here, in this car with me, waiting to see five bands in London. You know what talent really is, and you can help push it to the front of the queue with Seven.\u201d</p><p>He dragged the side of this thumb across the top of the steering wheel and I accepted that as a form of acknowledgement.</p><p>\u201cBesides I\u2019m kind of glad you didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice, January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really. Listen, if you had made it, I\u2019d have never...\u201d kissed you, \u201cmet you and wouldn\u2019t have gotten the ultimate lesson in scouting under such awesome tutelage. Call me selfish, but I\u2019m happy to be sitting here with you.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me and shook his head, a tiny grin gracing his lips. Bingo.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re incredibly suited for this job, Tom. It may not be what you had imagined yourself doing, but fate has a way of stepping in and guiding you the direction you need to go even when you yourself had no intention of creating that path.\u201d I sighed deeply.</p><p>A chorus of engines started as the lift to the ferry opened up and Holyhead\u2019s blue sky greeted us.</p><p>\u201cWe need to feed you,\u201d he said out loud, not really talking to me.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll just get my bib and rubber-coated spoon then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he said, laughing and surprising me.</p><p>\u201cI just meant that if we\u2019re going to be on the road for a while and what with your little issue, you probably need to eat something to keep you from feeling ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d I said, genuinely touched that he even thought past the minute with me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><p>Our little rental putted down and out into the fresh sea air.</p><p>\u201cPass this way with a pure heart,\u201d I said, reading an inscription on a bit of concrete just off the port.</p><p>\u201cHolyhead\u2019s motto.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery pretty.\u201d</p><p>Tom grunted his reply. I suppose it was better than nothing.</p><p>\u201cI know of a fish and chips shop just off Cambria in the city proper. Cherry found it when The Ivories were here a few years back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cCherry, from The Ivories Cherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, she is so freaking cool. I love the crap out of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is cool, my Cherry Bomb. She\u2019s a sister to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about your friends.\u201d I knew this was a subject he wouldn\u2019t shy away from. It was the one topic that made Tom\u2019s eyes light up like the Fourth of July.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my family. You probably know all about The Ivories, but there\u2019re a few more of them who don\u2019t take a stage at all but are so extraordinary they should.</p><p>\u201cFor instance, besides Cherry, Callum and Harper are my best friends. I hang or hung, before I moved to Austin, with them almost every other day. January,\u201d he said, meeting my eyes for a moment before moving them back to the road, \u201cthey are so freaking amazing. Both of them grew up in the foster system and were kicked out at eighteen with nothing but the shirts on their backs. They met, worked themselves up from nothing and are becoming some of the most accomplished people I\u2019ve ever met in my entire life! And they never asked for anything. They became extraordinary all on their own.\u201d He shook his head and took a deep breath. \u201cI miss them so much,\u201d he said, his neck and face heating up at their memory. He was fighting with emotion so badly it was affecting his heart, I could tell.</p><p>\u201cI want to meet them,\u201d I said, trying to keep him there with me, to keep him from reverting back to his closed-off normal self.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d he said, shocking me mute. \u201cThey\u2019d love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I barely whispered as we pulled up to the chip shop.</p><p>We walked into the tiny little shop and bought an order of fish and chips to share. Turns out, we both liked vinegar and salt on our chips so I lucked out there. With drinks in hand, Tom and I sauntered across the street and set our food on the wall between us and a very beautiful cemetery.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with your name, January?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I laughed, rolling my eyes, \u201cmy parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really, that\u2019s fascinating. Your parents named you, did they? What a conversationalist!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, rude ass. My parents named each of us after the months of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarting with you, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and it goes all the way down to October. My mom lost her eleventh and couldn\u2019t have them anymore. So, we\u2019re stuck at ten kids.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cTen kids! My God, that is - that is a lot of kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019ve never had so much fun as you\u2019ve had with my family. They are the craziest, funniest, most amazing people in this world. The way you feel about your friends is the way I feel about my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must love them very much,\u201d he said softly, eyes trained on a few grave markers.</p><p>\u201cI do. My sister July is my best friend. She is so rockin\u2019 cool, Tom. She\u2019s got this crazy long, jet-black hair and is, like, six feet tall. She\u2019s bigger than life!\u201d I smiled at a memory of her. \u201cAll of us are pretty tall. I\u2019m the shortest actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the shortest?\u201d he asked in disbelief, his eyes roaming down then up my body and heating me up from the inside without so much as a graze of his hand.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I cleared my throat.</p><p>\u201cI imagine your family must be an imposing force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat they are, but not because of their height. We\u2019re just big and loud and lots of fun. I miss them already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be alright,\u201d he offered. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a lot of fun at this job, trust me.\u201d</p><p>I eyed him carefully, taking in his tall frame, stopping on the hand that rubbed my arm not two hours before. I have a feeling you\u2019re right, Thomas Eriksson.</p><p>\u201cSo you know how lucky I am in my heritage but what about you? Where does Eriksson come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom is Swedish and my pop is American but from German descent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that explains the light features,\u201d I said, popping another chip in my mouth and contorting my face from the vinegar.</p><p>\u201cYeah, blond hair, blue eyes. Boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t say boring,\u201d I said, my face and neck heating to an impossible color. Irritating problem!</p><p>Tom\u2019s tongued his upper teeth as he avoided a laugh and that proceeded to drive me up the bloody wall.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said, hiding my face behind my hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, pulling at one of my wrists. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, January.\u201d</p><p>Nice? Nice? What does that mean?</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, crumpling the coned newspaper that carried our chips and tossing it in the nearest bin. \u201cWe\u2019ve got quite a trek ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>El Scorcho</p><p>January</p><p>Our tiny car proved advantageous for \"Operation Disarm Tom.\" He kept glancing my way, his arm bumping mine, his shoulder grazing mine, his fingers brushing mine. Problem? Uh, it was slightly backfiring! I kept fantasizing he\u2019d veer off the road and onto the shoulder and kiss the tar out of me.</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d I said, gulping down the tension permeating throughout the car.</p><p>\u201cMmm, hmm,\u201d he said, his knuckles white.</p><p>\u201cCan we pull over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, his eyes wide. \u201cFeeling sick?\u201d</p><p>I was sick\u2014just not from motion sickness. \u201cUh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Tom pulled over and I struggled with my belt, bolting from the car. I discovered we were on top of the most gorgeous rolling hill, its green sweeping layers screamed beautiful things as the wind swooped around the feet and back to the heads of each mounded hill.</p><p>Wales.</p><p>It was one of the most breathtaking countrysides I\u2019d ever had the pleasure of witnessing. A quaint little town was nestled at the bed of the hill below and it looked like what I\u2019d envisioned a village two hundred years ago would look like, like time had stood still. The only things that gave away progress were the little cars winding the charming streets.</p><p> I was breathing hard from the proximity of Tom and the overwhelming view below me. Tom came and stood beside me, brushing a few strands that had strayed from my loose braid from my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cUm, yeah. Much better. Thank you for pulling over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, moving to see the view I\u2019d just admired. \u201cWow,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cwhy do I feel the need to abandon my life as I know it and start a new one here?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cBecause you\u2019re sane? This is an incredible place. Look at that view.\u201d I held my hands out in front of me.</p><p>\u201cExtraordinary,\u201d he said, but when I looked up to agree with him, his eyes weren\u2019t on the world around us, they were trained on me. My neck and face heated, but I didn\u2019t find myself embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing, we should, uh, get on the road,\u201d he said, walking back to the rental.</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d I sighed. \u201cWait,\u201d I said stopping him short by grabbing his arm. \u201cYou\u2019ve got something on the back of your hoodie.\u201d I dusted away imaginary nothings from his back, enjoying the unbelievably amazing muscles beneath his hoodie.</p><p>\u201cGet it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, I got it.\u201d I smiled at myself before settling in and buckling myself back in.</p><p>London was five hours away and I took the opportunity to get to know Tom a little better, asking him all his favorites. Favorite color, food, song, band. I packed as much as I possibly could in those five hours and by the end of it, I felt I knew Thomas Eriksson better than anyone possibly could in five hours with the impossible Thomas Eriksson.</p><p>Truth be told, I was surprised he\u2019d opened up at all\u2014let alone the amount he\u2019d shared. The crazy part was for every question he answered, he expected me to answer the same, like he wanted to know as much about me as I wanted to know about him.</p><p>But an hour from London, the most unfortunate thing happened...Well, unfortunate yet at the same time very fortunate. You\u2019ll see.</p><p>\u201cIs Jonah going to be there?\u201d I asked, fiddling with the stations. \u201cAt the shows tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s definitely a competition. He\u2019ll be wherever we\u2019ll be, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about the bands. Who are they? How long have they been playing? Any past affiliations? Spill,\u201d I said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, the first band\u2019s been signed before to an independent label called Red Flag.

Why\u2019d they leave Red Flag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferences in opinion. Probably in the studio. The problem I see is that they\u2019re good, but not good enough for Seven. I mean, I can see that they might have potential but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why invest when I can name ten bands off the top of my head that need no conditioning?

They\u2019re a Caged ripoff, and I hate to say it but Caged is on the down and out. Kaput.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d He nearly yelled, making me jump. I was so unused to him raising his decibel level above \"I\u2019m cool,\" that if I\u2019d been standing, I\u2019d have fallen over, like one of those ridiculous stunned goats. \u201cExactly,\u201d he repeated but softer.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, feeling bolstered by his almost-praise. \u201cWhat about the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, uh, trying to remember.\u201d He drummed his talented fingers on the steering wheel. \u201cOh, yeah, ever heard of London-based...\u201d</p><p>The car spit and sputtered and completely broke down. Tom pulled it over, removing the keys from the ignition.</p><p> I expected him to curse, lose his temper, yell, something, but he didn\u2019t. \u201cWell, that sucks,\u201d he simply said. He was as calm as I\u2019d ever seen him and that impressed me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d I asked. It was October. The sun was destined to set in another hour. In fact, the sky was a deep pink and orange, the beautiful precursor to night.</p><p>\u201cWe find a phone,\u201d he said, getting out. \u201cKnew I should have gotten a cell in Ireland. Oh well. All right,\u201d he said, peering behind us. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing behind us for miles. We march onward.\u201d</p><p>I followed Tom for a few yards, wishing to all that was holy I\u2019d just put on my thicker coat. I hadn\u2019t expected it to get so flipping cold so fast but England winters, it seemed, were much harsher than I was accustomed to, being born and bred in Texas. My fingers were freezing and my nose felt like it was on fire. I was willing to bet that wasn\u2019t a good sign.</p><p>As we walked side by side, Tom didn\u2019t say a word, too deep in thought, but he was definitely paying attention because out of nowhere, he slid off his big leather jacket and wrapped it around my torso, squeezing it around me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take your coat, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can and you will,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got this thick hoodie.\u201d</p><p>Since asking for permission was out, I decided to act first, apologize later. I huddled up next to him and wrapped my arms around his waist. I closed my eyes briefly, waiting for the rejection I was sure would come, but he only wrapped himself around me as well and we walked nestled together toward the glowing lights of a petrol station.</p><p>It was small, only two pumps, but they had a store inside and we were both excited about that because we hauled ass a few feet from the entrance. When the door slid open, warm air engulfed us.</p> <p>\u201cThank God,\u201d I said, making Tom laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnyone home?\u201d Tom called out to the empty store, pulling away from our embrace. I\u2019m not gonna lie, I felt a little devastated that our hug was over, but we had a job to do and we needed a phone.</p><p>I peeked around doors, even knocked on the restroom stalls, but no one seemed to be around.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d Tom said circling around. \u201cThere\u2019s no payphone. Besides that, I\u2019ve got no money but American.\u201d</p><p>I looked around and behind the register and noticed the phone was setting on a small area behind that. \u201cShould we just use it anyway? What time is that first show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen. I think if we can just get the rental company to come replace the car, we\u2019d be able to make it. We\u2019re only an hour outside London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I agreed. I leaned over the register and picked up the phone just as the store employee came rounding a bend we hadn\u2019t seen.</p><p>\u201cOy! What ya\u2019 doin\u2019!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d I said. \u201cWe just needed to borrow your phone. We\u2019re stranded about a mile that way.\u201d I pointed down the road but it did no good.</p><p>\u201cStay right there!\u201d He yelled to Tom as he grabbed my wrist hard.</p><p>\u201cSir! Please! You don\u2019t understand, we just needed to borrow your phone,\u201d I said.</p><p>Tom came at my side, huge and intimidating and the guy dropped my wrist. \u201cWe meant no harm,\u201d he said, but the guy had already grabbed the phone from me and dialed the police.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve two thieves at...Yes, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s it.\u201d He hung up. \u201cStay put, you two! \u201d We stood there, determined to clear up the misunderstanding. Tom crossed his arms over his chest. I could tell he was holding back. The veins in his arm pulsated and his neck strained with the tension. \u201cJust stay put!\u201d The novice detective said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Tom asked, losing patience. \u201cIf we were truly thieves, why would we be standing here? Are you purposely being obtuse?\u201d</p><p>The man said nothing, just shifted from foot to foot waiting for his \"rescuers.\"</p><p>\u201cShould we just leave?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNah, they\u2019ll just put out a search for us and we did nothing wrong, why should we run? Plus, our getaway car is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, two policemen walked through the door and braced themselves at the entrance.</p><p>\u201cHenry,\u201d one of the coppers said, but it sounded more like, \u2019Enry.</p><p>\u201cI caught these two Yanks stealin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I said, throwing my hands into the air. \u201cFor the last time, we were not stealing! When you came in, I was holding the phone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a moment, miss,\u201d Officer Two said. \u201cGo on, Henry. Tell us what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI come \u2019round \u2019ere,\u201d he said, pointing to the impossible corner he emerged from, \u201c an\u2019 this one was attemptin\u2019 the register!\u201d</p><p>Tom started to laugh. \u201cHaven\u2019t you any cameras? You can see for yourself. We were not stealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d the first cop said, \u201cwhat were ya\u2019 doin\u2019 \u2019hind there anyhow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you correctly,\u201d Tom explained. \u201cOur car stalled a mile or so down the interstate there and we were looking for a phone. We came in, looked around for someone to ask since there\u2019s no payphone and no one was here. We have to be in London by ten tonight and needed to call the rental company. That\u2019s when we saw a phone just behind the counter. Granted, it wasn\u2019t the smartest idea we\u2019d ever had, but it\u2019s the truth nonetheless. Here,\u201d he said, pulling out the rental agreement. \u201cYou can check down the road, there should be a small car parked on the shoulder. I brought the contract to answer any questions they\u2019d have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds reasonable,\u201d Officer One said. \u201cDavid, run down an\u2019 see this car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Officer Two, David, left the store and left the parking lot to spy it out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thieves,\u201d the employee said, but he was losing steam because his once defiant chin now sagged near his chest.</p><p>\u201cAre not,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAre too,\u201d he spit back.</p><p>\u201cAre not!\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cJanuary,\u201d Tom said, looking at me like I was the biggest idiot, shrugging his shoulders in question.</p><p>I shrank into myself at the immaturity of it, but I couldn\u2019t help it! The guy was getting on my last nerve!</p><p>Officer David came waltzing back in, a pair of handcuffs dangling from his hand. \u201cNone of it, chap. There\u2019s no car there.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped to my own chest this time. \u201cNot possible!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>Tom, cool as a cucumber, said, \u201cThen I\u2019d like to report a stolen vehicle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome then,\u201d Officer One said, gesturing to Officer David. \u201cYou too, miss. You\u2019re both comin\u2019 with me.\u201d</p><p>All I could do was watch Tom, desperation seeping from every pore I owned. \u201cTom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do as they ask, January. We\u2019ll get this all straightened out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God! My mother is going to kill me. She always dreamed of my first arrest but theft isn\u2019t exactly the charge she\u2019d imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being so dramatic. This is a simple misunderstanding.\u201d Tom thought for a moment. \u201cWhat kind of charge would she have preferred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Probably something like unlawful protesting or resisting arrest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can still accomplish resisting arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwfully odd for thieves, ain\u2019t they?\u201d Officer One asked David.</p><p>\u201cYanks are an unusual lot, they are,\u201d David responded.</p><p>Officer One handcuffed me and David cuffed Tom.</p><p>Agh! Our duffels! \u201cTom! All our stuff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Jason will take care of us.\u201d</p><p>They stuck us in the back of their police car and I was forced to lean a bit into Tom at the awkwardness of our positions. \u201cYou\u2019re just too big,\u201d I told him. \u201cMy God, we\u2019re both too tall for this thing.\u201d Our faces were pressed so close together, I could have counted the hairs on his head.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should\u2019ve ran,\u201d he joked, his warm breath a caress on my ear. I involuntarily shivered.</p><p>\u201cTo where?\u201d I asked, shaking off the tension of the proximity. \u201cAn invisible car?\u201d</p><p>We both started laughing at the ludicrousness of our situation. Tom looked at me just then, really looked at me for the first time without guarded eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, January,\u201d he told me.</p><p>My eyes widened and my jaw went slack. \u201cIs that a compliment from you, Eriksson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have told you that first night in Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d I asked in a whisper, not believing where this conversation was headed.</p><p>\u201cI was a dumbass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, tell me, Tom. There\u2019s something going on with you. Jason told me you used to be this carefree, funny guy. Then it was like a switch went off, he said, and you became this, and I quote, \u2018hulking beast who hates the world.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an idiot,\u201d he said, but his grin negated the statement.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not. He cares for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d he said, meeting my eyes once more. Our breaths came out in billowy clouds. \u201cWish they\u2019d turn the car on. Are you cold?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFreezing, but it\u2019s not like you can warm me up,\u201d I said, without thinking.</p><p>I caught the surprise in his eyes and my face and neck heated up to its usual unnatural red. \u201cOh, I could warm you up,\u201d he answered, shocking the hell out of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTom,\u201d I said, closing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cCome closer,\u201d he said, inching my way.</p><p>\u201cIf I was any closer, I\u2019d be on your lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no qualms with that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTom, stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of pretending I don\u2019t find you the sexiest girl I\u2019ve ever met in my entire life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour entire life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, January. You want to know why I moved to Austin?\u201d When I didn\u2019t say anything, he continued. \u201cI moved to get away from a girl I was in love with but she belonged to someone else.\u201d I gulped, my stomach twisted in knots. \u201cBut when we kissed, that burning need to have her vanished in an instant.\u201d</p><p>I took another deep breath. \u201cThen why treat me like a disease?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a coward, January. I\u2019m not sure if I can handle another heartbreak and I know if I fell for you, I\u2019d fall so hard there\u2019d be no coming back from it. You\u2019re extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>I felt my body go still and my heart beat into my throat at his confession. My breaths got deeper and my chest began to pant. \u201cTom,\u201d I whispered. \u201cSometimes the risk can be worth the reward.\u201d</p><p>We leaned into one another and closed our eyes. He languidly kissed the side of my red throat. His mouth following up, up, up until he reached my jaw and my breath hitched in my throat.</p><p>\u201cI think you may be right, MacLochlainn.\u201d He kissed down my jaw line until he came to the hollow beneath my ear. \u201cDo you know how many times I\u2019ve imagined doing this for the past six months?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I panted. \u201cProbably not as many times as I\u2019ve imagined.\u201d I needed my hands free! If they hadn\u2019t been tied so well behind my back, they would have been interlaced in his hair, clutching his mouth to mine.</p><p>He followed farther up my jaw and across my cheek. I closed my eyes in anticipation as I felt his lips at the corner of my mouth.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Ey, lovebirds! Ready for jail?\u201d Officer One teased, settling into the driver\u2019s seat. Tom and I broke eye and skin contact to glance his direction. He leaned over his seat toward us. \u201cYou really are a strange lot,\u201d he said as Officer David opened the passenger side door and sat down.</p><p>Tom took a complete one-eighty. \u201cWhat\u2019s the charge, officer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttempted burglary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see, and what were we supposedly attempting to steal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d Officer One said, looking over at Officer David. \u201cWhen we look at the tapes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! They have tapes! Thank God!\u201d I interjected, earning a silencing look from Officer David.</p> <p>\u201cWe should get you attempting to open the register.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get that at all,\u201d Tom said. \u201cAnd when you find out that we were just innocent in all this, our car stolen, etc. How quickly can we be released?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming you\u2019re right, which we\u2019re not, you\u2019d be out in, oh, say, twelve hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve hours!\u201d I said. \u201cBut we have to be in London by ten!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, London by ten, you say? For what? Probably secret drug meetin\u2019s and such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for Heaven\u2019s sake!\u201d I said. \u201cWe just had use for the phone is all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary,\u201d Tom said, shaking his head. \u201cDo we get a phone call at the station?\u201d he asked Officer One.</p><p>\u201cOne, yes.\u201d</p><p>At the station, they processed us both by taking our prints followed by a round of mug shots. I glanced at the computer and saw the pic they\u2019d taken and almost burst out laughing. I looked like a frightened rabbit. Truthfully, I was a little frightened, but not enough to deprive myself of the laugh that was my mug shot. Does anyone take a good mug shot?</p><p>Tom rang Jason and let him know everything that\u2019d went down. I stood beside him, waiting for my turn to call...someone. Jason would have been my call but Tom took care of that, so I called July.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I heard July\u2019s voice and it sounded so good to hear.</p><p>\u201cJuly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary! Oh my God! How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know, just hangin\u2019 out,\u201d I said, contorting my face at Tom. He shrugged his shoulders, physically approving of my choice of words. Nice. \u201cWell, I mean, I\u2019m in the slamma here in some little town an hour outside of London, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! Why! Oh my God, January! What is going on? Do I need to call the Embassy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuly, we\u2019re in the U.K., not Nicaragua, calm down.\u201d Tom laughed.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d July asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s Tom,\u201d I said, without making eye contact.</p><p>\u201cMay I speak with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy ever not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s unnecessary. I\u2019m calling you because I\u2019ve got a free call and you\u2019re the only person I could think of to waste it on while they prove we are innocent of all our menacing charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you charged with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, January,\u201d she said, making me smile.</p><p>Officer David gave me the sign for \"wrap it up.\" Apparently that signal is universal.</p><p>\u201cUh, I gotta go, buttercup. I love you, okay? I\u2019ll call you when I break out. Tell Mom I love her and let her know I\u2019m getting lots and lots of prison tattoos with the name \u2018Bubba,\u2019 or whatever the English equivalent to Bubba is, on my chest and arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d she said and I hung up.</p><p>I walked over to Tom and sat next to him in one of the dirty plastic chairs that lay in several lines, to accommodate the staggering number of men and women, no doubt. I\u2019m being sarcastic. There was one other gentleman in there and he was drunk as a skunk and so far off we could barely see him.</p><p>\u201cI take it your sister is well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmbassy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s a bit...dramatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say?\u201d he said, with a gentle smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cGood news!\u201d We heard behind us. We both stood and faced Officer David. \u201cYou\u2019ve been cleared of all charges. They found ya\u2019 car right where you left it. I hadn\u2019t looked far enough it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh thank God!\u201d I said, grasping at my chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat can we expect from here?\u201d Tom asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re free to go, but I\u2019d wait \u2019ere if I was you. Night\u2019s cooled things off a bit. You can use that phone to ring your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Tom said, walking back to the wall phone. He dialed Jason and I waited impatiently beside him, desperate to leave the place. My first impressions of England weren\u2019t impressing. \u201cJason?\u201d I heard. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re good, bro. Thanks.\u201d Laughing. \u201cYeah, okay, that\u2019s fine, dude. Oh, good, good. All right,\u201d he said, glancing at his watch, \u201ccool. Talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>He hung up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he say?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe rental company will deliver a new car here in the next half hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about our belongings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll transfer them into the new vehicle. Apparently they were very apologetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we wait in the lobby near the doors so we can watch for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d he said with a wink. That wink told me two things. One, he was freaking adorable and did things like wink. The only other person I knew who winked was my grandpa. Two, that he was excited about privacy with...Lil\u2019. Ol\u2019. Me.</p><p>He took my hand and guided me through the doors. The officers waved and saluted after apologizing for the misunderstanding. We exited through the heavy double doors with the tiny pocket window, letting it slam against our backs.</p><p>\u201cGod, I would never want to go to prison,\u201d I said.</p><p>For some reason, this made Tom laugh. He was doing a lot of that lately. \u201cFirst off, that was not prison. That wasn\u2019t even jail. That was a processing area. And secondly, you could never go to prison because you\u2019re too good of a person to go to prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? And how do you know that, huh? The only thing we seem to exchange is saliva.\u201d My face literally melted into my neck at that statement, but I pretended it did no such thing.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re embarrassed, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s a curse.\u201d</p><p>He stopped me short and swung me in front of him, \u201cIt\u2019s lovely.\u201d Well, if that didn\u2019t make me blush harder. Dang it. His smile got deeper and he brought his hand up to my face, guiding his hand across my cheek. I sank my face into his palm. \u201cYou\u2019re lovely, January.\u201d</p><p>His other hand swept my falling hair off my shoulder. \u201cI should probably take my braid out,\u201d I said, fingering the mess it\u2019d become. I broke away for a moment and sat on a bench near the station\u2019s glass doors. Tom sat next to me and just watched, seemingly mesmerized.</p><p>I pulled the chopstick holding my messy bun up and put it between my teeth so I could unbraid my hair. Once I\u2019d worked out all the kinks with my fingers, I let it all fall to my shoulders. \u201cThat feels so much better,\u201d I said around the chopstick as I twisted the length around my hand and held it away from my face for a moment.</p><p>Tom removed the chopstick from my teeth and stuck it within an inside pocket of his leather jacket before dragging my body closer to his and making me face him. \u201cI\u2019ll watch the doors,\u201d he said softly, his eyes roaming my head as he laced his big, warm hands through my hair. My eyes became heavy.</p><p>\u201cStop making me sleepy, Thomas Eriksson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s like I need to run my fingers through your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my favorite thing in the world,\u201d I said lazily before opening my eyes to the most handsome face I\u2019d ever seen in my entire life.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing, I just...\u201d</p><p>There was a knock on the station\u2019s glass doors and a young woman in the rental company\u2019s uniform waved. We walked over to her and met her on the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cMister Eriksson?\u201d she asked and he nodded. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about all this. We\u2019ve upgraded your vehicle for you for the inconvenience and taken care of your bill. Is there anything else we can do for you?\u201d she asked, handing over the keys.</p><p>\u201cNone, thank you,\u201d Tom answered.</p><p>\u201cJust give us a ring, love, if there is,\u201d she said with a sweet smile.</p><p>\u201cWill do. Again, thank you.\u201d</p><p>The woman ran to an awaiting car behind us and we climbed into our new rental. It was definitely an upgrade. Like, mega upgrade. It was a giant SUV, the likes of which I\u2019d yet to see in Ireland or England thus far. Land Rover. Score! Jason had done this, I\u2019d known it as soon as I saw it.</p><p>Thomas</p><p>We reached London in just under an hour. The GPS came in handy, taking us right to The Chesterfield in Mayfair. As we drove up to the hotel, or palace, depending how you looked at it, I was stumped. We both stared in fascination.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Jason put us here?\u201d I asked no one in particular. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But January answered anyway. \u201cBecause he loves us?\u201d</p><p>I looked at her in disbelief. \u201cDo you even know Jason?\u201d</p><p>She thought for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Something\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>The valet came up and opened the door for January before coming around and taking the keys from me. He informed us in a very formal accent that he\u2019d find out our room and have our bags brought up. \u201cI\u2019ll catch you when we leave, bro,\u201d I said, letting him know I\u2019d tip him all at once in the end and he nodded tightly.</p> <p>Inside, the lobby had black-and-white marble floors. Our feet echoed off the walls and pushed back and forth repeatedly, a resounding hymn of clicks. The rest of the room was dark wood and crimson accents, save for the cream plaster ceiling and columns. We approached the Concierge and he greeted us cheerfully, asking our names.</p><p>\u201cThomas Eriksson and January MacLochlainn,\u201d I told him. His brows lifted slightly at January, not enough to warrant a beat down but just enough to sting. Zap. I felt that simple burn of jealousy for about the hundredth time since being around this girl. If I had any chance of a normal relationship with her, I was going to have to check that quickly. Relationship? Where the hell did that come from?</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said, clicking away at a computer system. \u201cAh, yes, I have you both on the third floor, is this acceptable? There are some fantastic views from that room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d January said, before doing a double take. \u201cWait. Room? Don\u2019t you mean rooms?\u201d</p><p>The man became flustered and peered down at his computer once more. January and I looked at one another, confused.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. You only reserved the one room. Twin beds, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d I said under my breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said a bit louder, \u201cbut we\u2019re going to need two rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize, sir, but there is only the one vacancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d January said. \u201cIt has twin beds, you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, madam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d January offered, touching me lightly on the arm.</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, let\u2019s just get out there and listen to some music, Tom. I\u2019m kind of dying to do our job right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, wishing I could kiss her in that moment. She made my heart feel lighter than it had in over a year. \u201cFine,\u201d I told the man as he started to ready our keys. I turned back to January. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she said, squeezing my forearm through my hoodie.</p><p>The concierge finalized everything, handing us our keys and letting us know our bags would be up shortly. He pointed us to the elevator and we got in, but when the doors closed and I pressed the button for the third floor, it felt like someone else took over my body.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t have stopped myself if I\u2019d tried, I grabbed January briskly and pushed her against the side of the elevator, cupping the back of her head so I wouldn\u2019t hurt her. She looked surprised but not at all unwilling, her mouth gaped slightly and held a small grin at the corners. I eyed her fiercely before physically turning her head and moving to her beautiful neck. I breathed her beguiling scent deep within my chest. I righted her face and drank her in before closing my eyes and pressing my lips gently to hers. It was everything in me to keep it soft, my body had other ideas, rougher ideas, and wanted so badly to kiss her harshly to release all the pent up feeling I\u2019d been harboring for the fascinating female since that night in Austin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m into you,\u201d I told her as I broke free.</p><p>\u201cAre you,\u201d she whispered as a statement rather than a question.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie,\u201d I amended.</p><p>Her breaths puffed gently as her eyes wandered my face. \u201cA lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, running my fingers along her neck and throat, resting my palm over her heart, feeling it race for me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m obsessed with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOb-obsessed,\u201d she said, tripping on the word.</p><p>\u201cAm I scaring you?\u201d I asked, removing my hand from her chest and bringing it back to her throat.</p><p>The elevator door dinged, alerting us to our floor and we both stepped out without another word spoken. I opened the door with the electronic key and let her in first. When the door closed, I held fast to her arm and whipped her back to me, pinning her once again against the door. The only light in the room was a soft lamp in the corner.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not scaring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about you,\u201d I acknowledged to her as well as myself. My stare raked her body from her feet to the top of her head. \u201cWant to hear something damaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dream about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all the time. Every night. Every single night, January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be...prudent for me to say,\u201d I admitted, not believing I admitted to it.</p><p>She giggled timidly and I could feel her face and neck pitch to a feverish degree. \u201cStop,\u201d I spoke into her hair.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d she whimpered, sending me in every different direction possible.</p><p>\u201cThen be prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor this,\u201d I said, pressing my body severely into hers.</p><p>She groaned and I almost let go of all self-control at that captivating sound. Her long legs climbed up mine and I very nearly tossed her to one of the impossibly small twin beds. Her fingers combed through my hair and pulled slightly at the ends, bringing the kiss deeper.</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d she breathed into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d I asked, moving to her jaw and throat.</p><p>\u201cThe door, Tom.\u201d She said at the knocking behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, pulling away, supremely pissed that we had luggage that even needed bringing to us.</p><p>I let her incredible body slide down mine until her feet hit the floor. I made sure she held up before flipping on the light, running my hands through my hair and taking a deep breath. I opened the door and a bellhop brought our duffels in, laying them against the wall near the television.</p><p>I gave him a few pounds, thanked him and he left.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d she said, the backs of her hands at her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI know, I shouldn\u2019t have let it get that far. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that too,\u201d she said, her face bright red. My lids became hooded and she brought her hand to her throat. \u201cSorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI meant \u2018Whoa, this room.\u2019 It\u2019s like the British Navy threw up in here!\u201d</p><p>I looked around and finally saw what she did. \u201cCripes! You\u2019re right. I\u2019m blind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGah! All bright blue and gold! What were they thinking?\u201d She laughed and I couldn\u2019t help but join her.</p><p>\u201cIt is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>I glimpsed at the nightstand and read the time. \u201cCrap!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nine-fifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d I said, \u201cdon\u2019t forget this, okay? I need you to remember that kiss. I want you to know that I do still very much want you.\u201d</p><p> Her face bloomed in answer.</p><p>\u201cJust give me a moment,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready in fifteen. You can get ready in here, if you want?\u201d I nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll, uh, knock on the inside of the bathroom door when I\u2019m ready to make sure you\u2019re dressed.\u201d</p><p>I heard water running for a moment and sounds of cloth hitting the sink and floor, including her shoes. I placed my hand on the door and closed my eyes, praying that God gave me the patience to sleep in the same room with that magnificent creature.</p><p>I was going to kill Jason.</p><p>I unpacked everything in the duffel in the set of drawers nearest the bed at the window. I knew we were only going to be there a day, but if you\u2019ve ever had to live out of a duffel, you know it\u2019s harder than living out of a suitcase. If you don\u2019t keep everything organized and folded, it can take you hours to make it right again.</p><p> I threw on a pair of jeans and thermal under yet another black t-shirt before shrugging on my hoodie. I stood in front of a mirror and ran my hands through my hair. Done. I walked to the closet near the bathroom and removed the provided laundry bag, throwing all my stuff from that day and the day before inside.</p><p>I knocked on the bathroom door. A tiny shriek came from inside, making me laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not decent!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh well, then it\u2019s okay for me to come in then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Not decent! Not decent!\u201d I was quiet for a minute. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer, just laughed. \u201cJanuary, here\u2019s the laundry bag for all your stuff. I\u2019ll set it right outside the door. We\u2019ll want to have our things laundered tomorrow since we\u2019ll be out of here tomorrow evening.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>At Least I'm Not as Sad</p><p>Thomas</p><p>January emerged fifteen minutes later, looking for all the world like sex on heels and I tried desperately to pretend she didn\u2019t. We both moved in front of the sink and brushed our teeth together, trying not to laugh in the mirror and get toothpaste down our fronts, but that didn\u2019t really work out too well for me.</p><p>A fresh t-shirt later, and we were out the door. January, a walking, ticking time bomb and I, the detonator. It was only a matter of time before one of two things happened. Either some idiot was going to push me over the line, or she was. I imagined both wouldn\u2019t exactly be ideal. Though, I did have a preference.</p><p>\u201cYou know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d I told her as we settled into the scene of the only crime we\u2019d actually committed that night. Yeah, I did that.</p><p>\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d She feigned surprise, her hand flew to her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou know what you look like. You\u2019d have to be an idiot not to and you, January MacLochlainn, are not an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She teased, one brow raised. \u201cDo you plan those little ditties out before hand, or was that off the cuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize, was that not clever enough for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was beneath you, Eriksson, beneath you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know something else I\u2019d like beneath me,\u201d I joked.</p><p>She laughed loudly, her laugh the equivalent of a ringing bell, before checking herself. \u201cSee? You just killed it. It\u2019s literally dead, floating upside down and bloated. It\u2019s that dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a visual. You\u2019re the queen of defusing sexual tension.\u201d</p><p>She made a tiny bow, raising the hem of her skirt a little and sending me very near that edge I warned you about. \u201cThank you. Thank you,\u201d she said, righting herself. \u201cDon\u2019t try this at home, folks. I\u2019m a professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThomas Eriksson! You\u2019ve cut me to the core! I don\u2019t believe I can go on,\u201d she said with an exaggerated Southern accent. She leaned her body against mine and went limp. I gladly held her up and against me. \u201cTell Mama I love her. Tell July I bequeath to her my collection of shells from around the world, and the snow globes can go to August.\u201d She died in my arms and then peeked up at me with one eye open as the doors slid wide to a packed lobby. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A woman gasped at our position but caught herself before making too much of a scene. Can\u2019t express too loudly her distaste in us or she would be too closely associated. The remainder of her party looked equally repulsed and that was just comical to me. They were disgusted for just one reason and it had nothing to do with who we were but what we weren\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look now, MacLochlainn, but I believe we may be shocking these folks with our radical clothing and complete lack of personal space.\u201d And obvious lack of money.</p><p>She peered their direction and stood up, smoothing down her skirt and raising her chin to the level of \"I don\u2019t care what you think of me,\" but it did nothing to convince me because her neck was painted a bright red. I hated that she felt embarrassed by being silly, funny, herself. Hated that. Who did they think they were? She was probably infinitely more intelligent than these lemmings as well as talented as hell. She had absolutely nothing to be humiliated about. She was amazing.</p><p>I grabbed her hand and we strode confidently through the lobby and out the doors.</p> <p>\u201cJanuary, can I be candid with you?</p><p>\u201cHmm? Of course,\u201d she said, distracted.</p><p>\u201cI find you to be...extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d she said, a genuine smile touching the corner of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHell yes, I do. One of the most.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Tom. That\u2019s very kind of you to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not kind, it\u2019s the truth. Come on,\u201d I said, wrapping her underneath my arm as we headed for the Tube toward London\u2019s Soho district.</p><p>We were headed for Ronnie Scott\u2019s. That\u2019s where The Mark were scheduled to play first at ten. Seven didn\u2019t dictate who we watched or even when or where, but if they made a suggestion, I was going to accommodate, especially if Jonah could be there. Which reminded me.</p><p>\u201cIf Jonah\u2019s there, we have to play it cool with this,\u201d I said, lifting her hand in mine.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, a bit hurt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want to shout about it and shit. It\u2019s because if Jonah found out, word would get out and you could jeopardize solidifying a position as a scout, January. I would feel awful if that happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d She said, still sounding disappointed.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, pulling her short. I placed my hands on either side of her neck to drive the point home. \u201cI swear, January, I\u2019m so into you it\u2019s not even funny. I just can\u2019t compromise you like that. You\u2019re obviously going to earn scout by your own merit, but if anyone at Seven thinks it\u2019s because we\u2019ve gotten together, no one will take you seriously. I just can\u2019t have that. You\u2019re too good for that.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes crinkled in a smile. \u201cAnd what is \u2018this\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said we had to play it cool with \u2018this.\u2019 What is \u2018this,\u2019 Tom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the beginning, January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d she asked me seriously.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have all the time in the world to talk about that. It\u2019s too deep to get into it right now but know this, I\u2019m tired of pretending. So weary of it. I forgot myself when I lost who I thought Kelly was to me, but you\u2019ve shown me what I think, no, I know no one else could have shown me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I don\u2019t want to be lost anymore. I - I want you.\u201d</p><p>She kissed me then and my tongue found hers. She smacked of innocence and saccharinelike want. Two of the most appetizing flavors I\u2019d ever tasted and knew I\u2019d never get enough of. January was who I wanted and I\u2019d realized in that moment that she eclipsed Kelly with the power of a thousand suns. Thank God for unanswered prayers.</p><p>I dragged her with me through Ronnie Scott\u2019s door and squeezed her hand before letting go. We both searched the crowd for Jonah but didn\u2019t see him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s not?\u201d A deep timbre asked her. I fought with myself not to tuck January into my side.</p><p>\u201cJonah,\u201d I said, turning around and offering my hand.</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d he said, shaking the hand I\u2019d offered. \u201cJanuary!\u201d He exclaimed dropping my hand like it was diseased and picking January up, swinging her around. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long, sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonah,\u201d January acknowledged with a wry smile, pushing herself off his chest. \u201cStop showing off. I just saw you in New York last week.\u201d</p><p>Jonah set her down and I resisted the urge to punch him in the face. He can\u2019t cross a boundary he doesn\u2019t know exists. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Eight days is too long when it comes to your face,\u201d he laid on thickly, grabbing her jaw with one hand and rubbing his thumb across her cheek. January rolled her eyes but laughed.</p><p>\u201cShall we lay it all out?\u201d Jonah asked us both.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d I said, folding my arms across my chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna win,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>I laughed quietly and shook my head. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he said, slapping me on the back as if it was all in good fun.</p><p>He kissed January\u2019s cheek and lifted two fingers above his head as he walked away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really starting to hate that guy,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cI like Jonah. I really do, but he can do some douchey things. I\u2019m just warning you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, turning to face her.</p><p>\u201cSeriously. I heard he was doing some sketchy things when it came to bands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, like what?\u201d</p><p>She raised her hands in the air as if in surrender. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t want to start shit, but I heard he was paying an insider at Seven under the table to find out where you would be scouting. Again!\u201d She said, grabbing my shoulder. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to start anything. I just think we should be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shoot the messenger, dude! Plus, I thought it would\u2019ve been obvious to you since he\u2019s at almost every show you\u2019re at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, I knew that was too much a coincidence. I gave him the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor someone being so cynical in love, you sure are naive about life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it, MacLochlainn.\u201d</p><p>January laughed. \u201cZipping it.\u201d</p><p>While the first band set up, January and I took a seat at the bar together. People milled in and around us but we ignored them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll you have?\u201d the bartender asked us.</p><p>\u201cStrawberry mojito,\u201d January said without any prompt from me.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you have on tap,\u201d I said.</p><p>The bartender nodded and left to make our drinks.</p><p>\u201cStrawberry mojito?\u201d I asked, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Eriksson. All the girls at work rant and rave about strawberry mojitos and I found myself in a situation where I can try one. I\u2019m a newbie. Cut me some slack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. I hope you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, bowing her head.</p><p>We both turned around in our stools to face the crowd and the stage. I placed my hand on her knee absently to lean into her ear.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d January teased before I could speak. \u201cIf Jonah sees this he could read into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said, lifting my hand but kept my mouth at her ear. \u201cCan you see him?\u201d I asked her, changing direction.</p><p>She turned her head to the left slightly then the right. \u201cNo, he\u2019s chatting up some broad with huge boobs. Totally immersed. In conversation, not her boobs,\u201d she said, clarifying.</p><p>I laughed in her ear, sending goose bumps up her neck. \u201cI forgot what I was going to say now. You can\u2019t be funny when I\u2019m trying to be sexy with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d she asked me, her throat vibrating as she laughed. \u201cFunny is sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, everyone knows that, but I\u2019m the one who\u2019s trying to be sexy. You can\u2019t over-sexy me. You\u2019re outdoing my attempt at sexy. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d she teased, leaning into me, but keeping an eye on Jonah. \u201cTry, try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary.\u201d I repeated her name because nothing had ever felt better to say, especially in that moment.</p><p>I trailed my lips down the back of her neck, inciting a shiver. I placed one slow, soft kiss on the spot where my lips lingered and sat back up. January\u2019s eyes closed briefly and she pitched forward slightly sending a strange sensation of approval up my spine at the way I affected her. I fixed my posture and looked toward the stage area as the band was readying to play.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re on,\u201d I told her, glancing Jonah\u2019s direction. His eyes searched the crowd before stopping at us. He lazily saluted me in acknowledgment before focusing back on the band.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, ya\u2019 bastard. You smile now,\u201d I told him under my breath.</p><p>Ronnie Scott\u2019s was a fairly intimate venue, suited best for acoustic sets. What I hoped was that the band we were about to see was better plugged in than out and that Jonah wouldn\u2019t be able to see this.</p><p>\u201cWatch for it,\u201d I told January.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen The Mark starts to play, listen to their acoustic set and let me know if you can imagine their set in full instruments. It will always be different. Our job is to decipher whether this band can handle full-fledged or if they\u2019re strictly acoustic. Occasionally, I\u2019ll have to ask to see them again. It\u2019s why I avoid acoustic sets like the plague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. Okay, I\u2019ll try that. Why do you avoid acoustic sets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause live gigs with ten thousand people don\u2019t sound that great when your instrument can\u2019t reach them.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have an advantage because we\u2019re already familiar with them. Ten to one, so is Jonah.\u201d</p><p>From the first strum, I\u2019d had The Mark, well, marked and by the look on January\u2019s face, so did she.</p><p>\u201cCaged,\u201d she said, repeating her first diagnosis.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d I agreed. \u201cShall we? There are a few bands playing at The Garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>We waved at Jonah on our way out. He politely waved back but the look of bewilderment was enough to send us both over the edge when we reached the path outside.</p><p>\u201cHe looked so confused,\u201d January said into her hand.</p><p>\u201cLike a lost puppy, that Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should really do his own research,\u201d she offered by way of explanation.</p><p>\u201cNo, when he did that, he picked wrong. That\u2019s why he cheats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s The Garage?\u201d she hedged.</p><p>\u201cA good twenty minutes that direction by way of the Tube.\u201d I pointed northeast. \u201cBut it\u2019s worth it. Lots of good bands playing tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI arranged it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI phoned the manager of the place, told him who I was, well, I may have fabricated my exact position with Seven, but it was all for prosperity mind you, and I got him to book four bands I\u2019ve been dying to hear from the area.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re pulling my leg!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m definitely not.\u201d My hands would tremble anywhere near her legs.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing!

You see, Jonah needed to know we were here and that we were only attending The Mark\u2019s performance to appease the label and that we had better things hidden up our sleeves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s three reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I lumped the last two in as one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. Well, lead the way, my diabolical master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d I told her. \u201cNext week\u2019s lesson? How to execute a fiendish cackle while drumming the fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I need any supplies for the lesson?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, just be sure to rest your voice the night before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>The Garage was packed beyond belief and I wondered if Jonah was going to show up after all, seeming as it must have been advertised well or perhaps it was word of mouth. I was hoping the latter.</p><p>Performances:</p><p>Georgia Asher - Unique in her songs and performance. Highly entertaining.</p><p>Influences: Janelle Monae, Fun.</p> <p>My take: Great musician, contract immediately.</p><p> January\u2019s take: \u201cAwesome musician, contract immediately.\u201d</p><p>One Lump Or Two - No Doubt rip off. Great live performance.</p><p>My take: No way.</p><p>January\u2019s take: \u201cSorry, two thumbs down.\u201d</p><p>Compass - Strange instrumentals. Live performance lacking.</p><p>My take: Could be good if they added a few more traditional pieces.</p><p>January\u2019s take: \u201cNo way, Jose.\u201d</p> <p>Let Them Eat Cake - Female vocalist. An actual decent female vocalist. Possibility of going commercial.</p><p>My take: Yeah, they could clean up their sound and go commercial, but they\u2019re so damn good why bother? Suppose we should let them decide.</p><p>January\u2019s take. \u201cTom, if you have Jason offer it to them, let them know they probably won\u2019t sound the same. Plus, there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll be accepted commercially still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they went commercial, January, they would be accepted and well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a little of what I\u2019m talking about. They\u2019d be a massive hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to poison the one thing that gives them their edge, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure. I think it can transcend. Only time will tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Call Jason. Ruin them,\u201d she joked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cDo you even remember who signs your paychecks?\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cShit. I forgot that for a second. Yes, call Jason but let him know that he needs to replace their keyboardist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s terrible,\u201d she said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cEgad. I couldn\u2019t tell from their set. Well, I suppose that instrument is your forte. You would know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThomas Eriksson is conceding a point? Just a moment.\u201d She picked up an imaginary cell. \u201cYes. Oh, it has? Well then, I see.\u201d She hung up. \u201cIt\u2019s official, hell\u2019s frozen over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m a reasonable person,\u201d I told her as we headed toward the Tube.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, extremely reasonable. You forget you treated me like crap the first time we met,\u201d she admitted, the teasing leaving her tone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, January. I apologized for that already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she smirked disbelievingly with a twist at her lips.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said softly, turning her toward me. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand what was going on with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew what happened. I\u2019m just saying I find it utter bull that you used that as an excuse to shit on everyone around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary, I don\u2019t think you understand what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to the hotel first. It\u2019s cold and late and I want you safe.\u201d</p><p>We traveled in silence, all the way to our hotel, I still wrapped my arm around her shoulder and she didn\u2019t shrug it off which made me think she just wanted to work through what was going on. I understood it. I was a confusing bastard. One minute, I was a complete asshole, the next I was practically confessing an undying infatuation. Emotional whiplash.</p><p>The ride up the elevator stirred the heat I\u2019d let go dormant. The memory of how her soft flesh felt pressed to mine sent waves of pleasure up my spine. I glanced her direction and her eyes were as dark as mine with the same recollection.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, January. This is hard enough without you looking like a bowl of ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a spoon, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. Seriously, I\u2019m not joking. I need to get this off my chest. I need parameters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParameters? Attraction doesn\u2019t have parameters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, attraction doesn\u2019t but potential does.\u201d</p><p>That shut her right up and I nearly laughed at her wide-eyed expression. I let us into the room and we kind of roamed around, pretending to do things, avoiding the inevitable conversation. Finally, I sat on the side of one of the beds and slid to the carpet below. She followed suit and sat opposite me on the floor, our legs touching. I fiddled with the zipper of my hoodie, afraid to look her way. Jeez, dude, grow a pair and talk to her.</p><p>\u201cJanuary,\u201d I began, looking directly in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never regretted anything so much as the way I treated you the night we first kissed.\u201d She was smiling at first but sucked in a breath at my proclamation. \u201cI was, is, really, in a strange place. My chest ached perpetually and I unfairly and immaturely took that out on everyone I met, especially you.</p><p>\u201cWhen we met, I was six months into a self-inflicted prison sentence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked timidly.</p><p>I breathed deeply, leaning my head on the side of the bed. \u201cThere was a girl. Kelly. She\u2019d been a part of our group for years and years. We were best friends but I never looked at her that way. I mean, sure, she was hot as hell, but Kelly wasn\u2019t someone I wanted to touch. She was Kelly. Get me?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>She nodded gingerly.</p><p>\u201cI was in a band and that meant all that it implies. I dated hundreds of girls. Kissed thousands. Did...other things.\u201d I ran my hands over my face at the confession. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of who I was. I was young and stupid.\u201d I peered her direction, her face held only anticipation. \u201cNot exactly the best excuse, I know, but I thought I was doing everything right, getting tested regularly, being careful, blah, blah, blah, but a year and a half ago, I couldn\u2019t pretend anymore that it was at all fulfilling.\u201d I ran my hand through my hair, tucking the strands behind my ears. \u201cI was disgusted with myself, to be honest. I\u2019d seen everything that world could offer and I was only twenty-two. Suddenly, it was like a switch flipped and I saw Kelly for the real woman she was and my God was I ever in love with her.\u201d</p><p>January\u2019s chest panted, her face flushed and her eyes glassed, making me feel terrible. I didn\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable, but she needed to know why I was the way I\u2019d become...I wasn\u2019t finished.</p><p>\u201cWait, January,\u201d I told her, grabbing her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d she choked.</p><p>\u201cBut I was too late. She met and became engaged to someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d January said, confusing me. I squeezed her hand to let me finish.</p><p>\u201cAnd I hated every fiber of his being. He was wealthy, connected, educated, and, unfortunately, sincerely in love with her in return. It ate at me. At first, I\u2019d indulged in women but that proved useless. My ache only got deeper. I was thoroughly ashamed of myself because I\u2019d begun to subtly infiltrate their relationship, demanding she see films and go to restaurants with me. I figured, hell, she wasn\u2019t married yet, she was fair game, but even I knew how wrong that was. It was all under the pretense of friendship. I was being dishonest with her.</p><p>\u201cWhen her fianc\u00e9 called our little meetings off for us, that\u2019s when I fled to Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s where you met me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see now,\u201d she said sadly.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t, January. You really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to forget Kelly, wanted her out of my mind and chest and I wanted no one to ever be able to get within five feet of me for reasons I think obvious. Dude, I thought I could never hurt so badly as I did when I realized that I could never have Kelly...but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d she asked, unknowingly inching forward.</p><p>I spoke quietly, almost too quietly, afraid to admit it out loud. I closed my eyes tightly. \u201cBut that hurt was nothing in comparison to how badly I\u2019d begun to feel when a stranger kissed me in a dusty lot just six months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, I\u2019m so sorry, Tom,\u201d she exclaimed, her back falling against the side of her bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done what I did,\u201d she said, her eyes glassing over.</p><p>\u201cYes, you should have, January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d She dropped her eyes to her lap and I could actually feel the sadness radiate from her.</p><p>I sat up on my knees and brought her up with me, bringing her face inches from mine. \u201cDon\u2019t ever say that, January. You revived me. You saved me. You did what I\u2019m convinced no other person could have done and believe me they\u2019d tried. As badly as I hurt for Kelly, it was nothing, nothing in comparison to how I felt when I didn\u2019t do right by that total stranger. January, you eclipse Kelly! I\u2019m ashamed to say it, but this friend I was convinced I loved is nothing compared to you. I feel like a fool. I could have sworn when I lost Kelly that I lost my soul mate but I was so wrong. So, so wrong.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She needed convincing? Fine.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you from Adam, but God how I dreamt of you night after night after night. You were this ghost I carried along with me everywhere I went, overshadowing the hate I carried for what Kelly didn\u2019t even really do to me. If Jason hadn\u2019t called me to New York, I know I would have come searching you out. I was obsessed with you and I barely knew you.\u201d I searched her face. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that scare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said calmly.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d I asked, bewildered. \u201cThis infatuation I have for you is borderline psychotic, even I recognize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she said, swallowing. \u201cBecause I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t feel it too. I feel desperate when it comes to you. Desperate and a little bit insane. All I can think about around you is what you taste like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me things like that,\u201d I begged her. I squeezed my eyes closed and rested my forehead against hers, fighting control with every grit of my teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s only the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know enough.\u201d</p><p>With each word she\u2019d spoken, the growing, bubbling tension spilled between us. Her eyes grew wide when she realized what was about to happen, how I was about to take out everything I\u2019d ever kept inside for the past year on her small, beautiful face but she didn\u2019t break away. No, she crept even closer so I slammed my mouth to hers, breathing her in so deeply, I swear I could feel her heartbeat on my tongue. My hands held her jaw and as softly as I could manage, I guided her to her feet, never breaking our kiss. I trailed my fingers down her neck, to her backside and lifted her. She wrapped her incredibly long legs around my waist and I fell to the bed behind me.</p><p>We sat there, trading sighs, trading wants, trading intentions. It seemed so incredibly inevitable to me then, how our lives were going to be forever entwined. I knew this was the last person I\u2019d ever kiss, could feel it in my bones, and it was with January MacLochlainn, the most amazing girl I\u2019d ever laid eyes on.</p><p>Was I in love with January MacLochlainn? No, I couldn\u2019t say I was...but I was going to be. Make no mistake about that.</p> <p>January</p><p>Thomas Eriksson was the last first kiss I was ever going to have. I don\u2019t know how I knew it but I could feel it in my bones. A delicious symphony resounded through my head, swum down my body and back through, over and over. The soundtrack to what our life was to become played beautifully around us and I wasn\u2019t afraid. And I could tell, neither was he.</p><p>We fit so incredibly well together, it was borderline painful.</p><p>Our make out session wound down to a comfortably slow back and forth, our lips achingly raw but neither of us feeling the pain. His light stubble scratched at my chin and I reveled in that feeling. I was kissing a man. The idea made me stupidly giddy inside as if I had any real idea what that really meant. All I knew was I had moved on from a \"never\" mentality to a very solid \"please, please, please\" one. I held on to his hoodie tightly between both hands, too frightened to unclench them and draw down his zipper, all his zippers. Do it, January, I ordered myself.</p><p>But Tom drew away from me slowly, peppering my neck with soft kisses that made me melt from the inside out. My heart and guts were a soft, liquefied mess and I loved the sensation.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he whispered hoarsely. The deeper octave sending shivers up my spine.</p><p>\u201cSo what,\u201d I offered, drawing his lips back to mine.</p><p>\u201cNot \u2018so what,\u2019\u201d he said, chuckling against my mouth, making me laugh along with him. \u201cCome on, love. Let\u2019s sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep?\u201d I asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYes, I must save you from me. Another minute and you\u2019d be in peril, Miss MacLochlainn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like a bit of danger, though,\u201d I said sleepily, as he brought me to his chest.</p> <p>I felt it shake beneath me. \u201cI imagine you\u2019d be quite the daredevil, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a beautiful cape I could wear,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he snickered. \u201cSleep, January,\u201d he said, a final kiss at my temple.</p><p>And I did, but somewhere in the back of my mind, I could have sworn he\u2019d whispered, \"You\u2019re too beautiful to sully,\"</p><p>I woke to Thomas talking on the phone, to Jason it sounded like. \u201cGeorgia Asher, yeah, definitely want her immediately. She\u2019s versatile enough that she\u2019d be welcomed internationally with absolutely no problem. What? Oh, uh, Let Them Eat Cake, but they\u2019re not as commercial as Seven usually likes. You might have to finesse them a bit.\u201d Pregnant pause. \u201cNo, I told you, forget about The Mark, Jonah is wrong. Okay, but don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn ya\u2019. Yeah, I\u2019ll tell her. Bye.\u201d</p><p>I felt his cell phone drop on the bed as soft swishes of cloth slid into the bottom of his duffel. I turned over and stretched out, my legs practically shot two feet off the end of my bed.</p><p>\u201cHow did we both sleep on this tiny nothing,\u201d I said out loud, my voice hoarse from disuse.</p><p>\u201cWell, that leg was wrapped around mine,\u201d he said, pointing to each part as he continued his explanation, \u201cthat stomach was pressed to mine, that beautiful face was buried in my neck. It was the best and worst night\u2019s sleep of my life.\u201d I smiled. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he said, smiling back.</p> <p>\u201cMorning, Tom. How much time do we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna shower then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll go check out downstairs while you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I told him, kissing his cheek as I trudged toward the shower.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Take A Picture</p><p>January</p><p>We were on the road and headed toward the Channel Tunnel an hour later. I made sure I had all my meds with me but Tom assured me the ride was exponentially smoother than a water voyage and it would take us straight to Paris in only two and a half hours. I knew Europe was small but it was flabbergasting to think I could go from London to Paris in the time it takes to watch a film. Okay, the film would be Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, but still, that\u2019s pretty amazing.</p><p>We dropped the car off at the rental place and cabbed it over to the Chunnel station. The entire process from leaving the hotel to boarding the train took less than an hour. I was impressed, thoroughly. Impressed because everything we did in Texas seemingly took a day\u2019s commitment. One, because everything is twenty miles away regardless of where you\u2019re going but also, to be honest, we just move slower than the rest of the world. It\u2019s why we\u2019re incorrectly pegged as slower thinkers. We aren\u2019t. In fact, we\u2019re sharper than most people; we just take our time, fewer mistakes that way. I think I sort of preferred it that way, but a little change of pace was always nice. Always.</p><p>We boarded the Eurostar and easily found our seats.</p><p>\u201cComfortable?\u201d Tom asked.</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d I said, laying my head on his shoulder and whipping out a bag of Twizzlers I brought from home. \u201cWant one?</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d He reached into the bag and pulled out a vine. That\u2019s when I noticed it.</p><p>\u201cYour jacket\u2019s unzipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it is,\u201d he said, glancing down at himself, not realizing the significance.</p><p>His t-shirt was plain as day. He slumped a bit in his seat making it stretch tightly over his stomach. He\u2019d chosen a charcoal grey tee and it was light enough for me to count each individual muscle in his abdomen. My own stomach clenched in the need to outline each one.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d I blurted, unaware I\u2019d said it out loud.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked absently, chewing his Twizzler.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I gulped, \u201cnothing. I, uh, just-nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he sung, narrowing his brows in suspicion.</p><p>\u201cWant to listen to my iPod with me?\u201d I asked. It was very important that I changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cFor business or pleasure?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPurely pleasure,\u201d I said, my face and neck warming to a deep crimson. I could feel it burn up my neck slowly. I leaned into my bag in front of me to retrieve my iPod, letting my hair fall.</p><p>\u201cYour hair has a bit of split, January. I can see your skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d I said, blushing deeper, fighting a grin and sitting up.</p><p>He leaned into the side of my face and tucked my hair behind my ear. \u201cNot to mention the heat I can feel just emanating off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I panted, turning toward him.</p><p>\u201cI can feel it when you blush. It settles here,\u201d he said, bringing my hand to his chest. \u201cAnd here.\u201d He brought my hand down the abdomen I wanted to line with my fingers.</p><p>I yanked my hand back as if it was on fire, making him laugh loudly.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d a little old English lady told him over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, but the decibel of his laughter did nothing but rise. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said again as the lady stared harder. He choked and coughed into his hand to control himself. \u201cSorry, ma\u2019am.\u201d She turned around. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get me in trouble, January,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cMe? You can\u2019t do things like that, Tom. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? That blush of yours drives me up the wall. If I can\u2019t see it at least once morning, noon, and night, I don\u2019t feel complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d I said, blushing yet again. \u201cStupid blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it never lies,\u201d he said more seriously. \u201cI love your blood, it paints the most beautiful things on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d I told him, rubbing at my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does,\u201d he said, grabbing my face. His thumbs grazed over my jaw, back and forth, back and forth. He mesmerized me. \u201cIt tells me just how much I affect you and, in turn, you enchant me. You\u2019re breathtaking, January.\u201d</p><p>He drew his fingers through my hair roughly and cupped my face in his palms, but he didn\u2019t lean in for a kiss like I expected him to. Instead, he brought those hands across my face and down my neck to my shoulders then back up.</p><p>\u201cAnd what a beautiful canvas to paint.\u201d</p><p>The conductor came over the speaker and spoke in French before relaying the same message in heavily accented English.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what he just said,\u201d Tom said, shrugging his shoulders</p><p>\u201cHe welcomed us aboard and mentioned that it\u2019s thirteen twenty-three now and that we should be arriving at Gare Du Norde at approximately sixteen forty-seven in the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? How in the world did you understand that?\u201d Tom asked, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cI speak French,\u201d I told the window, staring at the deck as we departed the station.</p><p>\u201cYou speak French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t tell you that?\u201d I turned to him, confused at myself.</p><p>\u201cNo, you failed to mention that you\u2019re bilingual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not bilingual,\u201d I told him, a smirk tugging at my lips.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m multilingual. I speak four languages.\u201d</p><p>Tom stared at me as if he didn\u2019t believe me. He couldn\u2019t look away; he stared hard into my eyes begging for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. Kids are sponges,\u201d I offered. He still didn\u2019t understand. \u201cI wanted to work for the U.N. as a translator when I was little, so during the summers I learned different languages. It was worth it because it comes in handy though I\u2019d never work for the U.N. now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeh, not so much, I learned some crazy things about the United Nations and decided they weren\u2019t exactly the...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t calling the U.N. amazing, January. I was calling you amazing. You\u2019re amazing. Incredible, actually. Every time you make me forget that you\u2019re extraordinary with your down-to-earth ways, something else blindsides me and reminds me just how out of my league you really are.\u201d</p><p>I sat up a bit and scooted closer into his side. I could not believe what he\u2019d just said. I grabbed his arm and leaned into his body. I needed him to feel what he needed to hear. \u201cYou\u2019re out of my league? You\u2019ve got to be joking, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no, I\u2019m not joking. You are way out of my league, January.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is going to be a problem, I can tell,\u201d I teased him.</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because you keep forgetting what an incredible musician you are and how talented you are at your job. How everyone in this business calls Seven, desperate to contact you so they can steal you away. You\u2019re a rock star, yet you\u2019re oblivious to it because you\u2019re always on the road. It\u2019s stupid, but it is what it is. Trust me, Thomas Eriksson, I play in the minors and you\u2019re the hypothetical starting pitcher for a team who won the World Series five years consecutive. You\u2019re so big league it makes my head spin.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at me. \u201cThat\u2019s utter bullshit but I love you for saying it.\u201d</p> <p>I opened my mouth to argue with him but he stopped me by pressing his lips to mine and I forgot my own name let alone whatever argument I had.</p><p>The English countryside held enough charms to distract us from conversation. We fell into a comfortable silence save for our shared earbuds. We listened to the entire Aim and Ignite album. The only contact we made was physical. Tom lined my palms with his index finger over and over, making me sleepier than my medicine was.</p><p> When we entered France, he nudged me in the ribs. \u201cAll the graffiti\u2019s in French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine that,\u201d I teased him.</p><p>It got quiet again as we examined the new countryside.</p> <p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d I told him, breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d He smiled, and the sun gleamed brightly over his white smile.</p><p>\u201cThe one you grew up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my parents have lived in New York City for most of their lives. They met in a Greenwich Village shop where they\u2019d go to get coffee every morning before work. They married six months later but couldn\u2019t conceive right away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s sad. Were they trying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they said they just went with it though and were surprised with the news they were pregnant with my sister Christina five years into their marriage. They didn\u2019t think it was possible. Then I came along three months after Christina was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. You were a surprise, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d he told me, grinning.</p><p>He took his soda from the chair back in front of him, uncapped it and took a swig. The movement of his throat swallowing made me want to instantly become something edible and sweet so I could slide down his body in an ultimate connection. My fingers tightened on the arms of my chair and I shivered the thought away as I watched him place it back.</p><p> \u201cAnyway,\u201d he continued, bringing me back to the present, \u201cI have one more sister named Chloe. She\u2019s your age and at the Art Institute of Dallas actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Christina up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in PR in Manhattan. She\u2019s married to a pretty good guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPierre. He\u2019s French.\u201d He snapped at an idea. \u201cI have the best idea. When I introduce you to my parents, you can translate the private conversations between my sister and her husband. It drives the family crazy.\u201d My heart beat frantically at the thought that he expected me to meet his family. \u201cWait,\u201d he thought out loud, \u201cyou\u2019ll probably just join them against us. Never mind, I change my mind.\u201d He smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cYour sister speaks French?\u201d I asked, hoping I didn\u2019t give away my ridiculous excitement that he saw a future with me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they met during college. Her university had a campus abroad in Paris. Enough said.\u201d I smiled at him. \u201cMy mom and dad are both teachers.\u201d</p><p> \u201cCool. And what are their names?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cWalter and Michelle, but you can call my pops Walt.\u201d He fiddled with the zipper of his jacket, seemingly nervous. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to ask you something, January, but I wasn\u2019t sure how to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say it,\u201d I prodded him with my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to the States for a week for Kelly\u2019s wedding and I-I thought maybe, if you want, you could come as my date?\u201d</p><p> I shifted uncomfortably in my seat. I didn\u2019t know how to answer this. I did want to go with him to New York, I really did, but it was just too freaking weird knowing I\u2019d be meeting all his friends as he watched the girl he just recently considered the lost love of his life get married. I mean, yeah, he said she meant nothing anymore but no one can just shut off like that and he hadn\u2019t even gotten an opportunity to get over her properly.</p><p>Suddenly I realized I needed to be very careful.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I heard him say, breaking me from my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve scared you off, I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just-it feels weird you asking me to see Kelly get married. I don\u2019t know her, but I feel this weird thing for her. I don\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><p>This made Tom laugh. \u201cBaby girl,\u201d he said with a bit of his inherited Texas lingo. He picked up my hand and kissed the back. \u201cIf I have to spend the next month convincing you she\u2019s nothing to me, I\u2019ll do it. She doesn\u2019t even hold a candle to you, MacLochlainn.\u201d</p><p>Thomas</p><p>The Windmill Festival was just a few days before Kelly\u2019s wedding, but we weren\u2019t going to Paris just to sit around and wait. The label bought us rail passes to pal around Europe, allowing us to check out as many bands as possible. We were starting in Paris because I wanted January to see the band Jamaica and a few of their starting lineups the next night. I\u2019d planned on working our way through Europe by rail until the festival and then head straight home for the wedding, which surprisingly the thought of didn\u2019t affect me at all. I didn\u2019t even feel a dull ache. It was as if my body had forgotten all about Kelly and I knew I had January to thank for that.</p><p>Damn, that girl was incredible. Zap.</p><p>I had a week to convince her to come with me. She was coming home with me. She was definitely coming home with me.</p><p>The next night, we waited in line to see Jamaica.</p><p>\u201cDid Jason talk to Georgia Asher?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>\u201cI think so. I hope it went well. She\u2019s going to be huge and I hope we get credit for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d she told me, her smile reaching her eyes.</p><p>I studied her. \u201cYou have really beautiful lips, January.\u201d</p><p>She shyly pinched them together, a red flush crept across her face. I grabbed her face and brought those lips to mine until they were loose again and she kissed me back.</p><p>When we pulled apart, her eyes widened and she fought a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose girls, the ones right behind us.\u201d I started to turn, but she whipped me forward again. \u201cDon\u2019t look!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t think I can understand them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think you\u2019re adorable.\u201d She paused, listening again and almost laughed. \u201cThey\u2019d like to see what\u2019s under your hood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, shifting uncomfortably, pulling the hood farther over my head.</p><p>\u201cThey like your hands...and your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re teasing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else do they think?\u201d</p><p>She listened, her eyes shot open, her mouth widened. \u201cI can tell you what I think. I think they want their faces punched.\u201d She began to turn around but I caught her, chuckling at her reaction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re adorable, January.\u201d</p><p>She stood tall, turned toward them briefly then leaned into me.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she told me when I laughed at the not so subtle display. \u201cI had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I kind of like you possessive.\u201d I leaned my face into the side of her hair and drank her in. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cGood, \u2019cause I know you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at me. \u201cConfident. I kinda like that.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not a conventional dating scenario, though, you know?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNothing about us is conventional, January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she said, but the smile on her face fell. \u201cOh shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, following her line of sight. We watched Jonah walk through the front door. He waved sarcastically before breaking the threshold. \u201cDamn it! How did he find us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Inside, I searched the club for Jonah but he was nowhere to be found.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got to be backstage,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a sneaky pete, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never believe we\u2019re also Seven reps. Not with Jonah back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could, you know, use my girlish wiles.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her, shocked. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pimp you out to gain backstage access, January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s disgusting!\u201d I practically yelled, appalled.</p><p>She laughed at me. \u201cTom, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m stripping or something equally sketchy. I was just going to flirt my way through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said emphatically. I pulled her body to mine. \u201cNo way in hell. No.\u201d</p><p>I led us to the bar in the corner of the club.</p><p>\u201cFine, then what should we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if he talks to All the Pretty Girls before we get a chance? Dude, he is not above stealing. I told you this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. All we can do is play it by ear tonight, but from now on I\u2019m not even telling Jason where we\u2019re going next. No one will know but us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak of the devil,\u201d I told her as Jonah exited from the backstage entrance. I didn\u2019t have to bother getting his attention, he saw us.</p><p>\u201cJanuary,\u201d he said, wrapping his arms around her. I didn\u2019t care about appearances, I pulled him off her. I figured he\u2019d misinterpret my possessiveness for anger at him for cheating.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Jonah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb, Jonah. How the hell did you know we were going to be here?\u201d</p><p>Jonah laughed, clapping me on the shoulder harshly. I stared at this hand, a muscle ticked in my jaw. I shrugged his hand off roughly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking with you, Jonah. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Paris this secretive town no one knows about? I\u2019m here for the music just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit and you know it.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWho are you stealing from us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re paranoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not an idiot. Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that it\u2019s not any of your business, but I just convinced All the Pretty Girls to visit Jason next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Tom,\u201d January said, tugging at my arm to get me away from Jonah. \u201cWe\u2019ll still win,\u201d she whispered to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJanuary, feel like dancing?\u201d Jonah asked as we started to walk away.

Is that what they call it now?\u201d</p><p>We both turned around and I read the recognition in his face. He knew we were \"together.\"</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cNothing, see you next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cOh, you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how would that be possible, Jonah?

Do your own homework.\u201d</p><p>I turned to walk away but Jonah stopped me with his next sentence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do it, or I\u2019ll tell everyone that you and January are sleeping together and that\u2019s the reason she\u2019s on the road with you.\u201d</p><p>January\u2019s grip on my arm tightened. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t, Jonah.\u201d She spoke before I could.</p> <p>\u201cI would,\u201d he told her, a pathetic sympathetic expression on his face.</p><p>January\u2019s face looked amazingly hurt, making me want to pummel Jonah. \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked him simply.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s business, January, nothing more.\u201d He smiled at her sincerely. Asshole. \u201cI see how he looks at you. You\u2019re his only weakness. I\u2019ve tried for years to one up this guy, but he keeps taking all the glory and for a while there I figured it was a lost cause trying to hit him where it hurts because nothing seemed important to this asshole. That is, until he met you.\u201d</p><p>Gently, I removed January\u2019s hands from around my bicep. I rushed Jonah in an instant, pinning him to the bar behind him. Several people scattered at once. \u201cYou tell a single soul that lie and I will make you hurt so bad, you\u2019ll wish you\u2019d never been born.\u201d He started to laugh and I squeezed my hold around his neck even tighter, choking it off. \u201cDo we understand one another?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He nodded and I dropped him. He gripped the bar top, still grinning, casually resting against it as if I hadn\u2019t just threatened him. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll still find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he promised.</p><p>I guided a sullen January toward the exit. We couldn\u2019t get out of there fast enough. If I\u2019d stayed another second, I would have wiped the floor with Jonah.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving?\u201d she asked me, dazed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stole the band we\u2019d come here to talk to but mostly because I can\u2019t be in the same building as that unethical bastard.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>After a few minutes of walking the streets of Paris, we\u2019d chosen to forget all about Jonah, purposely becoming absorbed in the beauty of the city.</p><p>Then it dawned on me. Watching January react to the city around her, I realized she\u2019d never been here before.</p><p>\u201cHow is it possible?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>She furrowed her eyes at me. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your first time here, isn\u2019t it,\u201d I stated.</p><p>She blushed prettily. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God and we\u2019re only here for another day. That\u2019s it. Come on, \u201c I told her and yanked her toward the obvious.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting the Eiffel Tower out of the way, then we\u2019re going to see the real Paris tomorrow. The parts the tourists never see and you\u2019re going to speak to the locals and I\u2019m going to watch your mouth as you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJe t'appr\u00e9cie vraiment. Tu m'appr\u00e9cies?\u201d She surprised me, bringing me to a full stop.</p><p>I hugged her body closely and raptly watched her mouth. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJe t'appr\u00e9cie vraiment. Tu m'appr\u00e9cies?\u201d She repeated.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d I asked her, swallowing hard.</p><p>\u201cI told you that I cared for you and asked if you cared for me as well,\u201d she murmured softly.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said without hesitation. I ran my hand across her forehead and down her face. \u201cSpeak to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like me to say?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhatever comes to mind.\u201d</p><p>She studied my face, then took a moment. \u201cTu es \u00e9l\u00e9gant. Tu me fascines. Te me rends heureuse. Je t'adore. J'ai besoin de toi. Je pense toujours \u00e0 toi. Embrasses-moi.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard at how sexy I found her words and to my utter disbelief I\u2019d had no idea what she\u2019d said but they affected me nonetheless. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I claimed her mouth harshly, breathing her in and tasting her tongue with my own before breaking away.</p><p>\u201cAll those words and all you asked me to do was kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was more, but after that kiss I can\u2019t remember what I\u2019d said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I wish I spoke French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kiss with quite the French accent.\u201d Zap.</p><p>I kissed her again.</p><p>\u201cYou know, we could just go back to my room and I could watch you speak just as easily there,\u201d I taunted.</p><p>\u201cYou play to win, Eriksson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I told her, smacking her cheek with a loud kiss. \u201cWe better stay out in public now that I think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, taking my hand. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>The Eiffel Tower was closed as it was so late in the evening so we stood underneath its belly, drinking in the cool metal and the intricately beautiful architecture. It truly was magnificent, I don't care what anyone says. Yeah, it may not have been the \"cool\" thing to do in Paris, but it most definitely was worth it to see. The structure was daunting and harsh but was so incredible in its artistry; it fit in so well with the nature around it. It was breathtaking...but not as breathtaking as the girl I was sharing its beauty with.</p><p>\u201cI know where I want to go next,\u201d she told me.</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I asked, not caring about the time.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to cab it. I think it\u2019s far from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I asked again.</p><p>\u201cCimeti\u00e8re du P\u00e8re-Lachaise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is the P\u00e8re-Lachaise?\u201d I asked, butchering the pronunciation. A chuckle built in her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d she explained, hailing a taxi.</p><p>She told the cabbie where to go in French and that earned her a place even closer to my side. Twenty minutes later, we\u2019d arrived.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cemetery,\u201d I said gazing out the window.</p><p>\u201cThat it is, but not just any cemetery. This cemetery has a few famous bodies resting inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOscar Wilde, Edith Piaf, Jim Morrison. And that\u2019s just who I can remember off the top of my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool, but how are we possibly going to see anything?\u201d I asked, paying the driver.</p><p>\u201cI always carry a flashlight in my bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I not surprised by this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot me. First stop? Oscar Wilde!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the only one I know how to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is rather adventurous for us. Cemetery. Night.\u201d I accidentally kicked a pebble beneath my shoe and January jumped. \u201cSounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s romantic,\u201d she said, squeezing herself into my side.</p><p>\u201cThat too,\u201d I agreed, kissing the top of her head.</p><p>The tomb was fairly near the side entrance we snuck through and it was...odd. I\u2019m not kidding. It looked nothing like I thought it would. A seemingly solid slab, the side had a simple winged sphinx or maybe angel, depending on how you looked at it, carved into its side. It was shockingly contemporary in look and feel. Personally, I didn\u2019t like it, not for Wilde anyway. I mean, it was an unbelievably beautiful piece of art but for someone who lived and spoke aesthetics, it was too plain.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it barricaded?\u201d I asked, running my palm up the glass fence surrounding the tomb.</p><p>\u201cI kind of remember reading something about women kissing the sides of the tomb to the point it was deteriorating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. We women can be a bit zealous at times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d I teased, tucking her in to me as we perused the cobblestone paths along the tombs.</p><p>\u201cIf you think that\u2019s bad, you should hear the story behind Victor Noir\u2019s grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSingle women are supposed to kiss his bronzed face, place a flower in his upturned hat, and then proceed to fondle him in his most private of areas.\u201d</p><p>I laughed so hard, I startled her.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding and what does this get these single women?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cA husband...in a year.\u201d</p><p>She got exceedingly quiet in that moment and I swear I could feel her blush.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tease her for the myth\u2014it didn\u2019t seem appropriate at the time, I didn\u2019t really know why. All I did know was that I didn\u2019t want to taint what could possibly be one of the most insightfully unintentional conversations I\u2019d ever had. I shocked myself with that thought. January and I had...potential. A slow tingle permeated my stomach.</p><p>We walked a long time in silence, ducking behind trees and tombs when we suspected a guard may be approaching. We passed many graves but had no idea who they belonged to, if they were artists of any sort, be they writers, composers, painters.</p><p>We stumbled upon Jim Morrison\u2019s grave by accident. The only indication the tomb belonged to anyone of importance was the aluminum barricade cordoning it off. I couldn\u2019t believe how plain it looked as well. Though, the piles of flowers, candles and oddly, pharmaceuticals, were a sight to be seen.</p><p>\u201cThanks for Light My Fire, Jim,\u201d I told him. Although he was an exceedingly talented musician and for that I appreciated him immensely, I didn\u2019t personally care for the guy that much. I read once that he read heavily of existentialism. I\u2019m a proponent of existentialism, but the Kierkegaard version and I tread carefully over those philosophies, especially Nietzche\u2019s. His version, one I\u2019m assuming Jim followed, based on his actions, is nothing but dribble in my opinion, created to justify the whims of immoral behavior. And it was probably the reason Morrison felt the need to experiment with the drugs that eventually took his life. He was looking for fulfillment through \"oneself\" so he chose a material source like heroin, and as we all know fulfillment doesn\u2019t come that way. I know, I know, deep, right? Not just a pretty face, ladies. Plus, unfortunately, I have a lot of experience in trying to \"fulfill oneself.\" I just ended up unhappy in the end.</p><p>A little farther down and to the right, we spotted a brilliant white tomb with a woman draped and weeping over a broken lyre. Many of the tombs belonging to musicians were fashioned with broken instruments, a fitting tribute to their genius, I think. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Chopin\u2019s,\u201d January told me, running her fingers along the wrought-iron fence surrounding the tomb.</p><p>\u201cHow fitting that the last grave we see tonight was the poet of pianists,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cHow is that fitting?\u201d she asked me honestly.</p><p>\u201cUh, maybe because you\u2019re a poet pianist?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, hush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary, I\u2019m not buttering you up. I\u2019ll get what I want from you regardless the compliment,\u201d I teased. She feigned dismay and made a move to hit me but I caught her hand, bringing her close. I whispered, \u201cI\u2019m telling you that you are a poet pianist. You have a lot in common with him.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me a long while and I let her. \u201cI think that is probably the sexiest compliment I\u2019ve ever gotten and if we were alone, I\u2019d probably jump your bones right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tease.\u201d I smiled but looked around me. \u201cJanuary, there\u2019s no one here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse him, Fred.\u201d She told the tomb and made an exaggerated movement with her head toward Chopin\u2019s grave.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I apologize.\u201d We heard a noise and January literally jumped on me. \u201cYou\u2019re good on your word, MacLochlainn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>We walked toward the massive main double door entrance of the cemetery but discovered it was barricaded for the night.</p><p>\u201cCrap, we\u2019re going to have to walk to one of the side entrances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, that is, like, totally far away,\u201d January whined.</p> <p>\u201cLike, for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Eriksson. It\u2019s one in the morning and we\u2019re illegally trespassing on a city cemetery. I\u2019m a little nervous. I channel my inner Valley girl when I get nervous. I can\u2019t be arrested in every country we visit.\u201d She was quiet for a moment as we trekked it back and to the right. \u201cWait, is that something I should aspire to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, collect shot glasses or snow globes or something equally garish.\u201d I took her flashlight and turned the light off. The moonlight lit the cobblestone path enough to see where we were going. No sense creating a beacon for the guards. \u201cIf you can decipher which European country has the most comfortable handcuffs, I believe your goody two-shoes reputation may tarnish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of my shoes are very good.\u201d God, I found her unbelievably adorable when she said things like that. \u201cBut I already collect snow globes, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Then collected arrests are the next natural step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who else is buried in here?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbelard and Heloise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make fun, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not. I\u2019m seriously not. You know of Abelard and Heloise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, I-I\u2019m a bit of a history buff, if you couldn\u2019t already tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary, it\u2019s like you were made for me,\u201d I told her. I realized what I\u2019d said way late in the moment and the silence was palpable. The cemetery trip was proving to be way more discerning an occasion then I ever thought possible. It seemed that light was being shed even as we walked through the dark night. I shook it away. \u201cYou know what they say about history,\u201d I said, pretending I hadn\u2019t made things awkward or revealingly uncomfortable for myself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s doomed to repeat itself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d I said, shivering at the thought of Abelard\u2019s fate.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about Abelard, aren\u2019t you?</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s change the subject then.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>When the Levee Breaks</p><p>Thomas</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to Rome?\u201d January asked me the next morning as she exited her room.</p><p>I had to swallow before answering or she would have realized she\u2019d tied my tongue. She was wearing a dress. Zap. A short one. Zap, Zap. And as dark blue as her eyes, making me want to keel over at her feet.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d I told her as I grabbed her bag from her. \u201cJanuary?\u201d I asked her, walking a bit ahead.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear?\u201d I smiled to myself, refusing to look at her.</p><p>\u201cYou look lovely today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, an answering smile hidden on her face as well. I could hear it. \u201cSo, who\u2019s in Rome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA South African band named The Great Remember. I\u2019ve been wanting to see them for some time now. I got wind of them through a mutual friend of Jason\u2019s and mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. What\u2019s their sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of a cross between folk and rock. Chicks will dig \u2019em. They use a lot of unusual instruments in their recordings as well as live, a lot of acoustic stuff, a lot of sweet sounding melodies. For some reason they favor G major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my favorite key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may like them then. I haven\u2019t seen them live yet though, looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p> \u201cDo you have anything by them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave your medicine?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cAye, aye, Cap\u2019n!\u201d She saluted me as we stepped onto the elevator.</p><p>\u201cHave-Have you thought any more on Kelly\u2019s wedding?\u201d I stuttered like a blithering idiot and settling in as the doors closed.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cHonestly? I don\u2019t think it would be wise for me to go.\u201d</p><p>She shifted slightly and leaned against the wall closest to her.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask why?\u201d I asked, my stomach dropping to my feet.</p><p>\u201cBecause, Tom,\u201d she said as we both stepped off the elevator, \u201cI don\u2019t like being used and that\u2019s what I think you\u2019re doing.\u201d She left me with my jaw hanging open and checked us out of our rooms. All I could do was watch her beautiful figure and restrain myself from groveling at her feet, begging her to change the way she thought about me. I felt like such a pathetic loser. She had more control over me than I thought possible and I wanted so badly to feel bad about that but couldn\u2019t and that made me even more peeved. We cabbed it to the train station in a stony silence. I was fuming and could tell by her defiant body language that she\u2019d caught on.</p><p>\u201cJust out with it already, Tom.\u201d</p><p>We approached a bench to wait out our train.</p><p>\u201cHow in the hell did you get the impression I was using you?\u201d I asked. She sighed loudly and plopped onto the seat. I sat next to her, closely. \u201cHow, January?\u201d I whispered. There was more hurt in my voice than I\u2019d imagined I\u2019d allowed.</p><p>She turned her body so that her face was next to mine. \u201cI won\u2019t be made a fool, Tom. Ever. I\u2019ve had lots of practice at it and I\u2019m confident enough to know that I\u2019m worth more than showing up to a wedding on the arm of the man who\u2019s still in love with the bride.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at her. \u201cHaven\u2019t you been listening to me, January? I\u2019m not in love with Kelly. I haven\u2019t been for more than six months. I\u2019m completely and utterly over Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody gets over the love of his or her life in six months, Tom. Nobody.\u201d</p><p>I studied the stressed lines in her beautiful face and how the light glinted off her glassy blue eyes. I ran my fingers along the crease in her brow, relaxing the worry away.</p><p>And it clicked.</p><p>I let the recognition spread through the slow smile on my face and grabbed her shoulders, squeezing her into a hug, using every bit of restraint I had not to press too tightly. I wanted so badly for her to melt into me. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I secreted into her ear, crushing her to my chest. \u201cNobody gets over the love of their life in six months, January. Nobody. In fact,\u201d I told her, kissing her neck so softly it could have barely registered and speaking even softer. \u201cYou never get over the love of your life.\u201d I felt the movement of her neck as she swallowed my words. \u201cI swear to everything, January, I am over Kelly.\u201d</p><p>I gently placed my mouth on hers and a surge of electricity seemed to pass between us. All I could think of was that I\u2019d somehow zapped January MacLochlainn, that she\u2019d been served a tablespoon of her own medicine and that its effects were immediate.</p><p>I\u2019d fallen so hard in love with her, I was surprised I hadn\u2019t been knocked out cold.</p><p>And when I got to thinking about it, feeling so confident I was in love with Kelly Simsky six months prior was about the biggest joke I\u2019d ever played...and it was on myself.</p><p>January</p><p>Oh. My. Lord. I\u2019m in love with Thomas Eriksson.</p><p>Since our first kiss six months prior, I\u2019d been falling hard for the stranger, but the short time I\u2019d had him all to myself was enough to solidify it and in stone it seemed. I had it bad. It scared the crap out of me, to be perfectly honest. I\u2019d only been in love twice before and both times I never felt it in my stomach the way I felt it with Thomas Eriksson. In fact, I was starting to question whether I truly loved the boys I thought I loved. They paled so white in comparison and further bolstered my confidence in my decision to wait. Tom was the only man, and I mean man, I\u2019d ever met that could possibly endeavor to deserve my virginity and that made my insides tremble in cool anticipation.</p><p>I also wasn\u2019t prepared to experience the entire, almost exhausting, consuming sensation that was being in love with Tom. My body seemed to ache for him. My chest and stomach hurt a dull sort of pang whenever we were apart, even for a short time, and burst in a euphoric peace when he closed whatever gap lay between us, whether it be time or proximity. It was strange and exciting and altogether a feeling of extremes but, ugh, I wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way.</p><p>With my insane new awareness, I boarded the train headed for Rome with the most butterflies ever to take root in a person\u2019s stomach. I couldn\u2019t stop the stupid-ass smile on my face and I know my cheeks were glowing the deepest cherry they\u2019ve ever shown but I was okay with that. I was so gosh dang cool with that it wasn\u2019t even funny. I wanted to do something terrible like run in circles on top of an Austrian mountain like Novice Maria in The Sound of Music, singing \u2018My love is alive for Thomas Eriksson!\u2019 I\u2019d get my sisters to sing back up. Get the effing crackers out! Apparently, in-love-January is nothing but a ball of cheese. I was so high on what I felt for Tom, I could not care less what anyone thought of me.</p><p>Everyone, except for Tom, that is. I was pretty confident if I\u2019d went around belting out my love for him in the key of ornery nun, he\u2019d have me committed. It\u2019s why I was quiet instead and acting insanely unlike myself just staring at my folded hands. I looked over and found him smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, my cheeks burning deeper. Maybe he\u2019ll think I\u2019m embarrassed instead of cracked out of my noggin for him.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he said, running a finger over my blazing cheek, branding me with his equally hot touch. \u201cYou\u2019re so goddamned beautiful, January.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened a bit at his heart felt exclamation. \u201cTh-Thank you,\u201d I gulped.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, leaning over my body. He enveloped me in his arms but didn\u2019t kiss me. He just stared and studied every line of my face. He looked at me with such unwavering intensity, he was stealing away my breath. My chest started pumping in air at an alarming rate. I was hyperventilating. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d I told him, never breaking eye contact.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, his own warm, sweet breath wafting over my cheeks. His right hand moved achingly slowly from the small of my back and wrapped gingerly around my neck, resting his thumb at my rapidly beating pulse.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I begged.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he ordered, his eyes roaming mine.</p> <p>I blinked long and slow, swallowing my fear. He knew. \u201cYou say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he breathed but he was silent for what seemed like minutes.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m in misery, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard.\u201d</p> <p>He swallowed and the movement sent my eyes lazily down his neck and back up. \u201cYou\u2019ll reject me,\u201d he said when my eyes met his again.</p><p>\u201cAnd so what if I do? Should it matter?\u201d</p><p>He sank a little into himself then but I pulled him back against me.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t matter but it does,\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t-I can\u2019t be hurt again, January,\u201d he rushed out quietly in one breath. \u201cThere\u2019d be no recovering, I told you that.\u201d</p> <p>My heart pounded in my chest at the intended proclamation. \u201cSay it,\u201d I ordered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>He said it simply, no hesitation between my last asking him and that moment. Just five words between the old us and the new us.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for me to say it back. He rushed and kissed me so hard and yet not hard enough so I met him with equal fierceness. It was double the impact and exponentially delirious. So many wondrous sensations were assaulting me. His tongue sent tingles down my chin as it slid into mine. His goatee scratched softly against my cheeks, his hands held my jaw and threaded through my hair. I couldn\u2019t get close enough. I wanted so badly to climb into his lap. The very vague awareness I was in public held me back but barely. He pressed into me and we smashed against the window on our row. He was so warm and perfect, my hands went to his exposed t-shirt and my fingers laced within the fabric. I wanted to drag him over me but the tiny, almost infinitesimal rational side of my brain reminded me where I was.</p><p>A little kid giggling at us broke the spell. Tom\u2019s lips stilled on mine but their quivering told me they\u2019d rather do anything but. My hands went softly to his face before fastening in his hair, running the length through my fingers until they met his neck.</p><p>I kissed him softly on the mouth and breathed my own revelation. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, Tom.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and let out a shaky breath before they shot open and held me in my place. \u201cRome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Rome?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust, promise me that while in Rome, you\u2019ll still feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and rested my hand over his heart. \u201cI promise.\u201d You don\u2019t get over the love of your life, Tom. You said it yourself.</p><p>He smiled the most heart-shattering smile.</p><p>He kissed my neck and I could feel him smile against my skin. \u201cJanuary MacLochlainn, how in the world did I get so lucky?\u201d</p><p>I hugged him tightly. \u201cFunny, I was just thinking the same thing about finding you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen a more beautiful city than Rome, Italy. It was definitely a city of God. The architecture, the sheer number of churches, a city of art. That\u2019s what it was, a city full of art. Not one inch within its walls was untouched by a magnificent artist it seemed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d Tom said, grabbing my hand after we completed a traditional coin toss into the Trevi Fountain, superstitiously ensuring a return trip to Rome. We saved the fountain for last since our hotel was right down the street.</p><p>We\u2019d already visited Vatican City, numerous churches and many monuments. We weren\u2019t set to see The Great Remember until the following night. We thought about partying it up a little but, to be honest, we were worn out from the traveling and always being \"on.\" We agreed to sleep in a little the next day as we rarely got to but not too late as we wanted to sightsee a little more.</p><p>\u201cI want to take you on a proper date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. American style. Dinner. Movie. Make out session.\u201d</p><p> \u201cI\u2019m down, Bobby Brown. What shall we eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cItalian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. And the film?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, this is good. I think it\u2019s against an in-love law or something that we don't know what movies each other digs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, hold on?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>I found a man walking by and approached him. \u201cMi scusi, dove trovo un cinema?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA due isolati sulla destra\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrazie,\u201d I told the man.</p><p>He nodded and walked away with a polite, \u201cPrego.\u201d</p><p>An inadvertent yelp came from me as I was swept off my feet and spun around. \u201cYou make me hot when you do that,\u201d Tom spoke into my ear.</p><p>I kissed him softly as he set me on my feet again. \u201cSei il grande amore della mia vita,\u201d I whispered into his lips.</p><p>He kissed me deeper. \u201cAnd what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Come on, it\u2019s two blocks down.\u201d</p><p>As we walked to the theater, I started singing a Georgia Asher song we heard days before but stuck with us and to my utter surprise, Tom joined in harmony and we sounded unbelievably good together. His voice was rich and deep and perfect for harmony, which made sense to me knowing he played bass for The Ivories. When we were done, I looked over at him in awe.</p><p>\u201cGod you\u2019re talented, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you really are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Tom. You are talented as shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis coming from one of the best pianists I\u2019ve ever seen live.\u201d He paused. \u201cActually, that does kinda make me feel like a hoss, coming from you. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I said, blushing from his compliment.</p><p>The theater looked more like a ballroom than a movie cinema but that was Rome for you. I translated all the titles for him. It seemed they played oldies but goodies, and we had a choice between Alien, Back to the Future, Indiana Jones: The Temple of Doom, and three Italian flicks. Seeming as I would be the only one who could understand the Italian films, we opted for the American/Italian subtitled.</p><p>\u201cSo which one?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOf those three, I know exactly which one I\u2019d pick, hands down, but I want to know if you\u2019d pick the same one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d pick-,\u201d I began but he cut me off with a warm finger to my lips.</p><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s play a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh, a game. I rock at games. I dominate at games. I am a game master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you finished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, proceed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s my card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, taking the little plastic Visa.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stand here while you buy your ticket. You go on inside, then it\u2019ll be my turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully we pick the same film.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis game sucks,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cJust play along, January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, convinced he was going to choose Alien or Indiana Jones.</p><p>I debated whether I should just choose whatever film I thought he would want but that was defeating the spirit of the \"game.\"</p><p>\u201cUn biglietto per Ritorno al Futuro, per favore?\u201d</p><p>The attendant took the card, ran it and I pocketed my ticket.</p><p>\u201cYour card, sir.\u201d</p><p>He took the card and palmed it in his hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you inside, then?\u201d I asked, feeling unsure for some reason.</p><p>\u201cIn just a few. Need anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can wait until later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, leaning in and kissing my cheek.</p><p>Thomas</p><p>As soon as January went inside, I went to the attendant\u2019s window and purchased a ticket to Back to the Future hoping she chose the same one. I slid my card and the ticket inside my wallet. I took a deep breath and let it out slowly.</p><p>\u201cFollowing us?\u201d I asked Jonah casually as I turned to my left.</p><p>He hefted himself off the wall a few yards from the ticket booth, unfolding his arms and taking his sweet ass time to reach me.</p><p>\u201cNo. Just a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. A coincidence. You know what else might be coincidental?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked, a dumb smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cMy fist connecting with your weak ass jaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, Eriksson. Threats? Really? Don\u2019t make me report you to corporate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a pussy when you say things like that. You know that?\u201d</p><p>His only reply was a snort.</p><p>\u201cGonna run off and tell on me, Jonah? Can\u2019t fight like a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a lover not a fighter, Tom. You know that,\u201d he said, a sarcastic tap on my jaw with his palm.</p><p>I gritted my jaw and pulled away from his reach. \u201cOnly cowards say shit like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always resort to violence, Tom. It\u2019s going to bite you in the ass one day, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just not afraid to fight for what I believe in, but you obviously don\u2019t believe in shit seeming as how you\u2019re such a spineless, dishonest asshole. Not that you\u2019d believe me, but I\u2019ve never hit anyone in my life, yet I\u2019m not afraid to start with you, dick. Get the fuck away from me before I\u2019m good on my word.\u201d</p><p>I started to walk away but he grabbed the back of my t-shirt.</p><p>\u201cLet go, Jonah,\u201d I told the air in front of me, refusing to face him. \u201cI promise you, you won\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know how I found you?\u201d he asked, releasing his grip.</p><p>I hated that I did. I sincerely needed to know how the hell he was finding us since we told no one we were even going to Italy.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I asked, still refusing to turn.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask January that question,\u201d he said, chuckling. My blood boiled to an intense heat, but when I turned to confront him he\u2019d vanished around the corner like a slithering snake.</p><p>\u201cWhat a crock of shit,\u201d I mumbled to myself. \u201cShe\u2019d never betray me.\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d planted a seed in that moment and as much as I hated it, it made me think.</p><p>How did he find us? If January and I were the only ones to know where we were going and I didn\u2019t tell him, that left only one other person who could inform him. Surely not, I thought, shaking my head. He\u2019s just trying to get inside your head.</p><p>I entered the theater trembling from the need to hit something. I booked it to the attendant tearing tickets and handed over mine. He pointed to a theater to my right and said something in Italian I didn\u2019t understand. I just nodded and told him the only Italian word I knew. I hoped to God it was thank you but I couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>The theater wasn\u2019t yet dark and there was no one else inside but January. \u201cGood, the previews haven\u2019t started,\u201d I told her, pasting the best smile I could attempt.</p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d January shouted. She\u2019d stood and started waving her arms. \u201cI\u2019m over here, Tom! Can you see me?\u201d She joked. I looked on her. There\u2019s no way she\u2019d do that to you. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I can, January, seeing as we\u2019re the only two people in here,\u201d I joshed back, the lump in my throat only getting bigger.</p><p>\u201cOh good. I was afraid you wouldn\u2019t be able to find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour jumping up and down helped.\u201d</p><p>We settled into our seats and she rested her head on my shoulder. I swallowed my fear and tried to control my shaking.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the film you bought the ticket for,\u201d she accused quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d I said, turning to meet her face.</p><p>\u201cThen what took you so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I just got a bit lost. I don\u2019t speak the language, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d she said matter-of-factly.</p> <p>\u201cI am not,\u201d I said, lying through my teeth. \u201cHere,\u201d I said, removing my ticket.</p><p>She took it and studied it, confirming what I\u2019d already told her. \u201cHmm,\u201d she teased. \u201cYou pass, Christopher Lloyd, but something\u2019s still wrong, I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Huey Lewis, I swear there\u2019s no news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget, I\u2019ve got \u2018the power of love.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a curious thing,\u201d I added dryly.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, \u201cIt\u2019s tougher than diamonds, rich like cream.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStronger and harder than a bad girl\u2019s dream,\u201d I continued.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s scarier, the fact we know these lyrics or the lyrics themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it might just save your life, January. That\u2019s the power of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I love you,\u201d she proclaimed.</p><p>I swallowed the lump away. \u201cI love you too,\u201d I told her, kissing the top of her head.</p><p>And just like that, Jonah and what he\u2019d told me melted away.</p><p>After dinner and the movie, I kissed her at her door and barely controlled my feet as they apparently had their own thoughts and began to make their way toward her bed with her in my arms. I abandoned her quickly, kissing her once more and sprinting to my own door. Inside my room, I dialed Harper, one of my best friends and Callum\u2019s wife.</p><p>\u201cYo, yo, yo!\u201d I heard on the other line, making me smile.</p> <p>\u201cHarper Tate. What\u2019s new?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cOh, besides the fact that it\u2019s seven in the morning here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit, sorry.\u201d I said, picking up the nearby alarm clock and trying to do the math. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about that. I just needed to talk to someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, buttercup. It\u2019s been over a week since you called. We were getting worried so it\u2019s all good. Why?\u201d She sounded concerned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it Kelly\u2019s wedding again?\u201d Callum and Harper were the only ones who knew about my little Kelly issue. I heard a mumbling then Harper\u2019s muffled response. \u201cNo, it\u2019s cool. It\u2019s Tom. I think he\u2019s depressed again about Kelly.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cHarper, please tell Callum that I am not depressed about Kelly. I told you, I am so over Kelly it\u2019s not even funny. She\u2019s a friend and nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then what\u2019s up, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, uh-\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cI\u2019m, uh,-\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-t-t-today, junior!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it, Harper.\u201d I took a deep breath and just spit it out. \u201cI\u2019m in love.\u201d There was a long pause. \u201cHarper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, with the girl? January?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I know what you\u2019re thinking and this isn\u2019t Kelly-love, Harper. This is-this is...it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know this for sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d bet my life on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty damn sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what the hell is the problem then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having some trust issues, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a chick, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, I know. It\u2019s embarrassing as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, grow a pair, dude. Suck it up. Because Kelly really didn\u2019t wrong you, you wronged yourself. If you\u2019re insecure, it\u2019s because you made yourself that way and there\u2019s no reason you should tiptoe around yourself because you\u2019re the toughest bastard I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, Harper, that was harsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry. You needed to hear the truth and I love you too much not to be honest with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for that, truly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I could hear her run and bounce on their sofa, then I heard Callum yell at her to stop throwing herself on the couch because it was scuffing the wall, then I heard her smile and roll her eyes. Okay, I didn\u2019t hear that, but I definitely knew her well enough to know that it\u2019s exactly what she did. \u201cYou\u2019re not my dad, Callum,\u201d I heard her say.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what you said last night,\u201d I faintly caught.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m outta here,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t! Stay! Hold on! Do you say that shit to embarrass me?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Callum answered as laughter faded away.</p><p>\u201cAnyway. Tell me. What\u2019s she like?\u201d she asked, the giddiness returning to her voice. Girls ate this crap up.</p><p>\u201cI told you. Gorgeous, cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my word, boys are dumb. I\u2019m gonna have to pry every detail from you aren\u2019t I? How tall is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, five-foot ten?\u201d She\u2019s exactly five-foot ten.</p><p>\u201cHer hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong and brown.\u201d The red highlights in it shine in the sun and all I want to do is bury my nose in it when she\u2019s around because it smells like cherry bark.</p><p>\u201cAnd her eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue.\u201d Like the ocean, blue.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a scout and your her apprentice so she must have killer taste in music. What else is she like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe plays the piano like an absolute boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit. That\u2019s cool. And her family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the oldest of ten kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That is wicked awesome. Her house must have been a riot to live in! Hey, I just thought of something, if she\u2019s January, then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, their names are the months of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the truck out of here! I may have to steal that idea. Callum, did you hear that! We\u2019re going to have to bear twelve children but no more than twelve!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt Callum will agree to that, Harper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tom,\u201d she laughed, \u201cyou know so little of my powers of persuasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not,\u201d I said, smiling at myself. \u201cAll right, it\u2019s late and I need rest to sightsee tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap. I\u2019m so jealous of you. Have a good time but not too good a time, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, Tom. Talk to you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, tell Callum I\u2019ll talk to him next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Bye, babe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>I hung up the phone feeling a lot better about my stupid self-inflicted insecurities. Harper was right, they were pointless. I needed to get over it. I also couldn't wait for Harper to meet January. I had a feeling they would hit it off immediately.</p><p>A knock on the door broke me from my thoughts. I thought it might have been our laundry because I informed the staff that they could bring it by whenever it was done, regardless the time of night. I knew how the laundry services worked and since we usually needed to leave early the day after scouts, I always encouraged a \"drop off when ready\" policy. I opened the door but it wasn\u2019t the stodgy staff member I paid a twenty to have our laundry ready as soon as possible. Nope, it was freaking January MacLochlainn. In a t-shirt. And nothing else.</p><p>\u201cQuick, let me in before someone sees me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, January, I can\u2019t have you in here looking like that.\u201d I tossed the door open and made way for her anyway because I wasn\u2019t an idiot. It was January MacLochlainn. In a t-shirt. And nothing else. I deserved at least a gander.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou definitely can\u2019t sleep in here.\u201d I gulped. \u201cNot looking like that, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked, worrying her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorrying your lip like that. Just, stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said a bit hurt.</p><p>I growled. Yes, growled as my eyes traveled her length. \u201cYup, just as I imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you damn well know it. Come on, I\u2019m taking you to your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She acquiesced easier than I thought she would but that was good news for me as I didn\u2019t think I could have survived another minute.</p><p>When we reached her door, I waited.</p><p>She patted her t-shirt clad body. \u201cOops.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and shook my head. \u201cYou did that on purpose, you clever minx.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth as if appalled then lost the expression and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should go downstairs and get you another key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. I can sleep in your bed...with you.\u201d</p><p>I ran my fingers harshly through my hair and blew a breath out quickly through my nose. \u201cYou are going to flipping kill me, January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be a pretty sweet way to go, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say things like that,\u201d I told her, distancing myself a bit and shaking my head back and forth. \u201cNow, what was I doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were going to your room to lay down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what-No! No, I was going to get you a key. Yes, a key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d she whispered, inching closer to me. She angled her face up at mine, our lips inches apart. \u201cLet me sleep with you.\u201d</p><p>I blinked slowly, trying to gain composure. My heart beat rapidly and my chest pumped air desperately. \u201cLet\u2019s-I don\u2019t think I can handle myself around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can,\u201d she teased, pressing a light, barely there kiss to my lips. A hand involuntarily palmed her ass as I pressed her into me and kissed her deeply.</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d I said, pulling away quickly. \u201cDid all the air just...leave?\u201d I asked the stifling hall around me.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Come with me,\u201d she tempted.</p><p>I followed her like a lost puppy back into my room. \u201cIt\u2019s your funeral, kid.\u201d</p><p>She shut the door behind us and pressed me against its back. \u201cDoes this feel familiar?\u201d</p><p>I switched places with her lightning fast, making her giggle. \u201cNow it does.\u201d</p><p>I kissed her again but this time slowly, languidly, biding my time, memorizing every curve, every line of her lower and upper lip. And I continued to kiss her until I found us laid down on the bed, her legs wrapped around my torso.</p><p>I sat up and shoved myself off. \u201cGet under the covers, January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cGet under those effing covers, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, confused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I paced the room a bit, pulling my t-shirt over my head as I thought quickly about my plan.

That\u2019s masochism, January.\u201d</p><p>She sat up a little, her t-shirt pooling around her thighs. I had to look away. \u201cAnd who said we couldn\u2019t do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a freaking virgin, January.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, you don\u2019t just give that shit away especially to guys like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to think you\u2019re a pretty neat guy. Oh, yeah, and there\u2019s the little fact that I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Those words soothed my aching, edgy soul and my breathing instantly steadied. \u201cI love you too,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cThen come here. I have something to give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t, January. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want it?\u201d she asked, the hurt outlining her entire face.</p><p>I fell on the bed beside her. \u201cJanuary, I want it, probably more than I\u2019ve wanted anything in my entire life but not like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how?\u201d she asked softly, her hand reaching up to rest on my face.</p><p>I took her left hand with my right and looked down at it, thumbing her ring finger. Her gaze followed mine and she realized what I\u2019d meant. She nodded slightly, smiled sweetly and we settled into bed.</p><p>She, wrapped in my arms, and I, wrapped around the third finger of that left hand.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>The Song Remains the Same</p><p>Thomas</p> <p>The next morning, after we woke and I got January back into her room, I went to tell her we should get going and accidentally caught the tail end of a telephone conversation. That wasn\u2019t all that bad and if I\u2019d left as any normal person would have, giving her privacy, I\u2019d probably be the happiest jackass this side of the Mississippi, but I didn\u2019t do that. No, in a typical asshole Thomas move, I stuck around to listen in. That was bad, for many, many reasons and a move I was going to pay dearly for. Believe me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in Stockholm tomorrow.\u201d I heard her say over the phone, making my heart race and my skin panic. No, she\u2019s not. She\u2019s not.</p><p> \u201cProbably around three in the afternoon by the looks of it,\u201d she continued, then laughed. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t suspect a thing.\u201d My heart sank to my feet. \u201cNo, don\u2019t even bother.\u201d Don\u2019t bother? \u201cAll right, love you too. Uh-huh. Tomorrow then.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I discovered that I was a gullible bastard.</p><p>January</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in Stockholm tomorrow,\u201d I told my sister July.</p><p>\u201cWhat time? So I know to tell Dad.\u201d</p><p> \u201cProbably around three in the afternoon by the looks of it.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cHey, has Tom figured out what a massive dork ass you are yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t suspect a thing,\u201d I teased, folding a scrap piece of paper in my lap.</p><p>I heard the front door open and close and knew it was my father returning home from work. He would expect his usual hourlong conversation if he found out I was on the phone, but I knew Tom was ready to leave soon. I reminded myself to call him later the next day.</p><p>\u201cDo you have time to talk to Dad, actually? He just walked in,\u201d July asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t even bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I love you, January. Be careful over there. Should I tell Dad tomorrow then?</p><p>\u201cAll right, love you too. Uh-huh. Tomorrow then.\u201d</p><p>Thomas</p><p>I should have told January that I saw Jonah the night before but I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t. I guess I was still letting a small piece of my insecurity control the rational side of my brain when it came to that fact. Truthfully, I wanted to know how he was finding out where we were and as much as I hated to admit it, her phone call made my heart ache. I hated to jump to conclusions, but that\u2019s exactly what I was doing.</p><p> \u201cI called The Great Remember up this morning,\u201d I told her stoically as we made our way to see them. \u201cDid I tell you that?\u201d I asked, studying her reaction.</p><p>\u201cOh? Well, that\u2019s a good idea, I suppose. What\u2019d you say?\u201d she asked, peering up into my face. She was so beautiful and innocent-looking. You're reading too much into that call, Tom.</p><p>\u201cI just let them know our names, who we were, and that they could expect to see us after the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell them about Jonah?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, should I have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I was just wondering.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed my hand as we walked to the venue. Her thin fingers felt so cool to the touch, I absently brought them to my mouth and blew on them. She wouldn\u2019t betray you. I told myself. You can\u2019t fake sincerity like that...But, maybe she\u2019s just playing you. Maybe she\u2019s Jonah\u2019s inside man...No fucking way! I argued with myself. January would never do that. She\u2019s not capable. I\u2019d bet my life on it.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, breaking me from my thoughts. \u201cWhat\u2019s got you so worried?\u201d</p><p>I forced a smile. \u201cJust thinking.\u201d</p><p>The Great Remember was phenomenal live, but I was so distracted with watching January then watching out for Jonah, I almost missed the potential.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we, you know?\u201d January asked me as I nursed my beer.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I dodged. \u201cHey! Richard!\u201d I said, catching the attention of the lead.</p><p>He looked up at us approaching and smiled.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Tom. This is January. We\u2019re from Seven. I spoke to you earlier on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. You really came,\u201d Richard said, a thick South African accent crowding his words. \u201cGuys! Guys! This is Tom and January. They\u2019re from the label I told you about!\u201d</p><p>The rest of the band clamored around us and we spent hours with them, they agreed to travel to Dublin from Rome to meet with Jason as he was coming to Europe a bit earlier before attending the Windmill Festival. The Great Remember were going to be huge. So, why didn\u2019t I feel any sense of triumph?</p><p>The next morning, I grabbed my duffel as well as January\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d January greeted me.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Oh, dear!\u201d January suddenly exclaimed.</p><p>My head whipped around toward her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, dropping our bags to the floor. My hands searched her body for injuries.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know how to tell you this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, my heart beating wildly in my chest.</p><p>She eyed me carefully, with pity in her eyes. \u201cFollow me, I need to show you something.\u201d</p><p>I picked our bags up and followed her into the room, prepared to hear her admit to everything, to hear she couldn\u2019t take the burden of the guilt. I sat at the edge of her bed after abandoning the bags on the floor. I looked up at her when the door clicked shut.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you need to show me?\u201d I asked solemnly.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d she whispered, taking my face in her hands and kissing me harshly.</p><p>And like a moth to a flame, I grabbed her and brought her to my body, bringing her on top of me as we laid back on her bed. I kissed her back like there wasn\u2019t going to be a tomorrow, like I wouldn\u2019t get the chance to kiss her like that again.</p><p>She stopped me and brought her face mere inches above mine. \u201cTom,\u201d she said.</p><p>I closed my eyes briefly. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is that\u2019s bothering you. Stop it. You\u2019ll get through it. We\u2019ll get through it.\u201d</p><p>She kissed me again and we made out like that for an hour. I could have done it all day with her. She did love me. She had to. It was in the way she breathed in my mouth when she kissed me, the way she grabbed my shoulders to get as close to me as possible, in the way she reassured me that we\u2019d get through whatever was bothering me. She had no idea the magnitude of my troubles but she said \"we\u2019d get through it.\" There was no way she could betray me. She loved me. She loves me, I kept repeating to myself.</p><p>\u201cI think we missed our train,\u201d she said behind closed eyes, still inching her way up my neck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d I told her. \u201cWe\u2019ll book another room here and go straight to the Windmill Festival tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>We laid like that the rest of the day talking and making me forget the telephone call...sort of.</p><p>Because seeds of doubt are one of those things. They fester and burrow and feed off uncertainties until they\u2019ve grown into one massive tree of shades and shadows that hover over all you've known confidently as the truth. The leaves rustle and whisper in your ear all the everythings you wished to God weren\u2019t true and they are unrepentant, determined to convince you that the doubt is out to get you. And although you scream, \u201cEnough!\u201d Ready to chop that damn tree down, they've somehow hidden your ax. It's nowhere to be found.</p><p>So the doubt swallowed me whole.</p><p>Paris was as we had left it. Beautiful as always, but this time there was a sheen of dishonesty associated, creating a foreboding feeling to permeate my skin. The more I thought about the phone call, the more I realized I couldn\u2019t have heard incorrectly, but maybe I had heard January being used. I thought her too honest, too naive to willingly screw me over. That was not January\u2019s style.</p><p>\u201cBack to the hoodie, I see,\u201d January said, breaking me from my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHuh? Uh, yeah. It\u2019s still a little chilly out.\u201d I tugged the hood of my jacket farther over my face.</p><p>\u201cMmm, hmm,\u201d she hummed under her breath.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t taking the bait. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple of day bands, but I\u2019ve screened them already and I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have I and I concur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want to see a band called Clever. Many of the labels are going to be interested in this one, but I know someone who knows someone who got them to see me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the eff up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, chill, Tom. I was just joshing,\u201d she said, elbowing me softly.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said absently.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they playing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a joint effort by several labels, January. There\u2019ll be media there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedia.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPic ops. I doubt we\u2019ll be put in any of the press, but Jason said we have to dress up anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! I didn\u2019t bring anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason took care of that.\u201d</p><p>January</p> <p>We reached our rooms at ten in the morning and I was only slightly freaking out that I could or could not be photographed and might or might not be put into print, immortalized forever as the slob who obviously dressed from a duffel bag for the largest music festival in Europe, but Tom assured me that Jason had that all figured out so I decided not to freak out...too much.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Tom asked me as I opened my door to him.</p><p>Tom had been acting very strangely, resorting to wearing his hood over his head again and I was slightly concerned at how ice-cold he\u2019d been acting toward me, but I wasn\u2019t going to let this get to me. He would come to me and talk when he was ready.</p><p>\u201cYeah, where are we going?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, handing me a note and a handful of cash before walking off.</p> <p>I peered down at my hands. \u201cWait!\u201d I said laughing. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some business to attend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome business to tend to,\u201d I mocked his deep voice. \u201cSorry little missus, this big man has things to do I wouldn\u2019t tax your tiny lady mind with. I got this.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and rolled his eyes. Condescending jerk. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with the label, January. It\u2019s personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cAll right, can I just come with you then?\u201d I asked, grabbing his hand.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, pulling away, wounding me. \u201cUh,\u201d he said, clearing his throat. \u201cListen, Jason\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I take it you don\u2019t need new threads then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, well, yes, but Jason\u2019s got my measurements. I trust him. I\u2019ve gotta go. Have fun,\u201d he told me before taking off down the corridor.</p><p>I just stared after him, wondering what in the hell crawled up his butt. Then I ogled his rude butt and thought, \"nice ass\" but shook myself and remembered that he needed a swift kick there not an appreciative stare.</p><p>I went back inside, grabbed my purse and hailed a cab.</p><p>\u201cO\u00f9 aller?\u201d the cabbie asked me.</p><p>I looked down at the paper in my hand and almost keeled over in happiness, recognizing the name of one of Paris\u2019 most elite and most gorgeous department stores, Galeries Lafayette.</p><p>Ten stories high, the store can be found on Boulevard Haussmann, and oh my Lord it is just unbelievably decadent. I couldn\u2019t wait to go there. Sometimes working for the label really paid off, but sometimes...</p><p>Le sigh. Oh well.</p> <p>Jason was outside the front doors smoking a cigarette when I pulled up. He reminded me of home. Seeing him, coupled with Tom\u2019s cold demeanor and missing my family like crazy, I unexpectedly burst into tears. I don\u2019t know why I did it. I just needed a friend in that moment it seemed, and it had been weeks since I\u2019d seen a friendly face from home. I was overwhelmed, I suppose. That and I didn\u2019t know what was going on with Tom.</p><p>When Jason saw me he smiled but saw my tear-soaked face and threw down his cigarette. I ran to his arms and threw them around his neck.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jason,\u201d I wailed pathetically in his ear.</p><p>His chest shook with laughter. \u201cOh, January!\u201d He teased.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I said, pulling away while laughing and wiping away my tears.</p><p>Jason pulled me back to him and hugged me harder, making me sigh. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you, January MacLochlainn? Hmm? Why the sour face?\u201d He ran his thumbs underneath my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m just so happy to see you,\u201d I semi-lied.</p><p>\u201cOh, just happy to see me, is it? Could it be you're sick of Tom as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d I admitted not realizing how true that really was. I loved Tom so much, but I wasn\u2019t an imbecile. The way he\u2019d been treating me these past two days was alarming to say the least.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, wrapping his arm around my neck and swinging me toward the doors of the fanciest store I\u2019d ever laid eyes on.</p><p>\u201cWe are going to stick out here like a sore thumb, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we might have one of those \u2018Pretty Woman\u2019 moments.\u201d</p><p>This made me laugh.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, spreading his free arm before us, \u201cimagine it. They\u2019ll look down at you in disdain, perk their noses in the air and say with their haughty French accents, \u2018You are not Lafayette material, miss!\u2019 Then I\u2019ll step in and save the day by flashing my black card. They\u2019ll cower and bow at your feet, kissing your shoes and begging your forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have quite an imagination, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I should have been a writer instead, but I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s no money in it.\u201d</p><p>We stopped and took in the magnificence of the store. It felt like I was standing within a giant Faberg\u00e9 egg. The word opulent came to mind, plenty of times.</p><p>\u201cThe world is your oyster,\u201d Jason said, kissing my temple, making me want to cry again, \u201cand it seems you need it.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to call Tom and run to him, but I also wanted to ignore Tom or find him and slap him in the face. I was a dichotomy of feelings, but one thing was for sure, I needed to talk to him, to get it out there. If he was regretting being with me or telling me he loved me, then I needed to know, so I could get over it and move on. I had more respect for myself than to endure disrespect. I was a MacLochlainn, damn it!</p><p> We went to a few stores but nothing really stuck out at me. It was either too formal or too casual. Jason explained that the festival was usually a light affair, but the first night, if you\u2019re lucky enough to be invited, the labels throw a party at one club hosting several up-and-coming bands and it\u2019s usually a dressy night.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about these stores, Jason. I\u2019m not seeing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty to choose from. You\u2019re just obsessed with price tags. Stop. Just find something you\u2019ll look good in and put it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow eloquently said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know shit about this kind of stuff. Listen, I\u2019m gonna go find some digs for Tom. Find something then I\u2019ll come find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>Perusing the stores was a lot of fun but Jason was right, I was afraid of the price tags.</p><p>\u201cIf Seven doesn\u2019t care, neither do I,\u201d I bolstered myself.</p><p>I called the attention of a woman in a store full of couture, but she didn\u2019t shy away from me. In fact, she was extraordinarily kind and seemed excited to help me. She told me I was the perfect model for the clothes in her store, but somehow I doubted that. I told her to work her magic and an hour later, Jason found me with a few new things in hand, including a few essentials that I believe I would have rather died than buy in front of Jason but I had no choice.</p><p> \u201cWhat is this, La Femme Nikita?\u201d he asked, picking the lacy object up with one finger.</p><p>I shoved it all down back on the counter and knew the blush that burned my face would take days to calm down.</p><p>\u201cJason, I swear. Don\u2019t embarrass me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, kitten,\u201d he smiled. \u201cMwar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you\u2019re never going to let me live this down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. In fact, I might just rub it in Tom\u2019s face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would that affect Tom?\u201d I asked, prying. Does Jason know?</p><p>\u201cOh nothing,\u201d he dodged.</p><p>The woman wrapped my things and we walked out of there with one dress that probably cost more than my entire wardrobe. My mother would kill me if she knew.</p><p>Jason dropped me off at the hotel and when I reached my room, I dropped my things inside before knocking on Tom\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cTom?\u201d I asked the door as I rapped lightly with my knuckles but there was no answer.</p><p>I sighed in frustration, and thought it was probably a good idea to take a nice long bath in my room\u2019s huge tub before I got ready for the evening.</p><p>I showered and shaved first, then soaked for at least an hour and almost fell asleep the water was so warm and the tub so deep. When I got out, I\u2019d never been so clean. I rubbed the condensation away from the mirror and took a good long look.</p><p>\u201cRight, you\u2019re a mess, January.\u201d That\u2019s when I realized. I had absolutely no curling iron or straightener or even a blow dryer to my name. I started to panic before remembering a salon downstairs. I rang Jason to ask him if I could charge a mani and pedi as well as a styling and he approved without thinking. I\u2019m sure he had no idea how much it all would cost. I was positive I\u2019d be fired over the whole thing but Jason was so blas\u00e9, I decided I could be as well.</p><p>I threw on a pair of yoga pants and a button-down and headed downstairs. In French, I told the lady I needed \"the works\" and she understood the American idiom. Maybe it was universal. I decided I didn\u2019t need to do anything too crazy with my hair and opted to leave it down and in large, loose curls. I have to admit I allowed them to go a bit insane with my makeup, especially on the eyes, but it was a night out and I didn\u2019t want to feel like my dreary usual self.</p><p>My dress was black, super short, and insanely sexy and the last thing I needed was for someone to whisper \"it\u2019s too much.\" I thought the dress was still a bit over the top, in fact, but the sales girl assured me I looked great in it and it was just understated enough so I trusted her. I was doing that a lot, giving everyone carte blanche, but lately the check was proving bad. Hopefully, the girl hadn\u2019t steered me wrong.</p><p> When all was said and done, I had to admit I looked pretty damn hot. I walked away from the salon feeling like a brand-new woman, heading straight for an empty room probably down the hall from yet another presumably empty room belonging to the elusive Thomas Eriksson. I was tripping myself out. I felt bipolar. One minute I was high as a kite, the next, I was down in the dumps. Don\u2019t let a guy make you feel like that, January, especially one who claims he loves you. Rise up, girl! I decided I was going to have fun that night even if I had to beg Jason to be my date.</p><p>At nine o\u2019clock that night I was ready, dress on, makeup, hair, and nails done. I stood in front of the mirror and did a double take at the reflection. I was staring at one sexy mama and I felt really damn good about that. I smiled at myself.</p><p>Knock! Knock!</p><p>I jumped at the sound at the door. Time to pay the piper, Tom. He was going to eat his actions if I had to stuff them down his throat with the painfully gorgeous heels strapped around my feet.</p><p>I flung the door open but my carefully constructed smile fell at my knees when I saw who it was.</p><p>\u201cJesus, January,\u201d Jonah told me, eyeing me up and down.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Jonah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to escort you. Jason sent me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason sent you?\u201d I asked, shocked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, apparently Tom is too busy to take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Here,\u201d he said, offering me his cell phone. It was already ringing Jason.</p><p>\u201cYo!\u201d I heard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJason? Jonah is taking me to the club tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, clearing his throat uncomfortably. Something was up. \u201cUh, Tom is indisposed. He said he\u2019ll see you here.\u201d</p><p>I hung up. \u201cThat son of a...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jonah asked, a devious smile on his face.</p> <p>\u201cShut up, Jonah. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my bag and stuck in a few essentials before letting the door click behind me.</p><p>\u201cGood God, January,\u201d he began. \u201cI gotta admit, you\u2019ve got to be one of the sexiest women ever. You\u2019re making me think twice about my girl back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClassy, Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit. You are smoking hot. What would you say...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop!\u201d I said, holding up my hand to get away from his slime. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mess with you if we were the last two people on Earth and our need to procreate was the difference between the continuation of the world or not. That\u2019s how much I hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not, Jonah. Take me to the club and leave me the hell alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeisty little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh! You are beyond creepy.\u201d</p><p>When we reached downstairs, there was a car waiting for which I was eternally grateful. The club was only two blocks but I didn\u2019t think I could survive my heels much less Jonah\u2019s incessant come-ons.</p> <p>We pulled up to the club and true to Tom\u2019s word, there were paparazzi, their cameras flashing at an astronomical rate. I was so freaking nervous, I could vomit. Jonah started to exit the cab but I pushed him back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think for a second you\u2019re exiting this car in front of me. You\u2019re going to let me leave, then you're going to circle the block so no one knows we rode together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jonah admitted too easily, sitting back.</p><p>I stepped out of the car and shut the door behind me, ensuring Jonah wasn\u2019t following. The clicks of lights were blinding and took a moment to become accustomed to. I followed the walk in front of me slowly so as not to trip and made a beeline for the entrance but was stopped short just a few feet into the promotional backdrop. Photographers clambered my direction and insisted on a picture. Fine, I thought, give them a picture to shut them up. They won\u2019t publish a nobody.</p><p>I posed as best I could and moved but was stopped again...and again and again. Finally, I made it to the door and broke the threshold feeling part exhilarated, part terrified. Either way I was glad it was over.</p><p>Thomas</p><p>I sat just behind the door not expecting to see January for at least an hour. I wasn\u2019t keeping an eye out for her...All right, I was definitely keeping my eye out for her, but I was also doing my job, waiting for one band in particular that I recommended for tonight\u2019s performance and I was eager to talk with them. In other words, eager to get Jonah away from them.</p><p>That\u2019s when I saw her and literally lost my balance resting against the door. I scrambled for some semblance of cool but couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away.</p> <p>\u201cOh Jesus,\u201d I heard behind me.</p><p>I turned to find Jason. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, knowing full well what he meant and who he meant it for.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I told him, staring after the most breathtakingly beautiful woman I\u2019d ever seen in person and Christ was she a natural at it. She looked supremely uncomfortable, but I was willing to bet I was the only one who would have been able to tell that in the way she held her arms a little stiffer than usual.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re in love with her,\u201d Jason said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I said without reservation, still staring at her.</p><p>\u201cThis time it\u2019s real,\u201d Jason said, folding his arms and leaning against the wall next to me.</p><p>\u201cI know it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the hell have her come here alone?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d I offered, not really sure what to say.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in love with you too,\u201d he said, trying to get my attention but I still was unable to tear my eyes away.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell she\u2019s not,\u201d he told me. \u201cI was with her all day and I know January. She\u2019s in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, with Jonah,\u201d I said, not really knowing if that was true.</p><p>Jason laughed so loud it caught the attention of one of the security guards at the entrance. \u201cThat\u2019s rich,\u201d he said, sucking in a breath. \u201cMy God, you really are the world\u2019s biggest fool.\u201d He walked away, shaking his head, and muttering, \u201cWhat an idiot.\u201d</p><p>January was approaching the end of the walkway so I sank into the shadows a bit and watched her break the threshold. She brought the backs of her hands to her flushed cheeks and smiled to herself, but her expression quickly turned to worry and what looked a little like determination. I never wanted to touch someone so badly as I did January in that moment. I fisted my hands at my side, bolstering myself with the memory of that phone call. I needed to talk to her about it but tonight was not the night. We had a job to do and it needed to be done before Jonah showed up. That R&amp;D spot was mine.</p><p>Inside, the club was noisy and ridiculously crowded and I lost January pretty quickly but somehow found Jason again.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen January since she\u2019s come in? I need her to be there when the band shows up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d he said, taking a swig of a dark liquid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to look around then. I might have to meet the band without her.\u201d</p><p>Jason was called to the bar for some kind of alcohol emergency and had to leave me to myself. I scanned the crowd below me and tried to see through the smoky, dark room. Intermittent laserlike lights would cascade over the heads of the club patrons and would highlight randomly, allowing me to see for short periods of time. My second sweep across the floor provided me a glimpse of her and my eyes strained to see through the fog so I inched closer and got the biggest surprise of my life.</p><p>January. Hugging Jonah.</p><p>My heart pounded severely against my ribs and my mouth went dry. I gripped the handle of the railing and leaned over as much as I could without falling to my death.</p><p>What a traitorous bitch, I thought to myself. My heart turned to mush inside my chest and for the first time in years I wanted to cry. Well, if I wanted to know what it really felt like to lose the love of your life, the one person truly made for me, I\u2019ve definitely gotten my fucking wish. I scrubbed my hands over my face and through my hair. They were unsure what to do with themselves. I\u2019ve got a job for you, I told my hands as they fisted into white knuckles. I pushed myself from the railing and booked it down the stairs into the belly of the beast. I\u2019d lost sight of them through the undulating crowd so I pushed through without regard for the guests around me.</p><p>I broke through close enough to catch another glimpse of them but stopped cold when I saw she wasn\u2019t hugging Jonah, she was shoving Jonah, fighting his roaming hands and crying. The adrenaline hit me like an atomic bomb, realizing I was the biggest dumbass in the world. She wasn\u2019t the traitor, I was. I was so quick to think ill of her, afraid that I\u2019d get hurt, that I was willing to jump to ridiculous conclusions, despite the fact that January hadn\u2019t ever done anything for me to distrust her so wholly.</p><p>I pushed harder and with new vigor. I needed to get to her. She needed me and I hadn\u2019t been there for her. My heart tore in two, aggravating an already ragged wound. I\u2019d been the betrayer, not the betrayed. I felt sick to my stomach as I made my way through the thick group of people.</p><p>\u201cGet off of me!\u201d I heard her scream, tears streaming down her face. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary!\u201d I yelled but she couldn\u2019t hear me over the pounding bass. \u201cJanuary!\u201d I tried again but it did no good.</p><p>I felt like I was making no progress. I was failing her. No one around her noticed her predicament except me and I was failing her. Her arms were red and swollen from his mishandling her and I couldn\u2019t fucking get to her!</p><p>Suddenly, I heard faint but gut-wrenching screams come from the direction of the DJ booth and everyone\u2019s heads whipped that direction.</p><p>\u201cFeu!\u201d I kept hearing, the panicky words screaming from invisible lips. I had no idea the meaning until I saw January\u2019s eyes had grown round in her head. She searched the crowd around her and her eyes fell on me.</p><p>\u201cFire!\u201d She screamed at me.</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cJanuary! Come to me!\u201d I yelled at her as Jonah fled, cowardly leaving her there to fend for herself.</p><p>I reached my hands toward her and she extended her arms, desperation lacing her expression. We pushed and strained for one another, the tips of her right hand brushed mine and for the first time, I felt slightly relieved that she was close to my possession. I grabbed for her, but her grip escaped mine just when I thought I had her. No! I pushed and tossed people away from me but the panicked cloud of people clambering for the nearest exit seemed to swell in numbers and January was too light to fight back. Every time I made an advance, people would push her back.</p><p>\u201cHelp me!\u201d She screamed, making my heart wrench.</p><p>\u201cMove!\u201d I hopelessly yelled at the people in front of me, but it did no good. My stomach dropped to my feet. January was swallowed whole and I was helpless to watch. I\u2019d failed her. Completely.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>All the Pretty Girls</p><p>Thomas</p><p>I followed the direction I thought she was being pulled as black, billowing smoke engulfed the massive ceiling of the club. I had maybe a minute. People\u2019s piercing screams haunted my ears as I spun around feebly in frenzied haste.</p><p> \u201cJanuary!\u201d I hysterically called out. My body was begging me to run, to act, to save, but I couldn\u2019t see her, fear locking up every ounce of common sense.</p><p>The crowd was thinning out and I breathed a slight sigh of relief, hoping I\u2019d get to her. The smoke was becoming so thick and lower to the ground, I had to bring my shirt over my mouth. It didn\u2019t help much and I began to choke and cough as I inhaled the charred remains of the building burning down around me. The heat was becoming unbearable but I was determined to find her. I would have died before I left her in that club.</p><p>I frantically searched the people around me, gripping them as I went and ensuring they weren\u2019t January. I went from person to person until the black cut off my view and two hands reached for me.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I told the person dragging me toward what I assumed was some sort of exit. \u201cNo!\u201d I exclaimed, pushing back but they succeeded in pushing me into the night air. I coughed and gagged as I reached soil and fresh air but immediately got back up, determined to find her.</p><p>The fireman who pulled me out, pushed me toward the crowd, unwilling to let me back in. \u201cJanuary!\u201d I yelled at the building, begging her to come out.</p><p>I immediately turned toward the crowd surrounding the burning building and searched for her face. I hysterically wound my way through the throngs of stunned faces calling out her name.</p><p>\u201cTom!\u201d I heard to my left and ran toward the voice.</p><p>\u201cJason!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhere\u2019s January?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! Help me find her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got out pretty early,\u201d he told me as we weaved our way back through the gathering. \u201cI didn\u2019t see her come out, Tom.\u201d His own voice was struck with fear she hadn\u2019t come out.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d I told him confidently, desperately. \u201cShe has to be here.\u201d I was trying so hard to hold on to that. My blood began to run cold as we reached the edge of people with no sign of January. \u201cShe\u2019s here. She\u2019s here.\u201d I repeated over and over.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Jason said, pacing the outside of the crowd. \u201cWe must have missed her. We had to have.\u201d</p> <p>My body began to shake in trepidation, in terror. I noticed a police cruiser nearby and ran to it. The back doors were open and I noticed a bullhorn sitting on the floorboard in front. I ran to the passenger\u2019s side and opened the door, grabbing the horn. My trembling hands fumbled with the on switch and I numbly tried to work the buttons. I leaped onto the hood of the car and peered over the crowd.</p><p>\u201cJanuary!\u201d I yelled as everyone\u2019s shocked expressions turned my direction. \u201cJanuary MacLochlainn, are you there?!\u201d</p><p>People began to search around themselves, searching for the name I\u2019d just called out, but there was no answer and the dread began to run icy in my veins.</p><p>\u201cJanuary?\u201d I asked them. \u201cPlease,\u201d I begged as horror slowly thread through my words. \u201cJanuary, please. Please, answer me.\u201d</p><p>But nothing.</p> <p>My eyes searched rapidly but my body shuddered at the realization that she wasn\u2019t there. The bullhorn slipped from my fingers, tumbling to the cobblestone below. Women surrounding the car drank in my shaking body and knew what the silent response meant. Many of their hands went to their mouths, a recognition of my supposed loss. The sight of their conclusions made me want to vomit. I jumped from the hood and ran smack into Jason who stood there, drawing the same conclusion of those around me.</p><p>\u201cShe just couldn\u2019t hear me,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, but his glassy eyes betrayed his words.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I pleaded. \u201cShe\u2019s here. She\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d he said quietly, placing his hand on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I said, throwing it off, but my body shut down and I was forced to drop to my knees. \u201cShe\u2019s here. She\u2019s got to be. She\u2019s got to be.\u201d</p> <p>An ambulance blew by and the hope that\u2019d been dying in my chest roared back to life.</p><p>\u201cThe hospital,\u201d I told the ground.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Jason said, dragging me to my feet.</p><p>We ran up the block and hailed a passing cab. Jason told the driver to take us to the nearest hospital using his pocket translator. I was relieved we were moving but no matter how fast we were moving, it still wasn\u2019t fast enough for me and I sat at the edge of my seat, hunched over the window, staring at the traffic ahead. My knee bounced at an ungodly pace.</p><p>I examined Jason\u2019s face quickly, noting that neither of us seemed to have inhaled any smoke. Our mouths and noses were clear of black unlike a few I saw back at the club. I thanked God for small favors.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be there,\u201d Jason said, reassuring me.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, but not as confidently as I\u2019d have liked.</p><p>I rubbed the palms of my hands together quickly and silently prayed that she would be there. We pulled up to the entrance of the hospital and jumped from the cab, leaving Jason to handle the transaction. I ran through the emergency doors and frantically searched the blackened faces of those who\u2019d already arrived, but none of them matched my January\u2019s. My heart flipped in my chest.</p> <p> I ran up to a nurse. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Do you speak English?\u201d</p><p>She gave me a sympathetic smile and searched around the desk around her, finding a girl sitting at a desk nearby. She grabbed the girl\u2019s sleeve and said something in French. The girl jumped up and took in my sooty clothing.</p><p> \u201cYes? I speak English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God! I\u2019m looking for a girl. She was in the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary MacLochlainn,\u201d I told her.</p><p>The girl typed on her keyboard and began shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but there is no one here by that name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked in disbelief. \u201cAre you sure? Can you check again?\u201d I asked, my body back to trembling status but this time in exponential form.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said and typed yet again. The expression on her face told me she\u2019d gotten the same result.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, sir. I have no one by that name. Can you describe her for me? There were several patients who couldn't be identified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, she was wearing a black dress,\u201d I told the nurse. \u201cShe\u2019s about five ten, or, uh, two meters tall, long brown hair, green eyes.\u201d She\u2019s amazing, unselfish, intelligent, sexy as hell. Her mere existence justifies mine.</p><p>\u201cJust a moment,\u201d she said and ran to the back.</p><p>Jason came up to me, his eyes asking me the news.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have anyone in their system with January\u2019s name,\u201d I explained, feeling like my body was on autopilot. \u201cShe\u2019s checking the patients who couldn\u2019t be identified.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded.</p><p>I nervously paced the length of the receiving desk, running my fingers through the length of my hair over and over. Jason sat in a nearby chair, his thumbs drumming his thighs. Both our gazes were riveted by the doors for what felt like hours before the nurse came through with a smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d she told us.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Jason told me, slapping his hands to his face.</p><p>The worry, anxiety and helplessness I\u2019d felt for the past hour came flooding from my body and I collapsed to the floor, unable to hold myself up. She weakened me in every way possible.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d I whispered to the tile below me. My eyes filled with unshed tears and I fought to keep them in. I needed to see her.</p><p>Jason helped me as I struggled to my feet.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d I asked when I had control of myself.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in a room and resting comfortably. She was burned slightly on the hip and is awaiting a physician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see her?</p><p> \u201cAre you her spouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, her- boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but you\u2019ll have to wait here until she\u2019s released then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, falling into a chair by the ER entrance.</p><p>Jason sat beside me.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Jason said simply beside me but the emotions of our ordeal were packed into the name.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, my body still trembling from the adrenaline.</p><p>We were silent for a few minutes, trying to recover from the worry.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was going to lose...\u201d I began to say but couldn\u2019t finish, choking on my words.</p><p>\u201cTom, it\u2019s cool now,\u201d Jason offered when I didn\u2019t continue.</p><p>I breathed deeply and let it out slowly. \u201cI almost had her in there, Jason. I had her fingers in my hands but wasn\u2019t able to save her. I\u2019ve failed her so miserably. I\u2019m so ashamed of myself.</p><p>\u201cIf I had trusted her the way I should have from the beginning, I would have escorted her there instead of making her attend alone, making her search me out alone, making her save herself...alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t beat yourself up, Tom. How would you have known the place was going to light up like the Fourth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can and I will. I let my past affect my future and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t do that. I feel like a coward.\u201d</p><p>January</p><p>I was shivering cold in that hospital bed. The temperature coupled with the fact that I was burned and that my adrenaline was starting to wear off was making me shiver. When the nurse came in to tell me that Tom and Jason were out front and looking for me, I felt such extraordinary relief that they were okay that I started to cry, but that didn\u2019t mean I wanted to see Tom or even Jason for that matter.</p><p>Everything culminating in that moment before the fire was overwhelming and everything after was just plain cumbersome. Tears were the only relief I was being afforded in that moment because the hospital was busy I\u2019d discovered after I\u2019d woken and I was at the bottom of the priority totem pole. I\u2019d have to wait for pain relief.</p><p>The burn wasn\u2019t that bad. I\u2019d probably have a little bit of a scar there but not much else. My dress wasn\u2019t stuck to my body or anything. I\u2019d been pushed against a railing near the source of the fire and couldn\u2019t pull myself away because the crowd was edging me against it. I was one of the first out and therefore sent to the hospital immediately after being checked for injuries.</p><p>About an hour after, I was aware that Tom was waiting for me, they moved my gurney out into the hall to treat some of the more pressing patients. It was another two hours before they saw and treated my minor burn. At four thirty in the morning, they discharged me right there in the hallway and not a moment too soon as I was getting ready to curse them out in French and walk out on my own.</p><p>I needed to decide what I was going to do about Tom. To be honest with you, I didn\u2019t even want to see his face. I wanted to walk right past him, flip him the bird for being so screwy with me and then head to my uncle\u2019s in Ireland. I knew I would quit that lousy job if I saw Jason within five feet of me but also knew that would be a bad idea. I needed the money. I needed the connections. One thing I could definitely not compromise though was working with Thomas Eriksson ever again.</p><p>Tom\u2019s treating me with such distance was one thing, something I could forgive. His leaving me to fend for myself at the club was something he would have needed a damn good excuse for and probably something I would have been able to listen to, but my near-death experience blew that chance right out the door.</p><p>My heart stopped in my chest. The decision had come without any consideration as to what it would do to my well-being. My brain wanted nothing to do with Tom any longer, but my heart screamed for me to run to him.</p><p>No, you\u2019ve listened to your heart so much, January. It\u2019s time to be sensible. He\u2019s repeatedly shown you that he doesn\u2019t care for you the way you care for him. He\u2019s obviously still in love with Kelly. He\u2019s pulling away out of guilt.</p><p>I stood up and removed my hospital gown in the bathroom, replacing it with my sooty, torn couture masterpiece. Oh well. I walked with purpose out the double doors and into the lobby.</p><p>One foot in front of the other one, I deliberately avoided eye contact with the lobby and burst through the front doors of the ER. Just when my stomach was settling the worry Tom would find me, I heard his voice, making my heart jump into my throat.</p><p>\u201cJanuary?\u201d he asked groggily. Not a word from me, brother.</p><p>I hailed a passing cab but he didn\u2019t stop. Jerk.</p><p>\u201cJanuary, are you okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I sighed. Loudly. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Thanks for asking,\u201d I told him, an arm raised for an oncoming cab.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cAs far away from you as I can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cJanuary, please just hear me out. I-I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked at him, a slight sarcastic smile on my face. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m done with this toxic shit, Tom. I don\u2019t know what your problem is, frankly I don\u2019t care, but it\u2019s enough for me to realize that I better get out now, suffer the heartache and give myself a chance to find someone who won\u2019t ditch me or treat me like crap without talking to me about whatever\u2019s bothering him. I don\u2019t trust you anymore.\u201d</p><p>The cab pulled up beside me and I opened the door. Tom\u2019s hand came crushing over the edge, shutting it tight.</p><p>\u201cDrive on!\u201d He told the driver and the cab sped away.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d I yelled in his face, not in the mood for his games.</p> <p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cJust listen to me for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way in hell.\u201d I used the classic women\u2019s \"don\u2019t fuck with me\" expression and he backed off a bit. I held up my hand for the next oncoming cab and it pulled up beside me. \u201cYou must mistake me for a sucker, Tom. I know exactly what\u2019s going on. You want out. You regret your time with me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He began but I cut him off with my hand.</p><p>\u201cListen, I get it. You\u2019re not over Kelly. You\u2019re feeling guilty about lying. You don\u2019t really love me and you don\u2019t want to lead me on. I\u2019ve experienced this exact thing before. God, how I\u2019ve experienced this same phenomenon over and over.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cWhatever. I may not be the keepable type, but I will be okay without you, Tom.\u201d</p><p>And with those parting words, I left Tom slack-mouthed on the walk, closing the door behind me and giving the cabbie the name of the hotel. Tom began yelling at the cab and slamming his hands on the trunk, but I told the cabbie to step on it. I was going to be gone before he\u2019d even know what happened and not a moment too soon either. I needed a place to hunker down for a while and hopefully ease the trouble I felt already brewing in my chest. I needed a reprieve from the impending doom and there was no better place than Donovan\u2019s.</p> <p>The two-hour flight from Paris to Cork was excruciating. The more I tried to hold back the tears, the more they wanted to burn past my lids. My chest constricted with every breath I took. So this is what real heartache is. I finally understood why Tom became so bitter. There was nothing in the entire world like that feeling. Death would have been so much easier.</p><p>Donovan met me at the airport and I can honestly say I\u2019ve never been so happy to see anyone in my life. The second I came within reach, I grabbed for him.</p><p> \u201cDonny,\u201d I said quietly, the tears already streaming down my face.</p><p>\u201cAh, lass,\u201d he breathed out harshly. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, hugging me tightly, \u201clet\u2019s get to Killarney. You can tell me everythin\u2019 on the way.\u201d</p><p>The hourlong drive to Killarney provided barely enough time to let Donny in on the whole deal. He wasn\u2019t aware of the fire because I hadn\u2019t told anyone, not even my parents or siblings and he almost flipped out. What\u2019s the point in worrying them? I reassured him that it was just a minor burn and that over-the-counter meds would alleviate the pain, that\u2019s how minor it was.</p><p>Donny\u2019s street was a series of shops all connected into one seemingly long building with different facades peppering each shop. Donny lived above his own. The tears came down stronger at the sight of his little blue door.</p> <p>\u201cOh now, stop it, love. It\u2019ll all be okay,\u201d Donny tried to soothe me.</p><p>I entered Donny\u2019s shop and sprinted up the stairs to his tiny apartment, bursting through the door and toppling onto his sofa.</p><p>\u201cWhat the heavens!\u201d I heard from the kitchen</p><p>I turned onto my back but kept the accent pillow at my face. In a sobbing voice, I said, \u201cHi, Aunt Briann.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that my January?\u201d she said, her singsong voice making me lose it more.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I wailed.</p><p>\u201cOh, my pet.\u201d She came to sit on the sofa arm and started rubbing my hair. \u201cDonny told me a bit before he left. I\u2019m sorry, love.\u201d She lifted me up by the shoulders. \u201cCome on, January, let\u2019s get to your room. You can lie a bit and I\u2019ll wake you for dinner. I\u2019ll get the rest from your uncle while you rest.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and she kissed my cheek because she couldn\u2019t reach my forehead. Aunt Briann was exceedingly beautiful and kind as hell. I don\u2019t know how surly Donny got her.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Briann.\u201d</p><p>Thomas</p><p>That cheeky wench had stunned me silent in front of that hospital. I\u2019d been forced to gather my wits, but apparently I wasn\u2019t quick enough to catch her before she sped away. Jason informed me that night that January was on \"vacation\" in Killarney and that she\u2019d return to New York City at the end of the week.</p><p>\u201cThe hell!\u201d I told Jason as I packed my shit for a one-way flight to Cork.</p><p>\u201cI thought Kelly\u2019s wedding was tomorrow,\u201d he said as I stuffed everything in my duffel.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to miss it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to swing by Killarney for Miss Assumption first and pick her up.\u201d Jason cleared his throat at my glaringly obvious contradiction. \u201cDon\u2019t even start. I\u2019m going to apologize for that,\u201d I told him.</p><p>I\u2019d informed Jason of everything that had gone on between January and me, including the phone call. \"You\u2019re an idiot,\" he\u2019d simply told me. \"I know,\" I\u2019d admitted. That was the end of that.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you at the wedding?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, with January in tow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>I rented a car in Cork and drove straight through to Killarney, reaching January\u2019s uncle\u2019s door at two in the morning. I parked quickly and at a weird angle, hoping to God no one attempted to drive down the narrow street, and started pounding on Donovan\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cJanuary!\u201d I yelled. \u201cJanuary! Open up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that poundin\u2019!\u201d A neighbor yelled from his window a few homes down.</p><p>\u201cJanuary!\u201d I yelled, ignoring him. I repeatedly pounded again and again, desperate to see her.</p><p>The door whipped open just when I thought I couldn\u2019t take another second. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d A disheveled January asked me. God, she was glorious to look at!</p><p>She pulled me inside and closed the door. Her eyes were red and made me want to kick my own ass.</p><p> \u201cJanuary,\u201d I began, but she cut me off with a finger to her lips.</p><p>\u201cQuiet, my aunt and uncle are asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I reached for her but thought better of it and reigned my hands back in. \u201cPlease, January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Tom?\u201d she asked, folding her arms across her attractive chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to explain to you what has been happening to me these past few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we already covered this,\u201d she spit out.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, growing peeved. \u201cListen to me. Just let me explain, damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she gritted.</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop! Just let me say this.\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything, so I continued. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, but I need your forgiveness because I\u2019m going to admit something I\u2019m really ashamed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she answered in hesitation.</p><p>She took a step back, wounding me, but I continued. \u201cI, uh, I listened in on a conversation you had on the phone a few nights ago and I made some assumptions. I thought you were working with Jonah, letting him know our exact location. I thought you were two-timing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never do that,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d I confessed. \u201cI should have come to you about it, but I was so angry and felt so betrayed, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you made me go to Reine alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>Tears sprang to her eyes and I reached for her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, holding up her hands to stop me, breaking my heart. \u201cLet me get this straight. You thought I was giving away our locations to that asshole and instead of coming to me and asking me about it, you assumed I was that untrustworthy, that my proclamation that I loved you was just bullshit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s shitty, I know, January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, laughing sarcastically. \u201cWhat\u2019s shitty is that you thought I could fake all that. That every moment we\u2019d ever shared on the road was not genuine.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThat makes me sick to my stomach, Tom.\u201d</p><p>She ran her hands across her belly and stepped back. She wanted distance. I took hold of her, panicked she was about to say what I thought she was about to say.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said.</p><p>She brought her tear-filled eyes to mine. \u201cBut you already did. When you assumed I could be the type of person to do that, you admitted you didn\u2019t know me at all. How can you claim to love someone you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I told her, hugging her tighter, willing her to forgive me. \u201cDon\u2019t, January. Please, I\u2019m sorry. So, so sorry. Please,\u201d I begged, \u201cI couldn\u2019t survive if you broke my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she said, openly bawling. \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough.\u201d</p><p>Crying, she began to push me toward the door, but I refused to move. I just couldn\u2019t accept that it was over. I refused to acknowledge it.</p><p>She stood tall and stepped back from me. \u201cGet out,\u201d she whispered, continuing backward.</p><p>I watched as she inched her way to the stairwell and disappeared up the stairs. I was unmovable in the moment, my heart shattered at my feet and the one person capable of assembling the shards back into a working organ once more wanted nothing to do with me. And I deserved it.</p><p>I shuffled my leaden feet across the shop floor, closed the door behind me...</p><p>And pulled my hood over my head.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>This Too Shall Pass</p><p>New York City</p><p>Kelly\u2019s Wedding</p><p>Thomas</p><p>I walked into that wedding without a moment to spare. I say walked. I dragged my ass is more like it. Dragged because my body may as well have weighed as much as the Brooklyn Bridge for all the motivation I had to get out of bed.</p><p>Because January left me. She fucking left me and it was all my fault. For the first time in my entire life, I knew what it truly meant to be in love with someone, to know exactly who you\u2019re meant to be with, and never having a chance in hell of reconciling what you never intended to fuck up.</p><p>I found my family and squeezed in next to Harper while the organ played.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus! You scared me!\u201d Harper said, grasping her chest. She hugged me fiercely and kissed my cheek. A small tear escaped her eye. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you, friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d I said, hugging her back.</p><p>I stood and hugged all my friends, lingering a bit at Cherry.</p><p>\u201cMy lovely Cherry, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never been happier to see you in all my life,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut you look like shit.\u201d She peered around me. \u201cWhere\u2019s your girl, baby?\u201d The expression on my face must have revealed it all and her smile fell. I shook my head. \u201cOh, Tommy. It\u2019ll be okay. Let me help you fix this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be fixed,\u201d I whispered as Callum slapped my shoulder in greeting.</p><p>\u201cMy God, Tom. I\u2019ve found it very difficult to handle these women without you. We\u2019ve taken a vote. You can\u2019t leave again.\u201d</p><p>This made me smile but it was unpracticed and he could tell something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been dumped,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Harper approached our little pow-wow and grabbed her husband\u2019s hand, making my chest constrict at the idea that January and I could have been just like them. Perfect.</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d Harper yells, before bringing her voice back down. \u201cWhat the devil, Tom? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have.\u201d</p><p>Cherry wound her arm through mine and brought me close to her side. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fix it, Tom.\u201d</p><p>She said it so confidently, I almost believed her.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harper agreed just as strongly. \u201cIt must be a mistake. Thomas Eriksson doesn\u2019t get dumped. Girls should clamor in line to be with you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her but couldn\u2019t answer. Truth be told, I\u2019d buried myself the second I didn\u2019t trust January the way she deserved to be. I let my old cynical self take over and although I promised her I\u2019d be good to her, I\u2019d failed her.</p><p>Callum looked on his wife and kissed her temple. You could tell he was proud of her, of her loyalty. She was amazing. All the girls were. I\u2019d need them to help me survive.</p><p>\u201cEnough about me, lovelies. This is Kelly\u2019s day. Let\u2019s not detract from her.\u201d I was obviously deflecting and they knew it but decided to let it go...for then.</p><p>The ceremony was beautiful as was the bride. I reveled in the fact that six months prior I wouldn\u2019t have even considered showing up the day of the wedding, let alone being lovesick, for real, for an entirely different girl. I laughed to myself as I gazed on Kelly walking down the aisle and felt nothing more than admiration for a very good friend. Then I thought of January and imagined it was her timing her steps on the arm of her father. That idea sent a new wave of hurt to emanate through my chest and heart.</p><p>That was the moment I knew January should have been my very own bride. The thought of her marching toward another made me queasy and I had to grip the pew in front of me for support.</p> <p>The next night, we all sat around Cherry\u2019s deck. (Charlie\u2019s apartment was now known as Cherry\u2019s. That\u2019s always how those things go, I think.) We were all drinking, except for Carter and Kelly of course, as they\u2019d left for Fiji that morning. I couldn\u2019t help but feel a small sense of peace around my extended family. Harper sat on Callum\u2019s lap as they laughed as some private joke. Charlie slowly danced with Cherry. Marty, Aaron, Nat, Jared and Josiah all sat around singing, passing a bottle of wine around. Freddy, Sam, Cross and SO were inside playing a serious game of Scrabble.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t happy, but I was as close as I was going to get to feeling a semblance of normality. Yeah, in order for you to avoid going over the deep end, dude, you\u2019re going to have to move in with your married friends. You\u2019re fucking pathetic.</p><p>A buzzing, ringing sound interrupted my thoughts. My phone. I barely recognized the ringtone; I hadn\u2019t used it in so long. I dug it out of my pocket and pulled down my hoodie to answer, not bothering to check who it was.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYo, it\u2019s Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, J. What are you up to?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. Not a good sign. \u201cNothing, man. I just needed to talk to you. Are you at Cherry\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Just say whatever it is you have to say.\u201d My gut clenched in preparation.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d really feel better if-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason, don\u2019t effing make me wait. Just spit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey gave Jonah the position.\u201d</p><p>Of course they did.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were a lot of deciding factors-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the bullshit, Jason. You and I are friends, good friends at that. No need to give me the whole song and dance after ten years. Now come over and pick me up. We\u2019re going out. And bring a bottle of Jack for later.\u201d</p><p>When you can\u2019t have what you want, drinking always helps...kind of. Not really. But who the hell cares.</p><p>I kissed the girls goodbye when Jason rang me from downstairs. \u201cBye, Cherry Bomb,\u201d I said to her at the door, but she pulled me in for a last minute pep talk.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid, Tommy Boy. You\u2019ll regret it and you\u2019ll spin down a shame spiral the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen. I know you, and right now, you\u2019re hellbent on causing irreparable damage. Just stop and think, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try, Cher,\u201d I said, kissing her forehead but even I knew that was a lie.</p><p> I took the stairs to the lobby and hopped in the cab with Jason. \u201cLet\u2019s get shitfaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what the doctor ordered,\u201d Jason said, pulling out a bottle of Jack from the floorboard. \u201cLet\u2019s drop this off at my pad and then hit the city.\u201d</p><p>After dropping the liquor off at Jason\u2019s, we headed to Soho.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make some bad decisions,\u201d Jason said, clapping his hands together as we took two stools at the bar.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, feeling uncomfortable already. I needed to drown that feeling out pronto.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be?\u201d the bartender asked.</p><p>\u201cScotch, McEwan's,\u201d Jason said, ordering for me.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I protested, an image of January in Dublin coming to the front of my mind. \u201cNo.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cUh, two shots of Patron, please.\u201d</p><p>The bartender nodded.</p><p>Six shots later and I was starting to lose sensation in my gums. This was a good thing. I needed to forget, needed the torn and gaping hole in my effing chest to feel numb. Jason was dancing with a girl on the other side of the bar and all I could think was that I needed to keep drinking.</p><p>\u201cIs this seat taken?\u201d a gorgeous blonde asked me.</p><p>\u201cGo \u2019head,\u201d I slurred.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPatron,\u201d I told her.</p><p>My forearms had permanent dents in them from resting so harshly against the wooden bar top. She leaned into me slightly and I pushed them in further.</p><p>\u201cIs that your friend over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dancing with my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you dancing?\u201d she asked, leading.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the dancing type.\u201d That wasn\u2019t true. For January, I was.</p><p>\u201cCan I get a Patron for my friend here?\u201d she asked the bartender.</p><p>She stood so I could get full view of her figure. She was beautiful, very, yet she was nothing.</p><p>\u201cI can buy my own drinks,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve obviously been through something.\u201d She sidled even closer and I was too drunk to keep her off. \u201cIt\u2019s written all over your face,\u201d she whispered closely. Her sickly sweet perfume enveloped me. \u201cLet me help you forget,\u201d she suggested, running her hand up my forearm. The touch made me sick to my stomach.</p><p>There was a time in my life where a woman like this would have been warm in my bed within the hour of meeting her. There was a time I would do those sordid things and feel almost nothing at all for it. I looked at her closely in that second and she mistook it for interest, smiling at me kindly. All I could see and think when I looked on her was that this young woman was someone\u2019s daughter, sister, possibly mother. I was disgusted with myself knowing all this time I\u2019d been acting like the biggest fool at the expense of so many girls. I realized I\u2019d caused untold damage. I didn\u2019t deserve January.</p><p>Yet looking at that girl, knowing what she was willing to do with me, I knew I would never do those things again, and not because I cared one iota for that girl. No, it was because I could never betray January like that. I loved January more than I loved myself and that was the first time I\u2019d ever really felt that way for someone. I knew it would probably be the only time.</p><p>I was going to stay away from January MacLochlainn...because I loved her more than anyone on God\u2019s green earth and she deserved someone as amazing as herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked the blonde.</p><p> \u201cKristi,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\u201cKristi, would you have sex with me tonight?\u201d I asked honestly.</p><p>Her smile faltered for a moment but picked right back up. \u201cYes, I would,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know why,\u201d I told her, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t know your own worth. Some advice?\u201d I stood up and gathered my hoodie, throwing it over my shoulders. \u201cDiscover why you\u2019re important, then refuse to settle for anyone who doesn\u2019t completely agree.\u201d</p><p>I walked out of the busy bar, sucking in cool New York air and wishing to everything that I was going home to January because January was my home. I texted Jason, letting him know I bailed and I\u2019d see him around, that I was heading to L.A. the next day.</p><p>I was running away, for real this time.</p><p>Six weeks later...</p><p>Thomas</p><p>L.A. was a fucking mess. I found a dozen bands worth signing and sent them Jason\u2019s way, but I was so miserable, I barely remembered any of them. I was mechanical, even more than Austin Tom. Austin Tom was downright cheery compared to Los Angeles Tom.</p><p>In Austin, I was pissed off. Los Angeles, I was practically suicidal, depressed as hell and nearly crying into my damn pillow every single night like a damn girl. I was miserable. Every corner I turned, I thought I saw January. Every time I bought a coffee, went jogging, grocery shopping, I could smell her, hear her, feel her. She seemed to be everywhere I wanted her to be but not tangible enough to touch or kiss her. She was seared into my brain.</p><p>A month and a half into my stay, I knew I needed to see her. I just needed to drink her in, to soothe the ragged edges of my soul and just memorize her one more time. I\u2019d do it every month if I had to. Eventually weaning myself free in a few weeks, months, okay, years.</p><p>I needed a plan.</p><p>And that plan came in the form of a phone call from Jason.</p><p>\u201cDude, we need you in New York,\u201d he told me over a broken line.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say, the shiteth hath hitteth the fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the eff up. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get your ass here. I\u2019ll tell you all about it on Monday.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to fight it. A free ticket to New York? And I\u2019d self-diagnosed myself dehydrated of January MacLochlainn. Time for your meds, Tom.</p><p>Take two Januarys a day and call me in the morning.</p><p>New York</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d Jason said to me as I exited my cab.</p><p>I\u2019d called a few minutes before and told him I was coming. He\u2019d told me he\u2019d meet me street level. This meant news to Jason. I found him smoking a cigarette. He put it out with his shoe by the time I\u2019d closed the cab door.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what\u2019s going on now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said succinctly. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, I\u2019m pretty effing tired of these cryptic messages from you. Last time this happened, I got stuck doing something I didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, come now. Last time I checked, you found your soul mate in that little incident. Don\u2019t knock unanswered prayers, brotha!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, look how happy I am now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shut up. I\u2019m about to make your fucking day.\u201d</p><p>We rode the rest of the elevator ride in silence. The doors opened to the executive floor and I felt an incredible sense of deja\u2019 vu as we made our way to Peter Weathervane\u2019s office. Jason knocked.</p> <p>\u201cCome in!\u201d I heard Peter yell.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I expected when I entered Peter\u2019s office. Maybe Jonah drumming his fingers like the evil freak he was? It sure as hell wasn\u2019t Peter\u2019s latest wife sitting on his lap.</p><p>\u201cShit! Sorry,\u201d I began. Wait, he invited you in.</p><p>\u201cNo worries. She was just leaving.\u201d</p><p>His wife pretended to pout and he handed over a credit card, making me want to gag. January would never do that kind of shit. She strutted out of his office, her short skirt barely covering her ass. She smiled at me seductively as she left. Well, that was disgusting.</p> <p> \u201cTom!\u201d Peter said, finishing off his drink and standing. He tucked in his disheveled shirt and I almost lost my lunch. No telling what they were doing before we walked in. \u201cI, uh, I\u2019m not good at apologies.\u201d He looked thoughtful a moment. \u201cMatter of fact, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever apologized to anyone before. Huh. Anyway, listen, Jonah\u2019s gone. You\u2019re the new R&amp;D rep. Congrats.\u201d</p><p>He sat down and picked up the phone. He was done with us.</p><p>Jason ushered us out of the room and closed the door behind us.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell just happened there?\u201d I asked Jason.</p><p>\u201cCongrats, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks? I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJonah\u2019s gone. Turns out you were the right man for the job all along. I\u2019d told Peter that a million times but he\u2019s such a stickler for his own stupid rules...Anyway, congrats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wiggin\u2019 out here, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop questioning it. Just roll with it, dude.\u201d</p><p>I thought about it for a moment. \u201cFine. I mean, this is fantastic news. Everyone will love that I\u2019m here to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p> We took the elevator down two floors down and I absently remarked that Peter never did apologize, though for what, I didn\u2019t know. Jason thought that hilarious.</p><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d Jason coolly said, walking past the floor receptionist and waving.</p><p>I gazed at all the office doors on that floor and noted they were all a serious frosted glass and ten feet high. \u201cWhat exactly is my new salary?\u201d I asked Jason, staring at the names on the plates beside each door.</p> <p>We stopped at the last one on the floor and it read Thomas Eriksson. I almost burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cI had Suzanne rush that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Suzanne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour secretary. It\u2019s six figures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I asked, inspecting my nameplate.</p><p>\u201cYour salary? It\u2019s six figures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the eff up,\u201d I told him as he swung the door to my office open.</p><p>\u201cSurprise!\u201d I heard in chorus.</p><p>Inside my barren office was my entire family. My mom, dad, sister, Cherry and Charlie, Callum and Harper, and all the rest of the gang, including Kelly and Carter. My eyes began to sting with how happy I was to see them all in one place and I shook it away, clearing my throat. Harper was closest and threw her arms over my neck.</p><p>\u201cTom, congratulations!\u201d She told me, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I choked back. \u201cThank you, everyone.\u201d</p><p>I noticed my mom in the corner and pushed my way to her. \u201cMom,\u201d I said, hugging her tightly.</p><p>I felt like a little kid. I needed my mom so badly in that moment. I needed her to tell me it was all going to be okay.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, my darling boy,\u201d she said, and I could feel her tears fall on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d I said, moving to him and hugging him fiercely. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongrats, son.\u201d</p><p>I looked around and swallowed the faces surrounding me. The love and admiration from each of them was so incredibly humbling. Everyone I loved was in that room. Every single one save for the one I loved the most.</p><p>Knock. Knock.</p><p>We all froze where we stood, unsure what to do.</p><p>\u201cAnswer it, you dolt!\u201d Cherry playfully jeered, making everyone laugh.</p><p>I opened the door and was stunned silent.</p><p>\u201cUh, hi,\u201d January MacLochlainn told me.</p><p>She was just as stunning as I\u2019d memorized her to be, if not more so. She\u2019d trimmed her hair since last I saw her and her skin was a bit less tan. She wasn\u2019t any better put together or anything but she obviously wasn\u2019t being forced to improvise on the road. She had access to a permanent wardrobe.</p><p>She was unbelievably beautiful. I\u2019d wondered what she\u2019d been doing since I last saw her. I wanted to throw her into my arms and kiss her senseless but I didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t mine to throw.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I stupidly replied after too long a silence. Things were awkward.</p><p>\u201cI-I just wanted to stop by and congratulate you. Everyone\u2019s really excited to have you back,\u201d she said, then cleared her throat. \u201cAnyway, I see you\u2019re busy,\u201d she said, popping her head in the room and smiling at everyone. \u201cI won\u2019t bother you anymore. It was nice to see you again.\u201d She waved to everyone in the room then left.</p><p>I closed the door behind her, dumbstruck. No, struck mute, like a complete idiot. She\u2019d left me tongue-tied. I knew if I had opened my mouth I would have just spouted nonsense or worse, proclaim that I loved her again but at the top of my lungs and in front of my entire family.</p><p>I turned toward that family and caught a sea of shocked faces with mouths agape.</p><p>I swallowed as I took them all in. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cWas that her?\u201d Cherry asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that was January.\u201d</p><p>All the girls yelped at once, startling me.</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cGo after her!\u201d Harper commanded. \u201cRight now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you nuts? That\u2019s the January you couldn\u2019t shut up about?\u201d My dad interjected, the complete surprise etched all over his aging face.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I sang, more nervous than I\u2019d ever been.</p><p>Callum slapped me on the shoulder. \u201cIf you don\u2019t go after that girl, Tom, I believe these women may skin you alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d I asked them, desperation seeping into my voice.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how you got this job?\u201d Jason asked evenly, interrupting the already conspiring females. He stared absently out the window before turning toward me.</p><p>Everyone grew quiet.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said truthfully.</p><p>\u201cCan you not guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no clue.\u201d I was being honest. I had no idea. I figured Jonah had quit or thrown himself off a bridge. I didn\u2019t care. What?</p><p>\u201cJanuary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary got me the job?\u201d I asked, baffled as ever.</p><p>\u201cYes, January put her own reputation on the line to save your sorry ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I swallowed audibly.</p><p>\u201cShe went to Peter Weathervane, without permission, by the way.\u201d We both knew that showing up unannounced at Peter\u2019s door is basically a death wish. I nodded. \u201cTurns out, January found she was somewhat responsible for Jonah thieving all your bands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d never do that,\u201d I said, defending her.</p><p>\u201cNo, not directly,\u201d Jason continued, fishing his cigarette and lighter out of his pocket, as if he could smoke it in there. He was nervous just talking about the risk January took. I breathed deeply. \u201cApparently, when she would phone home, she\u2019d let them know where she was going and I guess Jonah found this out somehow. He\u2019d ring her home soon after claiming to represent the label and conned her little sister into spilling your locations.</p><p>\u201cShe felt awful about it, I guess, and risked her own job to let Peter know the truth. When Peter confronted Jonah with the phone records, he couldn\u2019t deny it and was fired on the spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, she could have been fired as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d my mom asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause our locations were label business and we signed confidentiality agreements before we\u2019d left. We don\u2019t want competition from other labels. She risked herself for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a brave girl,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cShe must love you very much.\u201d</p><p>I was staggered by Kelly\u2019s words and could only stand there, staring at my shoes.</p><p>\u201cI have to find her,\u201d I said suddenly and bolted out the door.</p><p>Everyone followed me out into the hall.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I heard Jason say from behind me. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know where to find her?\u201d</p><p>I turned back around.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a producer now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d I said, happy to hear it, walking backward for a bit before turning back around.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I heard my mom ask my dad as I ran for the elevator doors.</p><p>\u201cIt means she\u2019s a talented, talented girl,\u201d I heard my pop explain to my mom, making me smile. I\u2019d used those exact same words to describe her to Jason in Austin just in a very different context. I had no idea at the time just how true those words really were.</p><p>I hit the buttons for the below ground floor on the elevator and my body shook in anticipation.</p><p>Cherry came skidding to a halt next to me as the doors slid open and I stepped inside, turning to face her.</p><p>\u201cBe patient, Tommy,\u201d She told me. \u201cRemember to be patient.\u201d</p><p>I nodded as the doors slipped closed.</p><p>The ride down was excruciating. My heart could keep time with a hummingbird\u2019s wing and the sweat began to slide down my neck. I\u2019d never been so nervous in all my life.</p><p>Ding.</p><p>I startled. Get it together. I practically sprinted down the hall towards the studios and was brought short by none other than Georgia Asher.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, man!\u201d she said before realizing it was me. \u201cOh! Thomas!\u201d she said properly, making me smirk. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for January. Have you seen her?\u201d</p><p>Georgia\u2019s shoulders sank in my hands. \u201cI\u2019m afraid she\u2019s left for the night. She came into the studio a few minutes ago complaining she wasn\u2019t feeling well. She\u2019s taken off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, kissing Georgia\u2019s cheek. \u201cSee you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye then!\u201d she said, waving at me with a sweet smile. I loved Georgia.</p><p>I returned to my office deflated. When I opened my door, I was bombarded by women.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Where is she? What\u2019s going on?\u201d They all chimed in at once.</p><p>\u201cGive the guy some room!\u201d Callum said.</p><p>I backed off a bit and rubbed my forehead, leaning against the edge of my new desk. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t there. She left for the day, said she felt ill.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not ill,\u201d Cherry said.</p><p>All the girls seemed to agree, including my mom.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s upset,\u201d Harper added, nodding happily. \u201cThis is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That\u2019s awful!\u201d I told them.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a good sign,\u201d my mom said. \u201cIt means she\u2019s not over you. This is a very good sign.\u201d</p><p>I gulped. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d I asked them.</p><p>\u201cWe go to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where she lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Jason asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt never came up!\u201d I seethed.</p><p>\u201cFine, I could get into trouble for this, but I\u2019ll look it up. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>Jason left to do his thing and everyone visibly relaxed.</p><p>\u201cWhat should I say to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her you love her,\u201d Kelly suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t want me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPatience, Tom,\u201d Cherry said again. \u201cShe does love you. Pride\u2019s getting in the way, for both of you, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her you know she still loves you,\u201d my sister Christina said. \u201cTell her you know what she did for you. That it\u2019s your proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, absorbing it all.</p><p>I backed up some more when the women started studying me more closely. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re making me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnzip your jacket,\u201d Marty said, \u201cand remove the hood.\u201d</p><p>I did as she said.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Cherry said, examining me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m done. She\u2019ll listen to me regardless of the way I\u2019m dressed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very good thing,\u201d my mom said, making all the girls laugh.</p><p>\u201cI-I, uh, need a moment,\u201d I said, feeling stifled.</p><p>I burst into the hall and breathed in the air, running my hands through my hair. I was beginning to suffocate with all the estrogen flowing in that room.</p><p> \u201cJust be yourself,\u201d I heard from behind me. Callum.</p><p>I was so grateful he\u2019d joined me. \u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just tell her how you truly feel, leave nothing out, trust me about that, and leave the rest up to fate,\u201d he said, leaning his body against the hall wall.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I told him, running my hands through my hair.</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it!\u201d Jason yelled down the hall.</p><p>Just as suddenly, my office door clicked open and a sea of people came barreling my way. I barely had enough time to react as they ushered me in front of them, pushing me toward the elevator.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not all coming with me!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cOh yes we are!\u201d Cherry shouted from the back of the crowd.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious!\u201d I said, stopping in front of them and taking in the sheer number. We wouldn\u2019t even fit in one elevator car.</p><p>\u201cWe are!\u201d someone shouted.</p><p>\u201cFine, but you\u2019re all waiting down the street.\u201d</p><p>I led the group of fifteen to the trains and we all piled in.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d I said under my breath.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Cherry agreed, \u201cbut if life wasn\u2019t ridiculous sometimes, what kind of life would it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA normal one,\u201d I countered playfully.</p><p>\u201cHush it,\u201d she said, prodding my shoulder with hers. \u201cYou love it.\u201d</p><p>I did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a long train ride home if she says no,\u201d Jason said after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Jason!\u201d the girls said in unison.</p><p>\u201cJeez Louise!\u201d he said, smiling deviously.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, she\u2019s gonna say no,\u201d I said, beginning to hyperventilate.</p><p>Harper sent Jason a death glare. \u201cNo, she won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I just do, Tom.\u201d</p><p>Apparently January\u2019s grandma\u2019s house was only a ten-minute walk from the station so we decided to hoof it. Every step I took January\u2019s direction made my body shake impossibly worse than the last.</p><p> January\u2019s home was a typical Jersey split level, baby blue and ugly as hell. I stood just down the street from it, my family flanking me and immediately feeling for all the world like an absolute idiot for agreeing to bring them along.</p><p>\u201cYou all wait right here,\u201d I said with conviction, eyeing them all harshly. \u201cI swear to God, if I see one of you girls anywhere near us, I\u2019ll have your prospective spouses whip you, fifties-style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d Marty yelped. I focused in on her and she pretended to zip her mouth.</p><p>\u201cStay. Here.\u201d</p><p>I nervously walked January\u2019s way and shook out my hands to steady them, wiping the sweat onto the thigh of my jeans. I scaled the sidewalk to the front door. My finger lingered over the doorbell.</p><p> \u201cHere goes nothing.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Settle Down</p><p>January</p><p>I\u2019d barely rinsed the conditioner from my hair when I heard the doorbell. I\u2019d hopped in the shower almost immediately after coming home. I needed two things. One, I needed privacy so I could bawl my eyes out after seeing Tom at Seven where he proceeded to blow me off, making me feel worse than I ever thought I could. Two, I needed the water to soothe myself and my aching heart.</p><p>Who could that be? I thought as the doorbell rang again. I shrugged my shoulders and continued to cry into the falling water, sniffling like a little girl. They could sit on the porch for all I cared.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d I heard loudly.</p><p>I turned the water off and stilled, listening for the commotion coming from the direction of the living room.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand!\u201d I heard my cousin Collin say loudly.</p><p>I hopped out of the shower quickly and wrapped my short robe around myself. Hauling ass outside of the bathroom, almost slipping on the wood in the hallway. Sounds of fighting came from the front lawn along with...chanting? I ran to the front door and stepped out onto the front porch.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked, stopping still at the sight of Tom\u2019s hands around Collin\u2019s neck. \u201cTom?\u201d I could feel the burn of tears beginning to surface again. \u201cWhat-what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary,\u201d he said desperately, releasing his grip on my cousin and coming toward me. He stood on the bottom step beneath me.</p><p>Collin fell to the grass, rubbing his neck. \u201cDo you know him?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, this is Tom,\u201d I explained, gesturing towards Tom like an idiot. Collin started laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d we both asked, turning his direction.</p><p>\u201cThis guy thought I was your boyfriend. He said he recognized me from the airport and told me I couldn\u2019t have you, that you belonged to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d I sighed, realizing for the first time I was standing on my porch in a short ass robe, naked underneath and hair dripping in front of fifteen random people. \u201cCan I talk to you inside?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, climbing the porch steps.</p><p>I glanced behind me and saw a guy who looked exactly like Tom but older.</p><p>\u201cWho are those people?\u201d I asked quietly, as we entered my grandmother\u2019s home.</p><p>\u201cUh, those are my parents and sister and friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, I just embarrassed myself in front of your entire family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, January,\u201d he said, running his hands over his face and through his hair. \u201cThis was not how this was supposed to go.\u201d</p><p>I led him into my room and shut the door. \u201cYou attacked my cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that,\u201d Tom said, sighing deeply. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he began but stopped short when I burst out laughing. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I just- never mind. Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Tom stood tall and stepped closer to me, grabbing my shoulders in the process. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, January MacLochlainn, and I want you to take me back.\u201d</p><p>The tears had already started flowing. I couldn\u2019t stop them. His mere touch was enough to break me down. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you love me as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>My head fell toward my feet and a soft sob escaped my lips. \u201cYou hurt me so badly, Tom. For weeks, I felt like I had to tiptoe around you. I was walking on eggshells and when I finally felt comfortable enough to stomp around, you pulled the rug out from under me. I don\u2019t think I could take another surprise like that. It\u2019s not healthy, no matter how much I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary,\u201d he said, hugging me closely. Irrationally, I worried that my hair would soak his shirt. \u201cI am so sorry for not trusting you in Europe. I never really believed you would betray me like that. I think I was just scared of what you are to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what am I to you?\u201d I asked, looking up into his blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the love of my life, January MacLochlainn,\u201d he said without shame.</p><p>He ran his hands along my forehead and down my face, stopping at my collarbone. He stared at me like I was the last woman on Earth.</p><p>And the tears came in droves. \u201cDon\u2019t say things like that to me, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just saying them because I think that\u2019s what you want to hear. I\u2019m telling you this because it\u2019s the truth. I can\u2019t live without you, J. You\u2019re it. You\u2019re it. Get me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, afraid to speak. He took me in his arms and brought me closer, inching me nearer to his chest slowly as if he was frightened I\u2019d spook. His eyes searched my face like he was drinking me in for the last time. \u201cGod, I love you,\u201d he said without thinking.</p><p>He brought his mouth to mine and I could feel the desperation he felt for me. It matched mine completely. I grazed my hands up his shoulders and wrapped them around his neck. Staring at him afforded me the first sense of peace I\u2019d felt in the weeks since I last saw him.</p><p>His lips moved over mine languidly and I felt drunk from the warmth of his breath. His bottom lip trembled against mine in restraint and I decided to give him the permission he was begging for.</p><p>I pressed the kiss deeper, breathing in deeply through my nose. I was on the brink of ecstasy. Incredible, I thought. I broke free a moment and told him how I felt before diving back in.</p><p>\u201cJanuary,\u201d he whispered, sending a thrill up my arms and legs, where it pooled in my belly.</p><p>His tongue stung sweetly and I realized I wanted to be the only one who would be able to taste him forever. We edged slowly toward the bed, never breaking the kiss and toppled onto my disheveled quilt. Tom was wedged between my legs and my robe came undone a little, the edge of my breasts exposed.</p><p>We stopped for just a moment, realizing where things were headed. His eyes roamed my entire body before he ran the backs of two fingers over the exposed skin at my chest. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, January,\u201d he told me.</p><p>I brought him closer to me and I kissed him fiercely. I was ready for him.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI want you too,\u201d he said, kissing me deeper.</p><p>His right hand followed the line of my body starting at my shoulders, his thumb cupping underneath my breast before continuing down, pinching my hip and holding the back of my thigh, bringing my leg up and around him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p> This seemed to bring something out in me but stilled him. I peppered his face and neck with kisses.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t right,\u201d he told me, but his body told me differently.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel wrong,\u201d I told him, sucking on the lobe of his ear.</p> <p>\u201cJanuary,\u201d he moaned before sitting up and bringing me with him.</p><p>I continued to kiss him and he kissed me back. He wanted this but he was fighting me the entire way.</p><p>\u201cJanuary,\u201d he said softly, kissing the side of my neck. \u201cThis secret I\u2019ve yet to earn. It\u2019s not right for me to learn you yet. Please,\u201d he said, kissing my forehead, \u201cI can\u2019t do to you what I\u2019ve done with the others. I owe you so much more than that. You\u2019re worth so much more.\u201d</p><p>A heated embarrassment painted my entire body. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I said, wrapping the robe tighter around my torso, feeling so ashamed of myself.</p><p>Tom stood and adjusted his clothing before helping me to my feet. He brought me close to him and hugged me, kissing the top of my head. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d he said, running his hands down my back. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be sorry about. We\u2019re just going to do this right, is all.\u201d He eyed me with a slight smirk. \u201cIt\u2019ll be hard as hell, but I\u2019m determined.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I told him sincerely.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he said, kissing my temple.</p><p>I startled when someone knocked on my door.</p><p>\u201cJanuary?\u201d I heard Grandma Betty say on the other side.</p><p>Tom panicked but I stifled laughter.</p><p>\u201cYes, Maime\u00f3?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you in there alone with a boy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Maime\u00f3, but we\u2019re behaving,\u201d I told her truthfully, running my hand along the side of Tom\u2019s face, he buried it in my hand and kissed my palm.</p><p>\u201cAll the same, young lady...out.\u201d</p><p>This time we both laughed. \u201cYes, Maime\u00f3.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, there\u2019s \u2019bout fifteen people sittin\u2019 out on our front lawn. Would you know anythin\u2019 about that?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The Gambler</p><p>Six months later...</p> <p>Thomas</p><p>\u201cMove your hand a little to the left,\u201d the photographer told me.</p><p>January and I were at a photo shoot for Junkie, a national music mag doing a piece on the people who helped shape the bands America knows and loves. We were honored, to say the least, because we were being featured in the article and might even earn the cover. Apparently, they were impressed.</p><p> They\u2019d done a short interview a few weeks prior already and it was time for the shoot. They\u2019d done a few posed shots and told us to take a minute while they made some adjustments to the set.</p><p>I threaded my hands through January\u2019s while we waited.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do tonight?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>She playfully leaned back, forcing me to hold her body weight upright for her. I couldn't help but laugh at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. What do you want to do?\u201d she asked, bringing her face up, her nose near mine and wiggling her brows.</p><p>I swung her in my arms and she laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cYou mean besides you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>\u201cHow about we grab a bottle and meet the gang for a game or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing tonight.\u201d January got on with my friends better than I did, it seemed. \u201cWell, that and making out.\u201d</p><p>I grinned at her. \u201cOh, you\u2019d like to make out with me, J?\u201d I asked, wrapping my arms around her waist and blowing into her neck.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHell yeah I do.\u201d</p><p>Music was playing in the room so I swung her in my arms and began dancing with her, shifting her from side to side. Her hair swayed across the hand I had splayed against her back and I felt her shiver at my touch. God, how she affected me with her reactions.</p><p> \u201cHow about we skip the wine, our friends and the game and go right to the make out part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said in a silly voice.</p><p>I attacked her neck with my lips, following up her jaw and kissing her lips softly and slowly. Lazily, taking my sweet ass time, I tasted her tongue, running my own against the ridge of her teeth.</p><p> \u201cI love you, January,\u201d I said, when the kiss broke.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Tom.\u201d</p><p>I ran my hands down her face and lightly squeezed her cheeks, puckering her lips a little. I kissed them and brought my hands down.</p><p>That\u2019s when we realized we had an audience, and a large one at that. January\u2019s face lit up to impossible shades of red and I instinctively tucked her into my side.</p><p> \u201cSorry, we didn\u2019t realize you were waiting,\u201d I apologized.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d the photographer smiled, as he put up his camera \u201cyou\u2019re done. You\u2019re free to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d January said, \u201cbut I thought - never mind. Cool.\u201d</p><p>We wrapped up the shoot and decided to head to my apartment. Grandma Betty\u2019s wasn\u2019t exactly conducive to make out sessions, if that wasn\u2019t already obvious. My lease was up a few weeks after I got the R&amp;D position and January helped me move into my own place. Yeah, it was a studio, but it was mine and I\u2019d never had anything to myself before.</p><p>\u201cWhen do the mags come out?\u201d January asked, rummaging through my fridge for a Coke.</p><p>\u201cNext month, on the first. They\u2019re sending us our own box.\u201d</p><p>What I hadn\u2019t told January and for a very good reason was that I ensured they\u2019d go to her studio on a day I knew we\u2019d both be there because this magazine wasn\u2019t just an article on what we did for Seven. Oh no, it was much, much more.</p><p>\u201cOh, cool,\u201d she said, popping the top off the glass bottle in her hand.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I said, tossing myself on my bed and flipping the stereo on.</p><p>She took a swig and set the bottle on the bar before coming over and cuddling into my side.</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d she said getting comfortable and kissing my neck.</p><p>Get used to it, I thought.</p><p>We kissed for hours. I didn\u2019t know how many more make out sessions I was going to be able to endure. I found her fascinating and every time I touched her, I felt more and more drawn to her.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I told her later as she was falling asleep.</p><p>She groaned in displeasure. \u201cLet me just sleep here,\u201d she complained.</p><p>\u201cNo, come on. I\u2019ll take you to Sam\u2019s.\u201d Sam\u2019s is where January would sleep sometimes on the weekends. Sam didn\u2019t care because she was barely there and I had peace of mind at Sunday night dinners with Grandma Betty and her curious eyes. That woman saw all. Especially since our last \"conversation.\"</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she huffed, blowing her hair out of her eyes and sitting up.</p><p>I looked on her. \u201cJust a few more minutes,\u201d I conceded, making her smile.</p><p>She fell into my arms and all felt right with the world.</p><p>April 1st, the next month</p><p>Thomas</p><p>I took extra special care to look nice that day. I wore the suit I wore to Callum and Harper\u2019s wedding and even went to the trouble of buying new black Converse for the occasion. I cut my hair, but not so much that I couldn\u2019t still tuck it behind my ears.</p><p>That entire morning I paced back and forth in my office. Suzanne asked if I wanted decaf and I told her that I wanted nothing. She kept looking at me with this worried expression. It made me want to laugh. My office felt stifling, so I cracked the window at the top of my ceiling with one of those circulating bars. I played with that thing so much when I first got there, I thought it was going to break. It was probably the only thing that kept me from messing with it so much.</p><p>I turned on a few tunes, thought better of it and shut them off then rethought that as well and picked a few Max Richter songs to rotate at a low volume instead. I messed with the pillows on my sleek black leather sofa a million times before finally realizing January wouldn\u2019t even notice. I had Suzanne dust my long windowsill and water the plants the day before and those looked good.</p><p>I was just straightening my Warhol print when I heard January\u2019s lively voice telling everyone around her hello. My entire body went bloody warm and my hands began to shake. I sat in my chair and picked up a book, thought twice and pretended to be working on my computer.</p><p>\u201cHello, Suzanne!\u201d I heard her say and I had to clench my jaw shut to keep it from chattering.</p><p>\u201cHi, Miss MacLochlainn. You can go right in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d January said before bursting into my office like a breath of fresh air.</p><p>\u201cHowdy!\u201d she said, dancing into my office, swinging a cardboard box around.</p><p>\u201cHi, babe,\u201d I spit out, barely.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201d she sang, plopping the box onto my desk.</p><p>She took the scissors from the cup on my desk and opened them so the sharp part was exposed. She ran the length through the tape binding the entire thing and I swear to God I thought I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. I stood quickly and shut the door before sitting back down in my chair. I tried to rest my hand on my mouse but it was trembling so badly, I pretended I needed something from my shelf. I stood, retrieved the tape, the tape?, then sat back down. Thankfully, she didn\u2019t notice and I abandoned the worthless tape in front of me.</p><p>I set my arms on the rests of the chair and folded my quaking hands over my stomach.</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d she exclaimed, making me sit up a bit. \u201cWe\u2019re on the cover after all!\u201d She drank in the image of us and turned it toward me. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>I somehow brought my face down from staring at her eyes and noticed the pic they\u2019d chosen. It was January and me, but not in one of the posed shots like I expected. In fact, it was a candid shot of us when we thought no one was watching. We were both laughing, my face almost buried in her neck, and her hair falling back. We looked so incredibly happy.</p><p>I swallowed.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe how beautiful this shot is, Tom?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said matter-of-factly. \u201cYou\u2019re in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d she choked, a small tear escaping her eye. She smiled gently, wiped it clear of her face and took a steadying breath. She flipped open the magazine and took a seat in the chair at the foot of my desk. She brought her feet up and crossed her ankles on the glass.</p><p> \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d she said, looking up the index.</p><p>Oh my word, here we go, I thought.</p><p>She looked at me like she\u2019d only just noticed me and smiled again, making my heart stutter. \u201cWell, don\u2019t you look smart today,\u201d she said before standing up and kissing me, then sitting back down.</p><p>I think I\u2019m going to have a heart attack. \u201cTh-thank you,\u201d I stuttered but she was too distracted to notice.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, \u201cpage seventy-nine. Seventy-nine,\u201d she repeated, flipping through the pages. My knee bounced rapidly and my hand slapped down to still it.</p><p>She looked up at the noise. \u201cYou okay, buttercup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I offered.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she sang and went back to searching. \u201cSixty-eight,\u201d she teased. \u201cSeventy-two.\u201d My heart beat rapidly in my chest. \u201cAh! Here we are. Seventy-nine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>She turned the page and saw that we had a two-page spread.
