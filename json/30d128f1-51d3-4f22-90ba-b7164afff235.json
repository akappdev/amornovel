Done. It. After chasing his enemy cross-continent, bargaining away one of the four godly relics needed to find and destroy Pandora\u2019s box\u2014</p> <p>and yeah, he was gonna get spanked hard for that\u2014then, after being eaten alive by insects and at one point (cough) walking into a chick\u2019s knife (cough), he\u2019d final y won. And damn if he wasn\u2019t ready to celebrate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m king of the world, bitches. Come in here and bask in my glory.\u201d His voice echoed through the foyer, expectant, eager.</p><p>No one returned the greeting.</p><p>Stil . Grinning, he shifted the unconscious female draped over his shoulder into a more comfortable position. More comfortable for him. She was the enemy he\u2019d been chasing, as wel as the chick who\u2019d oh, so impolitely introduced his pancreas to the freaking hilt of her blade. He could hardly wait to tel everyone that he\u2019d done what they hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d bagged and tagged her, baby.</p><p>He cal ed, \u201cDaddy\u2019s home. Somebody? Anybody?\u201d</p> <p>Again, there was no response. His grin dul ed a bit.</p><p>Damn it. When he lost a single chal enge, he battled crippling pain for days. When he won, though...gods, it was almost a sexual high, energy buzzing in his veins, heating him, priming him. That kind of enthusiasm cal ed for a playmate. And, hel , twelve warriors and their menagerie of female companions lived here, yet no one had waited around to welcome him home? Even though the grounds were now gated, monitored and someone had had to punch him in, like, five minutes ago?</p><p>Didn\u2019t that just figure.</p><p>But he deserved it, he supposed. Seven days had passed since he\u2019d last texted or phoned. Technical y, though, that wasn\u2019t his fault. He\u2019d been a wee bit preoccupied, what with subduing his bundle of anything but joy. And on his last update, he\u2019d been told the danger here had passed and everyone could return, so he\u2019d stopped the I-have-to-know-how-everyone\u2019s-doing flurry of cal s.</p><p>So, fine. No biggie. The fact that no one wanted to play actual y did him a solid. Now he could take care of a little business. \u201cThanks, guys. You\u2019re the best. Real y.\u201d And you can al suck it!</p><p>Strider surged forward. To console himself, he imagined his prisoner\u2019s expression when she woke up and found herself trapped in a four-by-four cage. Now that\u2019s the good stuff. Then his gaze snagged on his unfamiliar surroundings, and the last vestiges of his grin fel away. He stopped abruptly.</p> <p>He\u2019d been gone only a few weeks, and he\u2019d thought most of the others had been, too, but in that time someone had managed to turn the run-down monstrosity they cal ed home into a showpiece. Once comprised of crumbling stone and mortar, the floor was now bril iant white marble veined with amber.</p><p>Equal y deteriorated wal s were now vividly polished rosewood.</p><p>Before, the winding staircase had been cracked; now it gleamed, not a flaw in sight, an unblemished gold railing climbing to the top. In the corner, a white velvet-lined chair was pushed against reflective paneling, and beyond that, priceless artifacts\u2014colorful vases, bejeweled trinket boxes and aged spearheads\u2014were perched behind glass cases.</p><p>None of which had been there before.</p><p>Al these changes, in less than a month? Seemed impossible, even with Titan gods popping in and out at wil .</p><p>Maybe because those gods were more concerned with murder and mayhem than interior decorating.</p><p>But maybe...</p><p>maybe while Strider had been congratulating himself on a job wel done, he\u2019d entered the wrong house?</p> <p>It had happened before.</p><p>And talk about awkward. There was no way to explain the cut, bruised and soot-covered baggage he was hauling around. Not without a little jail time. Explaining the blood splatter on his clothing would be a real treat, too.</p><p>Nah, he decided a second later. This was the right place.</p><p>Had to be. Along the staircase wal hung a portrait of Sabin, keeper of Doubt. Naked. Only one person had the bal s to taunt badass Sabin with something like that. Anya, goddess of Anarchy and dealer of disorder, who just happened to be engaged to Lucien, keeper of Death. Odd pair, if you asked Strider, but no one had, so he\u2019d kept the opinion to himself. Besides, better silence than the loss of a favorite appendage. Anya didn\u2019t take kindly to anyone second-guessing her. About anything.</p><p>\u201cYo, Tor Tor,\u201d he shouted now.</p><p>Torin, the keeper of the demon of Disease. Dude never left the fortress. He was always here, monitoring camera feed, ensuring the home remained invasion-free, as wel as playing on his computers and making their miniature, by-invitation-only army a shitload of cha-ching.</p><p>At first, there was no reply, only another echo of his voice, and Strider began to worry. Had something catastrophic happened? A total demon wipeout? If so, why was he stil here? Or had Kane, keeper of Al Kinds of Bad Shit, had a crappy week and\u2014</p><p>Footsteps pounded, closer and closer, and relief flooded him. He looked up the staircase, and there was Torin, standing on a zebra-print rug Strider also didn\u2019t recal seeing before, his white hair shagging around his devil\u2019s face, his green eyes bright as emeralds.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home,\u201d Torin said, adding, \u201cYou shithead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice greeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t cal , you don\u2019t write, and you want hearts and flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures.\u201d</p><p>Torin wore black from neck to toe, his hands covered by soft leather gloves. Fashion-wise, those gloves were overkil . To save mankind, though, they were kinda necessary. A single touch of Torin\u2019s skin against another\u2019s, and hel o plague. Guy\u2019s demon pumped some kind of disease in his veins, that single touch al that was needed to spread it. Even to Strider. But immortal as he was, Strider wouldn\u2019t die from a little cough/fever/vomiting of blood. Not like humans, who would be ravaged, perhaps worldwide, the infection becoming nearly unstoppable.</p><p>Strider would give the il ness to everyone he touched in turn, though, and as he moderately enjoyed seducing humans, he relied on skin-to-skin action.</p><p>\u201cSo, everything good here?\u201d Strider asked. \u201cEveryone fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures. Wel , for the most part, al \u2019s wel . A lot of the guys are out hiding artifacts, and looking for the last one. Those who aren\u2019t are hunting Galen.\u201d Torin took the stairs two at a time and stopped at the bottom, remaining out of striking distance. As always. His gaze flicked to the female, and amusement expanded his pupils, hiding whatever emotion had been banked there before. \u201cSo you\u2019re the next of us to fal in love, huh? Sucker! I thought you\u2019d have more sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I want nothing to do with this raging bitch.\u201d A lie.</p><p>During their seemingly eternal trek, he\u2019d found himself desiring her more and more. And hating himself more and more. She might be sex walking, but she was also death waiting.</p><p>Too-pretty-to-be-male lips curved in sheer delight. \u201cThat\u2019s what Maddox said about Ashlyn. What Lucien said about Anya. What Reyes said about Danika. What Sabin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I get it.\u201d Strider rol ed his eyes. \u201cYou can shut up now.\u201d While he would admit the girl\u2019s punked-out style appealed to him, he\u2019d never be dumb enough to try and tap that.</p><p>He liked his women compliant. And sane.</p><p>Liar. You like this one. Just as she is. He wished he could blame his demon for that admission, but...</p><p>Even now, simply thinking about her, his body was tensing, readying.</p><p>Torin crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cSo what is she? A human with a supernatural ability? A goddess?</p><p>A Harpy?\u201d</p><p>The guys here did have a propensity for choosing females of \u201cmyth\u201d and \u201clegend.\u201d Females far more powerful than their demons. Ashlyn could hear voices of the past, Anya could start fires with her mind (among other things), Danika could see into heaven and hel , and Sabin\u2019s wife, Gwen...</p><p>wel , she had a dark side you saw just before you died.</p><p>Painful y.</p><p>\u201cMy friend, what I\u2019ve got here is a bona fide Hunter.\u201d Strider slapped her ass as if a fly was perched there and he couldn\u2019t live another second without smashing it. The action was a reminder that she meant nothing to him. Although why he didn\u2019t tel his friend which Hunter she was, when he\u2019d been so excited before, he didn\u2019t know. Actual y, he did know. Fatigue. Yeah, he was tired, that was al , and didn\u2019t want to have to deal with al the praise. Tomorrow, after a nice long rest, he\u2019d spil everything.</p><p>The girl offered no reaction to his slap, but then, he hadn\u2019t expected her to. He\u2019d repeatedly drugged her as he\u2019d dragged her from one corner of the world to the other. From Rome to Greece to New York to L.A. and final y to Budapest, leading her brethren on a merry chase as they attempted to save her.</p><p>Something they would never do.</p><p>We won! his demon laughed.</p><p>Damn right we did. He shivered in delight.</p><p>\u201cHunter?\u201d Al amusement fled his friend\u2019s face, the light dying in his eyes, turning those emeralds into sharp, deadly blades.</p><p>\u201cAfraid so.\u201d Hunters. Their greatest enemy. The fanatics who wanted to destroy them. The bastards who considered them evil, beyond redemption, and the scourge of the earth.</p><p>The assholes who blamed them for al the world\u2019s heartache. Best yet, they were the militia Strider was going to send to the hottest depths of hel , one soldier at a time.</p><p>Or, with grenades, a few hundred at a time. Depended on his mood, he supposed.</p><p>\u201cYou should have offed her already,\u201d Torin remarked. \u201cNow Sabin wil want to talk with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk\u201d equaled torture in Sabin\u2019s mind. \u201cI know he wil .</p><p>That\u2019s why she\u2019s stil alive.\u201d She knew things about the gods pul ing their strings, and could do things, impossible things, like cause weapons to materialize from thin air. Something only angel warriors could do. Or so he\u2019d thought. Problem was, she wasn\u2019t an angel. And not just because she lacked wings. Girl had a temper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Strider wanted to know how much she knew and how she did what she did.</p><p>More than that, he hadn\u2019t been able to do his job\u2014aka dispose of Hunter trash\u2014when he\u2019d been alone with her.</p><p>Every time he\u2019d tried, he\u2019d looked at her beautiful face and hesitated. The hesitation had given way to desire, and he\u2019d started battling urges to kiss her rather than \u201coff\u201d her.</p> <p>Sabin wouldn\u2019t let him get away with that shit. Sabin would ride his ass until he acted. Strider would have no choice but to step up to the plate and knock the bal out of the park.</p><p>Because... His hands curled into fists. Because this woman, this walking atrocity...</p><p>His teeth gritted, and his jaw clenched so tightly the ache shot through his temples and straight into his brain. He experienced the same reaction every time he considered what she\u2019d once done. This woman had helped decapitate his friend Baden, once keeper of the demon of Distrust.</p><p>Strider could never forget or forgive that fact.</p><p>The savage beheading had taken place thousands of years ago, but the pain inside him was as fresh as if it had happened this morning. Along with his friend, a piece of his own soul had died that day, and as the girl had learned during their trek to this fortress, a good portion of his heart had withered, too.</p> <p>Mercy wasn\u2019t something he possessed. Not anymore. Most especial y not for her.</p><p>He thought he\u2019d kil ed her in vengeance already, al those centuries ago. Recal ed the slash of his blade, the crimson tide of her blood and the metal ic stench of death wafting on the air. The sound of her body slamming into rock, her last gurgle of breath. Yet here she was, alive and wel and driving him flipping insane. Maybe he had kil ed her. Maybe she\u2019d been reborn. Or maybe her soul had been stuffed inside another body. Or maybe this chick was more immortal than he was and had somehow healed after the beheading. He didn\u2019t know, didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Al that mattered was that she was Hadiee of ancient Greece. Wel , she cal ed herself Haidee now. From Hade-ay to Hay-dee. Evidently she\u2019d changed the spel ing and pronunciation for \u201cmodernization.\u201d Not that he gave a shit.</p><p>He cal ed her Ex, short for Demon Executioner, and that was that.</p><p>The proof of her crimes rested in her eyes. Those wintry, cal ous gray eyes. In the pride that dripped from her voice every time she spoke of that fateful night\u2014I just loved the way his head rol ed. Didn\u2019t you?\u2014and the stark tattoos etched into her back. Tattoos that kept score. Haidee 1.</p><p>Lords 4.</p> <p>She deserved everything he and Sabin would do to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking her to the dungeon,\u201d he said, and he\u2019d never heard such a combination of relish and regret in his own voice before. Once again he started forward, throwing over his shoulder, \u201cIf you\u2019d be a sweetheart and let Doubty-Poo know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo can do, Stridey-man. There\u2019s, uh, something you gotta see.\u201d A blast of fear mixed with dread and grim expectation accompanied the words.</p><p>Strider halted, one foot raised midair. He straightened, stil -</p><p>sleeping baggage nearly sliding to the ground. Slowly he turned, adjusting Ex, and faced Torin, his own sense of dread sprouting as he spied his friend\u2019s now pal id skin.</p><p>White dusted with tiny rivers of blue. \u201cYou said everything was fine. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Torin shook his head. \u201cNo way to explain until you\u2019ve seen.</p><p>And I said everything was fine for the most part. Now come on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe girl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring her. She\u2019l be guarded, you\u2019l see.\u201d A wave of Torin\u2019s hand, and he was racing up the stairs, taking them two at a time.</p><p>Dread increasing, Strider fol owed, Ex bouncing on his shoulder. If she\u2019d been awake, she would have lost her breath, over and over again, grunting from the pain of having her stomach repeatedly slammed into his bone. She also would have fought him with a skil matched by few.</p><p>Too bad the drugs had been so potent. A good fight would have settled his nerves.</p><p>What was so important that Torin didn\u2019t want him taking a few minutes to lock an abominable Hunter away?</p><p>His thoughts splintered the moment he hit the landing.</p><p>Al he could do was gape. Angels. So many angels. No wonder the house had been redecorated. Divine intervention and al that. Angels did like them some pretties.</p><p>They stood along the wal , the only space between them fil ed by the arch of their wings. White feathers laced with gold, the wings of warriors. Their scents perfumed the air, a col age of orchids, morning dew, chocolate and champagne. They ranged in height, though none were shorter than six foot three, and though they wore girly white robes, their muscle mass rivaled Strider\u2019s.</p><p>Most were male, but al were demon assassins trained to hunt, to destroy, and when warranted, to protect. Since they didn\u2019t rush at him, ripping swords of fire from the air, as he knew they were very capable of doing, he assumed they were here for the latter.</p><p>He studied them, searching for answers. Twenty-three in total, but not one of them glanced in his direction. They kept their eyes straight ahead, their stances taut, their hands anchored behind their backs.</p><p>Not a sound did they make.</p><p>Not even the rasp of breath.</p><p>Physical y, they...entranced him. And yeah, it was embarrassing as hel to admit that, even to himself.</p><p>But the sheer magnetism of them was stunning. Hypnotic. A drug for his eyes.</p><p>They possessed al different shades of hair. From the darkest of midnight to the palest of snow, but his favorite was the gold. So pure, so fluid, a king\u2019s ransom that had been melted and mixed with the dazzle of summer sun.</p><p>Rich, vibrant. Almost...alive. No way he\u2019d be teasing any of them about such prissy locks, though.</p><p>They might not be attacking him, might not even be looking at him, but death radiated from them.</p><p>Someone cleared his throat.</p><p>Strider blinked, Torin coming back into focus. His friend occupied the center of the hal way. Probably had the entire time, only Strider had lost sight of anything but the angels the moment he\u2019d spied them.</p><p>Yep. Em-bar-rassing.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d was al he asked.</p><p>Torin understood. \u201cAeron and Wil iam took Amun into hel on a rescue mission. And yeah, they got Legion out of there. She\u2019s alive, healing, but Amun...\u201d</p><p>Strider fil ed in the rest and wanted to punch a hole in the wal . The keeper of Secrets had new voices in his head.</p><p>He\u2019d been with Amun for thousands upon thousands of years. Eons, what seemed countless mil ennia.</p><p>He knew the warrior\u2019s demon absorbed the darkest thoughts and deepest mysteries of anyone nearby.</p><p>Things long buried, horrific, gruesome. Unwanted, humiliating. Soul-changing.</p><p>And if Amun had been in hel , where demons roamed in their purest form, his head was now churning with al kinds of evil. Malevolent whispers, wicked images, both drowning the essence of who he was.</p><p>Or rather, who he\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cThe angels?\u201d Strider gritted out. Yeah, he knew it was rude to discuss the beings as if they weren\u2019t there, but he simply didn\u2019t give a shit. He didn\u2019t love many people, but he loved the other demon-possessed residents of this fortress. Even more than he loved himself, and that was a whole hel of a lot.</p><p>\u201cThey wanted to kil him, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no!\u201d he roared. Anyone touched his friend, and they\u2019d lose their hands\u2014fol owed by their limbs, their organs and, when he tired of torturing them, their lives.</p><p>He hefted Ex off his shoulder and into his arms before easing her to the floor and stalking forward, already reaching for a blade.</p><p>Defeat sensed his need to destroy and laughed. Win!</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Torin raised his arm to ward him off, even as he backtracked to maintain distance. \u201cLet me finish, damn it!</p><p>They wanted to kil him, were supposed to kil him, but they haven\u2019t. Won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Yet hung in the air like a noose around his neck. Strider chose to ignore that noose\u2014for the moment\u2014and stopped, already panting and sweating with the force of his instant and white-hot rage.</p><p>Win? his demon whined.</p><p>No chal enge has been issued. Therefore, he could back off without consequences.</p><p>Oh, he thought he heard, a whole lot of disappointment in the undertone.</p><p>\u201cWhy are they here, then?\u201d he snapped, demanding an answer now. Or else.</p><p>Green eyes grew shadowed as Torin shifted from one foot to the other. His mouth opened and closed, the right explanation eluding him perhaps. \u201cAmun didn\u2019t just absorb new memories. He absorbed demon minions. Hundreds of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? How the fuck is that possible? I\u2019ve lived with him for centuries, and he\u2019s never absorbed my demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor mine. But ours are High Lords who can bind themselves to humans. Those were mere underlings, and as you know, they can only bind themselves to, what? High Lords. Which they did, to his.</p><p>He\u2019s...tainted now, a danger far worse than the brush of my skin. The angels are guarding him. Limiting the contact he has with others, ensuring he doesn\u2019t leave and...hurt. Himself, humans.\u201d</p><p>Strider scowled. Amun rarely spoke, containing the secrets he unwittingly stole inside himself so that no one else would have to deal with them, fear them or be sickened by them.</p><p>A grueling burden few could carry. Yet he did it because there was no one more concerned with the wel</p><p>-being of those around him. So, a danger? No. Strider refused to believe it.</p><p>\u201cExplain better,\u201d he commanded, offering Torin another chance to convince him.</p><p>Since they\u2019d reunited a few months ago after centuries apart, he knew Torin was used to his smiles and jokes, but Disease didn\u2019t flinch at Strider\u2019s new vehemence. \u201cEvil seeps from him. Just going into his room, you\u2019l feel its sticky gloom. You\u2019l crave things.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cBad things. And you won\u2019t be able to simply wish the disgusting desires away. They\u2019l cling to you for days.\u201d</p><p>Strider stil didn\u2019t care and stil wouldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI want to see him.\u201d</p><p>Only the slightest hesitation, as if the decree had been expected, then Torin nodded. \u201cBut the girl...\u201d His words trailed off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Behind him, there was a rustle of clothing, a feminine moan.</p><p>Strider whipped around in time to see one of the angels lifting Ex into his arms and carrying her toward the unclaimed bedroom next to Amun\u2019s.</p><p>He almost rushed forward and ripped her away from the heavenly creature. He\u2019d dealt with an angel before\u2014</p> <p>Lysander, leader of these warriors and the worst of the worst when it came to do-gooders\u2014and knew such beings wouldn\u2019t understand the depths of his hatred for the woman.</p><p>They would see Haidee as an innocent human in need of sweet, tender care. But Amun was far more important than any Hunter\u2019s treatment, so Strider remained in place.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, she\u2019s worse than a demon,\u201d he said, a lethal edge sharpening the truth in his tone.</p><p>\u201cSo if you want to protect your charges, you\u2019l guard her like you\u2019re guarding Amun. But don\u2019t kil her,\u201d</p><p>he added before he could stop himself. Not that they would have. Stil . A guy had to state his wants up front, so there would be no confusion later. \u201cShe has...information we need.\u201d</p> <p>The angel paused in his stride, head turning to Strider with unerring precision. Like Torin, his eyes were green. Unlike Torin, there were no shadows in them. Only clear, bright flames, crackling, intense...ready to strike like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>\u201cI sense her infection.\u201d His voice was deep, with the barest hint of smoke. \u201cI wil ensure she does not leave the fortress.</p><p>And that she continues to live. For now.\u201d</p><p>Infection? Strider knew nothing about an infection, but again, he didn\u2019t care. \u201cThank you.\u201d And hel , had he ever thought to thank a demon assassin for anything? Wel , besides Aeron\u2019s Olivia.</p><p>With a shake of his head, he wiped Ex and everything else from his thoughts and marched forward, trailing behind Torin.</p><p>At the end of the hal way, the last door on the right, Torin paused, drew in a sorrowful breath, and twisted the knob.</p> <p>\u201cBe careful in there.\u201d Then he moved aside, al owing Strider to breeze past him without a single moment of contact.</p><p>First thing Strider noticed was the air. Thick and dark, he could almost smel the brimstone...the bodies charred to ash. And the sounds...oh, gods, the sounds. Screams that scraped at his ears, muted, yet in no way forgettable.</p><p>Thousands upon thousands of demons danced together, creating a dizzying chorus of agony.</p><p>He stopped at the foot of the bed, peering down. Amun writhed atop the mattress, clutching his ears, moaning and groaning. No, Strider realized a moment later. Those moans and groans weren\u2019t coming from his friend. They were coming from him. Amun was silent, his mouth open in an endless cry he couldn\u2019t quite release.</p><p>His dark skin was clawed to ribbons, those ribbons tattered and dried with blood both old and new. As an immortal soldier, he healed quickly. But those wounds...they looked as if they\u2019d scabbed over, only to be ripped apart again.</p><p>And again. And his butterfly tattoo, the mark of his demon, had once wrapped around his right calf.</p><p>Only now, that tattoo moved. Sliding up his leg, undulating on his stomach, breaking apart to form hundreds of tiny butterflies, reconnecting into one, then disappearing behind his back.</p><p>How? Why?</p> <p>Shaking, Strider studied his friend\u2019s face. Amun\u2019s lashes were fused together as if stitched, and the sockets underneath were so swol en he could have smuggled golf bal s in there. Oh, gods. Sickness churned in Strider\u2019s stomach, pushing bile into his throat. He knew what that swel ing meant, recognized the pattern blunted nails had left behind.</p><p>Amun had tried to pluck out his own eyes.</p><p>To stop the images forming behind them?</p><p>That was the last coherent thought Strider had. The last thought he control ed.</p><p>The darkness shrouded him completely, burrowing into him, fil ing his mind, consuming him. There were knives strapped al over his body, he recal ed. He should palm them, use them. Slice, oh, how he would slice. Himself, Amun. The angels outside the room. Then the world. Blood would flow, an ever-thickening crimson. Flesh would peel like dried, rotted paint, and bone would snap in two, tiny shards fal ing to the floor, merely dust to be swept away.</p><p>He would drink the blood and eat the bones, but they wouldn\u2019t be what sustained him. No, he would live off the shrieks and squeals his actions provoked. He would bathe in terror, exult in grief. And he would laugh, oh, how he would laugh.</p><p>He laughed now, the chil ing sound like music to him.</p><p>Defeat wasn\u2019t sure how to react. The demon cackled, then whimpered, then sank to the back of Strider\u2019s mind. Afraid?</p><p>Be afraid.</p><p>Something strong and hard banded around his forearms and jerked him backward, dragging him kicking and shouting out of the darkness and into light. Such bright light.</p><p>His eyes teared, burned. But with the tears, with the burn, the images in his head washed clean and withered to cinder. Somewhat.</p><p>Strider blinked into focus. He was trembling violently, glazed with perspiration, his palms bleeding because he had grabbed his knives. Was stil holding them. Only, he\u2019d squeezed them by their blades, cutting through tendon into bone. The pain was severe but manageable as he opened his fingers and the weapons clattered to the floor.</p><p>One of the angels stood behind him, another in front of him.</p><p>They were glowing from within, like twin suns just freed from a too-long eclipse; he fought to breathe, managed to suck in one mouthful of oxygen, then two. Thank the gods. No brimstone, no ash. Only the scent of beloved\u2014and hated\u2014</p><p>morning dew. Hated because, with the fresh, clean scent, reality was brought into Technicolor focus.</p><p>That\u2019s what Amun had to endure?</p><p>Strider had been given a taste, only a taste, yet his friend suffered with the gloom and soul-shattering urges al day, al night. No one could maintain his sanity when constantly buffeted against that kind of wickedness. Not even Amun.</p><p>\u201cWarrior?\u201d the angel in front of him prompted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m myself now,\u201d he rasped. A lie. He might never be the same again.</p><p>He looked over the angel\u2019s shoulder and saw Torin. They shared a horrified moment of understanding before he returned his attention to the angel and the situation at hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hel are you just standing here? Someone chain him. He\u2019s tearing himself apart.\u201d Strider\u2019s throat was raw, grinding the words into broken glass. \u201cAnd for fuck\u2019s sake, get him on an IV. He needs sustenance. Medicine.\u201d</p><p>The two angels shared a look similar to the one he\u2019d shared with Torin, only theirs was fraught with knowledge only achieved through battle and heartache, before one returned to his post at the wal and the other entered returned to his post at the wal and the other entered Amun\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>The one at the wal said, \u201cHe has been on an IV before.</p><p>Several times, actual y. They do not last. The needles always find a way free, with or without his help.</p><p>The chains, however, we can do. And before you demand we clean him and care for him, I wil tel you that we have. We brush his teeth for him. We bathe him. We clean his wounds. We force-feed him. He is taken care of in every way possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Strider said.</p><p>\u201cWe are open to any ideas you have.\u201d</p><p>Of course, he had no response to that. He might be in control of his thoughts again, but as Torin had promised, the need to kil , to truly hurt the innocent, hadn\u2019t fled completely. It was there, like a film of slime on his skin.</p><p>He had a feeling he wouldn\u2019t be able to scrub himself clean, even if he removed every layer of flesh he possessed.</p><p>How was Amun going to survive this?</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>IN BRIEF MOMENTS OF LUCIDITY, Amun knew who he was, what he used to be and the monster he\u2019d become. He wanted to die, final y, blessedly, but no one would take mercy on him and deliver the finishing blow. And no matter how hard he tried\u2014and oh, did he try\u2014he couldn\u2019t seem to inflict enough damage on his own body to do the deed himself.</p><p>So he fought, trying to expunge the black images and disgusting impulses constantly bombarding him, yet at the same time hold them inside. An impossible chal enge, and one he would soon lose. He knew it.</p><p>There were too many, they were too strong, and they\u2019d already burned away his immortal soul, the last tether that had bound them to his wil .</p><p>Not that he\u2019d ever had control.</p><p>He\u2019d fight with every fiber of his being, though. Until the very end. Because when those images and impulses, those demons, were loosed on an unsuspecting public...</p><p>A shudder rippled through him. He knew what would happen, could see the destruction in his mind.</p><p>Could taste the sweet flavor of devastation in his mouth.</p><p>Sweet...yes...</p><p>And like that, this newest moment of clarity evaporated like mist. So many images swam through his head, a deluge of memories, and he didn\u2019t know which belonged to him and which belonged to the demons\u2014or their victims. Beatings.</p><p>Rapes. Murders. Rapture in the face of each. Pain.</p><p>Trauma. Death. Paralyzing fear that consumed as it destroyed.</p><p>Just then, he only knew that fire smoldered around him, melting his skin, blistering his throat. That thousands of tiny, stinging bugs had managed to dig their way into his veins, and they were stil feasting on him. That the smel of rot fil ed his nose, and had infused his every cel . That\u2014</p><p>Dead bodies were piled around him, on top of him, smashing and burying him, he suddenly realized. He was trapped, suffocating.</p><p>Help! he screamed inside his head. Someone help me! But no one ever came. Hours passed, perhaps days. His frantic struggling waned until he could only smack his lips. He was thirsty. Oh, gods, was he thirsty. He needed something, anything, to wash away the ash caked inside his mouth.</p><p>Please! Help!</p><p>Stil no one came. This was his punishment. He was to die here. Until he came back to life to suffer some more.</p><p>Desperation renewed his struggle to free himself\u2014but that only made things worse. There were too many bodies, the weight of them drowning him in a ceaseless sea of blood, rot and despair. There was no hope of escape. He truly was going to die here.</p><p>But then his surroundings changed again, and he was looking down on that mountainous, decaying pile, grinning and holding another body to toss on top. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This one had died too soon, he thought, gaze shifting to the motionless female soul he held in his scaled, gnarled arms.</p><p>Souls were as real and corporal down here as humans were up there, and for seventy-two years he\u2019d kept this one chained. She\u2019d been helpless as he\u2019d sliced her piece by agonizing piece. He\u2019d laughed when she\u2019d begged for mercy, revived her when she\u2019d thought to find that same mercy in sleep, and forced her to watch as he did the same to her beloved family, two members he also owned.</p><p>So much fun...</p> <p>A female\u2019s tears had never tantalized him so exquisitely, and he\u2019d meant to enjoy her suffering at least another seventy years. But he\u2019d gotten carried away this morning, his claws just a little too sharp, the tips sinking just a little too deep.</p><p>Oh, wel .</p><p>He was Torment, and there were a thousand other souls awaiting his attention. Why mourn the loss of this one?</p><p>He rid himself of the body with the barest flick of his wrists.</p><p>She landed, the other damned mortals clanking around her.</p> <p>He waited, expectant, and was soon rewarded. One of his minions, his hungry, hungry minions, crept to the body and began to feast, snapping and hissing at any other creatures who attempted to thieve the delicious meal.</p><p>Such a pretty picture they made, the scaled, crimson-eyed fiend and the naughty human who\u2019d dared to die before he\u2019d finished with her. Oh, wel , he thought again. Her soul would soon wither, materialize, and solidify somewhere in this endless pit, and if he were the one to find her, he would have another chance to torture her.</p><p>Whistling under his breath, he turned and strol ed away.</p><p>In the next instant, Amun was swept out of hel in a blinding gale of fury and sorrow, Torment no longer, but a female.</p><p>Human. She huddled in a corner, no more than twelve years old, the harsh material that covered her body like something out of a historic reenactment, tears scalding her cheeks, fear a living entity inside her chest. She was dirty, pale, the straw surrounding her the only source of comfort.</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten how I saved you?\u201d a hard male voice asked. In Greek. Ancient Greek.</p> <p>His booted feet slapped the ground as he paced in front of her. He was on the short side, his face scarred by the pox and his body rotund. His name was Marcus, but she cal ed him the Bad Man. Yes, he\u2019d saved her, but he\u2019d beaten her, too. When her words pleased him, she was given food, shelter.</p><p>When they did not, she was forgotten, locked away, terrified of being sold as a slave.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be terrified anymore.</p><p>He\u2019d plucked her from the hut where she\u2019d lived her entire life. Until he had arrived, she\u2019d been too afraid to leave, even though there\u2019d been no one left to care for her.</p><p>Somehow, he had known about the terrors that fil ed her every dream, both awake and asleep\u2014memories no little girl should have, much less replay over and over again, eyes open or closed\u2014and he had promised to help her.</p><p>For some reason, she had hated him at first sight, just as she\u2019d begun to hate everything\u2014herself, her hut, the world</p><p>\u2014but in her desperation, she had believed him. Now she wished she had run.</p><p>\u201cHave you. Forgotten how. I saved you? How the evil one wanted you dead, how I whisked you away before he could return? Don\u2019t make me ask again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cN-no, I haven\u2019t forgotten,\u201d she replied in that same lost language, the words trembling from her throat in a panicked rush.</p><p>\u201cGood. Nor wil you forget how the evil one infected you. Or what, exactly, the evil one is.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand the part about being infected, but the rest had been dril ed into her head. \u201cHe is a Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who kil ed your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Lord.\u201d Her voice was stronger now, a flash of mutilated bodies appearing in her mind.</p><p>A memory quickly fol owed, the Bad Man disappearing from view. A memory only three weeks old, and yet, it seemed an eternity had passed already.</p><p>\u201cYou were promised to someone,\u201d her parents\u2019 murderer had said, his voice eerie, unnatural, as he\u2019d splashed over the crimson river between their bodies. He was the evil one, and something in his voice had caused a blanket of ice to form around her soul. He\u2019d had no face, and his feet hadn\u2019t quite touched the floor. He was tal and thin, a black robe swathing him from head to toe, shielding every inch of him, floating around him and dancing in a wind she couldn\u2019t feel. \u201cThey should have kept their promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she\u2019d asked shakily, terrified and numb al at once. She had only stumbled upon this scene a few minutes ago and hadn\u2019t quite processed what she was seeing.</p><p>Now, looking back, with the Bad Man\u2019s warnings about the creature\u2019s evilness ringing in her ears, she quaked.</p><p>Despite her wonderings, the memory continued on.</p><p>\u201cWho I am matters not. Who you are is al that matters,\u201d the faceless being said. He scooped her up, obviously planning to leave with her, but she fought him with al her might. When he couldn\u2019t subdue her, he stabbed her. Once, in the side, barely missing vital organs.</p><p>The pain that consumed her was devastating. And yet, with the pain, more of that aberrant cold stormed to life, seeping from her. A cold that didn\u2019t just numb. A cold that raged liked a blizzard inside her.</p><p>And then, ice actual y crystal ized over her skin, seeping from her pores. What she was seeing couldn\u2019t be real.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t possibly be real.</p><p>As the creature strode outside the hut, stil holding her, she reached up and pushed at the face she stil couldn\u2019t see, skin meeting skin. He howled with an agony that matched her own.</p><p>For several seconds, neither of them could pul away.</p><p>Perhaps they were locked together, frozen by the ice. Then he dropped her, and she scrambled backward, bleeding, hurting. Stil howling, he disappeared, there one moment, gone the next. Leaving her reeling, uncertain of what had happened and how she\u2019d done what she\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to repay these Lords, my darling Hadiee?\u201d the Bad Man asked, drawing her back to the present. She didn\u2019t like him any better than she liked the evil one.</p><p>Another answer that had been dril ed into her head. One she wouldn\u2019t forget, one that was as much a part of her as her arms and legs. Perhaps more so, because it was a shield of armor around her, keeping her safe. \u201cSlaughter them al .\u201d They were murderers, after al , and they deserved to die.</p><p>A pause, silence, and then soft fingers briefly ruffled her hair. \u201cThat\u2019s a good girl. I\u2019l train you yet.\u201d</p><p>A split second later, the image inside Amun\u2019s mind changed. He realized he was no longer reliving a memory, her memory, but was now staring down at the girl. She was bathed in light, older, a woman now, and sleeping so innocently on a bed of silver silk.</p><p>There was something familiar about her name, even though he knew she had changed it. Hadiee then, but Haidee now.</p><p>There was something familiar about her surroundings, too, but his mind refused to bridge the gap from questions to answers.</p><p>She had a shoulder-length crop of pale hair that she\u2019d streaked with pink. Her face was lush in its femininity, despite the silver eyebrow ring she sported. Perhaps because her dark blond brows arched like a cupid\u2019s bow.</p><p>Lashes thick enough to be a raven\u2019s wing fluttered open, one moment fanning over the rise of perfectly sculpted cheekbones, the next framing eyes of pearl-gray, the next, fanning again. She fought to awaken, as if sensing his scrutiny, but failed, al owing him to continue.</p><p>Her delicate nose led to lips that reminded him of a freshly blooming rose. Her skin appeared eternal y flushed, as if she were constantly lost to arousal, the undertones kissed by the sun. No, he thought next.</p><p>Not just kissed by the sun, but sprinkled with its rays, as if she was lit from the inside, a thousand tiny diamonds crushed into her flesh. Not like the Harpies, whose luminous, multihued flesh rivaled the brightest rainbow. This woman, this Haidee, didn\u2019t actual y glow. She was simply beauty personified.</p><p>He could have watched her forever, he mused. She was his first glimpse of paradise in what seemed an infinite nightmare. But, of course, even this was to be taken from him.</p><p>Though he fought, the image shifted again, orange-gold flames suddenly fil ing his line of vision. Plumes of smoke curled upward, painting the acrid air with what looked to be a demon\u2019s breath.</p><p>A city burned in front of him, huts crackling as timber fel and grass disintegrated. Mothers screamed for their children, and fathers lay facedown in the blood-soaked dirt, weapons protruding from their backs.</p><p>Al of them wore the same type of clothing little Hadiee\u2014Haidee now, he reminded himself\u2014had sported. Dark, threadbare linen, rough and stained.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one watching the destruction. Eleven warriors stood at his sides, their eyes glowing bright red, their skin merely a mask that concealed the hideous monsters lurking underneath. Monsters with sharp-tipped horns knifing from their skul s, poisonous fangs jutting from their mouths, and oozing scales rather than peach-tinted flesh.</p><p>Their gore-covered chests lifted and fel with the force of their breaths, their nostrils flaring. Their hands clenched around blades as their thoughts invaded his mind. More.</p><p>They needed more. More flames, more screams, more death. For only when the entire world was flooded with the blood and bones of these precious mortals would they be satisfied. Fulfil ed.</p><p>Except...</p><p>Amun didn\u2019t want to kil just then. He wanted to return to the little girl. He wanted to hold her close and tel her everything was going to be al right, and that he would save her from the Bad Man. He wanted to return to the woman. He wanted to curl beside her and hear her tel him everything was going to be al right, and that she would save him from the demons.</p><p>And he would. He would return.</p><p>Amun struggled to reach her. He didn\u2019t care when skin tore and bone snapped. No, he welcomed the pain. Liked it, even. Perhaps too much. And he didn\u2019t care when flames rushed to him, licked over him, hundreds of spiked tongues leaking acid. He welcomed the sting, because with these newest wounds, the bugs in his veins were final y freed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They raced out, crawling al over his body, the bed.</p><p>The bed. Yes, he was atop a bed, he thought hazily.</p><p>Suddenly he could feel the shredded sheets underneath him, every savage gash carved in his muscles, the pain so much greater than before, and not so welcome now.</p> <p>Worse, steel pressed into his wrists and ankles, preventing him from stanching the flow of blood or shooing away the bugs.</p><p>Though every instinct he possessed shouted that he continue to fight, he forced himself to stop thrashing.</p><p>In and out he breathed, realizing the air was heavy and coated with decay. But underneath the rot, he smel ed something else...something crisp, like the earth. Pulsing, vibrant life.</p><p>And beneath the flames, he could feel the sweetest kiss of winter ice, soothing his burns, gifting him with tendrils of strength. What\u2014who\u2014was responsible?</p><p>He tried to open his eyes, but his lids were sealed shut. He frowned. Why were his lids sealed shut? And the steel...</p> <p>chains, he thought as the haze began to fade. Binding him, holding him prisoner. Why?</p><p>A startling moment of lucidity.</p><p>He hissed in horror, even as he clung to every thought now forming in his head, praying he continued to remember. He was Amun, keeper of the demon of Secrets. He had loved, and he had lost. He had kil ed, but he had also saved. He was not an animal, a brutal kil er, not anymore, but a man.</p><p>An immortal warrior who safeguarded what was his.</p><p>He had entered hel , knowing the consequences but wil ingly overlooking them. Because he couldn\u2019t bear to see his friend Aeron hurting, crazed with the knowledge that his surrogate daughter was trapped in hel \u2019s torturous blaze.</p><p>So Amun had gone, and had emerged with hundreds of other demons and souls al trapped inside him, writhing, screaming, desperate for escape.</p> <p>But he was home now, and he needed to die. Had to die.</p><p>He was a danger to his friends, the world. He would die.</p><p>There would be no comforting Haidee, nor taking comfort from the woman she\u2019d become, for he could never al ow himself to leave this room, his sanctuary. His coffin. And that, he found, was what he would mourn most. Whether he\u2019d encountered her soul in hel and absorbed her memories there, or had stumbled upon her years ago, her voice lost in the dark, thorny mire of his mind until now, he would never know. This was it for him.</p><p>This was the end.</p><p>Flames.</p><p>Screams.</p><p>Evil.</p><p>Once again they battled for his attention and threatened to overwhelm him.</p> <p>Amun knew he couldn\u2019t hold them off for long. Too demanding, so demanding... He focused on the earthy perfume and cooling breeze, head automatical y turning to the left, fol owing invisible threads wafting in the air.</p><p>Leading from this bedroom...into the one next to it? Power.</p><p>Peace.</p><p>Salvation.</p><p>Perhaps he could leave this room, he thought then.</p><p>Perhaps he could be saved. That smal sip of salvation, the barest taste...a frosted apricot, juice so sweet his throat would forever rejoice.</p><p>He just had to\u2014flames, screams, evil\u2014get there. Must...</p><p>fight. FLAMES. Amid the growing black thunder in his brain, Amun jerked at his bonds. SCREAMS.</p><p>Already torn flesh surrendered, and already broken bone dusted to powder. EVIL. But he couldn\u2019t pul himself free. He\u2019d already used up his strength, he realized. He had nothing left.</p><p>FLAMES, SCREAMS, EVIL.</p><p>As he slumped onto the mattress, he laughed silently, bitterly. He\u2019d lost, and so easily, too. He\u2019d truly, final y lost.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even cal for his friends. A single word spoken, a single sound made, and everything inside him would spew out, his clash against the evil al for nothing.</p><p>FLAMESSCREAMSEVIL.</p><p>Closer...closer now...</p><p>A shocking burst of hope as that sense of defeat shattered.</p><p>If he couldn\u2019t reach whoever was in that bedroom, perhaps he...she...they...could reach him.</p><p>As the evil swamped him once more, Amun shouted as soundlessly as he\u2019d laughed. Come to me!</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>COME TO ME!</p><p>The desperate male voice invaded Haidee Alexander\u2019s mind, a thriving fire amid a raging ice storm, dragging her from a cloying sleep and into total awareness. She jerked upright, panting, wild gaze scanning, mind cataloging her options in seconds, just as she\u2019d trained it to do since being captured by the demon. Unfamiliar bedroom with one window, one door, offering two possible escape routes.</p><p>The door, varnished to a luxuriant shine. Scratches around the handle, meaning it was wel -used.</p><p>Probably locked. The window, thick glass, unstreaked by hand or bird. The pane wasn\u2019t nailed shut, then. Couldn\u2019t be, not to maintain that level of cleanliness.</p><p>Window, best bet.</p><p>Alone. Had to act now.</p><p>Riding a cloud of urgency, Haidee threw her legs over the side of the bed and stood. Her knees instantly buckled, too feeble to hold her weight. Not normal. Usual y she could awaken and five seconds later be ready to run a marathon.</p><p>A this-is-the-only-way-to-survive marathon.</p><p>This weakness... How long had she been out this time?</p><p>She lumbered to a shaky stand, trying to find her balance as she replayed the happenings of the last weeks through her head. She\u2019d been overpowered by Defeat, the demon she\u2019d been hunting. He\u2019d carted her to what seemed a thousand different locations, trying to lose her boyfriend, Micah, and his crew of four. Hunters, al of them.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about that right now. You\u2019l lose focus.</p><p>Escape. That\u2019s what mattered.</p><p>She tripped her way to the window, but just before she tugged on the pane, she stil ed. In al their days together, Defeat had never left her side. He hadn\u2019t even trusted her to go to the bathroom or shower by herself, but here she was, on her own.</p><p>So, where was he now?</p><p>Two options. Either the demon had reached his final destination and was confident enough in the surrounding security to venture off on his own, or someone had stolen her from him.</p><p>Next thought: if someone had stolen her, they wouldn\u2019t have abandoned her. They would have wanted her to know their intentions. Good or bad.</p><p>So. Defeat had her where he wanted her. The door and the window were probably wired, so there was a very good chance an alarm would sound the moment she touched either one.</p><p>Would an army of demons come gunning for her?</p><p>Probably. But she didn\u2019t care. She had to try. Giving up wasn\u2019t in her nature.</p><p>Haidee gripped the warm edge of the panel and shoved.</p><p>Cursed. Nothing, no movement. Not just because her fingers were as weak as her knees, but because the pane was sealed. She\u2019d been wrong about the cleanliness factor, but at least she\u2019d also been wrong about the wire.</p><p>Stil . She\u2019d have to find another way out. And she would.</p><p>She\u2019d been in far worse situations than this and survived.</p><p>Hel , thrived.</p><p>Steeling herself, she peered outside to note what she\u2019d have to overcome once she left this place. The sun shone brightly, amber rays causing her eyes to tear. She wiped each drop away with the back of her wrist. No girly weaknesses al owed. Her prison rested high on a mountaintop, a barbed gate\u2014electric?\u2014stretching skyward and wrapping around the perimeter. She\u2019d encountered similar gates in the past and knew this one would be impossible to climb without inflicting so much damage she\u2019d die on the other side. If she even made it over.</p><p>Stil . There were hundreds of trees, each more lush and green than the last, their limbs stretching in welcome.</p><p>Those limbs would hide her, their leaves draping her and al owing her to search for a way to bypass that gate. And if there wasn\u2019t a way to bypass it, she\u2019d forgo cover and climb. Bottom line, death was preferable to staying here and being tortured by a demon.</p><p>Okay. So. New plan. Shatter the glass and shimmy to land.</p><p>Easy.</p><p>Yeah. Right. I\u2019ve never been that lucky. Haidee twisted and surged through the room, her steps not getting any smoother. Clearly, whatever drug Defeat had repeatedly injected into her vein stil poured through her.</p><p>Concentrate, woman. The spacious chamber boasted a king-size canopied bed with a white swath overlaying the top and fal ing to the floor like clouds sprinkled with fairy dust. A floral print love seat and a smal glass table perched in a tiny alcove, il uminated by a chandelier weeping with glittering crystal.</p><p>None of which she could throw.</p><p>To the left was a freshly polished desk and matching chair.</p><p>No paperweights or knickknacks rested on the surface, and the drawers were empty. To the right was a ful -length mirror surrounded by an ebony frame. Both were bolted to the wal . Next she tried the door.</p><p>As she\u2019d suspected, it was locked.</p><p>Panting, fury blooming, she kicked the bench at the foot of the bed. The heavy wood didn\u2019t move an inch. And shit, that hurt! She yelped, hopping and rubbing her stinging toe.</p><p>Someone had removed her shoes, leaving her barefoot.</p><p>Something she wished she\u2019d noticed before.</p><p>Damn, damn, damn. The luxury and wealth here made a mockery of the hovel she\u2019d scrimped and saved and final y managed to buy for herself, yet there wasn\u2019t a damn thing she could use to aid her escape. What the hel was she going to do?</p><p>Come to me!</p><p>The tortured, pain-fil ed voice overwhelmed her senses, the words like licks of fire, somehow heating her up. A voice?</p><p>Heating her? Could be a hal ucination, yeah, but she\u2019d seen and experienced al kinds of weirdness throughout her too-long life to simply write this off.</p><p>\u201cWho said that?\u201d She spun, fighting a wave of dizziness and automatical y reaching for the blades she kept anchored at her thighs.</p><p>Only silence greeted her\u2014and she sported no weapons.</p><p>Defeat had taken her knives, guns and poisons, foolishly thinking he\u2019d triumphed. But that\u2019s what he\u2014it\u2014did. Broke down the opponent through any means necessary, destroying al thoughts of achieving victory, no matter the cost of surrender.</p><p>Not that he\u2019d broken her.</p><p>He\u2019d learn. Haidee was unbreakable.</p><p>Come to...me... Weaker now, riding a tide of despair, but no less urgent.</p><p>Not a hal ucination, she thought. Couldn\u2019t be. That heat... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, who was he? A prisoner like her? There was something oddly familiar about his voice, as if she\u2019d heard it before and it had made an impression. Yet she couldn\u2019t specifical y place it. Was he a Hunter?</p><p>Had they met during training? At one of the thousand debriefings she\u2019d attended?</p><p>Come...</p> <p>Her ears twitched, and she turned, fol owing the sound of his voice this time, determined to help him, just in case he was a Hunter as she suspected.</p><p>Come...please...</p><p>There. She frowned. A wal . Was he on the other side? The fact that she\u2019d heard him certainly suggested he was nearby.</p><p>Slowly she approached the wal . She padded her hands along the smooth, delicate paper, finding no hint of a doorway, and yet... Haidee dropped to her knees, gaze zeroing in on a tiny gap between crown molding and floor.</p><p>A smal crack of light seeped through.</p> <p>No, not light. Not ful y. Woven with that stream of light and dancing dust motes was a wisp of black, a writhing phantom, curling up, inching toward her.</p><p>With another yelp, she scrambled backward. The black tendril fol owed her, avoiding her pants and her T-shirt to reach the skin bared at her wrist. But when it touched her, a screech rent the air and the...thing was sucked back through the crack, returning to the other room.</p><p>What. The. Hel ?</p><p>Had she just met one of the demons, stripped of its human cloak? Was that what tormented the man who\u2019d cal ed her?</p><p>Probably.</p><p>Her fight-or-flight instinct screamed flight.</p> <p>Haidee replied, Screw you, flight! I won\u2019t leave a man behind.</p><p>Teeth grinding, she scraped her nails over the wal paper until she created a groove. Then she began ripping, tossing the pieces she extracted over her shoulder. She worked feverishly and final y revealed enough of the wal to find the outline of the door.</p><p>No knob. Of course.</p><p>Through faint scrape patterns on the floor, she knew the door had once opened from the right. Which meant there would have been a knob at one point. She had only to find where the demons had spackled over the hole its removal would have left behind....</p><p>She scraped the center of the right side, cringing at the grating sound she created, until flecks of white chalk began to embed in her nails. Bingo! Clawing harder, deeper, she removed the spackle as fast as she could. Took half an hour to reach the other side, and by then, ice coated her entire body in a chil y sheen.</p><p>Her arms trembled violently, her sense of urgency increasing. She was swiftly using up her reservoir of strength and knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to stay on her feet much longer.</p><p>When she col apsed, she wanted to be outside, the man with her.</p><p>Haidee latched her fingers around the edges of the hole and jerked. The door eked open a mere fraction of an inch.</p> <p>Fighting disappointment, she gave another jerk\u2014only to be rewarded with another fraction. Get in the game, Alexander.</p><p>You can do this. Deep breath in, hold, hold... As she exhaled, she tugged so hard she feared her spine would snap. Final y. Real movement. Not much, yet just enough.</p><p>When the door stopped, it stopped hard. She lost her grip and fel to her ass.</p><p>Pinpricks of starlight dotted her gaze, but when the crackling orange and yel ow washed away, she focused on the gap she\u2019d created. A sweet sense of victory flooded her as she popped to her feet. Her knees rebel ed with every step forward, but she didn\u2019t pause.</p><p>She squeezed her way through the opening, shirt snagging on a sharp protrusion, then ripping as she just kind of fel into the other room. When she balanced, she quickly took stock, readying herself for anything.</p><p>Another bedroom, this one a mix of light and dark. There was a thrashing man on the only bed, smoke rising from him, undulating.</p><p>Her gaze locked on the smoke, and she gasped. It was as beautiful as it was horrifying. An ocean of crumbled black diamonds, punctuated by the occasional sparkle of paired rubies\u2014like eyes, watching, lethal y intent\u2014and damning flashes of white. Sharp, like fangs.</p><p>Come on, come on. Time\u2019s wasting. For some reason, looking away actual y hurt, shooting a pain from her temples to her bel y, but she did it, refocusing on the man and closing the distance between them. The moment she reached him, bile scalded her throat, and she nearly lost her last meal. Fruit and bread that Defeat had grudgingly given her. Al those injuries...</p><p>What had the demon done to him? Peeled him? Lit him on fire? He was\u2014</p><p>Oh, God. Oh, dear God. Eyes widening, she covered her mouth with shaky hands. No. No!</p><p>Despite the savaged body, the swol en, nearly unrecognizable face, she knew who writhed before her.</p><p>Micah. Her boyfriend. Same dark skin\u2014what remained of it</p><p>\u2014and same muscled frame. Same inky hair he constantly smoothed from his brow. No wonder she\u2019d recognized that battered voice.</p><p>Oh, God. The demon must have caught him while he\u2019d chased after her, trying to save her.</p><p>Tears rained down her cheeks, crystal izing into ice as they fel . She almost crumpled into a sobbing heap. She\u2019d dreamed of this man long before she\u2019d ever met him. Had loved him long before she\u2019d ever met him. She\u2019d thought him a memory that hadn\u2019t quite been wiped clean after\u2014</p><p>Nope. Don\u2019t go down that road, either. Those kinds of thoughts would paralyze her as nothing else could. Micah.</p><p>She\u2019d think only about Micah now. He needed her.</p><p>About seven months ago, she discovered he wasn\u2019t simply a memory or even a figment of her imagination. He was real. She\u2019d thought, Surely this is a sign we\u2019re meant to be together. A point further proven when they were both assigned to the same demon-hunting mission in Rome, and then again when he\u2019d asked her out, as attracted to her as she was to him. She\u2019d said yes without any hesitation.</p><p>Except the real man hadn\u2019t lived up to her imaginings.</p><p>There\u2019d been no bone-deep connection. No earth-shattering awareness. She\u2019d blamed herself, and rightly so, and had tried to force the bond. Because of her visions, she\u2019d known\u2014knew\u2014on a level she didn\u2019t quite understand that he would make her happy. That he was her future. That he could at last melt the unnatural ice that stil swirled inside her.</p><p>So she\u2019d stayed with him, al the while thinking the connection would soon spark. It never had. And though they were stil seeing each other and were total y exclusive, she\u2019d always held a little piece of herself back. She hadn\u2019t even slept with him yet. But now...connection. Sizzle. And it was everything she\u2019d expected to feel for him.</p><p>Here, now, she thought she might never again be whole without him. As if she\u2019d final y found the last piece of a puzzle.</p><p>Guilt suddenly swarmed her. She hadn\u2019t been the best girlfriend, holding herself back as she had, yet stil he\u2019d searched for her, stil he\u2019d chal enged a Lord of the Underworld for her. And now, he might die for her.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby,\u201d she managed to croak past a constricted throat. \u201cWhat did he\u2014\u201d they? \u201c\u2014do to you?\u201d</p><p>She reached out, the shadows hissing as they inched backward, away from her, away from him, as if afraid to be near her. She paid them no heed. As gently as she was able, she slid one of Micah\u2019s pulverized hands through the steel cuff that bound him. The amount of blood and the crushed bone al owed for an easy glide and also had her swal owing bile at an astonishing rate.</p><p>Could he recover from this? Could anyone?</p><p>Thankful y, her touch seemed to calm him rather than hurt him further. The thrashing became less violent, and he eventual y relaxed against the mattress. Haidee moved to the other side and freed his other wrist.</p><p>By the time his ankles were unchained, the slightest hint of a smile curled his lips.</p><p>Her chest contracted at the sight of it, both an agony and a blessing. He was damaged, but he was alive.</p><p>Would he be grateful for that, though? He might never be able to fight again.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. She had to save him.</p><p>Biggest problem: she couldn\u2019t carry him. He was too heavy.</p><p>And he certainly couldn\u2019t walk. She didn\u2019t have a medical degree, but she\u2019d bet a fortune that half the bones in his body were broken. Stil . She couldn\u2019t leave him behind, either.</p><p>She studied him more intently, praying for a solution.</p><p>Instead, what she found had her gasping in outrage. Those bastards! Of al the cruel things they\u2019d done, this was the worst. They\u2019d branded him. Etched a jagged-winged butterfly\u2014the mark of their demons\u2014into his calf. Just to taunt him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l make them pay, baby.\u201d Her hands coiled into tight fists, ready to strike. \u201cI swear it.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of her voice, he shifted, angling toward her. He even tried to reach out, the muscles in his forearm bunching with the strain. The action proved to be too much for him, and the arm hung uselessly.</p><p>A second later, the thrashing started up again.</p><p>Cooing, Haidee eased beside him and smoothed away the hair sticking to his brow, just as she knew he liked. The first moment of contact, she experienced a jolt of undiluted heat.</p><p>The ice that was her constant companion, a part of who and what she was, cracked. Droplets melted, dripping. Instantly Micah calmed, his sweat drying as if he\u2019d absorbed her deepest chil .</p><p>Nothing like that had ever happened before, and the sensation disconcerted her. A side effect of what had been done to him, perhaps?</p><p>Bastards, she thought again, her molars gnashing together.</p><p>In this life or the next\u2014and she was always given a \u201cnext\u201d\u2014</p><p>she would punish them.</p><p>Spiderwebs suddenly wove in front of her eyes, gossamer threads laced with a shot of fatigue.</p><p>Determined, she swept them away. She couldn\u2019t deteriorate. Not now. Micah needed her.</p><p>Haidee?</p><p>His voice startled her, but she quickly recovered. \u201cI\u2019m here, baby. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>A soft sigh echoed, a whisper of contentment. The breathy sound stroked her\u2014even though his mouth had never moved and his lips had never parted. Impossible. Right?</p><p>\u201cMicah? How are you talking to me?\u201d</p><p>Sweet, sweet, Haidee.</p><p>Again, his mouth hadn\u2019t moved, but again, she\u2019d heard him.</p><p>And she knew she wasn\u2019t imagining his voice. She couldn\u2019t be. She\u2019d heard him before ever entering the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That could only mean... Her eyes widened in astonishment.</p><p>He was speaking inside her mind. Had been speaking inside her mind the entire time. That was new for them, too, and far more disconcerting than the heat.</p><p>How was he doing it? How could the Lords have caused this?</p> <p>Reason it out later. \u201cI\u2019m going to look for weapons, okay?</p><p>Something, anything.\u201d Could she even stand? Her muscles were vibrating, her veins fil ing with sludge.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I\u2019m going to find a way\u2014\u201d</p><p>No! Don\u2019t leave. There was a panicked pause. Need you.</p><p>Please.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave the room, I swear, not without you, but I have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>No! No, no, no! Babbling now, his body tensing. You have to stay.</p><p>\u201cOkay, baby, okay. I\u2019m here. I\u2019l stay.\u201d Soft, gentle, the promise left her before she could consider the consequences. Not that they would matter. She would rather hand herself over to Defeat, gift wrapped on a silver platter, than cause this man any more grief. \u201cI won\u2019t budge from this spot. Promise.\u201d</p><p>Need you, he said again, barely audible this time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me. You\u2019ve always got me.\u201d She stretched out, mindful of his injuries, and curled herself around his fragile frame, offering what comfort she could. She knew what it was like to suffer alone. She didn\u2019t want that for him. Ever.</p><p>Perhaps this was even a blessing in disguise. Micah probably wouldn\u2019t survive his wounds if he left the bed anytime soon. And this way, when the demons returned\u2014</p> <p>and they would return, they wouldn\u2019t leave her for long\u2014she would be here to fight them, to keep them from hurting him even more.</p><p>Yeah, they\u2019d strike back and probably kil her. And yeah, she gagged, thinking of what would happen to her after that death, a fate so much worse than being stabbed, shot, or even burned alive. Al of which she\u2019d endured before.</p><p>She\u2019d told herself she wouldn\u2019t consider what happened after she died, but she didn\u2019t stop herself this time. Not even when fear swept through her, consuming her, chil ing her.</p><p>If she managed to kil any of the Lords, they would be eternal y lost, but she would be reformed, returned to the age she was now, minus any good memories she\u2019d built of this lifetime, consumed only with the bad, with the hate. It was an agonizing process that made her scream and beg and pray for an eternal death of her own.</p><p>A process that had taught her to avoid death at al costs.</p><p>But this time...she would die wil ingly, eagerly, taking as many Lords as she could with her. And then, then she could return for the rest of them.</p><p>Then she could avenge Micah.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>AMUN BLINKED OPEN HIS EYES. Or tried to. The action proved difficult, since his lashes felt as if they\u2019d been glued together. And maybe they had been. If one of his friends had punked him, he was going to retaliate. With scissors.</p><p>He kept tugging and final y managed to separate top from bottom. Immediately his eyebal s burned and watered, every thing around him seemingly smeared with Vaseline.</p><p>Worse, the light seeping in from the only window stil managed to lance his retinas like blade-tipped lasers. He turned his head away from the reflective glass and studied his surroundings as best he could.</p><p>He frowned\u2014and damn, that hurt, tugging and splitting multiple cuts on his lips. He was in his own bedroom, but...</p><p>there was a hole in the wal . A hole that led into the chamber next door. A hole he hadn\u2019t made, and to his knowledge, his friends hadn\u2019t, either. He liked to think they would have asked his permission before redesigning his room like that.</p><p>How was he here, anyway?</p><p>Last thing he remembered, he\u2019d been deep inside hel , fire crackling al around him as he fought evil spirits and basical y got the shit kicked out of both his body and his mind. Demon thoughts and human memories had bombarded him, like bombs going off inside his head, and they\u2014</p><p>Were stil there, he realized, frown deepening. The dark thoughts and memories were stil there, but though they were churning, agitated, they remained at a distance, as if afraid to gain his attention. Why?</p><p>A feminine moan stroked his ears, shocking him into concentrating.</p><p>Amun stiffened, his attention shifting again, this time landing on his mattress. Or what should have been mattress. Beside him was a woman. A very beautiful woman who was curled on her side, facing him, her warm breath caressing him. One of her arms was bent over his stomach, as if she couldn\u2019t bear to let him go, with her hand resting over his heart. Monitoring the beat?</p><p>That arm was tattooed from wrist to shoulder, completely sleeving her. He saw faces\u2014human\u2014each one glowing with life and love. Numbers, too. And dates, maybe?</p><p>Though, if so, some of those dates were from way back.</p><p>There were also names: Micah, Viola, Skye. And phrases: Darkness always loses to light and You have loved and been loved.</p><p>He knew her. Somehow he knew her. How\u2014</p><p>The answer slid into place. Haidee, the one from his visions, or whatever they\u2019d been. The little girl he\u2019d yearned to comfort, and the woman he\u2019d longed to touch. She was here.</p><p>How was she here?</p><p>He lifted his hand to smooth the pale hair plastered on her cheeks, and his muscle went death match on his bone, both aching in protest. Damn. What the hel was wrong with him?</p><p>As careful y as he was able, he moved his arm closer to his face, every inch an unsteady milestone, but not stopping until he had a clear look. Seeing the ruined flesh, the knotted muscle, he wanted to curse.</p><p>He\u2019d been chained, maybe tortured. By Hunters? Had they tortured the girl, and his friends had rescued her, too?</p><p>As rage sparked inside him at the thought of her mistreatment, his gaze returned to her. She hadn\u2019t moved, was stil sleeping so peaceful y. Dark circles marred the delicate tissue under her eyes. There were a few smudges of dirt lining her cheeks and a bruise on the underside of her jaw. Signs of wear and tear, but not torture. The rage muted to a low simmer.</p><p>She\u2019s fine. And you\u2019l defend her. Or rather, he would defend her until she healed and he had to send her on her way. He wasn\u2019t safe to be around anymore. Not for long.</p><p>For now, though, she\u2019s yours.</p><p>Suddenly she jolted upright, her gaze swinging left and right. \u201cWho said that?\u201d Without waiting for a reply, she threw her legs over the side of the bed and stood. She raced to the window.</p><p>What was she doing? Haidee, he mental y tsked, you shouldn\u2019t be running around like that. You need time to mend.</p><p>As if she\u2019d heard the thought, she spun around and faced him. Eyes of the sweetest pearl-gray widened as they studied him from top to bottom. \u201cOh, baby. You\u2019re getting better. Thank God!\u201d</p><p>Baby. She\u2019d cal ed him baby. The first endearment ever to be directed at him, and his ears soaked it up like nectar from the heavens.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to fal asleep. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She tripped back to his side. \u201cWe have to get out of here.</p><p>Can you walk?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think so. Both of his femurs were cracked, if not broken entirely. He recognized the heavy ache underneath the muscle. Besides that, he was home. He didn\u2019t want to leave.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. We\u2019l think of another way, then.\u201d Even as she spoke, she scanned the room a second time. \u201cI thought I\u2019d have to fight them from the bed, but they must not have come back.\u201d She offered him a fleeting smile. Fleeting, but like a ray of sunshine al the same. \u201cTheir mistake.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. That was the second time she\u2019d\u2014correctly\u2014</p><p>responded to something he hadn\u2019t spoken aloud. You...</p><p>hear me?</p><p>\u201cYes. I know, I know. It\u2019s weird.\u201d That gaze never stopped scanning. For weapons? An escape route?</p><p>\u201cI was surprised, too. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s happening, but I\u2019m grateful. If I hadn\u2019t heard you from next door, I would have left without you.\u201d</p><p>No one had ever heard him like that. No one. He\u2019d always been the one to know what others were thinking, and he found he was...uncomfortable with this new development.</p><p>How was she doing it? Could she hear everything? Al the secrets floating through his head? Could she even hear his whimpering demon? What about the others, the new ones who liked to scream? Or could she only hear what he projected at her?</p><p>\u201cCan you stil not speak?\u201d she asked gently.</p><p>Test time. He al owed the answer to form in his mind, but he kept a firm mental hold on it.</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d she insisted. She reached out and traced a fingertip along the seam of his lips, careful, so careful not to hurt him. The you\u2019ve-just-reached-the-freezer-section coolness of her skin delighted him.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard, he realized, even as he shivered at her silken touch. Such a surreal moment. She acted as if she knew him...liked him. Baby, he thought, dazed al over again.</p><p>No. I stil can\u2019t talk. He pushed the words at her, watching for the minutest reaction.</p><p>An angry sigh escaped her, and the corner of her lip curled in disgust. \u201cThose bastards. Did they do something to your voice box?\u201d Bastards? No. She\u2019d heard that time. Which meant there were limits.</p><p>Thank the gods. No one, especial y such an innocent human, should have to listen to the evil inside his head. No one, especial y such a fragile female, could survive its gloom. Even now, Amun wasn\u2019t sure he could.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what happened?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow you got here?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, slow, measured, trying not to open up any more wounds. Problem was, he was utterly covered in abrasions. The smal est action tugged too-tight skin and split scabs.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d Her next sigh was sorrowful. Her hand remained on him, as if she couldn\u2019t bear to sever contact.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l tel you what I know.\u201d</p><p>He nodded to encourage her, winced.</p><p>\u201cBe stil , baby,\u201d she said, al concerned mother hen and determined commando. \u201cJust listen, okay, and try not to panic.\u201d She drew in a deep breath, then slowly released it.</p><p>\u201cThe Lords of the Underworld have us. We\u2019re in a structure on top of a hil . Their fortress in Buda, maybe? I didn\u2019t see any landmarks to verify my suspicions. Though why they\u2019d risk bringing us here, I don\u2019t know. Last I heard, this was where they were keeping two of the artifacts. You think they\u2019d want us as far away from those as possible.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The artifacts.

But...</p><p>She thought she knew him, and he definitely recognized her. At least somewhat. He knew her name.</p><p>Haidee. Could picture her face softened by sleep, so lovely. He knew they\u2019d met somewhere, interacted in some way, but not where or when.</p><p>For once, his demon wasn\u2019t spewing out answers.</p> <p>This was so damn confusing, and his weakened condition wasn\u2019t helping. Maybe she had tricked him into thinking they\u2019d met, so he\u2019d be more inclined to help her. But again, how? Why? The artifacts?</p><p>Would anyone except a Hunter be after them?</p><p>His stomach twisted into little knots. There was only one way to find out the truth about this beautiful woman whose presence alone both muddled and cleared his brain. That way was dangerous, the possible consequences severe.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to go that route, but he didn\u2019t feel he had any other choice. Normal y he could read the thoughts of those around him; so far, he\u2019d heard none of hers, despite the fact that she could hear his.</p><p>Therefore, he needed to deepen the connection between them, push past any mental shields she might possess and peek into her mind, glimpse her memories.</p><p>Amun would be careful. He wouldn\u2019t let his demon wipe her brain clean\u2014the biggest complication of al</p> <p>. Secrets liked to play, to steal memories and leave the victims with nothing but static. Amun would pul away the moment the fiend tried to do so. Unless she proved to be a Hunter, of course; then al bets were off.</p><p>Gritting his teeth against the pain he knew he\u2019d feel, Amun lifted his arms. Gods, the sharp lance, the burn, worse than he\u2019d expected. When he\u2019d reached high enough, he al owed his hands to fal onto Haidee\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cStop whatever you\u2019re doing,\u201d she admonished. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting yourself.\u201d</p><p>Just that smal action caused him to moan and groan inside his head. Need...a moment. Must...</p><p>\u201cMust? What do you need, baby? Tel me, and I\u2019l take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Baby, again. She\u2019d \u201ctake care\u201d of it, of him, as if she cared.</p><p>Truly cared. He couldn\u2019t soften, no matter how much he liked the way she treated him. Touch your...temples, he said, guilt suddenly flooding him. He\u2019d just requested her aid for her possible downfal</p><p>Did she have any idea what he could do?</p> <p>\u201cYou getting kinky on me?\u201d she asked with a chuckle. She probably meant to distract him from his pain.</p><p>She did, just not the way she\u2019d intended. Her jest had his gaze fastening on her lips, imagining the thrust of her tongue inside his mouth.</p><p>His body reacted, blood heating, pooling between his legs.</p><p>Damn it! Just...need...temples.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019l help you.\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t know. Her fingers wrapped around his wrists, so cool, so welcome\u2014so steady\u2014and lifted without any hesitation. No questions about his motives, his intentions.</p><p>She trusted him absolutely. When his hands reached her temples, she flattened her palms, pushing his closer, providing skin-to-skin contact.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Such faith. Too much. He told himself he was disgusted by that, not delighted. It was a trick to distract him, surely.</p><p>Her lashes fluttered closed, and she nibbled on her lush bottom lip. Such straight, white teeth. Once again his body reacted. He wanted those teeth on him...lower...moving up and down on his shaft. He wanted her hands reaching out, tugging at his bal s. He wanted her tongue flicking over the slit of his erection, tasting.</p><p>I need to get laid, he told himself darkly.</p><p>The corner of Haidee\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cDo you now? I\u2019m invited, I hope,\u201d she said with husky entreaty.</p><p>Shit. She\u2019d heard. And she wanted to join him. Wanted him deep inside her, rocking them both to satisfaction. Don\u2019t think about that now. He\u2019d forget he needed to learn about her and simply drag her on top of him. Besides, she could be lying, purposely distracting him as he\u2019d suspected.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t if you won\u2019t,\u201d she said with a warm chuckle.</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cThink about having sex.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. He had to stop talking to himself. She heard every unshielded thought.</p><p>How did his friends stand him? He constantly read their minds, knew their every private\u2014and mostly pornographic</p><p>\u2014contemplation. They rarely chastised him, however, and never made him feel like a nuisance. He\u2019d always figured they didn\u2019t care. They must have found a way to hide their true feelings from his demon, though. No way they liked his ability.</p><p>He owed everyone in this house an apology.</p><p>Amun forced his mind to quiet and his own lashes to close.</p><p>He\u2019d done this a thousand times before, the process as ingrained as breathing. He\u2019d done it for Sabin, his leader.</p><p>For their cause. He blanked his mind and darkness enveloped him, then he concentrated on his senses.</p><p>Her skin, cool and soft. Her scent, so earthy. He could hear the rasp of her next exhalation...focused on the chil y breath wafting over him...al owed his demon to reach out...</p><p>Colors exploded, chasing away the black. Suddenly images began to take shape. He saw a sky of the brightest azure, a lush green meadow, untouched by time. A scattering of silver stones. Trees missing their leaves, but with sleek, twisted branches. Two little girls running and laughing, playing chase, both wearing lovely pink linen robes, flaxen curls streaming behind them. Sisters. Both possessed hearts practical y bursting with love.</p><p>Secrets purred in delight.</p><p>The reaction struck Amun as odd. Such an innocent memory, and not what the demon usual y favored.</p><p>Why did the fiend even care about this?</p><p>The image suddenly shifted, day replaced by night in an instant, leaving only one of the girls. Older now, her gray eyes sparking with tentative joy, as if she was afraid to hope but couldn\u2019t help herself.</p><p>Her skin was sun-kissed and glowing with health, her cheeks rosy with vitality. She wore a linen robe of lavender this time, flowers of the same color pinned through her hair.</p><p>Those curls...like ribbons of the very moonlight surrounding her.</p><p>This was a past version of Haidee, Amun realized as a gentle, spice-laden breeze caressed her. She stood at the edge of a veranda, looking down into a dappled, crystal ine pond. She bore no tattoos, no streaks of pink in her hair, no piercings; she was innocence and optimism wrapped in an utterly stunning package.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous, my sweet?\u201d a female voice asked from behind her.</p><p>Haidee turned, startled from her reverie. \u201cI love when you cal me that,\u201d she replied sincerely. \u201cEspecial y since you did not like me at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But that soon changed, did it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did. And yes, yes. I\u2019m nervous, but excited, too.\u201d</p><p>They spoke in Greek. Ancient Greek.</p><p>He\u2019d heard the language before, Amun thought, and recently. When? Where?</p><p>The scene continued to play on, and Secrets continued to rifle through Haidee\u2019s memories, dabbling here and there, the girl completely unaware. Then there was a purr, and Amun knew. Answers. His demon had found the answers.</p><p>No new images sprang up, not yet, but what the demon learned, Amun learned, too. Always. So, between one heartbeat and the next, he knew that Little Haidee and Sleeping Beauty Haidee were one and the same. They were this woman. And this woman was\u2014</p><p>Responsible for Baden\u2019s murder, he realized.</p><p>In a flash that lasted no more than a second, Amun saw Baden, hair soaked with blood and plastered to his scalp.</p><p>Bodiless. He saw Haidee\u2014Hadiee\u2014as she\u2019d once been, golden hair streaming down her back, naked, tanned skin luminous in the moonlight despite the hate radiating from her and the crimson-splatter al over her. He saw her friends, Hunters, swarming, battling his friends.</p><p>Horror blanketed him. The woman he\u2019d lusted after had helped kil his best friend. The woman he\u2019d thought to defend had helped snuff out the kindest soul he\u2019d ever known. The woman he\u2019d cradled at his side had destroyed the one man who\u2019d stood between easily broken mortals and feral, foaming-at-the-mouth immortals stil consumed by the evil of their new demons. The man who\u2019d said,</p><p>\u201cSave the humans, do not hurt them.\u201d</p><p>Baden had been the first to find himself in the darkness.</p><p>Baden had been the one to help the others do the same.</p><p>Baden... Baden... Amun\u2019s chest constricted so painful y, the barest hint of a gasp left him. He hadn\u2019t made a single noise as the new demons had ravaged him, over and over again, but now he was helpless to hold the sound inside.</p><p>Baden. Gone forever, because of this woman.</p><p>Each warrior had loved Baden like a brother, and each had felt as if they were his greatest confidant.</p><p>That\u2019s where the true beauty of the man had lain. His ability to captivate everyone around him. Which had been a miracle, considering the nature of his demon, Distrust.</p><p>Now, Amun held one of Baden\u2019s kil ers in his hands.</p><p>Cupped her temples as he\u2019d once cupped Baden\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Haidee asked him, al concern and sweetness. Her grip on him tightened.</p><p>His horror was fol owed by a quick burst of confusion. How was this possible? She\u2019d died. Hadn\u2019t she? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yes. Yes. She.</p><p>Had. Died. Hunters had used her as Bait\u2014dressed her up like a pretty, helpless dol , sent her knocking on Baden\u2019s door, begging for help. She had lured him straight into slaughter. The rest of the Lords had arrived just before he\u2019d lost his head; they\u2019d attacked. But even if they had arrived a few minutes sooner, they would have been too late. Al the pieces of the game had been set.</p><p>Amun remembered the blood, the screams. Remembered Strider victoriously lifting Haidee\u2019s head when the battle had final y ended, and like Baden, she\u2019d been without a body. Not even an immortal could recover from that.</p> <p>Otherwise Baden, more alive than anyone he\u2019d ever known, would have risen from the grave long ago.</p><p>Instead, the man\u2019s soul was trapped somewhere in the heavens.</p><p>The horror intensified to a shattering level. Amun couldn\u2019t bear to remember. Not this. Because the longer he wal owed in the past, the more likely he was to lose his tether on the other deep, dark emotion buried inside him.</p><p>Rage. He would destroy the fortress in a way Maddox, keeper of Violence, never had, ruining their home stone by precious stone.</p><p>His hands fel away from Haidee and flopped to his sides.</p> <p>Her past faded, as did his own, and he could only stare at her, this present version, hate blending with his horror\u2014</p><p>then completely overshadowing it. Yet even with that earth-shattering hatred flooding him, the lust remained undiminished.</p><p>His body simply didn\u2019t care what she\u2019d done.</p><p>The pink tip of her tongue swiped over her mouth, leaving a sheen of moisture. Dust motes sparkled around her, and with the pink streaks in her hair and the haze of his vision, she looked like an X-rated fairy-tale fantasy come to dazzling life. Her shirt hugged her breasts, and her nipples were pearled into decadent peaks. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d she breathed, unaware of the change in him.</p><p>What do you mean? The question snapped like a whip, lashing out before he could reason what to do, how to proceed.</p><p>\u201cThe...memories. Of me as a child, then as me as an adult, on the veranda.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d seen what he\u2019d seen, then. That had never happened before, either. And yet, she made no mention of Baden\u2014</p><p>but then, Amun hadn\u2019t truly pictured his friend, had he? No, not true. He had. There\u2019d been a split-second glimpse. She just hadn\u2019t noticed, then, the other memories holding her attention captive.</p><p>Therefore, she would have no warning, no way to prepare herself for his retaliation. And he would.</p><p>Retaliate. He needed to punish her, needed to hurt her. So very badly.</p><p>Stil she didn\u2019t seem to notice the darkness of his emotions.</p><p>Gray eyes wide, she shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve never remembered the good parts of my lives. Those memories are always taken from me.\u201d</p><p>Lives. As in, more than one. Had she been reborn more than once? Was she here to finish the job she\u2019d started al those centuries ago? To cause the destruction of everyone he loved?</p><p>How had she gotten here? Why hadn\u2019t she tried to kil him already? Why did she treat him with such affection? He\u2019d never had to wonder about someone\u2019s motivation before.</p> <p>He knew the truth, always. Knew what those around him most wanted to hide. This uncertainty was maddening, increasing the depths of his rage.</p><p>Answers first, he decided. Except, he had no idea how to urge her in that direction.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you did...however you did it...\u201d Wonder consumed her expression, lighting her up. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>With a shaky hand, she brushed a budding tear from the corner of her eye. \u201cThank you. I knew I\u2019d once had a sister, but I hadn\u2019t known what she looked like.\u201d</p><p>And the other vision? Could he trust a single word out of her deceitful mouth?</p><p>\u201cI have an idea, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Slowly she smiled, a vibrant smile of white teeth and untamed joy.</p><p>\u201cMaybe...</p><p>maybe when we\u2019re safe we can do this again? I can find out if I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>The smile he\u2019d seen before, that barest hint of delight, should have warned him of the devastating impact a ful -on smile would cause. It hadn\u2019t. He sucked in a breath, lost in her\u2014and never wanting to be found.</p><p>The gray of her eyes lightened so much he could see tiny flecks of blue. The rose in her cheeks deepened, his fingers itching to discover if the color warmed her flesh, or if those cheeks were as deliciously chil ed as the rest of her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t soften, he reminded himself darkly. Couldn\u2019t crave her in any way.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, suddenly unsure. She\u2019d final y noticed the change in him. \u201cYou\u2019ve never looked at me like that before.\u201d</p><p>How am I looking at you? Like he wanted to stab her? He would. Soon. For Baden. For the others who stil mourned the loss of their friend.</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m...edible.\u201d She leaned down, her breasts rubbing his chest, her breath fanning over his ear. \u201cI like it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He could only sit there, wanting desperately to grab her, hold her there\u2014to choke her, he assured himself\u2014but unable to make his useless body cooperate. Then, as if she hadn\u2019t just sent a thousand bolts of white-hot need\u2014to choke her\u2014through him, she straightened, returning them to the business at hand.</p><p>\u201cOkay. So. We can\u2019t leave yet, which means we have to prepare. Maybe...maybe we can blockade ourselves in here. That might buy us some time.\u201d</p><p>Leave? She meant to leave with him? Without the artifacts she\u2019d mentioned? Without trying to pry information out of him? That made no sense. Unless...</p><p>Prepare for what? His execution?</p><p>\u201cThe Lords.\u201d She popped to her feet and slowly spun. \u201cI\u2019l have to shut the door between the rooms.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, she rushed to the wal . She hooked her fingers around the edge of the \u201cdoor,\u201d and pul ed.</p><p>Scraaape.</p><p>Gradual y, the hole closed. Haidee then shoved the dresser against the exit he hadn\u2019t known about, preventing anyone from opening it from the other side. Wel , anyone of normal strength. She did the same to the front door, using his vanity.</p><p>Amun watched her, no closer to answers now than he\u2019d been before traipsing through her head.</p><p>Perhaps even further away. She was serious about protecting him.</p><p>Despite who and what he was.</p><p>\u201cIf you continue to heal so rapidly, and they continue to stay away, we might be able to fight them when they final y bust inside. We can escape. And I know, I know. Our motto is</p><p>\u2018die if you must, but take as many Lords as you can with you.\u2019 And I was total y prepared to do that when I thought you couldn\u2019t be moved. But sometimes it\u2019s better to get out and come back later, you know?\u201d</p><p>You hate the Lords? he asked, just to discover what she\u2019d say.</p><p>\u201cHate is a mild word, don\u2019t you think?\u201d She never ceased her efforts to blockade them.</p><p>She had told the truth. Shocking. Why?</p><p>\u201cI have my reasons, and you have yours.\u201d She attempted to wrench the mirror from the vanity. Hoping to shatter the glass and use the shards as blades? \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about them, remember?\u201d</p><p>No. I don\u2019t remember. Now, what would she say to that?</p><p>Final y she paused, her sharp gaze whipping to him. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember our past?\u201d</p><p>She thought they had a past. No. Should I? Careful y, he had to tread careful y.</p><p>Her eyelids slitted, evidence of the predator that lurked inside. \u201cI swear to God, baby. I\u2019l make them pay for every injury they inflicted on you.\u201d</p><p>Baby again. And she meant to seek revenge on his behalf?</p><p>He stil couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, soften, but something was wrong here. The knowledge changed the direction of his rage.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t pretending to like him; she actual y liked him.</p><p>And when Amun looked past his own emotions, he realized Secrets sensed no malice in her. Not directed at him, at least. And even as unreliable as the demon had been since Amun had woken up, he found he couldn\u2019t refute that.</p><p>Haidee\u2019s fingers curled over the mirror\u2019s frame so tightly her knuckles leached of color. After a few seconds of deep breathing, she released the wood and straightened.</p><p>What are you doing? he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe need weapons.\u201d Her gaze circled the room\u2014she did that a lot, he realized, and thought it was a defensive instinct\u2014before landing on his closet.</p><p>She strode forward, disappeared inside. He had multiple weapons stashed inside, but he knew she wouldn\u2019t find them. No one could hide things quite like Amun. What he wanted to remain unseen, remained unseen. Soon she exited with one of his shirts wrapped around her fist, and that was al . Stil , satisfaction radiated from her. Barely a second passed before she reached the mirror and punched, punched again, a hard jab, jab.</p><p>\u201cThey have a whole wardrobe in there,\u201d she said. \u201cThis room must belong to one of them.\u201d The glass shattered against that second thrust, and she released the material from her grip, letting it float to the floor.</p><p>One of them, she\u2019d said. As he\u2019d suspected, she hefted several shards, tested their weight, turned them in the light.</p><p>With a nod, she sheathed several in her pockets.</p><p>Haidee.</p><p>She jolted as if startled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Yes?\u201d</p><p>Who...am I?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know your name, either?\u201d A frown darkened her expression. \u201cYour name is Micah. We\u2019ve been dating for about seven months.\u201d</p><p>Micah, like the tattoo on her arm. Micah, her \u201cbaby.\u201d That\u2019s who she thought he was? And I\u2019m a Hunter?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Like you?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d So easily admitted, without a care. Unless she was a grade A actress capable of fooling a demon, she truly believed what she said, that he was Micah, a Hunter.</p><p>Knots formed in Amun\u2019s stomach, then sharpened into daggers, cutting at him. So there it was. Proof, by her own admission, that she was his enemy. He needed to kil her before she discovered the truth about him. Before she thought to fight him, to hurt him when he couldn\u2019t real y defend himself.</p><p>And as she\u2019d just locked them inside this room, effectively trapping herself in his presence, al he had to do was summon her over, wrap his hands around her pretty neck, choke as he\u2019d already wanted, and twist. He might be weak, the action might pain him, but he wouldn\u2019t back down. He couldn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Haidee, he projected to her, the word a croak, even in his mind.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t do it, part of him cried. She was sweet and lovely and utterly luscious.</p> <p>Secrets might even have whimpered, eager to return to her mind and play rather than destroy.</p><p>The other part of Amun recal ed her past deeds, her current motto. \u201cDie if you must, but take as many Lords as you can with you.\u201d The moment she realized he wasn\u2019t this Micah\u2014</p><p>Amun\u2019s hands fisted, how he despised the bastard...for no other reason than he was a Hunter\u2014she would attack.</p><p>There would be no stopping her if he failed to act. And fast.</p><p>Determined, he lifted his chin. Come here.</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>PANTING FROM EXERTION, those drugs stil playing havoc with her body, Haidee strode to the bed. She placed a sharp glass shard on the nightstand, within Micah\u2019s reach, then stuffed one under his pil ow. Never hurt to have two weapons at your disposal, rather than one.</p><p>Then she searched the nightstand, surprised she hadn\u2019t thought to do so before. She found al kinds of goodies inside. Toothpaste, a toothbrush, mouthwash, antibiotic ointment, bandages and wet wipes.</p><p>None of which made sense. Or had the Lords wished to torment Micah with what he couldn\u2019t have or use?</p><p>Wel , she would show them! She made use of the wash and wet wipes and helped Micah do the same, cleaning them from top to bottom, even intimately, which left her blushing</p><p>\u2014hel o, big boy\u2014then applied the ointment to his wrists as gently as she was able.</p> <p>He watched her, silent, his dark eyes intent but unreadable.</p><p>She hated that he didn\u2019t remember her or their relationship.</p><p>Not that there was a lot to remember, but months ago they\u2019d reached an understanding. They\u2019d get to know each other before they had sex, but they\u2019d get to know each other without discussing their pasts; they\u2019d also vowed that no matter what, they wouldn\u2019t see other people.</p><p>Why had he agreed to that? she wondered now. At the time, she\u2019d thought he respected her, hoped to ease her skittish nature. But had she not had those visions, she wouldn\u2019t have agreed to such an arrangement. Because with the restrictions laid bare like that, she realized they hadn\u2019t had a relationship.</p><p>They\u2019d had a tolerance.</p><p>That would change, she vowed. He\u2019d come after her, fought to get to her and endured horrendous torture on her behalf.</p><p>He deserved everything she had to give. So, she would give.</p><p>When she finished, she put everything back inside the drawer. \u201cNow. The shards wil cut your hand if you use them,\u201d she said, easing beside him, \u201cand with as much blood as you\u2019ve already lost...\u201d Her voice trailed off. She didn\u2019t want to remind him of his frailty. He was a warrior to his soul and might think to prove his strength if she pressed too forceful y. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, only use them if absolutely necessary. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>He might be healing physical y, and at an astonishing rate she couldn\u2019t explain, but her worry for him hadn\u2019t faded.</p><p>He\u2019d been savaged and mind-fucked in the most terrible way. He would be a different man now. Was already showing signs of change.</p><p>He\u2019d always been an intense man, and that intensity had deepened and darkened over the past few months, frightening everyone around him. Moods had blackened around him before he\u2019d ever spoken a word. Even hers.</p><p>Now, he was just as intense, but the darkness had faded.</p><p>He actual y lightened her mood.</p><p>Before, the thought of sleeping with him had disturbed her.</p><p>She\u2019d felt as if she would be cheating herself of...</p><p>something. The sizzle, she supposed.</p><p>And maybe if she\u2019d felt that sizzle she would have felt comfortable discussing her past with him. She\u2019d never told him that she\u2019d lived before, that she\u2019d died before. She\u2019d never told him what happened to her after she died. That she\u2019d lived far longer than her seemingly twenty-odd years.</p><p>That she\u2019d had hundreds of lives but couldn\u2019t recal any detail that didn\u2019t involve blood, pain and death.</p><p>That she\u2019d tattooed herself so that she would have some link to the good things that had happened to her.</p><p>To her knowledge, she\u2019d never told anyone.</p><p>One, she didn\u2019t trust people. Ever. Not even Micah, not ful y.</p><p>Two, when your business involved kil ing anyone with a supernatural ability\u2014because that ability could mean possible demon contamination\u2014you didn\u2019t admit to having a supernatural ability of your own. And three, the less people knew about her, the easier it was to return from the dead as someone else.</p><p>Yet, she thought she might like confessing al her secrets to this man. Even though he was more distant than ever\u2014</p><p>such clipped responses to her every word. Even though he was harder than she\u2019d ever seen him\u2014he\u2019d endured so much, yet he barely seemed to notice his pain. They were connected in a way they\u2019d never been before, and he\u2019d been so gentle with her. More than that, she felt safe with him. And desired.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d desired her before. But that desire had been tempered with a bit of hesitation. Now, nothing would stop this man from getting what he wanted. If she rebuffed him, she thought he might help her see the sil iness of that. In a good way, of course. His protective instincts were too honed for anything else.</p><p>Look how tenderly he had caressed her cheeks.</p><p>And there were physical differences, too, she realized. His lips seemed ful er, but of course, that could be from the swel ing. His lashes were definitely longer, his eyes now so black you couldn\u2019t distinguish pupil from iris. His shoulders were wider, the ropes of muscle in his stomach more numerous.</p><p>She knew the Lords had branded him with their butterfly, but what if they\u2019d done more than that? What if they\u2019d somehow possessed him with a demon and that\u2019s why he carried the mark? The moisture in her mouth dried as she recognized the possibility for what it was: likely.</p><p>Galen, leader of the Hunters, had found a way to pair a human with a demon. Maybe the Lords had, too.</p><p>Haidee.</p><p>She blinked as that husky voice penetrated her thoughts, then forced her suspicions to the back of her mind. Scaring a man in this condition wouldn\u2019t be wise. Or maybe he already knew, but didn\u2019t know how to tel her. Did he fear she would turn away from him if she learned of his possession?</p><p>Haidee, he repeated.</p><p>\u201cSorry. My mind wandered. Twice.\u201d She slid closer to him, not stopping until her hip met his.</p><p>He grimaced as he pul ed himself into a sitting position.</p><p>This close, she could feel the heat of his skin. So much heat she\u2019d never encountered its like. Another difference. He\u2019d never been this warm before. Otherwise, she would have final y given in and slept with him, even without the sizzle; she wouldn\u2019t have been able to help herself. Nothing was more delicious than the sweet burn of him.</p><p>Haidee, he snapped again.</p><p>Again she blinked into focus. She had to stop traveling these unwanted mental paths. \u201cSorry. What do you need, baby?\u201d</p><p>To touch you. He managed to raise his hands on his own this time and cup her temples.</p><p>More of his heat enveloped her, his skin like a live wire against hers. She shivered and leaned into his grip, practical y purring. Surprise flashed through his eyes\u2014eyes now flickering with sparks of red. Oh, yes, she thought, hopes plummeting completely. He had been possessed.</p><p>He knew. And he hadn\u2019t expected her to desire him.</p><p>Poor darling. As if she would ever betray him. He couldn\u2019t help what had happened, and she wouldn\u2019t reject him for it.</p><p>Besides, her war with the Lords had never been about their demons, but about their actions.</p><p>Micah hadn\u2019t infected her. He hadn\u2019t kil ed her family.</p><p>Blood, a river between her mother and her father. Both helpless...dead.</p><p>She shook off the memory before it could tug her into a pit of despair.</p><p>\u201cIf they did something to you, something...evil, I\u2019l help you through it,\u201d she told him gently, flattening her hands over his.</p><p>Touching him was definitely a need. \u201cI won\u2019t turn you in to Galen or Stefano. I won\u2019t betray you. No matter what. And if you start to...do things, bad things\u2014\u201d like lashing out, kil ing indiscriminately \u201c\u2014wel</p><p>, I\u2019l take care of you myself.\u201d</p><p>Merciful y. And only after she\u2019d done everything in her power to purge him of the demon.</p><p>She\u2019d loathe herself, would probably replay the act again and again with every new lifetime she experienced, but she would do whatever was necessary to save innocent families from the blood-fate hers had received. Even destroy herself and the only source of her happiness.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m tel ing you?\u201d she asked gently.</p><p>Again surprise flashed in his eyes, adding tiny pinpricks of amber light to the dark irises. Thankful y, the red was gone.</p><p>Something evil. Like...?</p><p>Another shiver danced through her. She was coming to love the times his voice drifted through her mind, as warm as his body. \u201cA...demon possession.\u201d He tensed. Tel me everything. How you got here. What your purpose is.</p><p>At least he hadn\u2019t flung her away for guessing the truth. Nor did he seem afraid of her. Good. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She lowered his hands to her lap, clutching them tightly. He didn\u2019t protest.</p><p>\u201cThe demon of Defeat, the one hosted by the Lord named Strider\u2014I don\u2019t know if you remember him from the pictures we\u2019ve seen?\u201d</p><p>Micah merely blinked at her.</p><p>She continued. \u201cHe was in Rome. He had the Cloak of Invisibility. We spotted him, chased him. He managed to capture me.\u201d Bitterness seeped into her tone. She\u2019d been such an easy mark. \u201cI think he meant to kil me, but for whatever reason, changed his mind. A few times, I even caught him looking at me like...you know, like he wanted me, but that can\u2019t be right. He detests me. Anyway, he brought me here. Put me in the room next door to you. I heard you cal ing and basical y clawed my way through the wal to reach you.\u201d</p><p>He offered no reply, but his expression was tense. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How long had he been here? she wondered as guilt torched her insides. She should have fought Strider harder.</p><p>Should have escaped and found Micah before he\u2019d been beaten. He suffered now because of her.</p><p>She\u2019d never be able to make it up to him, but God, did she want to try. \u201cMicah?\u201d Gaze never leaving his beautiful, savaged face, she scooted even closer to him. She placed their twined hands on his waist as she leaned in...closer stil ...and softly, gently, pressed their lips together. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re here. I\u2019m so sorry for everything that was done to you.\u201d</p><p>At first, he gave no reaction. Not to her words and not to her kiss. He stil didn\u2019t reply. Didn\u2019t flinch from pain or encourage her to deepen the contact, either. Then he stiffened, his fingers squeezing at hers. Then he inhaled deeply, as if he couldn\u2019t get enough of her scent. Then he canted his head and opened his mouth. Not just welcoming her, but encouraging her.</p> <p>Moaning, she slipped her tongue past his lips, past his teeth, and jerked at the sudden bolt of arousal that speared her. His taste was minty from the wash, but spiced with a dark drug, luring, tempting...demanding a response. A response she couldn\u2019t deny. Her breath grew shal ow, her nipples pearled and every cel in her body smoldered with the sweetest kind of fire.</p><p>More, she thought.</p><p>His tongue met hers, rol ed and coiled, danced and sparred, the heat spreading, intensifying. And then he was moaning, pressing more ful y, thrusting his tongue as if their mouths were having sex.</p><p>She\u2019d kissed him a few times before and had been disappointed in each of the experiences. This time, there was no disappointment. There was shattering excitement, sultry danger and heady bliss. Her fingers moved of their own accord, up, up, tangling in his hair. Soft, silky hair, the strands baby fine.</p><p>More, he said this time, the single word a growl inside her head.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d More. She never wanted this to end. She had a mind fil ed with bad memories, yet as she swal owed his exotic flavor, she was swept away by him, the past forgotten, the present a thril and the future something to anticipate. So good. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you. Don\u2019t let me hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Stopping\u2019s the only thing that wil hurt me. The kiss must have caused an adrenaline reaction in him, something, because the next thing she knew, he had enough strength to heft her up, forcing her to straddle his lap.</p><p>His erection pressed against her needy core, hard and thick, and she gasped. Good? No longer an adequate word. The earth freaking moved. Unable to help herself, she rubbed against him, arching forward and back. Each time she hit him, each time they connected, she released a groan of need. Nerve endings did the sizzling thing, pleasure rushing through her in heated waves.</p><p>More.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Her voice was little more than a needy whimper.</p><p>One of his hands dove past the waist of her pants and cupped her ass. Skin-to-skin, a white-hot brand of possession. His other hand rode up her spine and latched onto the back of her neck. In the next instant, he spun her, basical y tossing her on top of the mattress and looming over her, his weight smashing into her.</p> <p>The kiss never even paused. Over and over his tongue worked hers, feeding her the ecstasy she needed but also making her ache. Didn\u2019t help when his hips began a slow grind against her clitoris, that hand on her ass forcing her to rise up and meet him, to slide up and down his shaft. The friction burned, burned so damned sweetly. She\u2019d never experienced anything like this.</p><p>We shouldn\u2019t be doing this.</p><p>For her, it was too late to care about their surroundings, the danger. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>She would have laughed at how easily he\u2019d been convinced to continue, but at the moment she cared about only one thing. Climax. Her nails scoured his back, probably drawing blood. She tried to temper her reaction, to calm before she erupted, went wild and injured him further, but couldn\u2019t. The ache...was consuming her, driving her, fogging her brain.</p><p>\u201cI need...\u201d Haidee wound her legs around his waist and locked her ankles. He palmed her breast, rol ing her nipple between his fingers. Even through her shirt and bra, she could feel the heat of him. The fiery brand. \u201cI need...\u201d</p><p>Me. You need me.</p><p>AMUN WAS LOST.</p> <p>He\u2019d placed his hands around Haidee\u2019s neck ready to snap the bone in two. She\u2019d looked over at him with those eyes of pearl-gray, lashes long and sweeping, lips soft and pouty, pink locks of hair fal ing over her forehead. She\u2019d talked of saving him...then a dark emotion had claimed her expression. One he hadn\u2019t been able to read, but one he\u2019d hated.</p><p>She had leaned into him, somehow innocent in a way he\u2019d never been, apologized to him as if his pain were somehow her fault, and he\u2019d forgotten his body\u2019s wounds. His forgotten everything. He\u2019d been helpless to do anything but accept her lips against his. Then he\u2019d breathed her in and accepting hadn\u2019t been an option, either. He\u2019d needed to possess her. Own her. Taking everything. Giving everything.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t understood the desires, stil didn\u2019t understand them, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. The moment their tongues intertwined, his body had become a storm, and this woman had become his only anchor.</p><p>Now, al the demons inside him\u2014so many voices, so many thoughts and urges\u2014lurched frantical y, unable to remain at the back of his mind. They did not like her, had tried to hide from her, but now they were desperate to stay away from her. He sensed their agitation, their fear, but they were being pul ed toward her unbidden, as he had been. They resisted.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t resisted. He\u2019d simply given in.</p><p>Now he struggled to tether the demons, to keep them in place as Haidee writhed in his arms, the decadent chil of her skin teasing his palms. Soon he had trouble even remembering to do that. She was undiluted pleasure in his arms. A demon in her own right, consuming him, driving him.</p><p>Just then, he realized he didn\u2019t care that she was a Hunter.</p><p>Didn\u2019t care that she meant to harm his friends. That she had harmed his best friend. This was...necessary. She tasted like the Water of Life found only in the heavens.</p><p>Pure, fresh, crisp. And when she bit at his lips, no longer concerned with being gentle with him, too passion-crazed to care, like him, his thoughts derailed, realigning to his first goal: possessing her. Total y, completely.</p><p>He pried his fingers from her ass and slid his hand to the front of her. Panties. Cotton. Damp. Nice.</p><p>Mine, he thought next and stil didn\u2019t care about the consequences. He would care later. Tomorrow, maybe.</p><p>Here, now, she was his. Desperate to feel her most feminine core, he shoved those panties aside. More than damp. Slick, ready. Gods, the way she wanted him...</p><p>A groan rose from low in his throat and rumbled out. He stiffened for a moment, fearing what might fol ow even so slight a sound, but his mouth remained focused on Haidee and her thrusting tongue, no words forming.</p><p>Relaxing, he tunneled through her folds, found her clitoris and pressed with the heel of his hand. She cried out, hips shooting off the bed, nails scoring his back.</p><p>This is good. You like this. They should have been questions; they emerged as statements of fact.</p><p>\u201cYes, please. More.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her beg was a climax al its own. What do you want? What do you need? What else did she like?</p><p>\u201cYou. Just you.\u201d Her eyes were closed, her tongue swiping at her lips to find his taste. Oh, yes. She was as lost as he was.</p><p>Has it ever been this way before? Between us? The moment he asked, he stiffened. He didn\u2019t want to know. He didn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cGod, no. We were terrible before.\u201d</p><p>He fed her another kiss to show his approval, and that surprised him. Amun wasn\u2019t like Strider, possessive to the extreme. He\u2019d never minded sharing anything. Had never gone caveman on a woman before. Had never claimed one as his very own. Actual y, he hadn\u2019t had a lover in hundreds of years. To always know what they were thinking, what they truly thought of him, truly wanted from him... It had gotten old fast. So he\u2019d concentrated on the war with the Hunters and what he was good at: kil ing. But Haidee...</p><p>He wanted to be her best. Her only. Didn\u2019t want her thinking the old \u201cMicah\u201d was better. Didn\u2019t want her thinking about any man but Amun.</p><p>\u201cYou are...this is...amazing.\u201d</p><p>Gonna make you so happy you said that.</p><p>Amun worked his way down her throat, nipping, licking, sucking. Until he reached her nipple.</p><p>Tenderness was abandoned. He bit through the fabric of her shirt, tugging the little bud into the fiery heat of his mouth, even as he shoved a finger deep, deep into her sex.</p><p>Another cry left her, renting the air. Every muscle in his body clenched, savoring the sensation. Holy hel , but she clasped him tight. Seed leaked from the slit in his cock; he was hungry for her, for this, for more, so hungry. He added a second finger, moving in and out, in and out. She writhed, she begged some more.</p><p>The demons grunted hysterical y as they gripped the tether he\u2019d created, trying desperately to stay inside him as she pul ed at his hair\u2014as though she was pul ing on them again. And yet, agitated as they were, they stil could not overtake his mind.</p><p>Haidee\u2019s head thrashed left and right. \u201cSo close...just a little more...and I\u2019l ... I have to... I need...</p><p>Please!\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let the beasts near her. Not that they wanted near her; they were stil fighting. He should stop this, stop the madness, but he had to taste her. He needed to taste her. Life wouldn\u2019t be worth living if he didn\u2019t.</p><p>She was panting, little beads of ice crystal izing over her skin as he worked his way down. An oddity he barely registered. Sweating ice? Her T-shirt was rucked up to the middle of her bra\u2014cotton, white, pretty\u2014the flat plane of her stomach and the dip of her navel revealed. Gorgeous.</p><p>Had a woman ever been so gorgeous?</p><p>As he ripped the crotch of her panties, paving the way for his mouth, he licked into her navel. Her bel y quivered. Her knees pressed into his sides, squeezing. Had he been human, she would have cracked bone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kissed his way to her zipper. Barrier. He couldn\u2019t al ow a barrier. Another rip, and the pants were gaping open just like the panties. Then he was peering down at her, at a tiny triangle of pale curls, the rest of her pink and glistening. His.</p><p>Ready.</p><p>Liiick. Holy hel , he thought again. Nothing had ever tasted this good.</p> <p>Another cry left her, this one hoarse and broken. She released him to reach behind her and grip the headboard, her back bowing. Surprisingly the demons calmed, but only slightly, the pul on them somewhat eased, al owing them to go back into hiding.</p><p>The door handle rattled.</p><p>Amun was dimly aware of the possible intrusion but unconcerned. Liiick. Heaven and hel wrapped in temptation, leading him straight to his downfal . Addicting him. Consuming him. Owning him.</p><p>The door handle rattled again.</p><p>This time, there was a flicker of rational thought in his head.</p> <p>Someone meant to enter his bedroom. Friend? Foe?</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. He had to wait to finish tasting her.</p><p>The intruder would pay for that. Painful y.</p><p>Haidee must have sensed his growing disquiet, because she opened her eyes and said, \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d Her mouth floundered open and closed as she gasped in horror. \u201cYour eyes. They\u2019re completely red. Glowing.\u201d</p><p>What she didn\u2019t say: demon. She\u2019d known he was possessed, no matter what she thought his name was, and had claimed she would shield him from Hunters. But this must be her first true confirmation.</p><p>There was no time to placate her. Someone comes. He swiped the glass shard from the nightstand and whipped around. Haidee jolted upright, the spike of glass under the pil ow already palmed. She tried to right her ruined clothing as another rattle sounded.</p> <p>An instant later, the person on the other side decided to take things to the next level. Wood split from the hinges as the door was savagely kicked, the vanity in front of it skidding to the middle of the room.</p><p>A scowling Strider strode inside, knives in both hands. Al the demons inside of Amun danced into a sudden frenzy, Haidee forgotten, rushing back to the surface. Torment...</p><p>punish...pain...blood...suffering...must have. Needed.</p><p>Something else struck him. Something that had nothing to do with the demons, but everything to do with a long-buried instinct. Safeguard. He would safeguard the girl. Her taste was stil in his mouth, and he needed more. Stil had to have more. If she were hurt, he couldn\u2019t have more.</p><p>Wrong, that thought was wrong, but he couldn\u2019t banish it.</p><p>Instinct demanded; he heeded. Go! he mental y screamed at the warrior, but Strider didn\u2019t hear him. Or didn\u2019t care.</p><p>When Strider spotted Amun and Haidee on the bed, lower bodies stil twined around each other, he blinked. His jaw even dropped. And if Amun wasn\u2019t mistaken, there was a flicker of fury over his expression.</p><p>Wil safeguard, Amun thought, scowling at his friend. No matter what.</p> <p>\u201cYou bitch,\u201d the warrior growled to Haidee. \u201cWhat the hel did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>HAIDEE JUMPED TO SHAKY LEGS, breath sawing in and out of her mouth. As she\u2019d predicted, the glass shard she held had already sliced through skin, blood dripping to the floor. She barely noticed the sting or the loss.</p><p>Without her there to cushion him, Micah hit the mattress face-first and grunted, but she paid him no heed. She couldn\u2019t. Not if she wanted to get him out of this fortress alive.</p><p>And shit! This showdown couldn\u2019t have happened at a worse time. Desire stil pumped through her veins, thick and heavy, dul ing her reactions and making her limbs feel weighted with rocks. Her chest felt hol owed out, and her muscles ached. Perhaps she could have dealt with those things, but her mind was as clouded as if she\u2019d popped a dozen different pil s, a mix of sedatives, stimulants and aphrodisiacs.</p><p>She could only blame Micah. His kisses had been CPR to her soul. He\u2019d made her come alive. Split apart. Forget everything and every one. Common sense had abandoned her. So had survival instinct.</p><p>She\u2019d never ignored her survival instinct before. Al she\u2019d been able to think about was him. His touch, his taste. His tongue lapping between her legs. God, she could fly apart simply thinking about that heady caress. In seconds, he\u2019d reduced her to an animal state, where nothing had mattered but sensation.</p><p>Now isn\u2019t the time, remember? The doorway was open, offering a straight shot into the hal way. Either she or Micah could run, but not both. One of them had to deal with the demon.</p><p>Hopeful y Micah would understand what she wanted him to do.</p><p>\u201cNot smart, coming in here on your own,\u201d she said to taunt the Lord into an emotional response. What she\u2019d learned about him during their time together? He was always quick to anger, and that anger made him easily distractible. \u201cYou ready to die?\u201d</p><p>For once, he didn\u2019t react. His gaze darted from her to Micah, Micah to her. He radiated a mix of rage, concern and disbelief.</p><p>Micah didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t Micah moving? Damn it. If he would move, she could attack. Defeat would have to fight her. Micah was simply too weak to see to the battle himself.</p><p>She opened her mouth to chal enge Defeat but closed it with a snap. She\u2019d chal enged him a few times during their trek. Bet you can\u2019t catch me if you let me go. He\u2019d let her go. And he\u2019d caught her, pissed beyond imagination. Bet you can\u2019t just stand there while I stab you. He\u2019d let her stab him. And rather than pass out from blood loss, as she\u2019d hoped, he had then returned the favor. He\u2019d stabbed her thigh to keep her from bolting while he healed.</p><p>He\u2019d then stitched her up, shocking her. Stil . His determination to win every chal enge gave him strength, more so than usual, and she couldn\u2019t have him stronger than usual right now. Not while she battled the fog. So, as they stood there facing each other, both deliberating how to handle the coming fight\u2014and there would be a fight\u2014she was very careful not to issue another chal enge. Not even a chal enge to lose the fight.</p><p>She\u2019d made that mistake only once.</p><p>Bet you can\u2019t lose a fistfight to a girl.</p><p>He had al owed her to punch him, and he hadn\u2019t fought back. Therefore in his mind, he had just lost a fistfight with a girl. She\u2019d run off while he\u2019d struggled to breathe\u2014\u2019cause yeah, she\u2019d gone for his trachea\u2014and he\u2019d had to track her down. When he final y caught her, he\u2019d trussed her up like a Thanksgiving turkey, gagged her and started drugging her.</p><p>And if she had tried to speak past her gag, he would have removed her voice box. No question.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel did you do to him?\u201d Defeat repeated, dark, deadly.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do to him?\u201d She assumed attack position: legs apart, knees slightly bent and ready for her leap. The cold, already so much a part of her, seeped out, sheened her skin. With every exhalation, mist created a cloud in front of her face. Al the while, she mourned the loss of Micah\u2019s heat.</p><p>She stil didn\u2019t know why she froze like this. Stil didn\u2019t know how. Al she knew was that the ability manifested with her emotions, sometimes strengthening her, something weakening her. Today, she felt empowered.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she went on. \u201cWhat the fuck did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you hurt him...\u201d A muscle ticked below his dark blue eyes, and he final y kicked into motion. If she hurt him?</p><p>What a joke! \u201cThis is gonna be fun. I\u2019ve been craving a go at you.\u201d One step, two, she moved toward him, determined to meet him in the middle.</p><p>No!</p><p>In a sudden blur of motion, Micah sprang from the bed and flew past her, tackling the demon-possessed warrior and sending both men toppling to the floor. Grunts and groans soon echoed. Slashing arms and vicious kicks ensued.</p><p>They rol ed, they struggled, they assaulted each other ferociously.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen Micah fight so dirty. He went for the eyes, the throat and the groin, biting and ripping flesh, fists hammering. Defeat, though, merely deflected each of her man\u2019s blows. He never tried to cause harm. Why?</p><p>Something else she\u2019d never seen\u2014a Lord of the Underworld backing down. And this one, Defeat...</p><p>Something was wrong. Had to be.</p><p>Haidee stood there, numb, watching the bloodbath, sick to her stomach and unsure what to do.</p><p>Apparently, he\u2019s not too weak after al . Like him, she didn\u2019t run from the room.</p><p>God help her, she wasn\u2019t leaving without him.</p><p>What should she do? If she threw herself into the fray, she might cut Micah instead of the Lord. They were moving so quickly...twisting and turning, flying apart, springing back together. And if she accidental y delivered Micah\u2019s death-blow...</p><p>Damn it. What the hel should she do? she wondered again, no closer to an answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d Defeat demanded between punches. \u201cStop. Amun, you have to stop.\u201d</p><p>Amun?</p><p>She\u2019d heard the name before, knew it belonged to one of the Lords, but she couldn\u2019t connect the name with a face.</p><p>And because she had memorized al the names and faces of her enemy, she knew that could only mean one thing.</p><p>There was one immortal warrior the Hunters had never been able to photograph or even sketch throughout the years. Not that they hadn\u2019t tried. They\u2019d snapped pictures, but those pictures had never turned out, had always been blurry. And when they\u2019d drawn what they\u2019d thought was his face, they\u2019d later realized they\u2019d done nothing but scribble on the page.</p><p>Amun was also the Lord most people forgot the moment they walked away from him. He was the immortal the Hunters knew the least about. Maybe because Amun was possessed by the demon of Secrets.</p><p>Al the Hunters real y knew about him? He had dark hair and dark eyes, and he was tal and muscled.</p><p>That little bit of information had been acquired through centuries of observation.</p><p>Had this Amun died, his demon given to Micah? Did Micah now carry Secrets inside him? Was that why the Lords had chosen Micah? And he was demon-possessed. She no longer had any doubts about that. Those red eyes...peering down at her...hungry...craving...raging... She shuddered, then scowled.</p><p>This was another sin to heap on an already mountainous pile. Another crime to hate the Lords for. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Had they wanted someone with the same physical characteristics as their friend Amun? Probably. How amused they must have been, using a Hunter to house one of their disgusting demons.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about that, either. Get yourself in the game, woman.</p><p>Haidee shook her head, clearing her mind, thankful y thinning the fog. The two men were on their feet now, throwing punches, fal ing backward into the wal s, causing dust and plaster to waft through the air, then reconnecting and tossing each other into furniture. They were a blur of motion, brutal, like wild animals fighting over the only snack in the jungle. Wood chips were scattered across the floor, some even swimming in little pools of blood.</p> <p>Blood, a river between her mother and her father. Both helpless...dead.</p><p>Again she had to shake her head, dislodging the memory.</p><p>\u201cAmun,\u201d Defeat snarled. \u201cFor gods\u2019 sake! I\u2019m your goddamn friend. What the hel are you doing?\u201d</p><p>In the next instant, Micah\u2019s thoughts hit her. Must kil . Must safeguard.</p><p>The words were sluggish, lower in volume than the ones that had come before them, and she realized he was weakening. His wounds were opening, seeping, dripping al over the room.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Hunter,\u201d the demon continued in that outraged tone, \u201cand she\u2019s my prisoner.\u201d</p><p>Mine! blasted through her head. Not yours. Never yours.</p><p>Mine to safeguard.</p><p>Could Defeat hear him? Probably not. Otherwise, he would have been backing out of the bedroom and running for his life. There had been barbwire in Micah\u2019s tone, the tips laced with poison.</p><p>But then, Micah\u2019s thoughts switched direction. I have to stop this. Why am I doing this? I love this man.</p><p>Confusing, wrong, but again, those thoughts switched direction. Must kil . Must safeguard.</p> <p>Micah snarled low in his throat, the sound rumbling through her mind as he punted Defeat into the already crushed vanity. More wood chips scattered. Red sparked in Defeat\u2019s eyes, a gnarled mask of bone and scales fal ing over his features.</p><p>He was turning, she thought with dread. From immortal to demon.</p><p>\u201cWin,\u201d he growled now, and there was another voice fused to his. One that was guttural, raw.</p><p>Determined.</p><p>Shit. She knew that determination. No longer would he pul his punches or deflect Micah\u2019s. Now he would fight to win.</p><p>He closed the distance and threw his meaty clubs around, a jackhammer of lethal purpose. Not once did he miss. Micah weakened further, wobbling on his feet, his eyes beginning to swel shut as his head whipped left then right, alternating as Defeat switched fists.</p><p>The fact that Micah had lasted this long was astonishing, proof of his own determination, but he wouldn\u2019t last much longer. He couldn\u2019t. Not at the rate Defeat was delivering blows, and not with the already ravaged condition of his body.</p><p>She had to risk hurting Micah, she decided. There was no other way. Which meant she had to put herself in front of him, probably take a few blows before she was able to strike. No problem there.</p> <p>Better she die than him, even though he was now tainted.</p><p>He was tainted, yes, but he wasn\u2019t evil. That kiss...no, he wasn\u2019t evil. And if she was kil ed this day, she would come back; she would remember him. Not the kiss, that had been too good, and al her favorite things were always wiped, but this fight. She would recal the blood, her fear...her despair.</p><p>But if Micah died, he would be gone forever.</p><p>Haidee stiffened, preparing to jump, waiting for the perfect moment. A thought suddenly hit her and she hesitated. If Micah turned his sights on her or even struck her accidental y... Oh, God. If she died, she wouldn\u2019t remember why he\u2019d done so when she awakened, only that he had\u2014</p><p>and she would come back to kil him just as she planned to come back and kil the others. If he survived this, they would be enemies.</p><p>Defeat landed a particularly vicious blow to Micah\u2019s side, causing him to wheeze.</p><p>Worth the risk, she decided in the next instant. He was teetering...fal ing...</p><p>At last Haidee jumped forward, hooked her arm around Micah\u2019s waist and threw him with al her might.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, baby. As he stumbled to his knees\u2014away from the action</p><p>\u2014she used her momentum to spin and duck, swinging her right fist at Defeat\u2019s groin. Contact. He doubled over, oxygen bursting from his bleeding lips. She used her other hand, the one clutching the fragment of glass, to slice across his stomach. No mercy.</p><p>As she straightened, she landed a hard right to his chin. His head jerked backward, and he grunted, blood and teeth spewing. She aimed the glass at his throat, but only managed to slash his shoulder as he pivoted.</p><p>His narrowed gaze landed on her. He could have hit her just then. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Firm hands suddenly gripped her waist from behind and tossed her. Through the air she soared, flailing for an anchor, wondering what the hel had just happened. The makeshift weapon flew from her clasp, then she was bouncing on the bed, realization setting in. Micah was aware enough to know who she was, aware enough to want her out of harm\u2019s way. Sweet of him, but that wasn\u2019t going to stop her. He\u2019d done his part. Now she would do hers.</p><p>Before the bouncing stopped, she was throwing her legs over the side of the bed and straightening, once again intending to knock Micah out of way. Only, she saw that he had somehow tackled Defeat and now straddled the warrior\u2019s prone body, punching...punching...</p><p>Between whaling fists, Defeat groaned and babbled.</p><p>\u201cLost...lost...no, gods, no...lost...\u201d</p><p>For several moments, she could only blink, watch. Micah had done it. Despite his injuries, he\u2019d won.</p><p>Against an immortal. That\u2019s my man.</p><p>Seriously? You\u2019re going to victory lap now? Haidee forced herself into motion and rushed to Micah.</p><p>She latched onto his surging elbow. He could have shrugged her away, batted her off, could have swung at her with his other arm, but he didn\u2019t. He faced her. What she could see of his glowing red eyes locked on her, tormented, agonized.</p><p>Didn\u2019t want to hurt him...couldn\u2019t stop...couldn\u2019t let him hurt you.... Why couldn\u2019t I let him hurt you?</p><p>The words echoed in her mind. Didn\u2019t want to hurt him. Why couldn\u2019t I let him hurt you? Courtesy of the demon? Was the demon trying to convince him that he liked the Lords?</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter, she supposed. They\u2019d deal with it. Later.</p><p>Along with everything else.</p><p>\u201cCome on. We don\u2019t want to free his demon right now.\u201d She tugged him to his feet, and God, he was heavy. \u201cWe have to leave before the others come.\u201d They\u2019d be pissed when they saw what had been done to their friend. She didn\u2019t want Micah punished for that. And they would punish him. She had no doubt. Even though he was currently part of their group.</p><p>She ushered him to the doorway but had to pause there to wind her arm around his waist. He was stumbling, barely able to remain standing on his own.</p><p>\u201cYou can do this, baby. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Where are...we...going?</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re lucky, no one wil be around and we\u2019l find a way outside.\u201d Dragging him through the doorway left her shaking and ice-sweating. He was bleeding al over her, giving her more and more of his massive weight. How she maintained her grip, she didn\u2019t know. What she did know after taking two steps to the right?</p><p>They weren\u2019t lucky.</p><p>Her eyes widened as she stumbled to a halt, Micah moaning, nearly fal ing. She held tight. They were surrounded\u2014but not by the demons she\u2019d expected.</p><p>Robed warriors fil ed the entire enclosure, wings of white and gold outstretched. Scowls lined every single one of their faces, but even stil those faces were glorious, radiant.</p><p>So beautiful...so majestic...dazzling her. She couldn\u2019t look away. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t look away. Exquisite...</p><p>Angels. These men were angels.</p><p>Maybe she and Micah were lucky. Maybe Galen had sent reinforcements to rescue them.</p><p>\u201cHelp us,\u201d she beseeched. \u201cThe demons captured us, and we\u2019re trying to escape.\u201d</p><p>A lovely dark-haired male stepped forward, hard gaze pinning her in place more forceful y than any of the others.</p><p>\u201cWe were told to wait out here.\u201d His voice was just as thril ing as his face. A sensual breeze, an exotic caress.</p><p>\u201cWe did so. We were told not to interfere with what happened inside the room. We did not. But now you have come to us. Now we interfere.\u201d</p><p>Realization cut like a knife. The angels hadn\u2019t been sent by Galen. They were helping the demons.</p><p>Horror barely registered before Micah was ripped from her grip. She\u2019d never seen the angels move, had been too riveted by the one in front of her, but losing her man snapped her from that lost, dreamy haze.</p><p>With a scream of outrage, she kicked the angel in the chest. He stumbled backward only a few steps.</p><p>She spun, reaching for Micah. Her voice must have snapped him out of his pained, weakened stupor, because, as two angels dragged him down the hal , farther and farther away from her, he blinked open his swol en eyes.</p><p>When he spied the distance between them, he roared.</p><p>Loud and long and ragged, but only she seemed to hear him. No one else paid him any attention, no one else cringed. As she elbowed her way to him, the angels attempted to grab her. She twisted and squirmed for freedom.</p><p>Al the while, Micah fought his captors. Soon, the two holding him weren\u2019t enough. Soon, she wasn\u2019t pegged as the biggest threat. The angels turned their attention to the warrior, al but one needed to subdue him.</p><p>Haidee! Haidee!</p><p>Before she could reach him, the one that had remained behind caught her, strong arms banding around her and squeezing tight. Breathing became a thing of the past. Stil .</p><p>Her struggles never ceased.</p><p>Micah\u2019s didn\u2019t either, she noted as she was at last carted out of the hal . \u201cI\u2019l come back for you,\u201d she screamed. \u201cI swear I\u2019l come back.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>STRIDER FUCKING hurt.</p><p>He hurt everywhere but especial y his gut. Maybe because Ex had sliced him open from hip to hip, spine to navel. The angels had had to stuff his insides back, wel , inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019d even stitched him up and tended his feverish, sweat-drenched body for three solid days.</p><p>He would have healed sooner if he\u2019d won the fight with Amun and Ex like a big boy. But he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>He\u2019d lost. And so his pain had been magnified a thousandfold, and he\u2019d been too weak to do a damn thing about it. Talk about humiliating!</p> <p>Now he was stil bed-bound and propped against pil ows, but at least he was awake and aware. His demon was silent, too afraid to poke his head from the shadows of Strider\u2019s mind and lose another chal enge until they\u2019d recuperated sufficiently.</p><p>Torin sat in a chair in the far corner, and Zacharel, the black-haired angel Lysander had left in charge, leaned against one of the metal posters of Strider\u2019s bed. Both were watching him, waiting. Clearly impatient.</p><p>Could a guy not suffer in peace?</p><p>This room was supposed to be his sanctuary, his private escape, but he\u2019d opened his eyes a little while ago to find Torin pacing beside him\u2014and not out of concern, the curious bastard. Zacharel had been exactly as he was now.</p><p>Unmoving, gaze penetrating.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Zacharel asked. His voice mesmerized even as it repel ed. The undertones were lilting, almost melting\u2014and yeah, it was stil embarrassing as shit the way Strider reacted to these angelic beings\u2014but everything else about that voice was cold, uncaring, detached.</p><p>Like his eyes. A vivid jade-green, they should have been welcoming, should have reminded Strider of summer. Or hel , even of Torin\u2019s wicked sense of humor. Instead, those eyes were green ice. There was nothing inside them. No emotion of any kind. Not good, not bad, just a spiraling abyss of emptiness.</p><p>Strider had met some freaky immortals over the centuries, had thought he\u2019d seen everything, but this one...no. There were none like him. Nothing fazed him. Strider had a feeling he could stab the angel in the heart and Zacharel would merely glance down before continuing on with whatever he\u2019d been doing.</p><p>\u201cDemon. Concentrate. What happened?\u201d Zacharel again, and he didn\u2019t raise his voice in the slightest.</p><p>See?</p><p>Emotionless.</p> <p>\u201cFor gods\u2019 sake, Strider,\u201d Torin snapped. \u201cOpen your damn mouth and form some words. While you\u2019re at it, stop staring at the angel like he\u2019s a tasty treat.\u201d Not so emotionless.</p><p>Strider\u2019s cheeks warmed with a flush. He\u2019d leave the tasty treat comment alone since he was too foggy to come up with a decent response. And no, Zacharel didn\u2019t react to it.</p><p>\u201cI went to the girl\u2019s room. She wasn\u2019t there, but I saw where she\u2019d peeled back the wal paper and found an old doorway that led into Amun\u2019s bedroom. She barred it. So I went to his door, but she\u2019d barred it, too. That one I kicked in.\u201d And he\u2019d expected to find Amun headless. Or, at the very least, Haidee under the dark influence of Amun\u2019s new demons.</p><p>The rage he\u2019d felt at the prospect...the despair. And yet, neither had compared to the jealousy he\u2019d experienced when he\u2019d discovered the truth. A jealousy that had shamed him. One, he couldn\u2019t be attracted to Ex. Two, Amun was his friend. He should have sheltered him from the temptress\u2019s wiles.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Torin prompted, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cAnd he was awake, lucid.\u201d At least for a little while. Until Strider had approached the girl. Then Amun the Demonical y Insane had returned. \u201cSurprisingly, the black phantoms were gone and stayed gone.\u201d He didn\u2019t mention that Amun had been on top of Ex, with his hand down her pants, his face aflame with pleasure.</p><p>Hers had been, too. So much pleasure.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t fought the warrior. She had encouraged him, begged for more. A trick, Strider had thought.</p> <p>Surely she had planned to lure Amun into a false sense of security and then strike.</p><p>But when Strider had approached her, determined to stop her from hurting his friend, Amun had attacked him. And when Strider had tried to defend himself, Ex had attacked him. To aid Amun.</p><p>What the fuck, man? He hadn\u2019t understood at the time; he\u2019d been too busy trying not to die. Now he thought he got it. Ex had wanted to leave with Amun. Which meant she\u2019d planned to take him to her Hunters so they could kil him.</p><p>Stil . That didn\u2019t explain why Amun had defended her. Why the warrior had touched her so intimately.</p><p>Strider had known the dude a long, long time. They\u2019d fought together, hung out and partied together.</p><p>And by \u201cpartied together\u201d Strider meant that Amun had watched him party and guarded his back. Amun didn\u2019t sleep around, was usual y the most reserved of the warriors, and was sometimes as boring as shit.</p><p>The good kind of boring, though. You knew you could rely on him for anything. He was solid, a rock, and you always knew where you stood with him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t prone to angry fits, was the most levelheaded guy Strider knew. He would rather take a bul et himself than watch his friends take one. Yet, to protect a murderous bitch, he\u2019d attempted to splatter Strider\u2019s brains al over his bedroom floor.</p><p>Amun must not have recognized her. Hel , would anyone?</p><p>Centuries had passed, she no longer looked like an innocent maiden in need of a strong warrior\u2019s aid, and as many freaky places as they\u2019d been, they\u2019d met other women named Haidee. The fact that she\u2019d somehow regrown her head maybe mighta kinda sorta have also prevented his friends from realizing who she was.</p><p>Part of Strider was glad she hadn\u2019t been recognized. The stupid part of him that didn\u2019t like the thought of anyone hurting the woman.</p><p>You planned to sic Sabin on her. Remember?</p><p>Yes. And maybe he would have done it. Maybe not.</p><p>Strider hadn\u2019t even told Torin her true identity yet. He didn\u2019t know why. He\u2019d only said she was a Hunter and had left it at that.</p><p>And, okay, yeah. Maybe that had been a halfway decent decision. Maybe Ex\u2019s efforts on Amun\u2019s behalf were real rather than faked. The day Strider had captured her, he\u2019d gotten a glimpse of her boyfriend and had been floored to note the similarities between the Hunter and Amun. Was stil floored.</p><p>As swol en and disfigured as Amun\u2019s face currently was, she probably thought the men were one and the same. If that was the case, she wouldn\u2019t have been taking Amun to Hunters to torture him but to save him.</p><p>Had she realized the truth yet, since he\u2019d cal ed Amun by name? Or had she been too preoccupied?</p><p>\u201cFor gods\u2019 sake!\u201d Torin tossed up his arms, dragging him from the thorny pit of his thoughts. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, Strider?\u201d</p><p>He leveled a brutal scowl on his friend. \u201cI\u2019m healing. Can\u2019t you see the gaping hole in my stomach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are fine. Now, as you were saying. Amun looked into your eyes during your conflict, yet you felt no evil urges?\u201d</p><p>Zacharel asked, returning them to the only subject that mattered.</p><p>Conflict. Such a mild word for the handing-of-the-ass Strider had received. \u201cRight. No urges.\u201d Then or now.</p><p>Torin scrubbed both of his gloved hands down his tired face. \u201cWel , the shadows are back. Came back that very day, in fact, the moment the angels got him back in bed.</p><p>And now he\u2019s worse. He worsens every hour. Silently moaning, always thrashing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he was fine when you walked into his bedroom?\u201d</p><p>Zacharel insisted.</p><p>Did he seriously need to repeat himself? \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the girl?\u201d</p><p>Shit! \u201cYes, damn it. With the girl.\u201d</p><p>Zacharel gave no reaction to Strider\u2019s outburst, of course.</p><p>\u201cWhile you were absent from the fortress, we tried exorcism, burning him as close to death as possible, hoping the spirits would unbind themselves and leave. They didn\u2019t. We even tried a cloud cleansing, a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d Torin said dryly.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Zacharel continued, \u201cnone of those things made a difference. Yet if you looked at him and felt no evil, the girl did the impossible. She forced the demons into submission. That means she is the key.\u201d</p><p>Confusion caused Strider\u2019s brows to knit together. \u201cThe key? The key to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmun\u2019s sanity. He needs her. He must be with her.\u201d</p><p>Both Strider and Torin gaped at the angel.</p><p>Torin was the first to recover. \u201cShe\u2019s a Hunter.\u201d Disbelief and fury coated his tone.</p><p>\u201cYet that mattered not to Amun or the demons,\u201d Zacharel pointed out. \u201cWhere is your joy? Your friend now has a chance of surviving.\u201d</p><p>A chance. Grim words when they should have been hopeful.</p><p>The day Strider had busted into Amun\u2019s room, the angels had been talking of final y kil ing the insane warrior. They\u2019d given the Lords enough time to fix him, they\u2019d said, and the Lords hadn\u2019t fixed him. The phantoms had begun to seep into the hal way, trying to escape the angels, the fortress, and enter the world.</p><p>Strider wouldn\u2019t al ow that. He wouldn\u2019t al ow Amun to be harmed, either. But he real y wouldn\u2019t al ow Ex near him.</p><p>\u201cThe day I arrived, you said the female was infected. What did you mean by that?\u201d He would have asked before, but after visiting Amun that first time, he\u2019d been kind of busy sandpapering his skin off in an effort to expunge the evil.</p><p>\u201cI have not been given permission to share those details,\u201d</p><p>the angel said, his frostiness not thawing a single degree.</p><p>Zacharel cared about permission? Shocker. \u201cWho do you need permission from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLysander.\u201d</p><p>Of course. The head honcho. \u201cWel , where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith his Bianka. They were arguing, and he gave her possession of their cloud. No one is to disturb them for any reason. There are neon signs al around the palace saying so.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Strider didn\u2019t real y understand a word of that. A cloud palace? Why would Bianka\u2019s possession of it matter? There was no one bigger or stronger than Lysander\u2014except Strider.

One thing Strider had learned about the Harpy when she\u2019d visited the fortress was that she enjoyed power and didn\u2019t relinquish it easily.</p> <p>Lucky Lysander.</p><p>Strider could have tasted a Harpy of his own, he supposed, since Bianka had two single sisters. Taliyah and Kaia.</p><p>Taliyah was the ice princess, as seemingly emotionless as Zacharel, but Strider had never been interested in her.</p><p>Now, Kaia on the other hand, wel , she was the wildfire.</p><p>He\u2019d been interested. Real y interested\u2014until she\u2019d slept with Paris, keeper of Promiscuity. Strider had decided then not to bother with her. Who could compete with a freaking god of sex?</p> <p>To be honest, Strider was sick of competing in the bedroom al the damn time. Sick of having to be the best lover his partner had ever had. It had gotten old. There was nothing wrong with a guy wanting to lie back and let the woman do al the work for once.</p><p>If Defeat had been awake, the demon would have said,</p><p>\u201cWin.\u201d Strider almost wished the little shit would speak up.</p><p>Woulda been nice to trample on his feelings by shouting,</p><p>\u201cShut the hel up!\u201d The bastard had gotten Strider into this mess, after al .</p><p>\u201cAnd...he\u2019s off again,\u201d Torin muttered wryly.</p> <p>\u201cAm not.\u201d Strider flipped him off. \u201cTel me this at least,\u201d he said to the angel. \u201cCan the girl, being infected as she is with something you stupidly won\u2019t tel me about, contaminate Amun? Make him worse?\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in silence as the angel considered the question. And wouldn\u2019t you know it? He gave no reaction to the word stupidly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Al right, then. Strider would forget about Ex\u2019s \u201cinfection.\u201d</p><p>For now.</p><p>\u201cSo what are we going to do about Amun and the girl?\u201d</p><p>Torin asked, getting them back on track. Again. He leaned back in his chair, resting his ankle against his knee, hands twined over his middle. A casual pose, if not for the lines of tension branching from his mouth.</p><p>Zacharel eyed the keeper of Disease as if he\u2019d lost his brain when he\u2019d gained his demon. \u201cWe wil test our theory, of course. We wil put her back inside Amun\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHel , no!\u201d Strider snarled. And not because those sparks of jealousy had instantly lit back up and now poured through his veins like streams of acid. \u201cHe\u2019s defenseless, and she\u2019l hurt him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019l be a tame house cat next time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf things continue as they are, I wil kil him.\u201d The words were so simply stated, Strider had no doubt Zacharel meant what he said. \u201cYour choice. I wil be satisfied one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>Not real y a choice at al , the bastard. He had to know that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l have to clear out Amun\u2019s room and remove...\u201d Shit.</p><p>\u201cEverything except the bed.\u201d Anything could be used as a weapon. As he\u2019d already learned. \u201cThe window wil need iron bars.\u201d Hunters were notoriously adept and wily. Look what Ex had done with a simple piece of glass.</p><p>His stomach ached in remembrance, the scab pul ing tight.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should break her hands, too,\u201d Torin suggested, shocking the sweet loving hel out of Strider.</p><p>He was usual y the voice of semi-reason. \u201cI don\u2019t want her able to snap his neck or pluck his eyes while he\u2019s defenseless.\u201d</p><p>Zacharel shrugged, drawing attention to the breadth of his shoulders\u2014and making Strider grit his teeth in annoyance that he\u2019d noticed. What was wrong with him? Men were not his personal preference. \u201cShe didn\u2019t before,\u201d the angel remarked.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019l be a tame house cat next time,\u201d</p><p>Torin repeated, mimicking Strider\u2019s earlier you\u2019re-a-moron tone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when she thought she could escape with him,\u201d</p><p>Strider forced himself to say. Because deep down, he stil didn\u2019t like the thought of hurting her. He lost more IQ points every day, he decided. \u201cThis time, she\u2019l know there\u2019s no way she can free herself. She\u2019l know she\u2019s helpless and needs to curry our favor.\u201d</p><p>Torin\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re actual y voting to leave her be? A Hunter? What\u2019d she stab you with? A magic wand laced with Prozac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not voting to leave her be.\u201d Damn it! He had. \u201cFine.</p><p>We\u2019l break her hands.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to argue about her treatment. She deserved what she got, and he would just have to pacify himself with that knowledge.</p><p>\u201cOne other thing to consider,\u201d Zacharel said. \u201cAmun fought to reach her, and al of my warriors were needed to subdue him. If you hurt her, I think he wil object. And if he objects, I think many in this household wil be injured. But again, I give the choice to you.\u201d</p><p>How magnanimous of him, Strider thought dryly. Zacharel had a gift for ripping your rationale apart with only a few words. But...Torin couldn\u2019t force the issue now.</p><p>Stil . Prick that he was, Strider wasn\u2019t exactly ready to back down yet, no matter that he was getting what he\u2019d original y wanted. Zacharel irritated him, and part of him hoped to irritate the guy right back.</p><p>At least garner some kind of reaction.</p><p>\u201cIf we decided we wanted it done, would you be the one to do the breaking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Zacharel said easily.</p><p>Strider blinked at him. Not the answer he\u2019d expected. Feet shuffling, maybe. A little waffling, for sure.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re an angel. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be defenders of humanity or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is not exactly human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is she?\u201d The question whipped from him, his eagerness to know unparal eled.</p><p>\u201cI do not have permission to tel you.\u201d</p><p>The eagerness deflated like a bal oon, and Strider gnawed the inside of his cheek to keep himself from snarling. When Lysander final y crawled his way out of wild Bianka\u2019s bed, Strider was going to have a long chat with him. He suspected daggers would be used between every word.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t damage her,\u201d Strider final y said. \u201cAnd I have a few conditions. I have to be the one to escort her to Amun.\u201d</p><p>Just as soon as he could walk. He didn\u2019t like the thought of anyone else putting their hands on her. She was\u2014not his.</p><p>\u201cAlso, I want a camera in the room.\u201d The words emerged harder, harsher. \u201cWe\u2019l monitor what goes on twenty-five, eight.\u201d</p><p>Torin nodded, his expression half satisfied, half steeped in guilt. \u201cI\u2019l have them placed and recording within the hour.\u201d</p><p>There were cameras strategical y hidden throughout the entire fortress just in case Hunters snuck past their gate and traps, but not in any of the bedrooms. They\u2019d al agreed. If the enemy could bypass everything else and enter one of the rooms, the Lords deserved to die. Privacy was that important.</p><p>If Amun ever regained his senses completely, he\u2019d be pissed as hel about the new cameras. But better his fury than his murder.</p><p>Zacharel straightened from the post. \u201cI\u2019l inform my men of what is to transpire.\u201d With that, he turned with the fluid grace of a dancer and strode from the room.</p><p>A dancer? Seriously?</p><p>Strider\u2019s cheeks heated a whole hel of a lot more than before.</p><p>When Torin made no comment about his blush, he relaxed against his pil ows. As a sigh left him, he realized how tense he\u2019d been in the angel\u2019s presence. Now he scanned the bedroom, al owing the familiarity of his surroundings to comfort him further. His weapon col ection decorated the wal s, everything from ancient swords to modern-day firearms.</p><p>Only thing hanging on the wal that wasn\u2019t a weapon was the portrait just over the bed. No. Not true, he thought then. The portrait was a weapon, too. Of seduction. In it, Strider was utterly naked and whisking through the clouds like an avenging angel. He was holding a teddy bear in one hand and a stream of pink ribbons in the other.</p><p>Anya had given him the nearly life-size monstrosity as a joke. But the joke was on her. He loved the damn thing.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the others?\u201d he final y asked. \u201cThe other day you told me they were out and about, but not where exactly.</p><p>Or why. I\u2019ve had a little time to think this through, and I realized they don\u2019t need to keep the artifacts out of the fortress anymore. The Hunters aren\u2019t swarming us like before. Word on the street is they vanished, which is bizarre, but Cronus says not to worry\u2014and yeah, I talked to him, he just popped in the other day for no apparent reason</p><p>\u2014so I\u2019m not worried. Which means you aren\u2019t, either.</p><p>Which means the boyz are away for a different reason.</p><p>Right?\u201d</p><p>Torin\u2019s sigh was an echo of his. \u201cIt\u2019s just too dangerous around here, what with the angels being demon assassins and Amun visiting the dark side. Aeron, Olivia, Legion, Wil iam and Gil y are the only ones stil here. Not because I need help, but because they\u2019re too weak to leave. And wel , Aeron has taken the blame for Amun\u2019s condition and refuses to leave him. Not that you\u2019ve paid any of them a visit, you slacker.\u201d</p><p>Gods, he was, wasn\u2019t he? \u201cThank you for shoving me down the shame spiral. How are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guys are stil recovering from Hel Week, and the girls are taking care of them. Wel , except for Legion. She refuses to get out of bed.\u201d</p><p>Aeron must be worried about her, too. Strider real y should have checked on him. On al of them. I\u2019m a self-absorbed prick.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of the crew is spread out,\u201d Torin said, \u201cand I no longer have their locations. I told them not to tel me anymore, to just check in at least once a day so I\u2019d know they were alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to know where they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the little Hunter here, the less I know about them, the better.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>True. \u201cSo, any news?

It was straight up weird. \u201cCan you imagine twin demon hel ions running around this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Strider had never spent any time with kids and wouldn\u2019t even know how to hold one. Or what to say to one.</p> <p>Or what to do when one vomited on his favorite sword. But damn if he didn\u2019t get a kick out of imagining his friends struggling to cope.</p><p>\u201cOh, and get this. Gideon married Scarlet, the keeper of Nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d Fickle Gideon? Married? Scarlet was gorgeous, yeah, and feisty as hel . Powerful, too.

But marriage?</p><p>Everyone in the fortress had lost IQ points, it seemed.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have waited until I got back to sign on for double occupancy?\u201d Strider mumbled. \u201cWhat a great friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one was invited to the ceremony, if you catch my meaning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWel , the decision to get hitched is gonna give him nightmares.\u201d Strider snickered. \u201cGet it?</p><p>Nightmares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHar, har. You\u2019re a borderline fucktard, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not going to apologize for being on my A game.</p><p>Why don\u2019t you step up to the plate and join me, Junior League?\u201d</p><p>Torin ignored him. \u201cIt\u2019s weird, don\u2019t you think? Two demons hooking up?\u201d</p><p>Strider peered at him, blinked. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne word\u2014Cameo. And you. Okay, so three words.\u201d</p><p>Torin snapped his teeth at him. \u201cWhatever. We were talking about Scarlet. Which brings me to more gossip. Turns out she\u2019s the only daughter of...wait for it... Rhea.\u201d</p><p>What? Rhea? And he hadn\u2019t known? Strider had been way more self-involved than he\u2019d realized. Rhea was queen of the gods, the estranged wife of Cronus, and the bitch helping Galen, keeper of the demon of Hope\u2014and an al around asshole\u2014leader of the Hunters. \u201cHow\u2019d Gideon take the news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , he tried to kil his mother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet. But such romantic gestures aside, our boys have gotta start picking their significant others with more care.</p><p>Gwen is Galen\u2019s only kid, Scarlet is Rhea\u2019s. What\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>A Hunter? A participant in Baden\u2019s kil er?</p><p>Yes, he was a fucktard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l tel you what\u2019s next,\u201d Torin said. \u201cLucifer\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid no one tel you? Wil iam is related to Lucifer. And Lucifer is the devil, in case you didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome again.\u201d</p><p>The corners of Torin\u2019s lips quirked with amusement. \u201cI know. Whacked out as hel , but kind of fitting.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t ask again. He wouldn\u2019t. \u201cHow?\u201d Damn! The question escaped before he could stop it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. Wil iam refused to spil . Needless to say, things have been pretty festive around here. So, anyway.</p><p>You\u2019re back, and you\u2019re kind of healthy, so I can ask the question I\u2019ve been holding in for three days.</p><p>Where the hel is the Cloak of Invisibility? I looked through your stuff, your room, but couldn\u2019t find it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. Now it was his turn to drop a news bomb. \u201cAbout that...\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>HAIDEE PROWLED THE CONFINES of her cel .</p><p>She had no idea how much time had passed since she\u2019d been pushed inside. She was alone. Food and water had been brought to her only once. The fruits and nuts and crisp, clean water had somehow curbed her hunger completely, strengthening her in a way she couldn\u2019t explain.</p><p>Oh, and the food had been delivered by an angel\u2014a freaking angel living in a demon\u2019s den. That stil had her reeling. But she now knew beyond a doubt she was in the Budapest fortress. As they\u2019d dragged her down here, she\u2019d spotted wear and tear from a recent bombing. A bombing she hadn\u2019t been involved in, but one she\u2019d heard al about.</p><p>Enough time had passed for Micah\u2014\u201cAmun,\u201d Defeat had cal ed him\u2014to have suffered countless fates.</p><p>Torture, relocation, even death. The thought of each had sent her into a near hysteric state. She\u2019d clawed the wal s until she had no nails left. She\u2019d beaten the bars until her knuckles had cracked and swel ed.</p><p>She\u2019d screamed for answers until her voice had fractured.</p><p>Now, in the silence, al she could do was think, one sentence echoing over and over again. Defeat had cal ed him Amun. Was he Amun, a Lord? Or was he Micah, a Hunter?</p><p>He\u2019d known her, shouted for her help. That had to mean he was Micah. But, on the flip side, he hadn\u2019t known anything else about her. Not their history, not their purpose. That had to mean he was Amun.</p><p>Argh! The back-and-forth, was he or wasn\u2019t he, was driving her as crazy as her confinement. Could he be a mix of both? Amun\u2019s demon stuffed into Micah\u2019s body? Because real y, two men couldn\u2019t look that much alike. Could they?</p><p>No matter the answers, she wasn\u2019t leaving without him.</p><p>Even though, deep down, a part of her suspected the worst.</p><p>That two men could easily look alike\u2014especial y if powers beyond a human\u2019s comprehension were involved. That he was Amun, that he\u2019d always been Amun. That Micah was someone else completely, out there somewhere, stil searching for her, and she was simply trying to convince herself otherwise so she wouldn\u2019t feel guilty.</p><p>That kiss...something else she couldn\u2019t get out of her mind.</p><p>Micah had never kissed her like that. Fiery, consuming.</p><p>Necessary.</p><p>Despite the danger they had been in\u2014were in\u2014she would have al owed him to strip and penetrate her.</p><p>She would have met him thrust for wild thrust, taking, giving, claiming.</p><p>She would have clung to him, desperate for more, for everything.</p><p>Hel , she would have crawled inside him if she could have.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted them fused, never able to part. How crazy was that? A kiss had never affected her like that. Never. A man had never affected her like that.</p><p>Always before, she had remained detached. From everyone. Maybe because she\u2019d known the people around her would die, while she would continue on, eternal y brought back from the grave. Maybe because there was darkness inside her. So much darkness. A living entity, as real as the ice that flowed through her veins, a presence in the back of her mind, muted but always there, urging her to despise people, places, life, death. Anything, everything.</p><p>For the first time, she hadn\u2019t had to fight to feel or garner affection. She had looked at Amun\u2014</p><p>That\u2019s how you think of him now? Amun?</p><p>Yes, she realized. Somehow he was Amun to her now.</p><p>Micah didn\u2019t fit those ful er lips and wider shoulders. So, she had looked at Amun, and sensual awareness had sizzled inside her. Connecting them. She had heard his voice inside her head, and that sensual awareness had deepened.</p><p>And if he real y was Amun, not Micah, she should feel guilty about what had happened between them.</p><p>She should be horrified that she\u2019d succumbed to her enemy. Should be devastated that she\u2019d let him give her more than an explosive kiss; she\u2019d let him lick between her legs, and she had loved it. Had been begging for more.</p><p>Guilt and horror were not what she felt, however. Wel , not completely. She felt them, but she was stil consumed by desire.</p><p>Forgetting the fact that Amun was the enemy, she wasn\u2019t a cheater. And yet, had he walked through her cel , she felt pretty certain she would have thrown herself into his arms.</p><p>She scrubbed a shaky hand down her face. What was happening to her common sense? Her wel</p><p>-honed self-preservation instincts?</p><p>Micah was the first boyfriend she\u2019d al owed herself in centuries, and only because she had dreamed of him first.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t needed him, hadn\u2019t been lost without him.</p><p>She paused and peered down at her tattooed arm. At his name, branded so deeply into her flesh.</p><p>M-i-c-a-h. She traced the letters with a scabbed fingertip. There was no leap in her pulse, no hum of desire.</p><p>She thought the name Amun.</p><p>Goose bumps broke out over every inch of her skin. She licked her lips, her mouth suddenly flooded with moisture.</p><p>See? Reaction. Always. And that wasn\u2019t good. Not good at al .</p><p>What if...what if she hadn\u2019t dreamed of Micah? What if she\u2019d dreamed of Amun? Did that mean Amun was a bad memory trying to surface? Or, like the visions he had showed her of her past, was he something good?</p><p>Neither made sense, real y. One, in the visions, she knew the man she saw was her key to happiness, to freedom.</p><p>Two, how could a demon-possessed immortal, responsible for the travesty that was her life\u2014and her parents\u2019 and sister\u2019s deaths\u2014be something good?</p><p>She kicked back into motion, her sure strides eating up the distance from one cel wal to the other. A better question: How could a demon-possessed warrior be the one thing she craved? The one thing she didn\u2019t think she could live without?</p><p>Live. Without. The words echoed through her mind, and she stumbled to another halt. Her stomach twisted, sharp little knots forming, cutting. No. No, no, no. She purposely kept her home and belongings sparse, her friendships casual.</p><p>That way, she could pick up and leave without a moment\u2019s notice or regret.</p><p>She could live without him. She could. He was a mystery right now. A mystery she needed to solve. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That was al .</p><p>Another complication sprouted.

His gaze perused her from top to bottom, purposely lingering at her breasts, between her legs. \u201cI\u2019m feeling like I can do anything I want with you.\u201d</p><p>Calmly yet brutal y uttered, his threat clear. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t the answer she\u2019d expected, and she scowled at him. But then, she should have known he wouldn\u2019t simply endure her snide remarks. He always had to one-up her.</p><p>So. Enough pleasantries.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the warrior?\u201d she demanded. \u201cThe one I was with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Amun, keeper of the demon of Secrets?\u201d So calm, so certain. \u201cOr your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Secrets, he\u2019d said. Just as she\u2019d suspected. The confirmation explained so much. The knots in her stomach twisted into themselves, sharpening further. Stil , she wouldn\u2019t confirm or deny what she knew.</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what you want me to believe. That he\u2019s masquerading as a Hunter, while in reality, he\u2019s real y your friend.\u201d The words croaked from her. \u201cOr maybe you just want me to hate my own boyfriend. Maybe you want me to hurt him and afterward, you\u2019l taunt me, laugh at me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow why would I want that, huh? If he\u2019s my friend, demon-possessed like me, yet I told you he wasn\u2019t, that he was your man, you would do your best to watch over him. And I would want my friend watched over, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d Strider propped his shoulder against the bar, and though his head was turned, his hard gaze remained fixed on her. \u201cBut if he isn\u2019t, if he is your boyfriend, why would I give the pleasure of kil ing him to you, even for a joke?\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted a notch, her stubborn core refusing to be cowed. Despite his sound reasoning. \u201cWhy would you admit he was your friend, then? Thereby placing him in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve admitted he\u2019s Amun, have I?\u201d</p><p>No, he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d only questioned her thoughts on the matter, probably trying to confuse her. \u201cI don\u2019t care who he is.\u201d Either way, he belonged to her. That was a fact she couldn\u2019t argue, even with herself. \u201cI just want to see him, make sure he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant, want, want.\u201d He tapped a finger against his chin.</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about giving you what you want?\u201d</p><p>She popped her jaw, stil refusing to show him emotion.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Defeat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019l get to that in a minute. First, I have some questions for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I have every intention of answering them,\u201d she said, sugar sweet.</p><p>\u201cYou wil if you want to see your...man again.\u201d The last was gritted, as if the prospect bothered him.</p><p>\u201cYou just told me I wouldn\u2019t get what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. Think back. I asked you who said you would.\u201d</p><p>True. Bastard. But would he honor his word? The Lords of the Underworld were not known as givers in her world.</p><p>\u201cAfter you just taunted me with never seeing him again, you expect me to believe you\u2019l escort me back to his room if I give you answers you won\u2019t believe anyway?\u201d Or bring Amun here, she thought, but didn\u2019t say the words aloud. No reason to put ideas into his head if they weren\u2019t already there.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I was merely taunting you. Can you blame me, though? You bring out the worst in me, and I struck back.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to yel at him to continue but remained silent, waiting.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he prodded. \u201cWe gonna do this? Answers in exchange for a little sightseeing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gritted out. She had no other recourse. He might be lying, but she was wil ing to risk Hunter secrets on the hope that he\u2019d fol ow through. And that\u2019s what he would demand, she thought. Secrets.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hammer out a few details before I start spewing info. When wil you take me to him? A few years from now?\u201d She wouldn\u2019t put such a trick past him.</p><p>A muscle ticked below his eye. \u201cI\u2019l take you immediately fol owing our conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if you\u2019l keep your word,\u201d she said, raising her chin another notch. She might be wil ing to risk everything, but that didn\u2019t mean she would be stupid about it. The terms needed to be laid out flat, ironed and starched. Just in case. To do that, she would have to provoke him. Some things had to be offered without her prompting.</p><p>His eyes narrowed to tiny slits, the top and bottom lashes catching and twining. \u201cChal enge me, then.</p><p>Chal enge me to keep it.\u201d</p><p>Like that. Had she chal enged him on her own, he would have punished her. \u201cIs he even alive?\u201d Even asking, she wanted to cry. You can live without him, she reminded herself. She just didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>Oh, God. He already meant that much to her? Despite who and what he might be? Despite how he would hate her?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Defeat said. \u201cHe is. Though his condition has worsened.\u201d</p><p>Her heart thumped against her ribs. \u201cHow many questions?</p><p>There has to be a limit.\u201d</p><p>He gave another negligent shrug. \u201cFive. And your answers had better be truthful.\u201d</p><p>How wil you know if they are or aren\u2019t? she almost asked, just to taunt him as he\u2019d taunted her, but she didn\u2019t. The outcome of this was too important. \u201cAl right. I\u2014I chal enge you to take me to see Micah\u2014Amun\u2014after I answer five questions honestly.\u201d If he punished her for the chal enge, anyway, it would be no more than she deserved for al owing him to trick her.</p><p>Defeat\u2019s pupils gobbled up his irises as he jerked his head once in a stiff nod. \u201cI accept.\u201d His hands fisted. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d seen that reaction before, recognized it as what he\u2019d claimed. Acceptance. \u201cI\u2019m as satisfied as I can be in a place like this.\u201d</p><p>Those pupils continued to grow, as if she\u2019d said something provocative. And maybe she had\u2014a virile man would see her words as an invitation to satisfy her physical y, and this man was more virile and invitation-happy than most\u2014but it had been unintentional. She wasn\u2019t attracted to Defeat. He was beautiful, yes, but he lacked Amun\u2019s intensity. She also wanted to throw up in her mouth a little every time she looked at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your first question?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cWhat the hel are you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t pretend to misunderstand. \u201cI\u2019m human.\u201d</p><p>Fast as lightning, he struck out, his fist pounding into the bar and rattling the very foundation of the cel .</p><p>\u201cAlready you\u2019re lying. You can materialize weapons out of thin air.</p><p>That\u2019s not something humans can do.\u201d</p><p>She gave no reaction to his fury. \u201cIf I can, why haven\u2019t I produced one since being here? And I promise you, I would have sliced your throat from end to end if I\u2019d had even the slightest opportunity during our trek.\u201d</p><p>Now a muscle ticked in his jaw, but at least he didn\u2019t strike out again. \u201cAn easy boast, almost believable. Maybe you just wanted a ticket into this fortress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do what? Expedite my torture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were Bait once. Maybe you\u2019re meant to be Bait again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you were an idiot to bring me here,\u201d she lashed out.</p><p>His nostrils flared with the force of his renewed fury, but he said nothing else.</p><p>\u201cThis is getting us nowhere,\u201d she said, as calmly as she was able. \u201cThe weapons didn\u2019t simply materialize when we were in the jungle. I hid them from you until I found the opportunity to use them.\u201d And that was the God\u2019s honest truth. \u201cThat, and you\u2019re kind of a dumbass.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled, the breath seeming to drain his fury. \u201cWel , that\u2019s an improvement over stupid and idiot.\u201d</p><p>Gentle, amused teasing. From him. Shocking. Or was he trying to throw her off balance? \u201cI answered.</p><p>Honestly. So, second question.\u201d</p><p>The gentleness faded, only a single thread of the amusement remaining. \u201cIf you\u2019re human, how are you alive?</p><p>I watched you die. Which is a nice way of saying I fucking murdered you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been reanimated.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention how or how many times. He hadn\u2019t asked. \u201cThat\u2019s two.</p><p>Next.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot done with that one yet. If you\u2019ve been reanimated, and I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s just a fancy way of saying you were brought back to life, a god aided you.</p><p>Only a god has the power to reanimate a body after a beheading. And even then, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>Silence enveloped them. He stared at her pointedly. She stared back.</p><p>\u201cWel ?\u201d he demanded, spreading his arms as if he were the last sane man in the universe.</p><p>\u201cWel , what? You didn\u2019t ask a question.\u201d</p><p>The muscle in his jaw started ticking again. \u201cWho aided you?\u201d</p><p>Aided was not the word she would have chosen. Cursed, maybe. \u201cA creature very much like you. I think. I didn\u2019t see it, only know I had a reaction to it the first and only time it touched me.\u201d And that\u2019s al she would say on the matter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even if he asked for more. \u201cThat\u2019s three.

Rhea, the supposed queen of the Titans? Haidee had heard of her, of course. A smal group of Hunters even worshipped her.</p> <p>But why did Defeat assume the woman was responsible for Haidee\u2019s curse?</p><p>Or \u201cinfection,\u201d as the Bad Man had cal ed it? \u201cTwo more questions to go. Better make them good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw you with...him, kissing\u2014\u201d he\u2019d almost said a name, she realized, but had managed to stop himself in time \u201c\u2014were you interested in him as a man or as a possible escape route?\u201d</p><p>Of everything Defeat could have asked, why that? \u201cWhy the hel do you care?\u201d</p><p>His traced the tip of his tongue across the seam of his lips.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe our bargain involved explanations on my part.\u201d</p><p>Fine. \u201cThe man.\u201d</p><p>There was a beat of silence before he gave her a reaction.</p><p>A flash of that fury, quickly gone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always been the gentle one, you know,\u201d Defeat said almost absently. \u201cHe\u2019s rarely ever displayed a temper. Has never hurt one of his friends. And he would be horrified to know what he did to me.\u201d As soon as he realized what he\u2019d said, what he\u2019d admitted, he scowled at her, as if the confession was her fault.</p><p>She pretended not to notice. \u201cYou have one more question.</p> <p>And did I forget to tel you that if you lied to me, I would personal y reacquaint your spine with a shard of glass?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a long while, studying, searching for something. Whether he found it or not, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Then he spoke, soft, gentle. \u201cWhy did you help kil Baden, Haidee?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath. Of everything he could have demanded to know...how dare he ask that? As if he didn\u2019t already know the answer. As if he hadn\u2019t ral ied to destroy her, al those centuries ago. As if he would enjoy hearing her pain and her heartbreak.</p><p>Just like that, al the hate inside her exploded to the surface, and she stomped to the bars, placing herself within striking distance. She didn\u2019t attack him but dared him to attack her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, just continued to stare at her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did I help kil him?\u201d She threw the words at him as if they were weapons, and maybe they were.</p><p>\u201cBecause he took what I loved most. And don\u2019t try to lie and say he didn\u2019t, that I\u2019m confused, or misremembering. I saw him. I was there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done! Why else did I help kil him? Because he represented what I despised most. Because he deserved what I did, and he knew it. He wanted me to do it. And not once, not once in al these years, have I ever regretted it.\u201d</p><p>Again, silence. Those blue eyes glittered far more dangerously than before as he reached inside his pocket.</p><p>Haidee expected a dagger to the stomach but stil didn\u2019t back down. Physical pain might dul her emotional anguish.</p><p>He merely keyed the lock. The cel door swung open, the hinges squeaking. \u201cFor some reason, you calmed...our boy before. He\u2019s worse now, and we need to know if you can calm him again.\u201d</p><p>Him. Amun. So, she thought, furious al over again, Defeat had meant to take her to the warrior al along.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had to answer a single question. She\u2019d been tricked, just not the way she\u2019d thought. What a fool she was. \u201cAnd what is it, exactly, that I calm him from? How is he worse? What the hel did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take you to him,\u201d the demon went on, ignoring her. Either he was unaware of her volatile emotions or he just didn\u2019t care. \u201cBut if you harm him, Haidee, I wil kil you.</p><p>And I\u2019l make it hurt in a way you can\u2019t even imagine.\u201d</p><p>THE MOMENT DEFEAT led her down the hal way to Amun\u2019s bedroom\u2014a hal way stil fil ed with towering angels and their outspread wings\u2014she heard the warrior\u2019s voice inside her head and forgot everything else.</p><p>Haidee! That single word was a tormented wail. Need...</p><p>you...please...</p><p>How long had he been cal ing for her? Why hadn\u2019t she heard him before now?</p><p>Haidee!</p><p>She\u2019d uncover those details later. Right now, he was in pain, so much pain, and nothing but helping him mattered.</p><p>Wrenching away with al her strength, she broke free of Defeat\u2019s hold and rushed forward. No one tried to stop her.</p><p>Not the angels and not the Lord. She expected Amun\u2019s doorway to stil be splintered from Defeat\u2019s vicious kick, but someone had fixed the metal and wood, both now blocking her entrance.</p><p>She twisted the knob\u2014unlocked, thank God\u2014and raced into the bedroom, quickly slamming the door shut behind her. She tried to flip the lock in place and noticed it had been removed. Shit! Something else to worry about later.</p><p>Tiny beads of ice dotted her skin, and her knees knocked shakily as she pivoted. Then she saw him. He was thrashing atop the bed, just like last time.</p><p>Final y, she was with him again. He was alive. But for how long? He was worse, Defeat had said, and Amun had barely survived the last set of wounds.</p><p>Haidee...please...</p><p>So weak, suffused with al that pain. \u201cI\u2019m here, baby. I\u2019m here.\u201d Acid flowed through her as she stumbled toward him.</p><p>Some distant part of her brain noticed that every piece of furniture but the bed had been carted out.</p><p>Then she was standing at the edge of the mattress, peering down at him, and al thoughts fled.</p><p>He moaned inside her head.</p><p>\u201cI know. I know you hurt.\u201d</p><p>Haidee? Not quite so pained now.</p><p>\u201cYes, baby. Haidee\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>He sighed with the barest hint of relief.</p><p>The shadows had returned, were even then dancing around his once again savaged body. His eyes were swol en shut, his hands bloody and torn. The wings of his butterfly tattoo were...moving, breaking apart, forming hundreds of other butterflies. Those, too, danced over him, up his thighs, on his stomach, his pectorals, his arms, then disappearing behind his back.</p><p>In that moment, she was absolutely certain the man she watched was Amun rather than Micah. Which meant the Lords wouldn\u2019t hurt him. Thank God. The intensity of her relief was stunning.</p><p>What\u2019s wrong with you? she wondered again. Now that her worries over Amun\u2019s possible torture and execution were proven unnecessary, she couldn\u2019t forget or refute two simple facts. This man had never been a Hunter. This man was her enemy.</p><p>She should kil him. She should add to her tal y and be al the closer to evening the score. Like Baden, Amun deserved whatever punishment she dished. The vile things these men had done in ancient Greece... Stil . She couldn\u2019t force herself to hurt him. He was too battered, too pitiful.</p><p>Had sought only to protect her.</p><p>His attitude wil change. You know it wil . The moment he\u2019s wel , his friends wil tel him who you are.</p><p>He\u2019l go for your throat faster than you can say, \u201cBut I spared you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d worry about his hatred then. For now, for better or worse, she and Amun were connected. Later, she would search for answers, find out how and why. Maybe she could even convince herself she\u2019d never had visions of him. And then...maybe then she could find a way to cut the ties that bound them. If he didn\u2019t do it first.</p><p>Until then...</p><p>She would do everything in her power to save this man, just as before.</p><p>Even the thought was a betrayal to the Hunters. A betrayal Micah would take personal y. But that didn\u2019t alter her plans, and that, she realized, drove home the knowledge that her relationship with him was over.</p><p>She was shocked by her lack of unhappiness at the prospect. Shocked further that she didn\u2019t wish things were different. She just wished there was a way to let him know.</p><p>Gently. She desired another man, a demon-possessed man at that, and Micah deserved better than she could ever give him.</p><p>She sighed, the relieved sound an echo of Amun\u2019s. It was nice, having something figured out. If only healing Amun proved to be that simple. She reached out and brushed the sweat-soaked hair from his brow. Those dancing shadows screeched, darting away from her and burrowing under Amun\u2019s skin, even as the warrior leaned toward her, seeking closer contact.</p><p>What did that darkness represent? What did it mean?</p><p>Definitely something evil, as she\u2019d first suspected. Amun obviously hated it, cringing as the last thread of gloom faded inside him.</p><p>Haidee, my Haidee. Another sigh wafted through her head, this one laced with contentment. Don\u2019t leave me.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you.\u201d Her trembling intensified as she climbed in beside him and wrapped him in her arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be here as long as you need me.\u201d</p><p>IN HIS OWN BEDROOM, Torin watched Haidee on one of his computer screens. Haidee. Come back to life. Who would have thought? And why hadn\u2019t Strider told him? The questions lost their importance between one heartbeat and the next. His eyes widened as the shadows scrambled to escape her touch. He\u2019d never seen anything like it and had no idea what it meant.</p><p>He did know one thing. She wasn\u2019t human, as she\u2019d told Strider. No mere human could frighten demons as she\u2019d just done. And they were frightened of her. They\u2019d hidden inside Amun, rather than try and escape him as they\u2019d done from the first.</p><p>\u201cSo what the fuck is she?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>SCOWLING, STRIDER BARRELED his way inside Amun\u2019s chamber. How eager Haidee had been to reach the warrior, her sworn enemy. And now Strider saw her sprawled on the bed, curled into Amun\u2019s side, tenderly smoothing his brow. As if she wanted to be there. As if she was glad to be there.</p><p>Helping a Lord.</p><p>She thinks Amun\u2019s her boyfriend, remember? Of course she was glad. Of course she was helping.</p><p>\u201cEx?\u201d he growled with more force than he\u2019d intended.</p><p>Her gunmetal gaze shifted and locked on him warily.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d There was nothing wary about her voice. That single word snapped at him with more force than even he had used. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clearly, she wanted him to get out and leave her the hel alone.</p><p>His molars gnashed together, and he beat down the tide of jealousy that suddenly raged through him.</p><p>Jealousy.</p> <p>Jealousy over a Hunter.

His eyes teared and burned, but at least those tears washed away the hazy shield seeming to cloak the entire room, al owing him a clearer view.</p><p>Third thing: Strider reclined in a cushy chair he\u2019d placed just in front of Amun\u2019s bed, watching him with an intent, almost forbidding expression.</p><p>Strider\u2019s mind was blank, and purposely so. The warrior knew Amun could read every single one of his thoughts.</p> <p>Everyone here knew it.

He tried to raise his hands to sign his reply. Like shit, for the most part. The apricots, the chil , both overshadowed the worst of his pain.</p><p>Only, his arms refused to obey the mental command. Why?</p><p>His head turned to the left, gaze sliding to his wrist.</p><p>Scabbed skin, dried blood.

Those other demons. The dark flashes, the vile urges.</p><p>Haidee. The knowledge that he should kil her, the inability to do so. A taste of heaven, her body writhing against his, her hands al over him, her sweet cries in his ears. Strider.</p><p>Battle, blood. Hating himself for hurting his friend and shielding a Hunter. Failing to reach the girl when she needed him. The return of the demons, the dark flashes and vile urges. No Haidee. No heaven.</p><p>Grim expectation mixed with white-hot rage and bone-numbing fear, al fil ing him as he jerked himself upright. The bedroom spun, a sharp lance of pain tearing through his temples. He didn\u2019t care, remained upright. Where was she? Dead? The thought left him sick to his stomach.</p><p>No. No, he assured himself desperately, and he felt Secrets\u2019s agreement. She couldn\u2019t be. That earthy perfume belonged to her, as raw and basic as his need for her. He had to find her. Had to make sure she was okay, that no one had hurt her.</p><p>Even though you meant to kil her yourself?</p><p>He ignored the simple, rational question and experimented with his range of motion, lifting one leg and rotating his ankle. He grimaced, then repeated the process with the other leg. He grimaced again. Both legs fel back onto the mattress with a hard thump. The bones had woven back together, but they were stil fractured.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Strider pushed to his feet, the chair skidding behind him. \u201cWhat the hel do you think you\u2019re doing? Lie down. You\u2019re stil recovering.\u201d</p><p>Amun hardly ever despised his inability to speak. Silence was his choice, his way of righting the wrongs he\u2019d committed al those centuries ago, of helping the innocents so much like the ones he\u2019d once slaughtered. Not to mention his friends. They had enough to worry about. But just then, he wanted to shout\u2014the girl, where the hel is the girl\u2014uncaring that the moment he did, al the secrets inside him would spil out, hurting everyone who heard them. Not physical y but mental y, and that was a far worse pain to bear. He knew that very wel .</p><p>Not even the warriors he lived with would be able to tolerate knowing when other men desired their women. Nor would they be able to tolerate the disgusting things their enemies had planned for their loved ones. Friendships would be destroyed, jealousy a constant companion, and paranoia would fol ow their every step.</p><p>Amun could deal because he\u2019d spent thousands of years learning to distance himself from the visions and voices in his head, blocking emotions before they could even form.</p><p>Not this newest onslaught, of course. He\u2019d never experienced anything like this and had no idea how to cope. Had no idea how he was lucid now, the new demons cowering in the back of his mind. Unless...</p><p>Haidee.</p><p>Her name whispered through his mind, a plea, a prayer, his demon sensing the truth, even as Amun struggled to accept it. Was she responsible? The first time, as wel as now?</p><p>The first time he\u2019d tasted frosted apricots, he\u2019d come to his senses. Now he tasted apricots again, and his senses once again returned. Couldn\u2019t be a coincidence. His desperation to find her intensified.</p><p>He threw his legs over the side of the mattress, hinges squeaking. Every muscle he possessed knotted and ached, clamping tightly on those fractured bones.</p><p>\u201cAmun, damn it. You\u2019ve been bed-bound for days, recovering from your wounds and our little experiments.</p><p>Stop before you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Agitation somehow making his motions fluid, he twisted to face his friend, lips pul ed over his teeth.</p><p>Most of what Strider had said confused him, but he left it alone. Final y forcing his hands to work, he jerkily signed, I\u2019m sorry I hurt you. Sorry I chal enged you before. But I have to find her.</p><p>Where is she? If they\u2019d hurt her, he didn\u2019t know what the hel he\u2019d do. Didn\u2019t know how she affected him like this. Didn\u2019t know why he cared what was done to her, whether she was responsible for his recovery or not.</p><p>Secrets whispered, She is fine, and despite the low volume, the High Lord stil managed to be the loudest voice in his head. At the same time, Strider sat back down and said, \u201cShe\u2019s there.\u201d His tone was hard and unbending as he motioned to the left with a tilt of his chin.</p><p>Amun noticed his friend didn\u2019t have to ask who \u201cshe\u201d was.</p><p>He fol owed that tilt with his gaze, and hissed in an agonized breath. She was on her knees, her arms chained above her head. That chain was anchored to his ceiling, offering just enough slack to keep her spine erect. Her head lol ed forward, her chin pressed into her col arbone.</p><p>The length of her blond-and-pink hair shielded most of her dirt-smudged face, but he could see that her eyes were closed, her long, curling lashes fanning down.</p><p>His lips parted in a silent roar as he at last pushed to a stand. She is not fine! His knees almost gave out, his stomach almost rebel ed, but fury and reckless determination gave him strength.</p><p>\u201cI drugged her,\u201d Strider said as if to soothe him from a violent temper. \u201cShe\u2019l recover.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t fucking matter! What mattered was that something had been done to her. How long had she been tethered like that? Unconscious? Helpless? Amun stalked to his friend, stumbling twice, and held out his hand, palm up. Secrets began prowling restlessly. Because they were closer to the girl?</p><p>Strider knew what he wanted and shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s a Hunter, Amun. She\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He waved his fingers, insisting. He would chal enge Strider if necessary. Would do anything for what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cDamn it! Do you care nothing for your own safety?\u201d</p><p>Again he waved his fingers.</p><p>\u201cFine. You can deal with the consequences on your own.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, but perhaps sensing the depths of Amun\u2019s resolve, Strider reached inside his pocket and withdrew a key. He slapped the metal into Amun\u2019s stil open palm.</p><p>Immediately Amun spun and stomped to Haidee. He tripped twice more along the way, but not even that slowed him. Secrets, he noted, had ceased prowling, was utterly stil and completely silent now.</p><p>Only those years of blunting the fiercest edges of his emotions kept his ire inside as he twisted the key into the lock. The metal unsnapped, freeing her. She sagged forward without a sound, arms fal ing heavily to her sides.</p><p>She would have kissed the floor if Amun hadn\u2019t caught her.</p><p>His arms despised him, sharp pains stil shooting through him, but he didn\u2019t care. At the moment of contact, the screams inside his head\u2014muted though they\u2019d been\u2014</p><p>quieted altogether, the demons determined to hide from her, as if they feared the pul ing would start up again.</p><p>Gently, so gently, he fit her against his chest and lifted her into his arms. The chil of her skin delighted him anew, and he couldn\u2019t help but remember the glide of that skin against his, caressing, stroking, the friction unbearably sweet.</p><p>Raw desire, brutal in its intensity, suddenly consumed every inch of him. He fought past that clawing need and carried her to the bed. He eased her down, then fit the covers around her slight frame and peered down at her. How fragile she looked, her cheeks a bit hol owed, her lips chapped, her skin pal id. How vulnerable she was, unable to defend herself from any type of attack.</p><p>She would hate that vulnerability, he thought, not needing his demon\u2019s help to recal the way she\u2019d constantly scanned her surroundings, how she\u2019d vigilantly searched for a weapon. How she had defended him with her very life.</p><p>Because she thought you were her human boyfriend, he recal ed next. He despised the reminder. Did she know the truth now? Would she fight him when she woke up? He thought he would prefer that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Better her loathing than her acceptance of him as another man.</p><p>He would be liked for himself or not at al .</p><p>Amun stil ed as he realized where his thoughts were headed. Permanency. Keeping her. The moisture in his mouth dried, and he felt like he was swal owing cotton mixed with Haidee\u2019s glass shards. He couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, keep her.</p> <p>When his friends learned what she\u2019d done, that she was the one who had helped kil Baden, they would demand her head. He could try to talk them out of it, but they wouldn\u2019t be denied. He knew that beyond any doubt. And if he chose her, placed her needs over theirs, they would never forgive him. Hel , he would never forgive himself. Baden deserved better. They deserved better.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about that now. Head spinning with the tide of conflicting emotions and urges flooding him, he climbed into bed beside her, fit her against him, and faced Strider with narrowed eyes. The warrior was watching him, blue eyes ablaze.</p><p>She\u2019s more than a Hunter, Strider thought, clearly knowing Amun would hear. She\u2019s responsible for Baden\u2019s kil er.</p><p>Amun knew the warrior wanted to keep that particular revelation just between them\u2014strange that he hadn\u2019t spoken aloud, considering no one else was in the room\u2014</p><p>but he was glad. The fewer people who knew about her, the safer she would be, and this way, no one would overhear.</p> <p>Then Secrets informed him that Torin knew, also. That Strider simply hadn\u2019t realized. Amun was shocked to his soul that neither man had kil ed her already. Shock that nearly burned him alive, chasing away the sweetest kiss of her chil ed skin. Because she lived, Amun had assumed he was the only one who had figured out her past misdeed.</p><p>\u201cWel ?\u201d Strider demanded</p><p>In reply to his previous statement, Amun merely nodded.</p><p>The warrior\u2019s nostrils flared with outrage. \u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>He gave a second nod.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be surprised. You always know everything. But fuck, man! You\u2019re stil treating her like a goddamn treasure.\u201d</p> <p>The words were gritted as he tunneled a hand through his hair and paced. \u201cYou picked her over me, damn it.\u201d</p><p>There was no response that could exonerate him, even another apology, so he offered none. And in the silence, Amun began to hear more of Strider\u2019s thoughts. Thoughts the warrior couldn\u2019t snuff out quickly enough.</p><p>She\u2019s mine. To kiss, to kil . Whatever I decide. Damn her, how has she tied me in knots like this? I despise her.</p><p>Amun\u2019s hands curled into fists. Mine, he wanted to shout.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. Such a confession would only dig his hole of guilt and shame deeper, so he kept his lips pressed into a tight line.</p><p>Why haven\u2019t you harmed her? he signed stiffly. Because Strider desired her, too? Such desire was completely unlike the war-hungry man, though. Only Sabin, their leader and keeper of the demon of Doubt, was better able to place the campaign against the Hunters over his personal needs and wants. So Strider\u2019s hesitation to strike had to stem from something else. Or rather, it had better stem from something else.</p><p>Amun had never felt more capable of murder than he did at that moment, thinking of another man putting his hands on Haidee.</p><p>Guilt...shame...he fel into the hole anyway.</p> <p>His friend plopped back into the chair, gaze never leaving him. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how, but she calms you, clears your mind, even makes the demons cower.\u201d</p><p>So. As he\u2019d suspected, Haidee was responsible for his recovery. The knowledge was as upsetting as it was welcome.</p><p>\u201cShe has to be near you, in the same room, for...whatever she does to work,\u201d Strider went on. \u201cWe stil don\u2019t know how she\u2019s doing it, but we\u2019ve carried her in and out of this room several times to test the limits of her ability. Once she reaches the hal way, your torment begins al over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExperiments\u201d suddenly made sense. Was her ability the reason he felt bound to her? Because she somehow did what he couldn\u2019t, frightening the demons into submission?</p><p>Was that how she affected him so strongly, his body a slave to desires he didn\u2019t want to feel?</p><p>That question led to another, one far more distressing than any that had come before. Was this how Baden had felt when he\u2019d opened his door one moonlit night and found Haidee outside, begging for help?</p><p>The memory opened up in Amun\u2019s mind, courtesy of Haidee, he was sure.</p><p>I\u2019m frightened, she\u2019d said, tears glistening in her eyes, her lower lip trembling. I think someone\u2019s out there, fol owing me. Please escort me home. Please.</p><p>He beat it back until he saw only black. He didn\u2019t want to go there. Other questions began to pop up, each more damning than the last. Had Baden looked at her lovely face and felt at peace for the first time since his possession?</p><p>Was that why he\u2019d simply bowed his head when the Hunters had surged from their hiding places and attacked him, welcoming his own death?</p><p>Jerkily, he signed, Can she hear your thoughts?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Strider blinked, shook his head in confusion. \u201cCan she hear yours?\u201d</p><p>Amun nodded stiffly.</p><p>\u201cCan she hear everything? Even your demon...s? Even your demons.\u201d</p><p>No. Thank the gods. Just what I al ow her to hear.</p><p>Strider propped his elbow on the arm of the chair, a triumphant gleam suddenly glittering in his blue eyes, intensifying the blaze already banked there. \u201cWe can use that to our advantage.\u201d</p><p>Of course the warrior immediately went to tricking and defeating the girl. \u201cSabin wil \u2014\u201d</p><p>Amun hissed before he could stop himself. No.</p><p>Again Strider blinked in confusion.</p><p>No, he signed a second time. You wil not mention this to Sabin. He barely stopped himself from adding, Ever.</p><p>\u201cAmun, you know I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Not yet. You won\u2019t mention it yet. Amun had chosen to fol ow Sabin while they\u2019d lived in the heavens, soldiers for the god king, even though Lucien had been the one in charge. No one could strategize like Sabin. No one was fiercer. No one was better suited to getting an unpleasant job done.</p><p>After they\u2019d opened Pandora\u2019s box and found themselves cursed, as wel as stuck in the land of the mortals, half of his friends had continued to fol ow Lucien. The other half had decided to fol ow Sabin.</p><p>Amun hadn\u2019t changed his mind.</p><p>He\u2019d gone with Sabin because no one hated Hunters more.</p><p>For the first time in al the centuries since, he regretted that decision.</p><p>Amun had often helped his friend torture their prisoners for information, but he hadn\u2019t enjoyed the screams or the blood as Sabin had. Stil . He\u2019d known that what they were doing was necessary to their survival.</p><p>Now he knew, deep in his bones, that no matter what he said, the moment Sabin learned Haidee\u2019s true identity, he would stride into this room and calmly but surely strip her of her pride, her peace of mind and even her wil to live.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to keep this from him, Amun,\u201d Strider said.</p><p>There was no emotion in his tone. His voice was dead now, his tenacity clear.</p><p>Give me a day with her, then. A day wasn\u2019t going to be enough, he realized in the next instant. Not because he desired her. Which he did. Oh, did he desire. More than he should, more than he\u2019d ever desired another. There was stil no denying that fact. Never before had he placed someone else\u2019s welfare above that of his friends, and an enemy at that. No, a day wasn\u2019t going to be enough because she\u2019d cal ed him \u201cbaby\u201d and he wanted so badly for it to be true.</p><p>He scrubbed a hand down his sore, swol en face. The endearment had been meant for another man.</p><p>That should have lessened its appeal. It didn\u2019t.</p><p>Stil . He was going to protect her, he thought. From Sabin.</p><p>From al of them. She was the reason Amun\u2019s sanity had returned. Therefore, he had to keep her safe.</p><p>And if he was going to keep her safe, at least for a little while, he needed to set a few rules. Like, no more thinking about how soft she felt in his arms. Like, no more tapping into her sweetest memories.</p><p>Like, no more kissing her.</p><p>The first time had been the last time. No matter how succulent she\u2019d tasted. No matter how passionately she\u2019d come apart for him. No matter how much he yearned to sink inside her, slipping in and out, slowly at first, then increasing his speed, pushing them both to feverish heights. Shit. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be thinking about her, and he damn wel wasn\u2019t supposed to be lusting for her.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want a day?\u201d Strider demanded. \u201cA day\u2019s not going to change anything. Besides, Sabin\u2019s not going to kil her, knowing she\u2019s responsible for your improved condition.\u201d</p><p>Sabin would torture her, though. Because I would rather pamper an enemy\u2014even the one responsible for Baden\u2019s murder, he added for his own benefit\u2014than endure the darkness and the visions. Selfish of him, yes, and another reason to hate himself, but that wasn\u2019t going to stop him.</p><p>Another reason to hate himself? he mused then. An odd choice of words. Amun didn\u2019t hate himself and never had.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like some of the things he\u2019d done over his endless lifetime, but hate? No. Unlike some of the other warriors, he wasn\u2019t fil ed with guilt over his past, either. He\u2019d kil ed innocents, yes. He\u2019d razed cities to the ground, that, too. But he\u2019d been a puppet, his strings pul ed by his demon. So how, then, was he to blame?</p><p>Because he should have been stronger? That was what some of his friends thought about themselves.</p><p>Not him. No one would have been strong enough to stop those demons.</p><p>Because he\u2019d helped open Pandora\u2019s box, and deserved the punishment that led to his need for destruction? Nearly al of the Lords thought that, but again, Amun didn\u2019t.</p><p>Everyone made mistakes, and that had been one of his.</p><p>You paid the price and then you moved on.</p><p>And what of Haidee? he wondered. Was her mistake forgivable? Had she paid the price? Should he move on?</p><p>His jaw clenched. He ignored that line of questioning, focusing instead on what he\u2019d do once his day with her was over\u2014or if he wasn\u2019t even given a day. No matter what, he wasn\u2019t going to al ow Sabin to have her. When the time came, Amun would simply cart her out of the fortress. And once they left, no one would be able to find them. His demon could do more than steal secrets from those around them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His demon could keep secrets. Distorting memories, even before they were created.</p><p>If Amun wanted to disappear forever, he could disappear forever.</p><p>He could hide Haidee until he learned how to control the new demons himself. Then...then he didn\u2019t know what he would do with her. Bring her back, he hoped. Do what needed doing, he prayed. Because if he failed to learn the answers he needed, he would be stuck with Haidee forever, destroying his friends.</p> <p>Plus, Amun added, I plan to talk to her. Learn more about her effect on me.</p><p>\u201cWho are you trying to fool? Yourself or me? We both know that\u2019s a lie. You\u2019re not thinking with you brain right now, my man.\u201d The last was snapped, as if the warrior had reached the end of his patience.</p><p>\u201cYou want to fuck her, end of story.\u201d</p><p>Wel , Amun had reached the end of his patience, too. What we both know is that you aren\u2019t thinking with your brain, either.</p><p>There was a momentary splash of astonishment over Strider\u2019s face before the warrior smoothed his features into a blank expression that matched his earlier tone. \u201cStay out of my head.\u201d</p> <p>Control your thoughts, Amun signed. I know you desire her.</p><p>Now I\u2019l hear you admit it.</p><p>The tip of Strider\u2019s tongue traced over the straight line of his teeth. \u201cFine. I want her. But I\u2019m not going to do anything about it. I\u2019m not going to let it stop me from winning our war.\u201d At least he didn\u2019t try to deny his feelings. \u201cCan you say the same?\u201d</p><p>Amun merely raised his chin. I can\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cFunny. That\u2019s not what I meant and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Wel , that\u2019s al you\u2019re going to get from me.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d Strider snarled, pushing to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m leaving before you provoke my demon any more.</p><p>You\u2019ve got your day, but I\u2019d be careful if I were you. When you least expect it, she\u2019s gonna go for your head. Guaranteed. And maybe that doesn\u2019t concern you. Maybe you even want to die.</p><p>Yeah, I saw what you did to yourself. But guess what? Not for a single moment are any of the rest of us ready to deal with your loss. So why don\u2019t you think about that before you put your life on the line for our enemy?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>TWO SECONDS AFTER STRIDER barricaded himself inside his own bedroom, he had his phone in hand and was texting Lucien. He couldn\u2019t deal with this. He\u2019d reached his bul shit limit.</p><p>At fortress. Come get me. Now.</p><p>It was nice, having a friend who could flash from one location to another with only a thought.</p><p>Within five minutes, his friend materialized a few feet away from him. Lucien was winded, barreled chest rising and fal ing shal owly. A sheen of sweat covered his entire torso.</p> <p>His mane of black hair shagged around his severely scarred face, and his multicolored eyes were bright.</p><p>He was shirtless, his butterfly tattoo practical y crackling with electricity on his left shoulder. His unfastened pants were barely staying on his hips. To top it al off, tension radiated from the man.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel were you doing?\u201d Strider asked from his closet. He\u2019d already strapped himself with weapons, but a few moments before had decided a couple more blades wouldn\u2019t hurt. Wel , wouldn\u2019t hurt him.</p><p>One of Lucien\u2019s black brows practical y knitted into his hairline. \u201cWho the hel do you think I was doing?\u201d</p><p>O-kay, then. Lucien had been in bed with Anya. For a moment, Strider almost forgot how pissed he was with Amun and Haidee as he savored the fact that he\u2019d just cock-blocked the keeper of Death.</p><p>Almost. \u201cAnyone ever tel you that you shouldn\u2019t check your messages while you\u2019re rol ing around in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Anya. And believe me, I\u2019m going to pay for this.\u201d His deep baritone was amused and excited rather than fearful at the thought of incurring his volatile female\u2019s wrath.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a news flash for you. No matter what I\u2019m doing, I check my messages when I\u2019m worried about leaving my friends at home with a contingent of angels, when one of my men is sick, or when a Hunter is in residence. And when al three are happening at once? I check even when I don\u2019t have messages. So.</p><p>What\u2019s wrong? Why did you summon me? Amun okay?\u201d</p><p>Strider shoved an extra clip for his .22 into his pocket as he abandoned the confines of the walk-in.</p><p>\u201cAmun\u2019s great.</p><p>Better. The problem\u2019s me. I gotta take off for a little while.\u201d</p><p>For his sanity, yes, but mostly for Amun\u2019s safety.</p><p>Amun had lifted the fragile Haidee into his battered arms and carried her to his bed. He had tucked her under the covers, so careful not to jostle her, and climbed in beside her. Strider didn\u2019t think Amun realized this, but the warrior had caressed the woman during their entire conversation, as if the need to touch her was already ingrained in his soul.</p><p>A sense of chal enge had begun to rise inside of Strider.</p><p>For Haidee, a godsdamn Hunter. Worse, a godsdamn kil er. He\u2019d wanted to win her from Amun and claim her for his own, and the want had been far more intense than his usual \u201cthat\u2019s mine and I\u2019m not sharing\u201d mind-set.</p><p>If Strider stayed here, he would eventual y give in. He wouldn\u2019t be able to help himself. His demon would badger him constantly, and in the end, he would fight his friend, hurt his friend\u2014because no way in hel would he pul his punches like he\u2019d done the first time\u2014and hate himself.</p><p>Hate. Huh. He\u2019d never hated himself. If anything, he\u2019d always liked himself a little too much. Once, a human female had even accused him of picturing his own face while he climaxed. He hadn\u2019t denied it, either, and next time he\u2019d slept with her, he\u2019d made sure to scream, \u201cStrider\u201d at the pivotal moment.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t appreciated his sense of humor, and that had been the final nail in their relationship coffin. He was too intense, too jaded, too warped and too...everything for most women to take for long. But so what. He was made of awesome. Anyone who couldn\u2019t see that wasn\u2019t smart enough to be with him, anyway.</p><p>Haidee, though... She would be able to take him. With her strength of wil , her courage, her unbending and reckless spirit, she would match him. Maybe even surpass him.</p><p>That is the key player in Baden\u2019s murder you\u2019re thinking about.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t mattered to Amun, he thought darkly. Why should it matter to him?</p><p>Fuck! He hated those thoughts.</p><p>Hated. There was that word again.</p><p>\u201c\u2014listening to me?\u201d he heard Lucien ask with exasperation.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSay again.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, Lucien strode to the bed and sat at the edge of the mattress. Strider\u2019s gaze fol owed his friend, picking up little details about the room along the way. He hadn\u2019t cleaned in a few days, had been too busy guarding Amun, so his clothes were scattered throughout. His iPod hung from his nightstand, the earbuds wrapped around a lamp.</p><p>How the hel had it gotten there? Oh, yeah. He\u2019d tossed it over his shoulder last night, uncaring where it landed.</p><p>\u201cTorin texted me and told me Amun was doing better, but damn,\u201d Lucien said, once again dragging him from his thoughts. \u201cYou scared ten years off my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Eternity\u2019s too long, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when you\u2019re with the right woman.\u201d</p><p>He experienced a flash of jealousy that so many of his peeps had found the \u201cright woman\u201d already. And damn it, he was as sick of being jealous as he was of everything else.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d Lucien said. \u201cLet me help you, whatever\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to talk about.\u201d He needed to forget Haidee, lose himself in another woman, in the heat and wetness of her body. An appropriate woman. Someone inexperienced, though not a virgin. Someone he wouldn\u2019t have to work his ass off trying to win, then work his ass off again to please. \u201cI need a break, that\u2019s al .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou summoned me with a \u2018now\u2019 because you need a break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019ve been on break for weeks, it seems. Let someone else have a turn.\u201d</p><p>Silence, thick and heavy, enveloped them. Lucien studied him, and whatever he saw in Strider\u2019s expression caused him to lose his air of irritation. \u201cAl right. I\u2019l take you wherever you want to go. For Torin\u2019s sake, someone needs to take your place before we leave. He\u2019d never admit it, would even deny it, but he needs some help running this heap.\u201d</p><p>Gods, he loved his friends. Lucien wasn\u2019t going to question him further. Was just going to give him what he\u2019d asked for.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do it,\u201d Lucien continued, \u201cbut I\u2019m busy. I haven\u2019t been vacationing as you seem to think. I\u2019ve been\u2014and currently am\u2014guarding the Cage of Compulsion in a place Rhea can\u2019t reach. And I can\u2019t tel you where that is. Torin asked me not to say anything since there\u2019s a Hunter in residence.\u201d</p><p>The cage was one of the four godly relics needed to find and destroy Pandora\u2019s box, and in desperate need of that guarding. Strider knew that wasn\u2019t the only reason Lucien refused to move back into the fortress. The god queen was out for blood, and the man didn\u2019t want his Anya in any more danger than necessary. Strider could dig. \u201cWil iam\u2019s here,\u201d</p><p>Strider said. \u201cHe can\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucien was already shaking his head. \u201cHe\u2019s useless. He grows bored too easily to be relied upon. He\u2019l forget whatever duty he\u2019s promised to perform and head into town for a little some-some.\u201d</p><p>Some-some. Someone was picking up his woman\u2019s vernacular. \u201cApparently he\u2019s related to Lucifer.</p><p>That has to count for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me. I know who he\u2019s related to,\u201d Lucien replied dryly. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he\u2019s strong. No one wil want to mess with\u2014\u201d</p><p>Again Lucien shook his head. \u201cNope. Like I said, he\u2019s unreliable. He\u2019l think of himself first and everyone else not at al .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Wil iam wasn\u2019t demon-possessed. He was a god, according to himself, and had spent centuries locked in Tartarus\u2014a prison for immortals\u2014for sleeping with the wrong woman. Hundreds of them, in fact. He\u2019d even slept with Hera, the former god king\u2019s wife, and had been stripped of some of his supernatural abilities as further punishment. Exactly what those abilities were, he wouldn\u2019t say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Strider liked the man, even though, as Lucien had said, he looked out only for himself. Even though he could turn on you in a heartbeat, stabbing you in the back\u2014or rather, the stomach\u2014as Lucien had experienced firsthand.</p><p>My kinda guy, Strider mused. And since Wil iam wasn\u2019t wanted here, maybe he\u2019d want to leave with Strider. Strider made a mental note to text him before taking off. Never hurt to vacation with a friend.</p><p>So. Who did that leave to guard the fortress and those inside? \u201cKane and Cameo,\u201d he said with a nod.</p> <p>Disaster and Misery. \u201cSince Amun\u2019s better, they can return from wherever they are.\u201d</p><p>Lucien pondered for a moment, then nodded in turn. \u201cAl right, then. It\u2019s settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more thing. Tomorrow I need you to contact Sabin.\u201d</p><p>Strider planned to be too wasted to be coherent. \u201cHe needs to return, too, and meet the female Hunter up close and personal. But don\u2019t cal him until tomorrow, okay?\u201d</p><p>While Torin had apparently been texting, Strider had been cal ing both Lucien and Sabin every day, giving them updates on Amun\u2019s health. Only thing he hadn\u2019t told them\u2014</p> <p>yet\u2014was Haidee\u2019s identity. He didn\u2019t know why. He\u2019d certainly meant to share, but every time he\u2019d tried, the words had congealed in his throat.</p><p>Al he knew was that he stil wasn\u2019t going to tel them. Like him, they\u2019d find out the truth as soon as they talked to her.</p><p>And when they did, Strider wouldn\u2019t have betrayed Amun\u2019s trust, but would stil have done al he could to safeguard his friend from the murdering bitch\u2019s influence.</p><p>Shit. He was getting worked up again, fighting a need to stomp back to Amun\u2019s room and do some damage.</p><p>Win? Defeat asked.</p><p>Oh, no. We\u2019re not going there.</p> <p>\u201cConsider it done,\u201d Lucien said.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he replied, tangling a hand in his hair. \u201c\u2019Cause I real y need this break.\u201d</p><p>Once again Lucien asked no questions. He merely straightened and gave another nod. \u201cPack while I hunt down the lucky twosome and bring them home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to pack.\u201d He had his weapons. That\u2019s al he needed.</p><p>For the first time during their conversation, Lucien\u2019s lips twitched into the semblance of a smile. \u201cTwice you\u2019ve said you need a break. We both know nothing wil change in a day or two. You\u2019l stil be stressed, on edge. So I want you gone for at least two weeks, and that\u2019s a nonnegotiable requirement if you expect transport. Pack.\u201d</p><p>Death didn\u2019t wait for Strider\u2019s reply. He simply disappeared.</p><p>Strider packed.</p><p>WILLIAM THE EVER RANDY, as the shitheads here had started cal ing him, lay propped on his bed, a mountain of pil ows behind him. His covers were tucked around his waist and legs, cocooning him in a way he despised but refused to complain about because his Gil ian Shaw\u2014</p> <p>nicknamed Gil y, also nicknamed Little Gil y Gumdrop, though only he was al owed to cal the seventeen-year-old human that last one\u2014was responsible. She had a huge crush on him, and she had thought \u201ctucking him in\u201d would soothe him.</p><p>Unlike the tucking in, he\u2019d done everything he could to discourage the crush. She\u2019d told him she wanted to date a nonsmoker, so he\u2019d immediately taken up the habit. Was even now sucking a disgusting cloud of ash into his mouth and blowing smoke in her too-appealing, perfectly sun-kissed face.</p><p>She gave a delicate cough.</p><p>Tragical y, the smoke failed to diminish the loveliness of her features. Big, wide eyes of the purest chocolate. Sharp cheekbones that hinted at the passion she would one day be capable of giving. A pixie nose, slightly uptilted at the end. Lush pink lips. And framing al that beauty was a cascade of midnight hair.</p><p>With a sigh, he smashed the cigarette butt into the ashtray beside him. Maybe it was time he took up drinking.</p><p>\u201cLiam,\u201d she said softly. Her nickname for him. A name he would kil anyone else for using. Maybe because it was hers and hers alone. She sat beside him, her hip pressed against his, warm and soft and completely feminine. \u201cI have a question for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk.\u201d He could deny her nothing\u2014except a romantic relationship. Not only because she was too young, but because he...wel , he liked her. Yeah, shocking. Wil iam the Perfect\u2014a much more suitable name for him\u2014friends with a female other than Anya. The world should have ended.</p><p>But, in many ways, Gil y truly was his best friend. When he\u2019d returned from hel , unable to care for himself, she had done so. She had fetched his food, endured his dark moods as the pain became too much, and washed his sweat-soaked brow when necessary.</p><p>If, when she reached maturity, he was foolish enough to touch her, their easy camaraderie would be ruined. She would be forever disil usioned about the kind of man he was. He didn\u2019t want to disil usion her.</p><p>She deserved a man who would give her the world. Al Wil iam would give her was pain.</p><p>So, become involved? Hel , no. Not now, not later. He wouldn\u2019t al ow himself to hurt her. Ever. He was many things</p><p>\u2014a womanizer, a kil er. Cal ous, sometimes cruel, always selfish and dark in a way no one inside this fortress knew.</p><p>But this tiny little beauty had been through enough in her short life. Physical abuse, and so much worse.</p><p>She\u2019d run away from home, had lived on the streets, taking care of herself when loved ones should have ensured her safety.</p><p>After Danika and Reyes, the keeper of Pain, had hooked up, Danika had brought her here. Wil iam had taken an instant liking to her. She\u2019d needed someone to look out for her, and Wil iam had decided to be that someone. For now.</p><p>That meant destroying those who had destroyed her innocence and later helping her find a man worthy of her love. That meant resisting her.</p><p>Lids heavy over those exotic eyes and lashes so thick and curling they seemed to be reaching for her brows, she traced some sort of design on the covers beside him. At last she found the courage to ask her question. \u201cYou\u2019re cursed by the gods, but I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re cursed. I mean, I tried to read your book. Anya let me borrow it, I hope you don\u2019t mind, but the pages were weird.\u201d</p><p>The subject he hated more than any other. His curse. The only person he\u2019d ever discussed the particulars with was Anya, and then only because they\u2019d been cel neighbors inside Tartarus, and he\u2019d needed something to do while the centuries ticked by. When they\u2019d later escaped, he\u2019d made the mistake of showing her the book that detailed everything he\u2019d told her, as wel as his only chance for salvation.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when the naughty goddess had stolen that book\u2014and now threatened to rip the pages out every time he pissed her off. Nor should he have been surprised that she\u2019d given Gil y a peek. Anya had taken over the girl\u2019s care, too, and knew how the sweet little human felt about him.</p><p>But damn it, his secrets were his own.</p><p>\u201cLiam?\u201d</p><p>Resisting was pointless. And gods, he was pathetic. To not even put up a fight? Sickening. \u201cThe book is written in code,\u201d he explained. A roundabout fuck-you from Zeus, he mused. A \u201chere\u2019s your salvation\u2014not.\u201d He had yet to find the key to unlocking that code. He knew it was out there, though. It had to be out there. He couldn\u2019t believe otherwise.</p><p>Even though he was afraid to find the key, afraid to know more about his curse.</p><p>\u201cYes, but how are you cursed?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t tel her. He knew what she was doing. Trying to find a way to save him. Stil . She needed to know the truth. Maybe then her crush would at last crash and burn.</p><p>\u201cAl I know is that the woman I fal in love with wil unleash\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together. The woman he fel in love with would unleash every evil being he had ever created. And he had created some monsters. That, he wouldn\u2019t tel her. \u201cShe wil kil me,\u201d he finished.</p><p>That, too, was the truth.</p><p>Her eyes widened as she lifted her gaze to his face. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe curse isn\u2019t completely mine. I share it with her.\u201d</p><p>Whoever she was. \u201cOnce I fal in love with her, she\u2019l lose her mind. She\u2019l think only of my demise, and she\u2019l make sure it comes to pass.\u201d</p><p>Another gift courtesy of that too-cocky shit, Zeus. Good news was, the joke was on the now deposed king. Wil iam had never fal en in love and never would. There was only room in his heart for one, and he was that one.</p><p>\u201cI would never hurt you,\u201d Gil y said softly. And before he could reply, not that he had any clue as to what to say, she added, \u201cLet\u2019s backtrack a little. The book contains a way to save you? And her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He gently chucked her under the chin. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, Gumdrop. The curse is one of blood, which means someone has to die. If I\u2019m saved, the one who saves me wil be the one to die in my place. That isn\u2019t going to be you. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak, but she didn\u2019t nod, either. Nor did her gentle expression change. That scared him. The thought of dying should have freaked her out. The thought of her dying did freak him out.</p><p>With more force than he\u2019d intended, he said, \u201cBe a good girl, and go get some rest. You\u2019ve got circles under your eyes, and I don\u2019t like them.\u201d</p><p>Final y. A reaction. Her mouth pressed into a mulish line, and as wel as he was coming to know her, he prepared himself for pure, unbending stubbornness. Whoever she ultimately ended up with was going to have his hands ful .</p><p>Poor bastard.</p><p>Dead bastard. Wil iam might kil him just for fun.</p><p>Don\u2019t go there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a little girl,\u201d she gritted out. \u201cSo stop treating me like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a little girl,\u201d he replied easily, rol ing his eyes for good measure. She was, and that was a fact.</p><p>She stuck her tongue out at him, proving his claim. \u201cThe boys at my school don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He would not react to the sight of that tongue. Or to the provocative words. \u201cThe boys at your school are dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. They want to kiss me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A flicker of rage took residence in his chest. \u201cYou better not encourage them, little girl, because I wil hurt them if they ever try anything with you.

Until then, keep your lips to yourself or you\u2019l regret it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, real y? Give me a hint, then.\u201d There was steel in her voice rather than amusement. \u201cWhat age do you consider old enough and just how wil I regret disobeying you?\u201d</p><p>A wiser man would have kept his fat mouth closed. \u201cThree hundred. Or so,\u201d he added, giving himself room to work.</p><p>\u201cAnd believe me, you do not want to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019m human,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019l never be that old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And he didn\u2019t like that fact, he realized. She had eighty years, give or take a few, but no more. And that was only if she wasn\u2019t run over by a car. Or beheaded by a Hunter.</p> <p>Damn it. If he had to sign on with the Lords for a permanent place in their army just to look after her, he was going to be annoyed. He had shit to do, places to be.</p><p>\u201cSecond, I\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>She should be. The things he\u2019d done over the years.... The things he would do in the years to come....</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s forget the fear for now.

Get out of here.\u201d</p> <p>She hit the floor with a hmph, then popped to her feet. She peered down at him for a long while. He let her look, silent, knowing what she saw. A black-haired, blue-eyed stunner who had broken more hearts than he could count. He prayed that she, like al the others before her, wouldn\u2019t overlook the fact that his heart had never been breached.</p><p>That she wouldn\u2019t see him as a chal enge, as tamable...as worth any risk.</p><p>His phone beeped, disrupting the quiet and signaling a text had come in. She glanced at the phone on the nightstand, then at him.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said more firmly.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She spun and strode from the room, leaving Wil iam with an odd, hol ow feeling in his chest.</p><p>Damn it, he thought again.</p><p>Another beep sounded. He pushed Gil y to the back of his mind and lifted the little black device to read the screen.</p><p>Screen name \u201cStridey-Man\u201d asked, Want 2 vacay w/me?</p> <p>Wil iam snorted as he typed.

A vial of acid. A bone saw. A spiked paddle. A cat-o\u2019-nine-tails. And a bag of Gummy Bears.</p><p>Gods, but this was going to be fun.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>HAIDEE LUXURIATED IN THE now-familiar warmth enveloping her, branding her al over again, as the hazy dream took shape in her mind. Moonlight surrounded her, il uminating the veranda she stood upon, as wel as the pond she studied in the courtyard. Fireflies hovered over the clear, dappled water like fal en stars that had final y found a new perch. A cool breeze ruffled the wild tumble of her hair, and her lavender robe\u2014her wedding gown\u2014</p><p>danced at her ankles.</p><p>She could hardly believe this day had arrived.</p><p>Solon had actual y married her. After a rocky start and courtship, he\u2019d vowed to love and cherish her in front of his friends and family. Even though he was a powerful noble, she was not, and he could have kept her as a slave. But that arrangement was unacceptable, he\u2019d said. As his wife, no one would ever hurt her again. Even after he died.</p><p>For that alone, she would have fal en in love with him.</p><p>Except, she\u2019d already loved him. He was older than she by sixteen years but strongly built nonetheless.</p><p>He had only ever regarded her with kindness, had never raised a hand to her in anger, even though his first reaction to her had been one of tension, and had never al owed his visitors to abuse her.</p><p>He\u2019d begun to cosset her soon after buying her at the slave market, some eleven years before. She\u2019d been a child then, stil devastated by the loss of her family, terrified by the new fate that awaited her and confused by the numbing cold that had never left her. A cold that had saved her from being raped, time and time again. Most men couldn\u2019t stand to touch her.</p><p>And perhaps that was why Solon had never demanded sexual favors in return for his kindness. At least, that\u2019s what she had assumed. Until six weeks ago, when he had asked for her hand in marriage.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous, my sweet?\u201d a familiar voice asked from behind her.</p><p>She turned, heart accelerating with dizzying speed. Leora, friend and equal until this very day, was now supposed to be her servant. Gray hair frizzed around her aged features, and she wore the same coarse sack Haidee was used to wearing.</p><p>If Leora was here, that meant the time had come. That meant her husband had summoned her, was ready for her.</p><p>Her husband. \u201cI love when you cal me that,\u201d she replied sincerely. \u201cEspecial y since you did not like me at first.\u201d No one had. For that matter, no one ever did.</p><p>\u201cNo. But that soon changed, did it not?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Just like with Solon. \u201cIt did. And yes, yes. I\u2019m nervous, but excited, too.\u201d</p><p>Final y, she would be al owed to show Solon the depths of her gratitude for him.</p><p>Leora arched a too-thin brow. \u201cAnd you know what a man does to his new wife on their wedding night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d At least she thought so.</p><p>She had squeezed her eyes tightly closed when the guards at the market had raped the other slaves. The screams, though... Haidee shuddered, momentarily lost in the pain and humiliation she had been helpless to stop, no matter how much she had struggled against her chains, no matter how much she had prayed and cried and hated.</p><p>Deep down, she knew bedding Solon wouldn\u2019t be like that.</p><p>He would be tender, patient. He was kind and sensitive, and he would ease any fears she harbored.</p><p>\u201cThen I wil not keep you a moment longer,\u201d Leora said with a soft smile. \u201cYour man awaits.\u201d</p><p>The old woman turned, her bones creaking, and ushered dream Haidee inside a torch-lit hal way, toward the gynaeceum. The master\u2019s bedchamber. Alabaster columns stretched on each side of them, the arching doorway\u2014their final destination\u2014looming closer...closer stil ...</p><p>Real-life Haidee cried out, reaching for the innocent girl she\u2019d been, trying to grab her, halt her. \u201cNo.</p><p>Don\u2019t go in there.\u201d She had never remembered what had led to this point of her memories, but she suddenly knew what waited beyond that entrance. \u201cStop! Please, stop!\u201d</p><p>Neither female paid her any heed. Closer...</p><p>Haidee. A male\u2019s hard, determined baritone fil ed her head.</p><p>Equal y hard bands wrapped around her forearms, white-hot and inexorable, shaking her. Wake up.</p><p>Haidee fought the voice, just as she fought the dream. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Her arms flailed, her legs kicked. If she could prevent herself from going inside that bedroom, she could save herself thousands of years of guilt and pain. \u201cDon\u2019t go in there! Please!\u201d</p><p>Closer...</p><p>As Leora slowed her steps, she glanced over her shoulder and offered Haidee another sweet smile.</p><p>They had final y reached the door. Leora stepped aside. A trembling, unsuspecting Haidee reached out\u2014</p><p>\u2014was somehow floating, suspended\u2014</p><p>\u2014was tightening her fingers around the edges of the curtain\u2014</p><p>\u2014was being straightened out, placed on her feet\u2014</p><p>Before she could enter the room, cold water hit her ful -</p><p>force, soaking her from head to toe and shocking her into reality. Haidee sputtered, blowing droplets out of her mouth.</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered open.</p><p>Out of habit, she immediately took stock of her surroundings. She stood inside a shower stal .</p><p>Unfamiliar.</p><p>Spacious, tiled, the faucet speckled with gold filigree. She glanced down at herself. She stil wore the new T-shirt, jeans and underclothes Strider had given her before chaining her. Her feet were stil bare.</p><p>Dark arms ripped with muscle were wrapped around her waist, holding her upright. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stiffened, began to struggle. Panic gave her weakened body strength, her heart pumping blood through her veins at an astonishing rate. Yet, no matter what she did, she couldn\u2019t budge those meaty arms.</p><p>Easy. Easy now. Are you okay?</p><p>Amun\u2019s voice, steady though concerned, uncompromising though tender. He was the one holding her, she realized.</p> <p>Instantly the fight abandoned her, and she sagged against him, resting her head in the hol ow of his neck.</p><p>If he was standing, that meant he had recovered. She was so relieved she could have sobbed. She\u2019d spent several days trapped beside his bed, drifting in and out of consciousness. His stupid friend had carted her in and out, in and out. Just when Amun would stop thrashing, about to awaken, Defeat would move her. When the bastard would final y take her back, Amun would be worse than before.</p><p>Each and every time.</p><p>Now he was aware, lucid. For good. Now she was free.</p><p>Now they were touching.</p> <p>Nightmare? he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she managed to croak past the sudden lump in her throat. \u201cHow did we get here?\u201d Later.</p><p>She thought she remembered vowing that she wouldn\u2019t al ow herself to touch him again. Wouldn\u2019t al ow him to touch her. Both were dangerous. And maybe she had, maybe she hadn\u2019t. Nothing seemed real just then. But when one of his arms moved away from her, she had to cut off a whimper.</p><p>To her surprise, he didn\u2019t abandon her. He merely reached forward and twisted the faucet before straightening and holding her again. A few seconds later, the temperature of the water warmed considerably.</p><p>Tel me about the nightmare, he said, gripping the hem of her T-shirt and lifting.</p><p>She could have protested. Instead, she raised her arms and al owed him to whisk the material over her head. This moment was so steeped in fantasy, so...necessary, she wanted only to fol ow it to its end. \u201cI saw the vision you showed me the other day. The one on the veranda.\u201d</p> <p>I thought that was a good thing. He unfastened her jeans and pushed them to her ankles, then picked her up and kicked the denim out of the tub, leaving her in her bra and panties.</p><p>\u201cI saw what came after.\u201d Another croak.</p><p>With one hand snaked around her waist, propping her up, he used his other hand to palm a bar of soap and began lathering her skin. But you were so happy at the beginning.</p><p>So intimate a task, so shattering a topic. Yet, despite who and what he was, she had never felt more comfortable with another being. He didn\u2019t try to arouse her as he cleaned her, careful of her cuts and bruises; he merely performed a basic task.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><p>Tel me, he repeated. Once her skin was washed free of dirt and grime, he massaged shampoo into her hair. The scent of sandalwood bonded with the rising steam.</p><p>She opened her mouth to obey, but the words tangled on her tongue. If she spoke them, she realized, she would fling herself back to the past, back to that dark, dark day that had forever changed the course of her life\u2014and his. She would lose the tranquility of this moment.</p><p>Tranquility she desperately needed.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she final y said. \u201cNot now. Later. Please.\u201d</p><p>Our later is fil ing up.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She expected him to push for answers, but he merely ducked her head under the spray of water and rinsed the suds from her hair. Clearly he understood a woman\u2019s needs because he coated the thick strands with conditioner, gave the cream time to do its job, then gently rinsed her hair again.</p><p>There. Al clean.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t switch off the water or even move from where he stood behind her. He simply continued to hold her, strong fingers tracing circles just below her navel, his chin resting atop her head.</p><p>Stil he didn\u2019t try to arouse her. Not once did he pluck at her pebbled nipples or brush his fingertips over her sex. Yet, with every second that passed, her skin became more sensitized, a primitive need unfurling inside her and overshadowing that thick cloak of fantasy.</p><p>Reality was better.</p><p>Stil . She had to resist. For every reason she\u2019d already noted and the thousand others she hadn\u2019t yet considered.</p><p>Took every ounce of strength she possessed, but she stopped herself from lifting her arms, curling them back and digging her fingers into his scalp. Stopped herself from angling her face up to his for a kiss.</p><p>Bottom line, despite everything else, he didn\u2019t desire her. He couldn\u2019t. Not when she was practical y bare, covered only by thin strips of white cotton, and he\u2019d had his hand al over her, yet had never tried to arouse her.</p><p>Suddenly that wasn\u2019t the comfort it had previously been.</p><p>Had he figured out exactly who she was? Was that why he no longer wanted her?</p><p>No, he couldn\u2019t know. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be taking such good care of her. Most likely he\u2019d just decided kissing a Hunter, any Hunter, was wrong.</p><p>\u201cAmun, I have to\u2014\u201d she began, stopping when he stiffened.</p><p>What had she said?</p><p>You know my name?</p><p>Her nerve endings flared with trepidation. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>So you know who and what I real y am. A statement of fact, not a question. You know I\u2019m not your Micah.</p><p>No reason to deny the truth. \u201cYes.\u201d Another whisper.</p><p>And yet you of al people let me hold you like this?</p><p>Something about the absolute confusion in his tone alerted her. She replayed his words. \u201cYou of al people,\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>Oh, God. She\u2019d been wrong, she thought dizzily. He knew.</p><p>He\u2019d already known she was a Hunter, yes. She\u2019d told him.</p><p>Now, however, he knew the rest, the worst of the details. He knew about her part in Baden\u2019s death.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he kil ed her already?</p><p>The moisture in her mouth dried, and her knees began to tremble. \u201cDefeat\u2014Strider told you who I am.</p><p>What I\u2019ve done.\u201d She was proud to note that no emotion fil ed her voice, only arctic steel.</p><p>No. I discovered the truth on my own. You were Hadiee then, but are now Haidee. Whoever you were, whatever you are, you were there when Baden was slain.</p><p>Confirmation. \u201cAnd yet you of al people hold me like this?\u201d</p><p>As she snapped the question, understanding dawned. This was the calm before the storm. He\u2019d merely shown her the pleasure she could have had but now would be forever denied.</p><p>A bitter laugh escaped her. In a lifetime of regret and pain, he had no idea that denying her would simply be more of the same. That he wouldn\u2019t break her. Wouldn\u2019t ruin her. No matter what he did, she\u2019d already experienced worse.</p><p>Amun spun her around before severing al contact. Their gazes locked, black fire glittering down at her.</p><p>She gasped as another realization struck. He hadn\u2019t been unaffected by touching her. Far from it. Lines of tension branched from his eyes and mouth. His lips were pul ed taut over the straight white pearls of his teeth. His breath emerged shal ow and fast, his nostrils flaring.</p><p>Wait. Did he want her? Or was he simply pissed?</p><p>The swel ing had gone down in his face, revealing a rough beauty that shocked her further. His skin was like the richest coffee mixed with the slightest dol op of cream.</p><p>Those gorgeous black eyes were framed by a thick fan of silky lashes, lashes longer even than hers. He had an aquiline nose, regal and proud. His cheekbones were so sharp they could have cut glass. Lips that would have been considered cruel if not for their soft pink color glistening with moisture.</p><p>His chest was bare, scabbed in striking patterns of four.</p><p>Claw marks, she thought with a shiver. His own? Hers? His nipples were smal and brown, beaded.</p><p>Rope after rope of muscle descended the torso of a man who had honed his strength on the battlefield rather than inside a gym.</p><p>He wore sweatpants that hung low on his waist, revealing the barest hint of dark, springy curls on his groin. And when she saw that the rounded head of his penis stretched past the material, semen pearling from the slit, she swal owed, her gaze jerking back up to his face.</p><p>He was the gentle one, Strider had said. Yet she\u2019d never seen a man look quite so fierce.</p><p>How did you get me mixed up with him?</p><p>\u201cYou guys look a lot alike. Weirdly alike.\u201d</p><p>Was he immortal? Pause. You know I\u2019m immortal, right?</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, and no, he\u2019s not. Believe me, I would have known. He was injured time and time again, but he healed as slowly as any human.\u201d</p><p>So our likeness is a mere quirk of fate? Doubtful. I was created by Zeus, ful y formed, and I\u2019ve often wondered if the former king had simply looked down from his perch in the heavens, picked out a face he liked and boom. But that creation happened thousands of years ago, so my face had to come first.</p><p>\u201cAnd so you think someone else created Micah? Someone who saw you?\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>\u201cThen how is he human?\u201d</p><p>There are gods, humans, demigods, and then creatures in between. He could be any number of things.</p><p>\u201cWel , maybe Zeus saw past, present and future faces, and picked from those. Or hey, maybe Micah\u2019s your son, and you just don\u2019t know it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve picked up a few humans in your time.\u201d</p><p>Not possible.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Accidents happen, even with immortals.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t been with anyone in a long time. Like, a century.</p><p>And if he looks to be my age...</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hide her relief. He hadn\u2019t been with anyone in over a hundred years. Same with her. \u201cOh.</p><p>Wel , maybe he\u2019s a descendant of yours. Maybe it\u2019s just one of those strange, unexplainable things. Or hel , maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>Okay. Maybe you\u2019re right, he al owed. Doesn\u2019t matter, anyway. We\u2019re on opposing teams.</p><p>\u201cVery true.\u201d</p><p>So why did you change your name? he asked, switching gears.</p><p>\u201cThe simple change of spel ing helped me blend in as society changed around me,\u201d she said. \u201cPlus, there are more Haidees than Hadiees, and I didn\u2019t want to be spotlighted for any demons that happened to be looking for me.\u201d</p><p>If you wanted to blend in, you shouldn\u2019t have done so much to stand out. His gaze raked her hair, her tattoos.</p><p>She stiffened at his obvious censure. What did she care if he found her appearance lacking? Except for the ache in her chest, she didn\u2019t care at al , she told herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How are we connected? he demanded, switching the subject again. Bye-bye distraction. He\u2019d asked an excel ent question. How were they connected in mind and body?</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d Her cheeks flamed when she heard the stutter. She had fought and won too many battles to count.</p><p>This man would not intimidate her.</p> <p>Why can\u2019t I harm you?</p><p>Had he tried? The thought unsettled her. \u201cMaybe for the same reason I can\u2019t harm you.\u201d</p><p>And that is?</p><p>You\u2019re the sweetest form of temptation. I know the spicy decadence of your kiss. I\u2019ve ridden your fingers and want to ride them again. Not that she\u2019d make such an admission aloud. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve had the opportunity, though,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cSeveral times.\u201d</p><p>A sigh slipped from him, easing some of his tension. But you soothed me instead. Protected me.</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cAs you did for me.\u201d</p><p>For a long while, only the pattering of the water against the porcelain could be heard. Part of her was glad they knew about each other. That she didn\u2019t have to wonder what would happen when he discovered her secrets. The other part of her had never been more frightened.</p><p>They knew, but if they pursued each other anyway...there could be no excuses for their actions. For their stupidity.</p><p>Their friends would blame them, perhaps begin to hate them. And for what? No matter what they did, there could never be a happily ever after for them.</p><p>She must have retreated into her mind\u2014a shocking discovery, that, since she never al owed herself to drop her guard\u2014because she never saw him move, but suddenly his hands were clamped onto the flare of her hips. Another gasp escaped her as their gazes tangled anew.</p><p>Amun backed her up, pushing her under the waterfal , then walked through the spray himself, not stopping until she was smashed against the tiled wal . And even though they weren\u2019t touching anywhere but her waist, the heat of him wrapped around her, sinking past skin into bone. Her nipples hardened, aching for contact.</p> <p>He looked capable of anything just then. Most especial y of driving her to the brink of passion, of madness.</p><p>Stop this before it\u2019s too late, she commanded herself. A single brush of his lower body against hers, and</p><p>\u201ctoo late\u201d</p><p>would happen. She knew it. After their last kiss...</p><p>She flattened her palms on his chest, felt the erratic rhythm of his heartbeat. A harried rhythm that matched her own. \u201cI can\u2019t be with you this way. Until I\u2019ve spoken to Micah.\u201d Oh, God. Had she real y said that? Had she real y just pushed the qualification out of her mouth, trying to pave the way for them to be together? Even for a little while?</p><p>Seriously. What the hel was wrong with her?</p><p>Amun\u2019s eyelids narrowed, hiding his irises. That should have lessened the dangerous magnetism of him.</p><p>It didn\u2019t.</p> <p>She doubted anything could.</p><p>Why? The single word was snapped, demanding an immediate response.</p><p>\u201cI have to tel him it\u2019s over between us.\u201d That was the only honorable thing to do. For al her faults, she truly wasn\u2019t a cheater. But God, even talking about this, she was undermining everything she\u2019d already decided, not to mention her resolve to leave Amun alone.</p><p>You would end your relationship with him in favor of me? A demon-possessed warrior you\u2019ve sworn to murder? He laughed without humor. I\u2019m not as foolish as you apparently think I am.</p><p>She was the foolish one. They would never be able to trust each other, and with good reason. That stil didn\u2019t stop her from saying, \u201cYes.\u201d See? Foolish. She wanted to be with him. Despite everything, even her reasons for pushing him away, part of her needed him and that part clearly would not be denied.</p><p>His false laughter died quickly. Your relationship didn\u2019t stop you from kissing me before. Now his voice was a growl of frustration.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know who you were then.\u201d</p><p>He pondered that for a moment, then nodded. Fine. I\u2019l give you that. But how do I know this isn\u2019t a trick?</p><p>Nope, no trust. Not that she blamed him. \u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And how do you plan to speak with this Micah?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l cal him.\u201d How else?</p><p>Water droplets rained down Amun\u2019s hard expression. And during the conversation, I\u2019m positive you won\u2019t speak in code and inform him of your location. I\u2019m equal y positive he won\u2019t try to swoop in and save you. Of course, that means I\u2019m positive he won\u2019t then try to capture everyone inside this fortress.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head to emphasize her denial. \u201cI would break it off with him. No more, no less.\u201d</p><p>Intense need flickered over his expression. Need blended with possessiveness and primal instinct, with hope and helpless indecision.</p><p>No one had ever looked at her like that. As if she were a treasure, wanted in the most primitive of ways\u2014as if she were a bundle of dynamite that could detonate at any moment.</p><p>So badly she wanted to glide her hands to his back, lock her fingers together and jerk him into the soft line of her body. Then she\u2019d feel his hands settle on her bottom and heft her up, forcing her to wrap her legs around him. She\u2019d grind against the long, thick length of his erection until they were both screaming from the pleasure. Already she was close to begging for it.</p><p>Amun\u2019s hands fel away from her, dropping heavily to his sides, and he straightened. The water cascaded over him without mercy, shielding his features from her view.</p><p>Never going to happen, Haidee, he said flatly. A simple fuck isn\u2019t worth the consequences. With that, he left her alone in the shower.</p><p>His crudeness and cruelty shouldn\u2019t have surprised her, but they did. They hurt her, too. She\u2019d been wil ing to try to make something work between them; he hadn\u2019t. He never had. His eyes had been cold, distant as he\u2019d reduced her to \u201ca simple fuck.\u201d She\u2019d never been more to him, would never be more.</p><p>There were too many obstacles between them.</p><p>She wanted to hate him. God, did she want to hate him.</p><p>Instead, Haidee did something she hadn\u2019t done in hundreds of years. She sobbed like a baby over the cruel fate she\u2019d once again been dealt.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>AMUN STRIPPED OUT OF HIS WET sweatpants, toweled off, dressed in a T-shirt and jeans, then waited for Haidee to emerge from the bathroom. He didn\u2019t have to wait long, yet the time apart seemed infinite. When she entered the bedroom, he saw that her features were annoyingly blank, though her eyes were pink and a bit puffy. Had she...cried?</p><p>His chest constricted painful y at the thought, and he nearly stalked to her, nearly took her into his arms.</p><p>To soothe her.</p><p>His hands curled into fists. She couldn\u2019t have cried. To do so, she would have had to care about him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t care about him. Therefore, he couldn\u2019t al ow himself to believe a single tear had fal en from her beautiful eyes.</p><p>So why did his chest stil ache?</p><p>He forced his thoughts to clear and his gaze to move away from her face. A fluffy white towel was wrapped under her arms and hit just above her knees. Obviously she had removed her bra. He saw no tel tale straps. She\u2019d probably removed her panties, too. They\u2019d been so wet. So wonderful y wet.</p><p>The constriction in his chest migrated south. He knew what she looked like under al that cotton. Breasts that would fit in his hands. A soft though concave stomach. Hips that flared perfectly. He\u2019d desperately wanted to grip her there and force her to rub against his erection, over and over again.</p><p>Even now, she tempted him. Even? Hel , especial y now.</p><p>Clothes are on the bed, he told her, turning away before he forgot the reasons he\u2019d left her alone in the shower. Even in his mind, his voice was rough. And yeah, it stil shocked him every time he \u201cspoke\u201d to her without having to sign the words.</p><p>The connection between them was the very reason he\u2019d opted to tel her the truth about himself, about what he knew concerning her past. He\u2019d decided to show most of his cards before she glimpsed them on her own, hoping she\u2019d then reveal her own cards.</p><p>He hated that his demon had gone silent the moment he\u2019d touched her and hadn\u2019t spoken up again.</p><p>Secrets was always either quiet or agitated around her, and he never knew which he\u2019d get. What bothered him most was that the demon probably could have discovered everything about her. Except, though Amun could cast his voice into her head, he couldn\u2019t read her the same way he read everyone else. He would\u2019ve liked to chastise Secrets for that, but didn\u2019t. He chastised himself. What was the use of having a demon if a man couldn\u2019t use the damn thing\u2019s abilities?</p><p>Wasn\u2019t like he could use the other demons, either. They\u2019d experienced the opposite reaction when he touched her, shrieking and scrambling for a new hiding place.</p><p>Behind him echoed a light patter of footsteps, then the rustle of clothing. He wanted to watch Haidee dress. He was desperate to see those curves again. Al of her curves this time. Through the white cotton of her bra, every bit of fabric drenched, he\u2019d seen those firm breasts crested with rosy nipples perfect for sucking. And those matching panties...</p><p>His spine went rigid as another hot blistering wave of need savaged him. Between her gorgeous legs, at the apex of her thighs, she\u2019d had a little tuft of hair slightly darker than the flaxen mass above. He\u2019d almost dropped to his knees, almost dove in and feasted, shoving those unwanted panties out of the way and tasting the essence of her femininity. Gods, he remembered the sweetness of her.</p><p>Knew the heaven that awaited him.</p><p>He needed to think about something else before he cut the tether of his control and fel on her and took her. He couldn\u2019t take her. As he\u2019d promised her, he would not al ow himself to touch her again.</p><p>He blanked his mind. There was one thing guaranteed to piss him off and keep his hands to himself. Her tattoos. Just the thought had him biting his tongue until he tasted blood.</p><p>In the shower, he\u2019d gotten a peek at the travesty that was her back, and each marking had turned portions of his desire into boiling rage. If any part of him had ever doubted who she was, the tattoos there convinced him otherwise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She kept score, Baden\u2019s death proudly etched into her flesh. And the four Hunters the Lords had supposedly kil ed? He didn\u2019t know, but he would. How he would acquire the information when her secrets were her own, he didn\u2019t know, either. But again, he would.</p><p>Perhaps he\u2019d seduce the information out of her.</p><p>Seduce. Instantly, his mind and body returned to lusting after her. Seducing would involved touching.</p> <p>Perhaps his \u201cno touching\u201d vow had been premature.</p><p>Real y, why handicap himself? He should have her. Often.</p><p>As many times as the urge struck him. Until he obtained the answers he craved. Until he worked her from his system.</p><p>Until he realized that she hadn\u2019t cal ed him baby while he\u2019d held and cleaned her because the endearment was clearly reserved for her precious Micah.</p><p>Red suddenly dotted Amun\u2019s vision, just as it had done in the shower when she\u2019d spoken the bastard\u2019s name, and he drew in a deep breath. Hold...hold. Slowly he pushed the oxygen through his nostrils.</p> <p>Micah could very wel be a descendant of his, as Haidee had said. The idea intrigued him. He\u2019d never thought to have a blood-related family. However, the idea of that blood-related family being his enemy, wel , that he didn\u2019t like. Wasn\u2019t like he and Micah could sit down and have a heart-to-heart, either.</p><p>Besides the good versus evil thing, there was Haidee.</p><p>They both wanted her.</p><p>Amun should have taken her in the shower, despite her fragile protests, and pounded the worst of his emotions straight into her. And those protests of hers had been fragile. So fragile he could have bent his head and blown on the hammering pulse at the base of her neck and her reasons for denying him would have snapped beyond repair.</p><p>There were no doubts in his mind that she\u2019d hungered for him, too. Her pupils had been blown, her lips parted as she\u2019d struggled for air. She probably hadn\u2019t realized that her nails had sunk into his pecs the moment she\u2019d flattened her trembling palms on him, fingers curling, some part of her desperate to be connected to him, eradicating al hint of distance.</p><p>The action, smal though it was, had been a claiming, and he\u2019d reacted violently. Not that he\u2019d shown her. That boiling rage had been his only link to sanity.</p> <p>Over the years he had pampered the few women he\u2019d been with, and given them what time he could, as wel as attention and fidelity. Even when they hadn\u2019t given him the same\u2014and had then tried to hide their actions from him.</p><p>As if they could. But he liked seeing a female light up because of his special treatment. He liked knowing he was the cause of their happiness.</p><p>He knew his friends considered him calm, without a temper. Normal y he was. But when he looked at this woman, this supposed enemy, this unexpected savior, something hard and primal seethed inside him, knocking at the door of his restraint. He felt like a godsdamn caveman, wanting to carry off his woman and hide her from the rest of the world. Wanting to put his body between hers and anyone who dared threaten her. Wanting to tie her to his bed, keep her there forever, keep her ready for him.</p><p>Wanting to soothe her even as he ravaged her.</p><p>The desires were dark and sultry, insidious as they snuck past his defenses and wrapped around his every cel , changing the very fabric of his being. He was Amun no longer, but Haidee\u2019s man.</p><p>That title was not something he could tolerate. Not for long, at least.</p><p>Stil . He was on the right path, he decided. If he had her, he would tire of her. How could he not, when she was who she was? And when he tired of her, when the newness of her touch and taste and scent wore off and he no longer needed her to beat the demons back to maintain his good sense, he could do his duty and slay her. But until then...</p><p>He would just have to continue protecting her.</p> <p>The rustle of clothes died, and he pivoted on his heel, facing her. A smart man would never have given an enemy his back in the first place. But then, a smart Lord would never have al owed a Hunter to live long enough to dress.</p><p>Haidee stood by the side of the bed, arms hanging at her sides, her hands empty. His gaze raked her, and he told himself the perusal was necessary, that he needed to check for hidden weapons. The pink T-shirt and jeans she had donned belonged to Gwen, another petite female, but stil they bagged on little Haidee. Despite her feminine curves, she was too thin.</p><p>Irritation joined his other emotions. Over the past however long Strider had been in charge of her care, the warrior had most likely given her enough food to survive. No more, no less. She\u2019d probably lost pounds she hadn\u2019t been able to spare. That would change now that Amun was in charge.</p><p>Causing needless suffering wasn\u2019t his style.</p><p>She had toweled off her hair as best she could, but stil the blond-and-pink locks dripped onto her shirt, wetting the material covering the delicate frame of her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d she asked in her raspy voice.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t shifted under his scrutiny, he realized. She had stood stil , al owing him to look his fil .</p><p>Perhaps she\u2019d studied him, too, because tiny flickers of the mating heat had returned to those distracting eyes.</p><p>He liked that she liked the look of him. Usual y, with Paris and Strider and, hel , Sabin around him, women found the roughness of his features too...wel , rough.</p><p>Sit down, he told her. Now we talk.</p><p>\u201cMore talking?\u201d She didn\u2019t sound enthused.</p><p>Yes, more talking. He would not al ow her to irritate him into forgetting what needed to be said, he vowed. Sit.</p><p>With only the barest hint of hesitation, she obeyed. She perched at the edge of the bed, folding her hands in her lap.</p><p>Thank you. Now, it was time to show her the rest of his cards. Her reaction would dictate their next course of action. Amun spread his legs, braced his knees and prepared to defend himself from attack.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to talk about?\u201d</p><p>Me. You guessed my identity, but I doubt you know exactly what that means. So here it is, flat out. I\u2019m possessed by the demon of Secrets. He waited for a reaction; he didn\u2019t get one. In the shower, he\u2019d merely played with the details, never actual y admitting he was possessed.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>No, he would not al ow her to irritate him. And you know about immortals, but do you know anything about the heavens and hel ?</p><p>\u201cI know they exist.\u201d</p><p>That was a start. Recently I ventured into hel to rescue a friend.</p><p>She gulped. \u201cYou rescued another demon?\u201d</p><p>In a way. Legion had been demon, but had bargained with Lucifer for a human body. A human body she stil possessed. She wasn\u2019t\u2014isn\u2019t\u2014evil. Wel , not total y\u2014and she was being tortured.</p><p>\u201cShe?\u201d</p><p>Did he detect a note of jealousy or was that wishful thinking on his part? Yes. During the few days I spent down there, I was...overcome by demon thoughts and urges.</p><p>When he offered no more, she nodded.</p><p>Those thoughts and urges are a part of me now, driving me...</p><p>\u201cInsane?\u201d</p><p>Now he was the one to nod, though his was stiff. Only when I\u2019m with you do those things become manageable.</p><p>Wariness fel over her lovely features like a curtain, but she didn\u2019t attack. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>I have no idea.</p><p>\u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>He released a sigh. Perhaps for the same reason I can project my voice into your head.</p><p>\u201cThat tel s me nothing,\u201d she said, pursing her lips.</p><p>How adorable she was, just then. A pouty princess. The thought made him frown. Whether we like it or not, there is something between us. Maybe, because of that, the demons know what I know, and they\u2019re afraid of you. Afraid of Hunters.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. So...you hate these thoughts and urges?\u201d Her question was soft, almost hopeful.</p><p>Why hopeful? Because she wanted to believe the best of him? Yes. Beyond anything.</p><p>She peered down at her lap, where her fingers were linked and now twisting together. He hadn\u2019t expected such calm.</p><p>Not from her, a demon-hater, when he\u2019d just admitted to being poisoned by al kinds of evil.</p><p>Was she playing him? Lul ing him into a false sense of relaxation? If so, what was her ultimate goal?</p><p>He should know; his demon should know. More than ever he hated that he couldn\u2019t read her. Hated that the two times he\u2019d peeked inside her mind, he\u2019d seen her smiling. Heard her laughing.</p><p>Hated, because the images were branded inside him, a part of him, haunting him. Hated that even so, he craved another glimpse.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you tel me this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Because of my affliction and your affiliation, we can\u2019t stay here. I\u2019m a danger to my friends, he told her, expecting her to argue. If she remained in one location, her associates had a better chance of finding her.</p><p>And you, wel , you\u2019re a danger to them, too. As much a danger as they are to you.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want either group to find her. Plus, his twenty-four hours were almost up, and every noise outside the door had him stiffening. Sabin was liable to burst into the room with a flamethrower at any moment.</p><p>\u201cYes, we need to leave,\u201d she replied, thick lashes final y lifting. \u201cSo where do you propose we go?\u201d</p><p>Such pragmatism was admirable. Combine that with the we and the heat of her gaze, and she presented a powerful aphrodisiac. You wish to stay with me?</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>There was no \u201cof course\u201d about it. Why did she want to stay with him? His suspicious soul floundered for an answer, and found only one: she was playing him. Perhaps she even meant to lead him to her fel ow Hunters, just as she\u2019d done to Baden.</p><p>Amun\u2019s hands curled into fists. Fists so tight and hard his already damaged knuckles cracked from the strain.</p><p>\u201cAmun?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>His name on her lips...another aphrodisiac. We wil go to the only place I can purge the thoughts and urges.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou can purge them?\u201d Once again she sounded hopeful, as if she truly cared.</p><p>Though the prospect rocked him to the core, he revealed only mild surprise. While you slept, I spoke with someone in the know. And the conversation had pissed him off royal y.</p><p>\u201cYou must return to hel ,\u201d the angel Zacharel had said, unconcerned, when Amun sought him out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What? Amun had mental y shouted. When he remembered to sign, his motions had been jerky. My little jaunt into hel is the reason I\u2019m like this. So returning isn\u2019t real y a solution, is it?</p><p>\u201cYou took the demons out, now you wil take them back in.\u201d</p><p>No.</p> <p>A shrug. \u201cThen you wil forever be chained to the woman\u2019s side. Not that forever wil be long. Not for you. Without her, the spirits overcome you, and the next time you are overcome, you wil die by my hand.\u201d</p><p>If getting rid of the demons is as easy as going to hel , why didn\u2019t you take me back already?</p><p>\u201cI did not say it would be easy. Nor did I say returning with me would be helpful. You must take the girl.\u201d</p><p>No, he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYour choice, of course. I have no qualms about removing your head.\u201d</p> <p>It was impossible to argue with so logical and uncaring a being. How do I get them out of my body once I \u201ctake them back in?\u201d</p><p>Zacharel had walked away without answering, without offering even the slightest hint. Why? What was Amun supposed to do when he got there? How long was he supposed to stay? Exactly where in the endless pit did he need to go?</p><p>He told me the only way to free myself was to return to hel , Amun said to Haidee now.</p><p>\u201cReturn to...hel ? As in the fiery pit of the damned?\u201d The last was uttered in a horrified whisper.</p><p>Yes. And you\u2019re going with me. He waited for her to protest, to fight him. She didn\u2019t, not yet, and he relaxed. Somewhat.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t subdue her, defend her and search for a way to liberate himself. You won\u2019t burn, he assured her. I won\u2019t al ow the flames to reach you.</p> <p>\u201cIf we go,\u201d she said with a tremor, \u201cwil there be anyone with us?\u201d</p><p>If, she\u2019d said, and he relaxed a bit more. No. We\u2019l go alone. He desperately needed the muscle and support\u2014</p><p>because gods knew, he\u2019d barely survived last time, and he\u2019d had two trained warriors with him\u2014but he wouldn\u2019t place his friends in danger. Not from the demons, and not from Haidee. Besides, that would defeat the purpose of whisking Haidee out of their midst. Why? Do you wish to take someone with us?</p><p>Her lips pressed together in that mutinous line, and he suspected he\u2019d somehow hurt her feelings. No, surely not.</p><p>She would have to care about him, he reminded himself, and she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWil you\u2014wil you al ow me to have a weapon?\u201d The word al ow choked from her, and he doubted she\u2019d ever spoken it before.</p><p>Yes, but if you attempt to use it on me, I wil strike back in kind. Perhaps a lie, perhaps not. He valiantly hoped she didn\u2019t try to test the claim.</p><p>Silence stretched between them, an oppressive cloud he couldn\u2019t shoo away. He gave her the time she needed, though. He was asking a lot from her and offering very little in exchange. Of course, he would have to force her if she refused him\u2014they truly had no other options\u2014but until she did, he would let her think the decision was hers.</p> <p>\u201cAl right,\u201d she final y said on a sigh. \u201cI\u2019l do it. I\u2019l go with you.\u201d</p><p>No fight at al .</p><p>Once again he was thrown, but this time he couldn\u2019t hide the intensity of his shock or the earth-shattering cascade of relief. Then his suspicions flared. What did she hope to gain, placing herself in danger to help him regain his senses? Or did she plan to go simply to gather intel? Yes, he thought with a nod. That was far more likely. She was a Hunter, after al , and finding ways to destroy demons was her business.</p><p>Hunter. The blasphemy echoed through his mind, and he cringed. Stop reminding me.</p><p>\u201cStop reminding you of what?\u201d she sputtered, obviously confused by his sudden bout of disgust.</p><p>Nothing, he muttered. He nearly apologized but bit the words back. He would not apologize to this woman. Ever.</p><p>He had some pride, at least. We\u2019l waste no more time.</p><p>Amun strode to the door and knocked. Behind him, he heard Haidee gasp, her clothes rustling again as if she had pushed to her feet. A few seconds later, the lock clicked from the other side, and the wood squeaked open, revealing the angel Zacharel. Black hair in perfect order, emerald eyes devoid of al emotion. White-and-gold wings arched over his shoulders and swooped down his robed sides.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the warrior said. The greeting should have been inflected with a question, but surfaced as a mere statement.</p><p>We are taking you up on your offer of transport, Amun signed.</p><p>Zacharel offered no hint of his thoughts. \u201cI\u2019l gather the necessary supplies. Be ready to leave in five minutes.\u201d With that, the door shut, locked.</p><p>Amun rested his forehead on the cool wood, reminded for a moment of Haidee\u2019s skin. Hel . He was returning to hel when he\u2019d sworn never to go back. In a deep, dark corner of his mind, he thought he heard Secrets whimper.</p><p>Thousands of years ago, Secrets had fought to escape hel</p><p>\u2014and won. And yet, Amun kept taking him back. At least the other demons remained calm, neither crying nor cheering in regard to his plans. But then, they were more afraid of Haidee than anything else.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you speak?\u201d she asked, slicing through the tension he hadn\u2019t realized had sprouted anew.</p><p>My demon, he replied, offering no more. He straightened and turned to her. Mistake. She had stood, and as always, he was struck by the delicacy of her features, the passion that lurked under her glowing skin. More than that, his mouth watered for a go at those breasts, that stomach, those legs.</p><p>those legs.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have dressed her in the T-shirt and jeans. He should have dressed her in a shapeless sack.</p><p>\u201cBecause you carry the demon of Secrets, you can\u2019t speak?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Had he ever thought to find himself in this position?</p><p>Sharing his own inner mysteries with a Hunter?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why does your demon prevent you from speaking?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t curious about him, he knew, but was merely fishing for information to perhaps share with her people.</p><p>Stil . He answered. I open my mouth, and everything the demon has discovered, every dark deed of those around us, every bit of information that could ruin families and friendships, slips out.</p><p>\u201cSo you can speak?\u201d</p><p>What did that matter? Yes.</p><p>\u201cBut you choose not to?\u201d</p><p>Yes, damn it. Why do you want to know?</p><p>Amun\u2019s uncustomary outburst didn\u2019t faze her. \u201cIt\u2019s just...it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re doing. Very sweet.\u201d</p><p>So unexpected was the praise, he could only blink at her.</p><p>\u201cNo one else can hear your voice? Inside their head, I mean.\u201d</p><p>No. Just you. Bitterness had crept into his tone, and he could do nothing to mask it. Not that he wanted to. Let her hear. Let her know.</p><p>Twin pink circles stained her cheeks, and she cleared her throat. She eased back onto the mattress, prim once again.</p><p>\u201cSo how did you guys hook up with angels?\u201d</p><p>A change of subject. Wise of her, yes, but foolish of him to offer more truth. A friend of ours married their leader. More like Bianka had claimed Lysander as her property, but Amun wasn\u2019t sure Haidee would understand that kind of sentiment.</p><p>\u201cAn angel and a demon? Married?\u201d</p><p>Pretty much. As stone-cold as Lysander was, the term</p><p>\u201cangel\u201d seemed just about as appropriate as \u201cfairy godmother.\u201d The term \u201cdemon\u201d fit Bianka perfectly, though.</p><p>Her soul was darker than Amun\u2019s, but in the best possible way. The Harpies were so open, so honest about their mischievous nature, they were a delight to be around. At least for Amun. For a while, he\u2019d even considered pursuing Bianka\u2019s twin sister, Kaia. War had gotten in the way.</p><p>Speaking of angels, you should know that your precious Galen isn\u2019t one. He\u2014</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s agree right now not to talk about your friends or mine,\u201d Haidee interjected angrily. \u201cIt\u2019l only make us angry with each other. We should focus on the mission.\u201d</p><p>So she considered Galen a friend of hers? Of course she did, he thought next, and wanted to punch something. The leader of the Hunters wanted every Lord of the Underworld</p><p>\u2014excluding himself\u2014dead and buried. Because of Baden, Haidee had to be a prize among prizes for the keeper of Hope. Or was it possible Galen didn\u2019t know who she was?</p><p>Amun\u2019s teeth gnashed together\u2014he was doing that a lot lately\u2014grating the top layer into a fine powder, but he nodded. Very wel . There wil be no talk of our friends.</p><p>\u201cI just, I don\u2019t want us to fight,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd just so you know, Galen isn\u2019t a personal friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime is up,\u201d Zacharel\u2019s hard voice proclaimed before Amun could reply.</p><p>At the vocal intrusion, he whipped around, at the same time moving in front of Haidee to act as her shield. The door was stil closed. He frowned\u2014until the angel simply stepped through the wood, a backpack dangling from his hand.</p><p>He\u2019d possessed the ability al along, yet had only now opted to reveal it. Why?</p><p>\u201cI wil take you to the place your journey must begin,\u201d</p><p>Zacharel said. As with al angels, there was an undeniable layer of truth in his tone, and Amun couldn\u2019t doubt a single thing he uttered. \u201cBut know that Lucifer is angry that he was thwarted in his quest to destroy you and yours through Legion, and wil be out for eternal blood. Be wary, trust nothing and no one.\u201d</p><p>I never do.</p><p>\u201cExcept, perhaps, each other,\u201d the angel added.</p><p>Amun glanced over his shoulder, and he and Haidee shared a look.</p><p>Zacharel nodded in approval. \u201cI can promise you that your last journey through the underworld was nothing compared to what you wil soon face. In reparation for his role in Legion\u2019s freedom, Cronus has returned it to its former glory.\u201d</p><p>Why would he\u2014?</p><p>The angel held up his hand, halting Amun\u2019s tirade. \u201cIt was either that, or return Legion.\u201d</p><p>He made the right choice, then.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if you stil agree when you get there. Monsters you\u2019ve only heard whispered about, you wil soon encounter.\u201d</p><p>Haidee stood, her cool hands flattening on Amun\u2019s lower back. He had to bite his tongue to stop his moan of pleasure. Final y, contact. He felt as if he\u2019d been waiting forever to feel her, any part of her, again. That she now offered comfort...comforted him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gods, he real y was pathetic.</p><p>You won\u2019t al ow any of my friends to fol ow us? he signed.</p><p>\u201cCorrect. I wil ensure you and the girl remain undisturbed by them.\u201d</p> <p>Amun took no offense. If anyone could keep the brutes here from getting their way, it was this hard-as-steel creature.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>\u201cNow. Something else you should know.\u201d A breeze ruffled the golden down streaked through the angel\u2019s wings like a flowing, molten river. \u201cWith the changes, there are now six realms you must pass through before you even reach the gate\u2014and the gate is another obstacle altogether.\u201d</p><p>Haidee stepped to Amun\u2019s side, but didn\u2019t break contact.</p><p>\u201cHow wil we return here when we\u2019re done?\u201d</p> <p>Zacharel\u2019s green gaze briefly shifted to her. \u201cShould you save Amun, you wil have nothing to worry about. Should you not, you wil never leave.\u201d</p><p>The ominous warning rang through his mind. Then Amun shrugged. They would save him; it was that simple. We\u2019l find a way, he told Haidee.</p><p>Her hands trembled against him, but she said no more.</p><p>What about weapons? he signed. Food?</p><p>\u201cEverything you need is in here.\u201d The angel tossed the pack, and Amun caught the too-thin, too-light duffel with ease. \u201cGood luck to you, warrior.\u201d</p><p>The moment his fingers wrapped around the straps, his surroundings completely fel away. From light to murky dark, the smooth white wal s were replaced by jagged stone stained with crimson splatter. Bones littered the equal y rocky ground, and the temperature instantly flared hundreds of degrees\u2014or so it seemed.</p> <p>A cavern, he realized, deep in the earth. And there was no sign of Zacharel\u2014no dainty hands on his back. Fighting a rush of panic, Amun swung around. He relaxed, but only for a second. Haidee was a few feet away, hunched over and vomiting. Beside her rested a toothbrush, toothpaste and bottle of mouthwash.</p><p>Amun closed the distance between them before he realized what he was doing. With one hand, he smoothed her hair out of the way. With the other, he stroked her back, trying to comfort her as she\u2019d comforted him. Flashing from one location to another in a mere blink of time affected some but not others. She, apparently, fel into the \u201csome\u201d</p><p>category. The angel must have known she would.</p><p>As strong as she usual y was, the weakness probably appal ed her.</p><p>The sickness wil soon pass, he told her. Even as he soothed her, he thought perhaps she had infected him with a toxic mix of hunger, stupidity and unwanted tenderness\u2014</p><p>and he would never find a cure.</p><p>She spit, wiped her mouth with the back of her trembling hand. \u201cThank you. For not kicking me while I\u2019m down.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not a monster, Haidee. Yet.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cOtherwise, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>She, apparently, suffered from the same toxic mix.</p><p>That did not bode wel for their mission.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>\u201cBEFORE WE GET STARTED, let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got to work with,\u201d Haidee told Amun after she disinfected her mouth. Twice. She ducked her head as she walked away from him so that she wouldn\u2019t have to see his expression.</p><p>He\u2019d had his hands on her the entire time. Did he regret it?</p><p>She\u2019d vomited in front of him. Did he find that amusing?</p><p>She had responded to him, goose bumps breaking out over her skin. Did he feel smug?</p><p>He offered no reply, and she experienced a wave of hurt. A wave she ignored because it was stupid. He wasn\u2019t her boyfriend, wasn\u2019t a tame pet dog, and was merely using her, the enemy, to stay calm.</p><p>Stil . Would a \u201cthat\u2019s smart\u201d or \u201care you okay?\u201d have been amiss? After al , she had agreed to venture into hel with him. Was actively trying to reach the fiery pit for him.</p><p>And because of that, she was alone with him, she thought, suddenly dazed by the way things had worked out. She was completely, utterly alone with the demon-possessed immortal who set her body on fire. The demon-possessed immortal who would probably try to kil her after they found a way to free him from the evil that plagued him. The demon-possessed immortal she should despise, did despise, but couldn\u2019t convince herself to hurt, even in the smal est way.</p><p>The demon-possessed immortal she stil craved.</p><p>Frowning, she crouched in front of the backpack the angel had given them. Her hand shook with the force of her nervousness as she unzipped and parted the folds. What she saw, or rather, what she didn\u2019t see, had her sputtering.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s empty!\u201d</p><p>Pounding footsteps resounded, then Amun was crouched beside her, grabbing the pack and searching inside. She heard his growl whisper through her mind, low and rumbling.</p><p>He scrubbed a hand down his face, the rough action leaving his forehead red and scraped. The angel wanted us to fail, then. He...lied. I can\u2019t believe he lied.</p><p>\u201cWel ,\u201d she replied, chin lifting, jutting stubbornly. \u201cWe won\u2019t fail.\u201d They\u2019d survived too much already.</p><p>No. We won\u2019t.</p><p>Their gazes locked together in a suspended moment of agreement and awareness. At least, she thought awareness was the other surprise battering between them.</p><p>It was for her. She saw the strength in every line and curve of his face, the determination glittering in his eyes, the need parting those soft lips. Only he never reached out, never touched her. In the shower, he\u2019d promised her he wouldn\u2019t, and he was obviously\u2014tragical y\u2014a man of his word.</p><p>Silent now, Amun pushed to his feet and turned away from her, shattering the tranquility of the moment.</p><p>Haidee straightened, and her trembling increased. He\u2019d known who she was before their shower, yet stil he\u2019d treated her with care. He\u2019d held her, caressed her, he\u2019d even gotten hard simply being near her.</p><p>He\u2019d peered at her lips with utter longing, as if he couldn\u2019t exist another moment without lapping at her tongue.</p><p>What had changed since then?</p><p>The fact that she\u2019d mentioned breaking up with Micah?</p><p>Wel , a man who truly desired her would have been overjoyed by her suggestion. Yet Amun had stomped away from her and hadn\u2019t lowered his guard since.</p><p>Men! She would never understand them.</p><p>Come, he said, starting forward without looking back. I want to leave this area. We\u2019ve been here too long for my peace of mind.</p><p>They were in hel , or near enough. She doubted she\u2019d know peace ever again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right behind you.\u201d As she fol owed him through the yawning opening of the cavern, she anchored the backpack\u2019s straps on her shoulders. No reason to toss it, and a thousand reasons to keep it. They could store rocks inside, even bones, and use each as weapons. If they lucked out and found berries or nuts, they could store the food for later. Stil . That damn angel! He must be a demon in disguise, tricking them the way he had. And if she ever encountered the bastard again, she would probably knife him.</p><p>In fact, for what seemed an eternity, she distracted herself by considering al the ways she would torture him. A knee to the groin, an elbow to the cheek. A hard kick to the skul .</p><p>When that began to bore her, she switched her mental target to Amun. But soon that, too, lost appeal as she and Amun trekked through the underground tunnel, the scenery unchanging. Only the growing soreness in her muscles and the constant ache in her booted feet indicated the passage of time. The leather of those boots was wel -worn but not fitted to her arches, and blisters quickly formed on her tendons.</p><p>She endured without complaint for a little while longer, but real y, she hated the suffocating silence between them, every second laced with tension. If they were going to work together, which they needed to do if they hoped to succeed in freeing Amun, she had to break through whatever was angering him.</p><p>So she asked the first question that popped into her head.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a girlfriend?\u201d The moment the words were spoken, fury raced through her. The thought of this man belonging to someone else...kissing someone else...his intense arousal focused on someone else...</p><p>No, he said, and she relaxed.</p><p>Haidee nearly reached out and petted him as a reward.</p><p>She kept her arms at her sides, though, as they rounded a narrow corner, the wal s thinning yet again, practical y scraping at her. He might rebuke her, and she\u2019d rather endure the silence than that.</p><p>Did you ever kiss Strider? The question lashed from him, surprising her, and if his tone had been tangible, she suspected she would have been cut to the bone. Or...do more?</p><p>\u201cNo! Never.\u201d She might have abandoned her vengeance quest with Amun, but the same courtesy did not extend to his friends. Them, she stil wanted to kil . Amun, she just wanted to kiss again. Soon.</p><p>Maybe. Definitely. Except\u2014</p><p>Damn it! She\u2019d left the toothbrush and toothpaste back in the cave. Next time she and Amun did a little hooking up, she wanted to taste\u2014argh. If he had his way, they were never going to hook up again. She glared at his back, considered raking him with her nails. To him, she wasn\u2019t worth the risk. Any risk.</p><p>Part of her admired that. His friends were important to him.</p><p>Momentary pleasure was not.</p><p>Some of the tension left him. Was that what had been bothering him? she wondered. The thought of her with Strider? She stopped glaring at his back, and again considered petting him. If he didn\u2019t like the idea of her lip-locking his friend, she had to mean a little something to him. Right?</p><p>The other part of her real y admired that. He could overlook his (justified) prejudice in favor of desire for her and only her.</p><p>Al right, then, he said, pacified.</p><p>\u201cSo what gave you that stupid idea that I\u2019d made out with the keeper of Defeat?\u201d She\u2019d meant to ask gently and certainly hadn\u2019t meant to use the word stupid, but then she\u2019d remembered Amun\u2019s snotty attitude the past few hours and her irritation had taken over, speaking for her.</p><p>You spent some time with him. Alone. You were desperate to be free of him.</p><p>Irritation morphed into anger. \u201cI\u2019m a lot of things, Amun, but I would never use my body to get what I wanted. Even freedom.\u201d</p><p>There was a beat more of silence, then, You did with Baden. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh. Yeah. He was right, and there was nothing she could say to defend herself.</p><p>Back then, she\u2019d been so fil ed with hate and fury that she would have done anything, anything, to destroy one of the Lords. And she had. She had stripped in front of Baden, as if she\u2019d wanted to bed him in thanks for his escort home.</p><p>And as he\u2019d looked her over, distracted, she had signaled for the waiting Hunters.</p> <p>\u201cI learn from my mistakes,\u201d she said softly. Helping to kil the warrior hadn\u2019t been the mistake, but she did regret the way she\u2019d gone about it. She\u2019d lied to Strider about feeling nothing. She even regretted the pain her actions had caused the man in front of her, which was one of the reasons she had wil ingly placed herself in danger.</p><p>A confusing realization. That meant she more than wanted him; that meant she cared for him. Why did she care for him? She didn\u2019t know him, not real y. She was attracted to him, yes. She\u2019d already admitted that, over and over again.</p><p>She was somehow linked to him, yes. She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about his mouth on hers, then between her legs, yes, that too. Oops. That was part of her attraction to him.</p><p>Anyway. None of that required caring. Yet she had done everything in her power to stay with him. Be with him.</p><p>Spend time with him. Aid him.</p> <p>She sighed.</p><p>What?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t turned around to ask, and her gaze ate up the strong expanse of his back. Without her emotions in the way, she was able to truly see him. Such dark skin, so many layers of muscle. He had no scars now, and his only tattoo was the butterfly. Which she couldn\u2019t see at the moment; it must have returned to his leg. She marveled at the thought of a living tattoo, slipping and sliding from one corner of his body to the other, then shook her head and told herself to concentrate.</p><p>He was talking to her now. She didn\u2019t want to lose this opportunity.</p><p>\u201cI dreamed about you before I met you,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t know who\u2014\u201d or what, she mental y added \u201c\u2014</p> <p>you were. That\u2019s why I began dating Micah. I thought...\u201d</p><p>Amun\u2019s shoulder blades pressed together in a jerky motion as he straightened. You thought he was me?</p><p>\u201cYes. And before you start insulting my intel igence, remember that you guys look a lot alike.\u201d</p><p>So how do you now know you dreamed of me rather than him?</p><p>Because of the way Amun made her feel. Connected, aware. Alive. Burning from the inside out when she\u2019d only ever known cold. To confess the truth was to make herself vulnerable\u2014more than she already was. To confess was to give him power over her\u2014more than he already had.</p><p>\u201cI just do,\u201d was al she said. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t calmed you, would you have kil ed me when you found out who I was?\u201d She tried to maintain an impassive tone, but the tremble in the words gave her away.</p><p>There was a terrible pause that crystal ized the oxygen in her lungs. Then, Yes.</p><p>At least he was honest, but wow, that hurt. You would have kil ed him if you hadn\u2019t dreamed of him, she reminded herself. True. That failed to ease her hurt, though. He\u2019d kissed her, damn it. Intimately. A little loyalty would have been nice.</p> <p>Il ogical.</p><p>Distracted as she was, she tripped over a stone and stumbled forward. She had to anchor her hands on Amun\u2019s waist to steady herself. Instant, amazing heat. As always.</p><p>He didn\u2019t pause, but he did stiffen.</p><p>Stay alert, Haidee. He spat her name like it was a curse.</p><p>Maybe it was. \u201cI\u2019m trying. Amun. We\u2019ve been walking for a long time and don\u2019t seem to be getting anywhere. I\u2019m tired, hungry, and oh, yeah, I\u2019m also saving your ass. Propping me up when I fal without complaining is the least you can do to repay me.\u201d Even as she scolded him, she vowed to do a better job. She straightened, severing contact\u2014</p><p>mourning the loss, again as always\u2014and studied her newest surroundings.</p><p>They had maneuvered into a type of hal way, the blood-splattered wal s tal but not broad. The floor tilted, sending them deeper underground with every step. Dust layered the warm air, and in the distance she thought she heard a steady drip, drip.</p><p>You\u2019re right, he said. I\u2019m...sorry.</p><p>The apology was gritted, like the words tasted foul. Didn\u2019t matter. She\u2019d take it. Anything was better than nothing. Just ask her stomach.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where you\u2019re going?\u201d she asked, her voice echoing around them.</p><p>No. A clipped tone, and, if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, a roundabout command for silence. Then he surprised her by adding, Al I know is that hel is down, so that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re heading.</p><p>A chimp could have told her that, but she kept her mouth closed as they stepped through another opening. Another cavern. The wal s stretched, al owing easier, freer motions.</p><p>Final y, they were getting somewhere. And shockingly, there was thick, dewy foliage sprouting from the rocks.</p><p>Nice, she thought, until something hissed at her. She yelped, twisting to discover the source.</p><p>A pair of narrowed red eyes glowed from the round head of a snake, forked tongue dancing over sharp, dripping fangs.</p><p>She opened her mouth to scream, but a tide of dizziness slammed through her and only a moan escaped.</p><p>Somehow she remained on her feet. \u201cN-nice snakey snake,\u201d she whispered, palms rising to proclaim her innocence.</p><p>The creature launched at her neck. Not nice. Her reflexes were too slow to save her.</p><p>Amun\u2019s thick, corded arm whipped out, fingers wrapping just below that open, waiting mouth, wrist twisting, snapping head from scaled body. When he opened his fist, the reptile floated lifelessly to the ground.</p><p>\u201cTh-thank you,\u201d she rasped. The dizziness hadn\u2019t left her, and now her heart felt distorted in her chest, a smashed organ hammering against her spine rather than her ribs.</p><p>Welcome. Now I\u2019ve saved your ass. His gaze never shifted to her, nor did he massage her neck in comfort, as she suddenly craved.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not even close to even, big boy.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say we were. Let\u2019s keep moving. I don\u2019t like this area.</p><p>They started forward again, and this time, Haidee kept one hand wrapped around the waist of his pants, afraid to let go. He didn\u2019t chastise her, and she was grateful. She hated snakes. Hated, hated, hated.</p><p>Maybe because a Hydrophis Belcheri had kil ed her once, its poison spurting acid straight into her veins, making her writhe and beg for mercy she had never found. Not even in death.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like this area, either.\u201d</p><p>Then you\u2019re real y not going to like what my demon just told me.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. What?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve just entered the Realm of Snakes, Amun said grimly.</p><p>Sweet heaven above. \u201cPlease tel me the Realm of Snakes refers to the sweet little garden variety, and that we\u2019l only encounter one or two of them.\u201d</p><p>The Realm of Snakes refers to the sweet little garden variety, and we\u2019l only encounter one or two of them.</p><p>Though she knew he was lying, his dry baritone caused her lips to twitch and some of her fear to fade.</p><p>\u201cGood, that\u2019s good. So what else did Secrets tel you?\u201d Fingers crossed she didn\u2019t have a panic attack after his next words.</p><p>That we shouldn\u2019t look directly into their eyes because they can hypnotize us into believing we actual y want them to bite us.</p><p>The fear returned ful -force, but at least the dizziness now made sense. Hypnosis. Shit. Control was one of her most prized possessions. Too wel did she know the horror of being without a choice. For days, weeks, whatever, she\u2019d been Strider\u2019s prisoner, al owed to do only what he wanted her to do. Before that, every time she\u2019d died, losing pieces of her memories when she final y returned to life, she had known only consuming hate and a driving need to destroy.</p><p>And long before that, she\u2019d been a puppet of the evil one, then the Bad Man, then the Greeks who had enslaved her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can do this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Just pretend the snakes are demon-possessed warriors.</p><p>I\u2019m sure you\u2019l do fine.</p><p>Ouch. He\u2019d struck more sharply than the snake. Tears momentarily burned her eyes, but she blinked them back.</p><p>No weakness. Especial y when she deserved such a stinging remark. Once, she might have even been proud to hear it. Once, but not today.</p><p>\u201cAnd why don\u2019t you pretend they\u2019re innocent humans?\u201d she said softly. He, too, deserved to be cut down, and she couldn\u2019t let herself forget.</p><p>Another bout of silence thickened the air between them.</p><p>Until he sighed and admitted, I shouldn\u2019t have said that. I\u2019m sorry. Again.</p><p>The second apology, offered far more poignantly than the first, was so unexpected she was shocked\u2014and softened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too. And I understand why you did,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cI took something from you. Something you loved.\u201d</p><p>Yes. And we took something from you?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to elaborate, but she never did. She\u2019d already told him she wouldn\u2019t discuss the past with him, and she\u2019d meant it. There was nothing he could say to ease the hurt, and a mil ion things he could say to increase it.</p><p>I won\u2019t let anything happen to you while we\u2019re here, Haidee.</p><p>You have my word.</p><p>Again he shocked her. Sil y thing was, she believed him, and not just because he needed her. He may not like her, but he\u2019d taken responsibility for her welfare. No matter the circumstances, his responsibilities were clearly important to him.</p><p>Something else to like about him.</p><p>The deeper they walked, the more lush the vines became, until there was no gap between leaf and limb, tree and cave wal . There was only mile after mile of what seemed to be a tranquil forest.</p><p>How many snakes lurked nearby? Waiting? Hungry?</p><p>Oh, God. Bile, rising again...</p><p>Soon steam was wafting from the leafy greens, limiting their range of vision. She inhaled deeply, scented sulfur and something else, something sweet. The conflicting aromas left her gagging and swaying with another bout of dizziness.</p><p>Was she being hypnotized again and just didn\u2019t know it? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHelp,\u201d she managed to whisper, hating that she was already losing control of herself. Her knees were knocking, about to give out. \u201cAmun.\u201d</p><p>In the next instant, he had turned, his arm winding around her waist and holding her up. What\u2019s wrong?</p><p>Her lashes fluttered shut, suddenly too heavy for her to keep open. \u201cDon\u2019t know. Head...spinning...\u201d</p> <p>He was so stil against her, she couldn\u2019t even feel his heartbeat or the rise and fal of his chest. Couldn\u2019t feel his heat, that amazing heat.</p><p>There\u2019s ambrosia in the air, a substance very harmful to humans, but you aren\u2019t...</p><p>\u201cHuman. Yes. I am.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t understand. You died. Now you\u2019re alive. You can\u2019t be human.</p><p>The dizziness intensified, pul ing her under a dark, dark wave. No matter how hard she fought, she couldn\u2019t swim to the top. \u201cAmun...\u201d</p> <p>Haidee. Listen to my voice. Stay with me.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d she wanted to tel him. No sound emerged.</p><p>If you pass out, I\u2019l strip you and touch you again. Do you hear me? I\u2019l view it as an invitation to take you.</p><p>Before she could tel him the invitation wouldn\u2019t have an expiration date, that his \u201cconsequences\u201d were not a threat but a delightful prospect, the darkness swal owed her completely.</p><p>DAMN THIS. Amun hefted Haidee over his shoulder, barely registering her slight weight. He did, however, register the fact that her breasts were smashed into his back. Because of her unusual y cool body temperature, her nipples were already pebbled.</p><p>She\u2019d been behind him for what seemed an eternity, touching him fleetingly yet awakening every nerve ending he possessed. Despite the danger, he\u2019d almost stopped a dozen times, desperate to taste her again, to hear her moan his name. His, and no other.</p> <p>When she\u2019d confessed that she had only dated that bastard Micah because she\u2019d mistaken him for Amun, she\u2019d almost found herself pressed against the cave wal , her jeans and panties ripped away, his shaft pounding its way home.</p><p>Control had been maintained through a wish and a prayer only.</p><p>Confounding baggage. How was he supposed to cal ously use her and work her from his system when she treated him with such...sweetness? When she responded to his barbs with hurt rather than venom?</p><p>Secrets stil couldn\u2019t read her mind, but the demon had begun to sense the absolute conviction in her every word.</p><p>She believed everything she said. Of course, the demon also retreated every time Haidee touched him.</p><p>The coolness that so delighted Amun terrified his companion.</p><p>Al of his companions. Since leaving the fortress, the other demons had yet to try to influence him in any way. Why?</p><p>Damn this, he thought again, striding forward. Didn\u2019t matter why. He needed this woman.</p> <p>A little dizzy himself, he shouldered his way through the foliage. He\u2019d whisk Haidee to safety if it kil ed him. And it just might. If he was affected by the ambrosia in the air, how much damage would the substance do to her?</p><p>Through Maddox, Amun had learned that humans simply couldn\u2019t tolerate ambrosia, a drug meant only for immortals.</p><p>They were better off being injected with tainted heroin.</p><p>Haidee hadn\u2019t ingested the substance, had only breathed in the fumes, so Amun told himself she would be okay.</p><p>Was she human, though? She truly believed she was and could very wel be, despite the fact that she\u2019d risen from the dead. But surely she was more than she realized. That unnatural coolness, her mental connection to Amun, the way she corral ed his demons, each bespoke something beyond mortality.</p><p>Stil . To be safe, he wanted to get her out of this forest as quickly as possible. Al he had to do was find the entrance to the next realm. Which, if he wasn\u2019t mistaken, would be the Realm of Shadows. So far, al he could see were trees.</p><p>Trees, trees, trees. They surrounded him so completely they were like a second layer of clothing.</p><p>Soon he was panting from exertion. His dizziness increased, and he tightened his hold on Haidee. They didn\u2019t touch skin to skin, merely cloth to cloth. Perhaps if he slid his hands up the hem of her pants and gripped her thigh properly, her temperature would stave off the dizziness the same way it staved off the demons.</p><p>Fol ow your own advice and stay alert. No touching the girl.</p><p>A single touch, and he\u2019d become lost to the lust again.</p><p>Branches slapped at him, slicing his cheeks. He shook his head, clearing his thoughts. The action must have roused Secrets. Instantly agitated, the demon prowled through his skul , hatred for this place wel ing up.</p><p>Voices suddenly wafted to Amun\u2019s ears.</p><p>Come closer, warrior...</p><p>Welcome to our home...</p><p>We won\u2019t hurt you...much...</p><p>Thoughts soon fol owed, fil ing his mind.</p><p>They\u2019l taste so good.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019l scream just the way I like...</p><p>The snakes were closing in, ready to strike. To kil . He couldn\u2019t fight them with Haidee dangling so precariously over his shoulder. She would take the brunt of the action, her body acting as his shield, and that he wouldn\u2019t al ow.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, he stopped and eased her to the ground\u2014no sudden movements\u2014then fit the backpack she stil carried around her neck, shielding the sensitive area as best he could. As he slowly, so slowly straightened, he withdrew two of his blades, metal whistling against leather.</p><p>That must have been the starting bel for the snakes.</p><p>Dozens of crimson eyes leveled on him... Fangs flashed bright white.</p><p>He tensed.</p><p>The snakes launched forward.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>NOW THIS IS THE SHIT, Strider thought with a slow grin.</p><p>A few hours ago, Lucien had flashed him and Wil iam to Paris. The guy, not the city. Though the evening had only just begun, Paris had been wel on his way to ambrosia intoxication, already laughing like a loon.</p><p>So rather than cart him off and start hunting Gil y\u2019s parents to play a little game of slice and dice, as planned, and rather than leaving him behind in such a vulnerable condition, Strider and Wil iam had decided to take care of Paris\u2014aka down a little ambrosia themselves\u2014and head out as a unit in the morning.</p><p>Brotherly love and al that. The things I do for my friends. Not that Strider was intoxicated. He was the sober one.</p><p>He reclined on a delightful y cushioned lounge in the sprawling ranch Paris had rented. In Dal as, Texas, of al places. Promiscuity had decked himself out, too, wearing a Stetson (weird), no shirt (understandable), unfastened jeans (smart) and cowboy boots (weird again). Dude looked ready to rustle cattle or something.</p><p>At least the girls Paris had invited to party with him were more sensible. They wore bikinis.</p><p>Best of al , as the girls swam in the moon-and-lamplit pool, laughing, playing, Strider was reminded that he\u2019d always preferred females with big boobs and lots of makeup. He was able to forget al about only-a-handful Haidee and how lovely and delicate she\u2019d looked in Amun\u2019s arms. Arms that should have been his. But whatever.</p><p>\u201cI cal dibs on the topless one,\u201d Wil iam said from Strider\u2019s left, throwing back his ambrosia-laced beer.</p><p>\u201cAnd the one wearing dental floss.\u201d He\u2019d changed his mind five times in the past ten minutes. As of now, he had dibs on every single female in sight.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a thong, moron,\u201d Paris slurred from Strider\u2019s right.</p><p>They reclined in lounges, too, the only cocks within miles of this little henhouse.</p><p>The girls were in front of them, some using the concrete rim around the hourglass pool as a dance floor.</p><p>Gods love this modern era, because the females weren\u2019t afraid to grind on each other.</p><p>\u201cIf the thing riding up her ass is a thong, whatdya cal that string across her nipples?\u201d Wil iam countered.</p><p>\u201cA string,\u201d Paris said, then nodded as if confirming his own genius. \u201cAnd by the way, I get first pick since I rounded \u2019em up and brought \u2019em here, and I cal dibs on the topless one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get \u2019em, anyway?\u201d Strider asked. Funny. His own words were slurred.</p><p>\u201cStrip club downtown,\u201d Paris replied, finishing off his latest bottle of jack. \u201cThrow enough money around and you can have anything you want. Except, maybe, fried Twinkies. I can\u2019t find those anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Wil iam tapped two fingers against his chin. \u201cYou had any of</p><p>\u2019em before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFried Twinkies?\u201d Paris nodded. \u201cOnly once, but I\u2019ve never forgotten the experience. It\u2019s like heaven in your mouth, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFried\u2014 Paris, you dumb bastard.\u201d Exasperated, Wil iam shook his head. \u201cI meant the women.\u201d</p><p>Exasperated himself, Paris splayed his arms. \u201cHow would I know whether or not the women have had a fried Twinkie? I only just met them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear gods.\u201d Wil iam pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cHave you. Slept with. One of. The women.</p><p>Before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sure, I have. And shit. Why didn\u2019t you say that to begin with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinal y,\u201d Wil iam said. \u201cWe get somewhere. Who?\u201d</p><p>Because of his straight-up awesome demon, Paris couldn\u2019t screw the same woman twice. Sure, he weakened unbearably if he failed to rol around in the sheets at least once a day, but that was a smal price to pay for unlimited nookie.</p><p>\u201cLike I remember,\u201d Paris replied.</p><p>\u201cYour cock always remembers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , we\u2019re currently not speaking, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we come to yet another dead end.\u201d Wil iam\u2019s sigh was somehow as wry as his tone. \u201cYou\u2019re just gonna have to take who I give you and deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike anyone would pick you over me.\u201d</p><p>Wil iam blustered over the insult. \u201cYou just wait and see. I\u2019l have every single one of them eating out of my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you find one of those delicious fried Twinkies,\u201d</p><p>Paris snapped.</p><p>Strider rol ed his eyes. Egotistical morons. Anyone with a set of eyes could see that Strider was the pretty one in their little threesome.</p><p>His demon immediately recognized the chal enge and stretched, gearing up to do whatever was necessary to ensure that statement was true.

He didn\u2019t need the hassle tonight.</p><p>\u201cHey, Wil iam,\u201d a beautiful blonde frolicking in the water cal ed. \u201cYou said you wanted to taste me when I got wet.</p><p>Wel , I\u2019m very, very wet,\u201d she ended with husky entreaty.</p> <p>\u201cCome taste me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not quite wet enough, honey bun. Keep playing, and I\u2019l let you know when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>For al his own dib-cal ing the past few hours, Wil iam hadn\u2019t touched a single female yet. Strider had, though. He\u2019d already taken the one with blue streaks in her sandy-colored hair upstairs. For forty-five minutes he\u2019d unleashed his sexual needs on her wil ing body, making her moan and scream and writhe.</p><p>He\u2019d even made her beg.</p><p>Clearly, he\u2019d been the best she\u2019d ever had. Not that he\u2019d ever doubted that would be the case. Not that he\u2019d waited several minutes after the loving was done, tense, expecting to double over in pain since he hadn\u2019t laid his patented moves on her, had just acted on need.</p> <p>When he and Defeat had realized they could add another name to their ever-growing list of completely satisfied females\u2014not that they remembered any of the names\u2014</p><p>Strider should have shot right into another climax. But the rush of victory hadn\u2019t done anything for him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t felt any better about his situation. He might even have felt worse. Like, hol owed out or something.</p><p>The girl had fal en asleep immediately afterward, thank the gods, because if she\u2019d tried to talk to him, he would seriously have cut off his ears. Sex, good. Conversation, bad. He should have let her rest, but he hadn\u2019t trusted her enough to leave her unattended, so he\u2019d carted her back outside and placed her on a lounge\u2014on the opposite side of the pool, where she was stil sleeping. A guy couldn\u2019t be too careful.</p><p>Stil . She hadn\u2019t been a chal enge, not in any way, real y, and he\u2019d liked that. Liked being able to relax.</p><p>With Ex, the chal enge would always be there, influencing everything he did, so he would always be on edge. Of course, that would also mean the pleasure of final y winning her would be unparal eled, because the harder the battle, the sweeter the victory.</p> <p>Not that he gave a shit about that now. He just wanted to take the easy road, damn it. He deserved the easy road for once. Even though he was learning the easy road sucked.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you join us, Paris?\u201d a brunette cal ed silkily, dragging Strider\u2019s mind back to the party. She sat at the edge of the pool, her feet dangling in the crystal ine water.</p><p>She nibbled on her bottom lip as she swirled a finger over one of her bared nipples. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to get my hands on you ever since you first said hi to me.\u201d</p><p>A few others sighed dreamily, as if remembering that very thing. As if Paris\u2019s \u201chi\u201d was the most stimulating conversation they\u2019d ever had the privilege of enjoying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching you al this time,\u201d Paris responded in a rumbling purr, \u201cand as you can guess, I\u2019m practical y on fire to have you. But I gotta get myself under control before I can trust myself to even kiss you.\u201d</p><p>The girls giggled.</p><p>Such a smooth talker Paris was, flattering without hurting a single feeling, yet doing exactly as he desired.</p><p>Staying just where he was without inviting anyone over. But his desires were stupid, Strider thought. Did Paris want to spend the night alone and untouched?</p> <p>And what the fuck, man. Was Strider dog food? Where was his shout-out? Where was his \u201ccome over here and play with me?\u201d Or maybe they thought he only wanted the sandy-haired wench. Wel , he wanted the topless one.</p><p>Win. Defeat stretched a little more, practical y humming about the possibility of trying to steal the girl\u2019s affection away from Paris.</p><p>Damn it. Can\u2019t I have a single night to myself?</p><p>The demon replied with more humming. Meaning, hel no.</p><p>I gave you a victory tonight already.</p><p>WIN.</p><p>Fine. One more. But it wouldn\u2019t be the fight his demon wanted. Frowning, Strider pointed to the shortest female in the group. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened with pleasure. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>She was slightly older than the others, putting her in her early thirties, with black hair and green eyes. He kinda wished she were a blonde, but she had a few tattoos scattered across her back\u2014birds rather than words and faces, not that he cared\u2014so he figured she would do. Not that he was particular or anything, or going for a specific type. He just knew what he wanted, and there was nothing wrong with that.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You. C\u2019mere, honey,\u201d he said, crooking that finger and motioning her over.</p><p>She giggled and jumped to a stand. Several of the other girls threw her jealous scowls as she closed the distance and plopped onto his lap, and he nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>Now that was more like it.</p><p>There\u2019s your one more, you little shit.</p><p>Defeat quieted, happy with the win but bored by the ease of it.</p><p>Strider sighed. Earlier, this female had taken a dip in the water, and her gold-foil bathing suit was stil damp. She fit her ass right over his semi-erect penis and leaned back, stretching out against him. Her large\u2014real y large\u2014breasts jutted up, her nipples beaded underneath the fabric of the suit, and she squirmed against him, trying to rub him into ful arousal.</p><p>Suddenly he wished he\u2019d kept his mouth shut. He didn\u2019t want to be rubbed\u2014or talked to. Damn his irresistible sexual magnetism.</p><p>\u201cEasy now,\u201d he told her, gripping her hips to ensure she slowed down. \u201cI need a few minutes to recover from the excitement of having you here.\u201d</p><p>Thankful y, she stil ed. She twisted just a little, peering up at him through heavy-lidded eyes. \u201cWant me to turn around?\u201d</p><p>She smel ed of peaches and cigarette smoke. \u201cActual y, be a good girl and get me another beer from the kitchen.\u201d He hefted her to her feet and gave her tight ass a pat. \u201cI need to rebuild my strength or I\u2019l never be able to keep up with a woman as talented and beautiful as you.\u201d</p><p>The action startled her, and she yelped, then threw a narrowed glance over her shoulder. \u201cBeer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and sometime tonight,\u201d he prompted, not wanting to give her time to question him further. \u201cThat\u2019s a sweet girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab me one, too, sweetness,\u201d Paris cal ed. \u201cDon\u2019t pop the lid, though, al right?\u201d</p><p>With a huff, she flounced inside. The kitchen sat right next to the patio, the glass doors al owing him to watch her as she dug into the fridge, turned and stalked back out. By the time she reached him, she had calmed down.</p><p>When she tried to sit back on his lap, he confiscated the beers and gave her a little push toward the pool. \u201cWatching you swim is about the sexiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Show me that swan dive again, and transport me right back to heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you wanted... If you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. I\u2019m practical y drooling just thinking about how graceful you are.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders squared proudly, and she raced off to do just that. Strider tossed Paris his beer.</p><p>\u201cI just had the best idea ever,\u201d Wil iam said the moment they were alone. Wel , as alone as three guys could be with a backyard fil ed with strippers. He grinned evil y. \u201cLet\u2019s give Maddox a ring.\u201d</p><p>Paris had dumped a baggie of ambrosia in the new bottle and had just taken a swig. The liquid caught in his throat, choking him. After banging a fist into his sternum, he regained his breath and said, \u201cYou mean propose to him?</p><p>To grumpy ole Maddox? Shit, Wil ie, why didn\u2019t you tel us you\u2019re a masochist who swung that way?</p><p>You\u2019re so delicate, he\u2019l rip you to shreds the moment you climb into his bed. Plus, he\u2019s hitched himself to Ashlyn. You try to lay a move on him, and that sweet thang wil rearrange your face.\u201d</p><p>Rol ing his eyes, Wil iam withdrew Paris\u2019s cel phone from the pocket of the swim trunks he\u2019d borrowed.</p><p>\u201cI mean cal him, you idiot. What\u2019s with you tonight? Permanent brain damage? We\u2019l breathe heavily and ask him what he\u2019s wearing. I bet no one\u2019s phone sexed him before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Paris frowned as he eyed the smal black device. \u201cI had that stashed in my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s where I found it when I was snooping through your things.\u201d As always, Wil iam was unrepentant about his sins. \u201cSo who has the titanium bal s to actual y do it, huh?\u201d</p><p>Defeat raised his arm like a schoolboy, the only kid in class who knew the answer to the seemingly impossible mathematical equation on the board.</p><p>Enough from you already! You had your \u201cmore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Maddox?\u201d Strider asked. If anyone could kick his ass over the phone, it was the keeper of Violence. The warrior would probably find a way to reach through the line and strangle him the moment he started describing al the naughty things he supposedly planned to do to him.</p><p>Wil iam flashed his perfect white teeth. \u201cBecause he\u2019l curse the most, and that\u2019l make me laugh the hardest. Now, are you in or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me that effing phone,\u201d Strider grumbled, opening his palm and waving his fingers.</p><p>\u201cEffing?\u201d Wil iam laughed with genuine amusement. \u201cYou ever realize how polite you get when you\u2019re hammered?</p><p>And you know what they say. A man\u2019s true character is revealed when he\u2019s toasted. So you gotta face facts, man.</p><p>You\u2019re a closet gentleman.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cLoser!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe heck I am!\u201d</p><p>Even Paris laughed at that.</p><p>Strider snatched the phone out of Wil iam\u2019s hand and started dialing. Yeah, Maddox\u2014like every other warrior\u2014</p><p>was on speed dial, but Strider didn\u2019t know the order Paris had them listed and he didn\u2019t want to ask. If Strider wasn\u2019t first, he didn\u2019t want to chal enge the bastard to fix the mistake.</p><p>A few seconds later, Strider realized he\u2019d dialed the wrong number because some dumb kid answered with a \u201cWhat\u2019s up, yo?\u201d</p><p>Strider quickly hung up and tried again, careful y pecking at the keys. After the first ring, he switched to speaker. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maddox answered a few seconds later, his voice raspy with the force of his panting. \u201cSomething wrong, Paris?\u201d</p><p>Wil iam and Paris were on the edges of their seats, peering over at Strider with utter glee. He hadn\u2019t seen either warrior that happy or relaxed in a long time, and he realized they had needed this vacation as much as he had.</p><p>Strider blew into the mouthpiece, then moaned as if he were buried deep inside a woman\u2019s body. He tried not to grin.</p> <p>\u201cParis?\u201d Maddox asked, confused. \u201cYou there? You okay?\u201d</p><p>Both warriors tried to cut off their laughs, smashing their knuckles into their mouths, but snorts managed to escape.</p><p>\u201cYou naked, big boy?\u201d Strider asked in his best imitation of an aroused female. \u201cBecause I am.\u201d</p><p>More snorting fol owed his words.</p><p>\u201cStrider? And don\u2019t try to deny it. I recognize your voice.</p> <p>What the hel are you doing with Paris\u2019s phone? I thought you were in Rome. And furthermore, what the hel does it matter if I\u2019m naked or not? You have exactly two seconds to explain or I\u2019m going to reach through the line, rip your tongue out of your mouth and\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, static, a muttered, \u201cGive me that,\u201d by an indignant female. Then the normal y quiet and reserved Ashlyn was demanding, \u201cDid you just drunk dial my husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Strider said, and the other two final y burst into laughter, fal ing back in their chairs, their bodies shaking with the force of their mirth. \u201cA guy\u2019s gotta have some fun. Even if it\u2019s the fun he puts in his own funeral. So is he? Naked, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, for your information, he is not. He\u2019s working out. I, uh, kind of incited him to rage so he\u2019s beating the crap out of a brick wal .\u201d</p><p>The laughter continued for several minutes, until even Ashlyn was chortling. \u201cYou boys are incorrigible.</p><p>This isn\u2019t funny! He\u2019l probably destroy the other wal when we hang up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. He needed to get out of bed and final y do something besides\u2014\u201d Strider stopped himself before he said something else Maddox would rage over.</p><p>\u201cBesides pleasuring me?\u201d Ashlyn finished for him, anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l change your mind when you next see him. Lately, he\u2019s a nervous wreck about the babies. He\u2019s picking fights with everyone he meets and has even been arrested.</p><p>Twice. We\u2019re going to make our way back to the fortress in the next week or so. He needs you guys.</p><p>Because, and please don\u2019t laugh when I tel you this, if we\u2019re alone much longer I\u2019m going to murder him in his sleep.\u201d</p><p>Strider chuckled. \u201cBet you\u2019re wishing you hadn\u2019t saved him from his death curse.\u201d Once upon a time, Reyes had been forced to murder Maddox every night and Lucien had been forced to escort his soul to hel . Ashlyn managed to reverse the curse, sparing them al .</p><p>\u201cA little peace and quiet isn\u2019t too much to ask for, you know?\u201d she said loudly. Then, in a softer tone, she added,</p><p>\u201cSo everyone\u2019s good?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be nice to them,\u201d Maddox barked in the background.</p><p>\u201cYou need your rest, and they interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hush,\u201d she replied. \u201cIf you had your way, I\u2019d be resting every minute of every day. And like I can real y rest while we\u2019re outside, in the middle of town, while you destroy another building. Besides, I miss them and want to talk to them.\u201d</p><p>That shut Maddox up. He could deny his precious Ashlyn nothing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re great. Me, Wil ie and Paris are on vacation.</p><p>Together,\u201d Strider added. He relaxed against his lounge, his free hand anchored under his head, wondering if he\u2019d ever have such an easy relationship with a woman. \u201cYou guys good? No trouble lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides Maddox\u2019s temper? Not even a hint of it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask where they were or what, exactly, they were doing. Besides destroying public property.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to know. Ignorance was bliss. Besides that, if Hunters ever managed to pul their heads out of their asses and capture him, he wouldn\u2019t have any secrets to spil .</p><p>Secrets. Amun. Ex.</p><p>His jaw clenched. You weren\u2019t going to think about them, remember? \u201cHow are Stride and Stridette?\u201d</p><p>Friend that he was, he\u2019d taken the massive burden of picking names for the twins upon himself.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s means Liam and Liama,\u201d Wil iam cal ed, but a shadow then passed over his features, his grin fading.</p><p>\u201cMadd and Madder are kicking like professional soccer players,\u201d she replied, her voice softening with love and affection. \u201cI swear, we\u2019re gonna have our hands ful when they final y get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the way, you\u2019ve ruined a perfectly good prank cal with al this baby talk, Ash,\u201d Wil iam scolded her.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Paris said with a nod.</p><p>She laughed with unvarnished delight. \u201cNo more than you deserve, boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang up the phone, woman,\u201d Maddox suddenly said, grim.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. I have to go now,\u201d she said and hung up before anyone could reply.</p><p>Strider tossed the phone to Paris, who missed. \u201cThink they\u2019re in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Paris said, plucking the device before Wil iam could.</p><p>\u201cThe someone who\u2019s coming is probably Maddox himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s probably dragging her back to wherever they\u2019re staying so he can make a prank cal of his own,\u201d Wil iam said, adding, \u201con her body.\u201d</p><p>Before Defeat could throw in his own supposition, Strider changed the subject. \u201cSo now what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>Out of habit, he scanned his surroundings.</p><p>The girls were watching them, he realized, confused by their amusement but clearly charmed by it. They were wearing dreamy expressions, as if they were already planning a triple wedding.</p><p>\u201cI guess we could grab a female or two and head to our bedrooms.\u201d Paris didn\u2019t sound enthused by the prospect.</p><p>At least he wasn\u2019t going to deny himself his daily dose, though.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wil iam replied, and he actual y sounded depressed.</p><p>Strider knew Paris\u2019s problem. The woman he had desired above al others, the first woman he\u2019d ever been able to have sex with more than once, had died in his arms, gunned down by her own people.</p><p>Hunters. Like Ex.</p><p>This time, Strider didn\u2019t even attempt to cut off his thoughts of her. Yet. Had she been among the shooters? Probably.</p><p>There was no bitch more coldhearted. Literal y. He\u2019d never met anyone whose body was as cold as that girl\u2019s\u2014except those he\u2019d sent to the morgue, of course. Like he\u2019d once sent Ex.</p><p>Was she cold because she was stil dead? Was she akin to the walking dead?</p><p>The possibility was worth considering. Later. Right now, he wanted to figure out Wil iam\u2019s unusual somberness. A much safer topic. Was there someone the warrior wanted but couldn\u2019t have? Someone he\u2019d lost? Was that why he was so hands-off when he used to be a worse degenerate than Strider?</p><p>Seriously, he hadn\u2019t touched a single stripper. Not even to slap a rump.</p><p>\u201cSo am I the only one who sees the dead girl at Paris\u2019s feet or what?\u201d Wil iam asked conversational y.</p><p>Strider and Paris stiffened in unison. Dead girl?</p><p>Strider was the first to find his voice. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He looked, hard, but saw no hint of a dead...anything.</p><p>\u201cIs this a joke?\u201d Paris demanded, and there was no denying the menace in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo joke, I swear.\u201d Wil iam held up his hands, al innocence.</p><p>\u201cShe showed up a few minutes ago and just kinda threw herself on the ground beside your chair. Dude, she\u2019s got her hands wrapped around your ankle.\u201d His gaze remained in the same spot, as if he were studying her. \u201cShe\u2019s got dark hair and dirt-smudged skin. Or maybe those are freckles. She\u2019s wearing a ripped white robe and black wings are growing out of her back. Ohhh, she\u2019s got nice hands. Look at those things. I bet she does al kinds of naughty things with them.\u201d</p><p>Paris was on his feet a second later, wild gaze darting over the concrete surrounding his chair. \u201cWhere is she? Where, damn it?\u201d</p><p>A frowning Wil iam pointed at the exact spot Paris was standing. \u201cYou\u2019re on top of her. Hey, girl. Girl. I don\u2019t think he can see you. Or feel you. I don\u2019t think grabbing on to him like that is gonna help you.\u201d</p><p>Paris jumped back and, with an urgent moan, fel to his knees, patting the area in question as if he were putting out a fire. \u201cI don\u2019t feel her. Are you sure she\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>Desperate, uttered in a rush.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d Wil iam\u2019s brow furrowed several seconds before smoothing out as comprehension dawned.</p><p>\u201cI guess I never told you guys, but I see dead people. Oh, and look.</p><p>There\u2019s Cronus.\u201d</p><p>Cronus, the god king. Strider\u2019s eyes widened, but he saw no bright light to announce the sovereign\u2019s sudden appearance. Al remained as it was. No, not true. Paris had stiffened, fury bathing his face, his teeth bared in a fearsome scowl.</p><p>Cronus had given them medal ions to hide them from the gods, but had since taken them back, saying the Lords had abused them. Meaning, Cronus wanted to know where they were at al times. Here was proof.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy. How you doing?\u201d Wil iam waved. \u201cYou taking the girl?\u201d Pause. \u201cWow, you\u2019re brave.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t look like she the girl?\u201d Pause. \u201cWow, you\u2019re brave. Doesn\u2019t look like she wants to leave with you.\u201d Another pause. He didn\u2019t seem to care that he was having a conversation with himself. \u201cOkay, then, but go easy on her. I think Paris likes her. Wel , bye.\u201d</p><p>He waved again.</p><p>Paris listened, growing more and more agitated. At the</p><p>\u201cbye,\u201d he launched himself at Wil iam, his roar shattering the ease of the night.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>HAIDEE FOUGHT THROUGH THE thick, black cloud in her mind, hearing grunts, groans and hisses in the distance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Heavy eyelids blinked open, and through a misty haze she saw a tal , muscled warrior standing over her, a solid leg on each side of her hips. Amun. Her sweet Amun.</p><p>He slashed his serrated daggers with swift proficiency, his wrists arcing as his hands overlapped, quickly sailing apart and nailing a target. Or several targets at the same time.</p><p>Thin, scaled bodies\u2014snakes, she thought groggily\u2014fel al around her, crimson rivers flowing under her.</p> <p>In death, their red eyes were fixed on her, their fangs forever bared but useless.</p><p>Those bodies continued to rain as Amun continued to slash, and a more fantastical display of male aggression and skil she\u2019d never seen. But no matter how many reptiles he kil ed, more flew from the tangle of limbs, desperate to bite him. Many had already succeeded. His arms were covered with tiny punctures, his own blood dripping and blending with theirs.</p><p>None of the snakes had reached her, however. Every time one of them angled in her direction, either from in front or behind, he noticed and attacked. He protected her, even though he left his sides wide open to do so, al owing several other sets of fangs to sink deep.</p><p>She should help, do something, anything, but her limbs refused to obey her command to move. She drew in a deep breath\u2014the air, so sweet, so pungent\u2014trying to find her center, trying to tap into a reservoir of strength. Only lethargy greeted her.</p><p>Amun was panting, sweating, probably tiring and definitely needing her to do\u2014her eyes were closing again...open, damn it...closing...thoughts fragmenting...darkness.</p> <p>THE NEXT TIME HAIDEE managed to pry open her eyelids, she saw wide, rocky wal s painted red with blood and depicting horrific images that blurred at her sides as she...floated? Even from the swift glimpses she was afforded, she managed to spot three stabbings, two rapes and countless burnings.</p><p>Worse than the images, however, she saw an actual human body hanging from the domed ceiling, crows eating at its rotting flesh. What. The. Hel ?</p><p>Hel . The word echoed in her mind, rousing her memory.</p><p>She had entered hel with Amun. Her dream man. Her enemy. Her obsession.</p><p>Her head felt too heavy to turn even the barest inch, so she moved her gaze instead\u2014and found herself peering up at his beautiful dark skin. He cradled her in his arms, his chest littered with tiny, seeping holes.</p><p>He stared straight ahead, his chin jutting stubbornly, his lips pressed into a thin, mutinous line.</p> <p>He must be in pain, she thought, yet he carried her with careful, easy steps, doing his best not to jostle her. Such tenderness...such a darling man.</p><p>Would she ever figure him out?</p><p>She tried to open her mouth to thank him, to apologize for not aiding him in the Realm of Snakes, for actual y hindering him, but no words emerged. Her lips refused to even part, lethargy stil pumping through her at an alarming rate. Damn it. She owed him something.</p><p>He must have sensed her internal struggle, though he never looked down, never slowed his gait. Easy now, he said, that husky voice wisping through her mind. Don\u2019t try to talk.</p><p>Sleep, heal.</p><p>That. She could give him that. Obedience, just this once. Or again. With him, the lines had always been blurred. She closed her eyes and let the darkness once again consume her.</p><p>HAIDEE STRETCHED HER ARMS over her head, back arching, legs kicking out. In the back of her mind, she knew she\u2019d grown used to hard, twig-laden ground, cramped cel s and general discomfort.</p><p>But, oh, not this time. The mattress beneath her was soft and smel ed deliciously of peat smoke and flowers. And sweet Lord above, she heard a crackling fire, felt wave after wave of delicious heat caressing her skin.</p> <p>Only two things marred the luxury of the moment. A dul headache throbbing in her temples, and a gnawing sense of emptiness in her stomach. Both demanded attention.</p><p>Now. She blinked open her eyes, taking stock. She was sprawled on her side, lying on a bed of soft, colorful petals.</p><p>Inside a murky, barren cave. Had Amun picked the flowers from the forest and brought them here, just to ensure her comfort?</p><p>Amun.</p><p>She jolted upright, heartbeat accelerating with gratitude, delight and awareness. So much awareness. He sat only a few inches away, within striking distance. Perhaps he was coming to trust her. A fire blazed in front of him, creating a symphony of music and heat. His bare back was to her. As she\u2019d noticed before, he bore no tattoos, no scars. She saw only the ridges of his spine and a wide span of muscle and scabs.</p><p>From the snakes, she realized. The snakes he\u2019d saved her from.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she asked, surprised by the raw quality of her voice.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t even twitch with alarm at the sudden interruption. We\u2019re between realms, I think.</p><p>We\u2019re safe, though. I scouted ahead, and there\u2019s nothing and no one for miles.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said softly. \u201cFor everything.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. You have to talk to me, Haidee. Slowly he twisted so that his hip pressed against hers, and they were facing each other. I wasn\u2019t sure how the ambrosia in the air would affect you. I wasn\u2019t sure if I needed to try and purge it from your body or leave you be.</p><p>She knew she needed to reply but couldn\u2019t. Not just yet.</p><p>She wanted to savor this moment with him, no animosity between them.</p><p>He was just so beautiful, his dark, fathomless eyes probing al the way to her soul. His lips, though taut with tension, could lure a woman to her own downfal . As long as she could have those lips on her body, that tongue licking, sucking and tasting, destruction hardly mattered.</p><p>More than embodying physical perfection, he was courageous, caring, protective. How could anyone consider him evil? Least of al herself?</p><p>Honestly. How could she ever hurt him? Even if he decided he no longer needed her and opted to punish her for her past sins? She wouldn\u2019t be able to blame him. He just wanted to survive, as she always had.</p><p>And what if Baden had been just like him? she suddenly wondered, causing sickness to churn in her stomach. What if she\u2019d helped kil an innocent man? Not that Baden had been innocent back then, but what if he would have matured into a dedicated warrior like the one in front of her?</p><p>What if they were al innocent? The sickness intensified.</p><p>Strider had spent those seemingly endless days with her, yet he hadn\u2019t raped her, hadn\u2019t tortured her, hadn\u2019t hurt her as he could have. He\u2019d threatened her, yes, but then, she had threatened him. She had even hit him, stabbed him.</p><p>He\u2019d retaliated, once, but not as fiercely as he should have.</p><p>The Lords of the Underworld are the epitome of evil, Dean Stefano, the modern-day version of the Bad Man, the first Hunter she\u2019d ever encountered, had always said. As right-hand man to Galen, who rarely made an appearance, he was currently in charge of the troops. They must be eradicated before their poison spreads. To you, to your loved ones. How many of your mothers have died of cancer? How many of your teenage daughters have been violated? How many of your spouses have betrayed you?</p><p>When someone had balked about kil ing another living being, Stefano had added stiffly, Kil ing a demon isn\u2019t murder. Demons are animals, and those animals would slaughter your entire family without a single pang of remorse. Like a starving lion or bear. They attack and ravage thoughtlessly. Never forget that fact.</p><p>Wasted breath, she\u2019d thought every time she\u2019d heard that speech. Haidee hadn\u2019t needed convincing. A demon had slaughtered her entire family. Not just once, but twice.</p><p>She\u2019d always blamed the entire lot of them because, to her, a demon was a demon and evil was evil.</p><p>Now, with the proud, compassionate Amun so close to her, she at last saw the flaw in her logic. Evil destroyed. These men hadn\u2019t destroyed her when given the chance, yet destruction had always been her ultimate goal.</p><p>How many times had she tried to eradicate the Lords? Had she even cared about the methods used?</p><p>No.</p><p>A wail of regret suddenly caught in her throat. What if she was the evil one?</p><p>A firm arm slid under her knees and another wrapped around her waist. A moment later she was being lifted and lowered. After that, she was leaning against Amun\u2019s massive chest, her cheek pressed into the hol ow of his neck. Gently he caressed her hair as if she was beloved rather than despised, as if her emotional state mattered.</p><p>What are you, Haidee? he asked again, voice as gentle as his touch.</p><p>She\u2019d never discussed her...infection with another living being. Ever. Not even Micah. But this was Amun. Her Amun. As tears burned her eyes, she relaxed against him, flattening her palm against the heart beating so swiftly in his chest. He\u2019d saved her; he deserved to know the truth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHuman, I know that much, but something else, too. I can be kil ed just like anyone else. Bleeding out, disease, starvation. But each time I\u2019m kil ed, I come back, exactly as I am now.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ve died before? I mean, I know you died that once, but you\u2019ve actual y died several times? His tender stroking never ceased.</p><p>\u201cYes. More than several, though. I lost count a long time ago. Stil , no matter how long I manage to stay alive in one incarnation, I never age past this point. I guess my age just kind of froze after the very first death.\u201d</p><p>So what happens after you die?</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. You\u2019d think the pain of dying would be the worst, but no. The pain of rebirth, or whatever it is, is devastating. I\u2019l feel my life slipping away, float in darkness for what seems an eternity, but then, when the light comes...\u201d She shuddered again. \u201cThe light swal ows me, burns me to my soul, but not with fire, with ice, and my body wil begin to rejuvenate. I\u2019m like a mother giving birth</p><p>\u2014to myself. My bones feel like they\u2019re being injected with acid, every muscle spasms and my skin feels like it\u2019s being poured back on.\u201d</p><p>Those warm fingers curled around her nape, the caress becoming a massage. Again, his touch was tender, and yet, as aware of him as she was, her sensitive flesh prickled, her nipples beaded, and an ache bloomed between her legs. How she wanted this man.</p><p>She had always assumed discussing the past would be difficult. And never had she imagined doing so with one of the demon-possessed warriors she\u2019d fought so diligently to obliterate. The words flowed smoothly, however. \u201cWhen the pain final y leaves, I always find myself in the same location. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Greece, in a cave next to the water. I won\u2019t remember any of the good things that happened to me, yet I\u2019m aware that the memories were taken. Not that that makes any sense.</p><p>I\u2019l know who I am, every terrible thing that\u2019s ever been done to me, every terrible thing I\u2019ve done, and the hate... God, Amun, I\u2019m always fil ed with so much hate. For the first few years of a new life, that hate is the only thing that drives me.\u201d</p><p>He rested his chin on top of her head, his warm breath ruffling strands of her hair, tickling. How long have you been alive this time?</p> <p>\u201cAbout eleven years.\u201d</p><p>Why have you never come after us before?</p><p>She should lie. The truth would destroy the tranquility of this moment. He deserved the truth, though.</p><p>After everything, he deserved the truth.</p><p>\u201cI have come after you,\u201d she admitted. \u201cA few years ago, some of you were in New York. I helped burn down your home. And then, a few months ago, in Budapest, there was a shootout. I was there.\u201d</p> <p>No, I mean, in one of your other lives. I\u2019ve been around a long time, yet this is the first time since ancient Greece that I\u2019ve encountered you.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to take issue with her confession. He wasn\u2019t even going to acknowledge it as the travesty it was.</p><p>The realization was staggering. \u201cI always remain in seclusion until I\u2019ve got the hate under control. And even then, I have to wait until I can pass myself off as someone else before I can rejoin society and the Hunters, which means waiting until the people who might have known me are dead.\u201d</p><p>How do you know who they are, if most of your memories are taken? And how you are Haidee now, if you\u2019ve changed your identity?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come back so many times, and with so many years apart, I\u2019m often able to reuse the same name.</p><p>As for the rest, I keep records inside my cave, files detailing everything I\u2019ve been through in one lifetime.</p> <p>I also send newspaper clippings, photos, that sort of thing, to a mailbox nearby.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s smart. His sincerity warmed her as surely as his touch.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She lifted her arm, drawing his attention to her tattoos. She\u2019d never done this before, either. Never explained what the etchings meant. If she and Amun were ever going to make a relationship work, though\u2014you want a ful -blown relationship now?\u2014one of them had to take that first, trusting step.</p><p>\u201cSee this?\u201d she asked, ignoring her question to herself.</p><p>With her free hand, she traced a circle around the only address amid the faces, phrases and dates.</p><p>His fingers curled around her wrist, slowly turning her arm, al owing him to study each of the surrounding tattoos. He rubbed the pad of his thumb over Micah\u2019s name, as if he could wipe it away. Just then, she wished he could.</p><p>Yes, he said. I see.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where my mailbox is.\u201d</p> <p>At first, he didn\u2019t respond. Then his breath emerged raggedly and he stiffened. Don\u2019t tel me anything else about how you survive. Okay?</p><p>\u201cO-okay,\u201d she said, confused. \u201cWhy?\u201d Because he\u2019d feel obligated to tel his friends, but didn\u2019t actual y want them to know? Yes, she realized a moment later. That was exactly why.</p><p>The thought of possible betrayal should have sent her leaping out of his lap. Instead, she cuddled closer.</p><p>He was stil trying to take care of her.</p><p>Who\u2019s the Bad Man? he asked, changing the subject.</p><p>Hearing a nickname she\u2019d only ever thought jolted her.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know about him?\u201d</p><p>His thumb brushed the side of her jaw, and she shivered. I had a vision of you. Like the one we saw together, of you on the veranda. Except in this one, you were a little girl.</p><p>Everyone else, I can read their minds, but you...I have only ever seen snatches of your life.</p><p>First, he could read al minds but hers? That was kind of...</p><p>disappointing. She wished he could see al of her, know al of her. If anyone could help her sift through her confused emotions and conflicting desires, it was this man. \u201cThe Bad Man was the first Hunter I ever met. He found me after my parents were kil ed.\u201d</p><p>Blood, a river between her mother and her father. Both helpless...dead.</p><p>Oh, no. No way in hel would she al ow that hated memory to resurface now. \u201cHe saved my life after...someone like you tried to kil me. He thought I\u2019d come in handy.\u201d She laughed bitterly. \u201cHe was right, he just didn\u2019t know it. I was nearly a teenager when he sold me in the slave market after failing to train me. But after I died the first time, I remembered his lessons and that\u2019s how I later hooked up with the Hunters.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when you helped kil Baden? Simply asked, with no hint of his emotions.</p><p>Goodbye, sweet, stolen moment. If any topic could ruin their ease with each other, it was that one. Stil .</p><p>She nodded, tears once again burning her eyes.</p><p>Who did we take from you that drove you to hate us so deeply?</p><p>Again, there was no emotion in his voice. Not anger, not condemnation. Far more stunning, his question offered her absolution. A justifiable reason for her actions. He would never know what that meant to her, how profoundly that affected her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help herself. She pressed a kiss on the pulse thumping at the base of his neck. \u201cMy parents.</p><p>My sister.</p><p>My...husband.\u201d</p><p>Husband?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened around her. Before, you mentioned only one of us had done the deed. Do you know...do you know which of us it was?</p><p>That hesitancy...he feared he was the culprit, she realized.</p><p>\u201cI did not see the face of the one who kil ed my parents and sister, but I do know it wasn\u2019t you or any of your friends. He was a demon-possessed warrior, though. As for my husband...\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly who was responsible, but I do remember seeing your friends the night of his death.\u201d</p><p>He tipped up her chin and met her gaze, his black eyes deep pools of regret. He didn\u2019t speak, and neither did she.</p><p>Earlier he had offered her absolution, and with her silence, she now did the same for him.</p><p>He nodded in understanding, in thanks, and released her chin. His hand slid into her hair, his fingers combing through the strands. Do you know the story of how I came to be demon-possessed?</p><p>\u201cI think so. You and the others stole and opened Pandora\u2019s box, unleashing the demons that were trapped inside. The gods decided to punish you, and rightly so,\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but add, \u201cby bonding each of you with a demon of your own.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you steal the box, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Zeus asked Pandora to guard it rather than asking us, and we were...upset.</p><p>\u201cInsulted, you mean.\u201d Men and their pride, sometimes the reason nations fel .</p><p>Yes. We wanted to teach the god king a lesson, show him our worth.</p><p>\u201cAnd did you?\u201d</p><p>Hardly. We showed him exactly how stupid we were.</p><p>She fought a grin. At least he saw and accepted the truth.</p><p>He lifted a lock of her hair to his nose and breathed deeply, a moan of satisfaction drifting through her mind. The reason I brought up the box was to tel you that there were more demons locked inside than there were warriors to punish for unleashing the evil. Those that remained were placed in the prisoners of Tartarus. An immortal prison, he explained.</p><p>Ah. She knew where he was going with this. \u201cSo the man who kil ed my parents and sister might have been released from that prison.\u201d</p><p>Or escaped. Yes.</p><p>\u201cAnd whoever kil ed my husband could have escaped, as wel ?\u201d</p><p>That, I don\u2019t know. I wish otherwise, but... If you saw us that night, I\u2019d say there\u2019s a ninety-nine percent chance we were responsible.</p><p>No excuses, just brutal honestly. With countless lifetimes steeped in mystery, she appreciated such unvarnished probabilities. She kissed his pulse a second time, letting him know the admission hadn\u2019t propel ed her into a rage.</p><p>His sandalwood scent consumed her senses, reminding her of their shower. Which reminded her of their almost-kiss. Which reminded her she was in his arms and had only to stretch up to press their lips together.</p><p>Have you seen the man who\u2014have you seen him since?</p><p>She blinked. Concentrate. While she\u2019d been opening the doors to her body\u2019s desires, Amun had been focused on the being responsible for her family\u2019s demise, stil determined to look out for her. \u201cA few times,\u201d she hedged.</p><p>More like a hundred.</p><p>When? Where?</p><p>\u201cEach time, just before I die,\u201d she admitted. Always a prelude to the end of her current existence, as if he poisoned whatever life she\u2019d managed to build for herself.</p><p>But as many times as she\u2019d seen him, she\u2019d never fought him. And she\u2019d wanted to fight him, so badly.</p><p>He would simply reveal himself, that dark robe dancing around his ankles, his feet not quite touching the floor. He would watch her, hate dripping from him. He would curse at her. But he would never touch her or al ow her to touch him. Then, he would disappear.</p><p>I need to think on this, Amun said.</p><p>Her stomach chose that moment to rumble, and her cheeks flushed with embarrassment.</p><p>Once again Amun lifted her up, but this time he placed her on that bed of petals. Instantly she mourned the loss of his arms, his heat. I need to find you something to eat. I was afraid the snakes would harm you, even in their deaths, so I brought none of their meat with us.</p><p>Always taking care of her, her Amun. \u201cI wish that stupid angel had packed a few protein bars and bottles of water,\u201d</p><p>she said, snappier than she\u2019d intended.</p><p>Beside her, the pack in question plumped up with a whoosh. She and Amun shared a confused glance.</p><p>Frowning, he leaned over, unzipped the panels and reached inside. He withdrew a handful of protein bars.</p><p>His frown deepened as he upended the bag and dumped out the contents: more protein bars, fol owed by bottles of water. Just like that, his frown softened with hints of relief and wonder.</p><p>Ask for something else, he commanded.</p><p>Haidee lumbered to her knees, not daring to hope. \u201cI wish the pack had sandwiches and fruit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sides of the pack expanded a second time before sandwich after sandwich fel on top of the bars, each encased in a clear plastic wrapper.

I want weapons and toothpaste and a toothbrush\u2014\u201d they\u2019d left those behind</p><p>\u201c\u2014and a first aid kit for Amun\u2019s wounds.\u201d As she spoke, each of the requested items joined the pile.</p> <p>Giddy, she sorted through the food, picking out what she wanted to eat. Once she had a ham sandwich and apple in hand, she practical y inhaled them. Then another sandwich, then an orange. She drained two bottles of water. Every bite, every drop was heaven. And when she final y finished, too ful to shovel in another crumb, she cleaned herself as best she could with the wipes, brushed her teeth\u2014God, that felt good\u2014and final y al owed herself to glance over at Amun. Breath caught in her throat.</p><p>The firelight caressed him lovingly, bestowing a golden tint on his dark skin. A tint she hadn\u2019t noticed before. He was watching her, a strange, bemused expression on his beautiful face, and a half-eaten apple in his hand. Obviously he\u2019d cleaned up, too, since his face was no longer streaked with dirt.</p><p>\u201cLet me bandage your wounds,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>The bemused expression vanished, his pupils expanding, his nostrils flaring as if he suddenly scented prey. Her eyes widened. What had she said?</p><p>Your concern for me is nice, but to bandage me, you\u2019l have to put your hands on me. I want your hands on me for a different reason.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I...okay.\u201d</p><p>Come here. There was such force, such command in his tone, she didn\u2019t even think about refusing.</p><p>She crawled to him, quickly closing the distance between them. He set the apple aside, but he didn\u2019t touch her. He simply peered at her. Waiting. Expectant. She rose to her haunches, breathing him in. The sandalwood was now layered with the peat smoke.</p><p>She was supposed to bandage him first, right? Then touch him for a different reason. \u201cI\u2014I forgot the supplies.\u201d They were around here somewhere, and\u2014</p><p>Forget the supplies again. You\u2019re going to kiss me now, Haidee.</p><p>His heat was like a thick vine around her. She found herself almost in a trance as she straightened and said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Final y. Another kiss. Exactly what she\u2019d craved. Forever, it seemed.</p><p>A kiss between you and me and no other.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A plea from deep inside.</p><p>Do it, then. His voice snapped like a whip, daring her even as it warned her.</p><p>It was then she realized that, on some level, he was stil fighting his desire, exactly as he had in the shower, just before he\u2019d walked away from her, and that even when their tongues were rol ing together, he stil meant to resist her, to maintain distance.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to let him.</p><p>If she gave her al to their kiss, he had to give his al , too.</p><p>That was only fair.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I won\u2019t kiss you,\u201d she said, shivering as his eyes narrowed to dangerous slits. \u201cI mean, I won\u2019t do it because I\u2019m grateful to you, and I won\u2019t do it to distract or soften you.</p><p>I\u2019l do it just because I want you. So get ready. Because I expect the same from you. If you can\u2019t do the same, walk away now.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>I\u2019LL DO IT JUST BECAUSE I want you. As Haidee\u2019s soft, shattering words echoed in Amun\u2019s mind, he stopped waiting for her to take the lead, stopped waiting for her to physical y prove her desire for him, thereby atoning for her rejection of him in favor of Micah in the shower.</p><p>I can give you what you want, he told her, voice raw.</p><p>Her lips parted on a relieved gasp.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her relieved; he wanted her mindless. With a moan, he crushed his mouth to hers, one hand at her nape, one on her ass, and jerked her into the uncompromising line of his body. Immediately she opened for him, welcoming the hard thrust of his tongue into those wet, satiny depths. He tasted mint and apple, both frosted like ice cream. Both fueling his need.</p><p>During their talk, he\u2019d meant to ask her about the unnatural chil of her skin, but as she\u2019d spoken of death and pain, he had focused only on that. On finding a way to save her.</p><p>There had to be a way. And there had to be a reason she kept coming back.</p><p>How many times had she died? he\u2019d wondered. In how many ways? Not knowing tortured him, but he had a feeling that knowing would utterly destroy him. No matter what she\u2019d done in the past, she hadn\u2019t deserved to suffer as she clearly had. Especial y more than once. The fear in her eyes as she\u2019d spoken of being reborn into the same body...he never wanted to see it again.</p><p>And could he real y blame her for her hatred of him and his friends? A demon-possessed immortal had slain her family, her husband. Amun would have reacted the same way, lashing out at everyone responsible, even the slightest bit. At the time of Baden\u2019s death, Haidee had known only that the Lords were violent, crazed, capable of any dark deed. Of course she\u2019d sought to destroy them.</p><p>He\u2019d done the same to her. To her col eagues.</p><p>Now, as Amun looked back without any taint of guilt, fury or despair, he knew three things to be true.</p><p>Haidee had lost her family. He had lost a friend. He wasn\u2019t going to hate her for that loss anymore. Since she\u2019d fought her way into his bedroom, so sweetly caring for his wounds, the sentiment hadn\u2019t sat right with him, anyway. He\u2019d had to force the issue.</p><p>Now, he wanted al of her. He wouldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t, settle for less, his need to touch no longer about tiring of her or freeing himself of this obsession, but about gratifying her.</p><p>\u201cAmun,\u201d she rasped, and the sound of his name on those pleasure-giving lips nearly undid him.</p><p>\u201cYou...you stopped.</p><p>Why did you stop?\u201d</p><p>Amun. She\u2019d cal ed him Amun. He lifted his head and peered down at her. Her mouth was red, swol en and glistening with moisture. Her tongue flicked out to capture the lingering flavor of him. His shaft throbbed in response, desperate to feel the clench of her inner wal s.</p><p>Her hands rested on his shoulders, her nails already cutting. He was panting, sweating despite the cool breeze wafting from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>You always cal ed me \u201cbaby\u201d when you thought I was...</p><p>Micah. Just then, he had trouble even thinking the loathsome name. The scope of his understanding extended to Haidee and only Haidee. Besides being a Hunter, the bastard had held her, tasted her, and while Amun knew he was being irrational, he despised every man who\u2019d ever had this pleasure. His pleasure. Yet you cal me by my name, he finished darkly.</p><p>Her expression softened, il uminating the delicacy of her features. \u201cThe only person I\u2019ve ever cal ed baby is you.\u201d</p><p>Wel , okay, then. That was acceptable. He reclaimed her mouth in a rush. Their tongues rol ed together, taking, giving, their teeth scraping. Hands began roaming, every new touch increasing their fervency. He cupped her breasts, her nipples beading under his palm, and he moaned.</p><p>\u201cI wish they were bigger,\u201d she said between licks.</p><p>Her breasts? Why?</p><p>\u201cMen like bigger.\u201d</p><p>Someone had made her self-conscious, he realized, and he wanted to kil that someone. This man likes these. He squeezed. They were smal , as she\u2019d implied, but firm and wonderful y tipped. And they truly were the sweetest little morsels, as he had implied. They\u2019re perfect.</p><p>In fact...he whipped her shirt over her head and ripped the front clasp of her bra. The backpack would provide her with another one. As the material sagged apart, he caught a glimpse of nipples the prettiest shade of pink he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>You\u2019re so beautiful. He sounded drugged, didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cTh-thank you.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head and sucked one of the little pearls harder than he\u2019d intended. A gasp escaped her, but she didn\u2019t push him away. No, she tangled her fingers in his hair and held him against her.</p><p>He switched his attention from one to the other, laving them equal y until goose bumps broke out over her skin. Until her bel y quivered in anticipation every time he moved. Until breathy groans were fal ing from her lips, interwoven with his name, with pleas for mercy\u2014for more.</p><p>Amun hadn\u2019t had a lover in a very long time, but he hadn\u2019t forgotten the basics, and he\u2019d never been so driven by instinct. Touch, taste, possess, own. He could have been a virgin, and he would have found a way to please this woman, because making her come wasn\u2019t simply a desire.</p><p>Making her come was a necessity.</p><p>Her pleasure was his pleasure, and that\u2019s just the way it was.</p><p>Touch...taste...yes, taste. He straightened, meshing their lips. He had to taste her again.</p><p>He wanted to go slowly, to savor every inch of her. To learn what she liked, what she didn\u2019t. But just as before, with a single kiss and a few caresses, the passion between them went nuclear. Those roaming hands clutched, nails scraped. He rubbed his erection between her legs, and she arched into every slide.</p><p>After everything she\u2019d told him, he felt as if he could lose her at any moment. As if someone would take her from him, and she would wake up in that cave in Greece, unable to remember him or this kiss.</p><p>They were both shirtless, and when her breasts brushed his chest, he hissed out a breath. The kiss never slowed, their tongues continual y rol ing, seeking, demanding.</p><p>Possess...own... He cupped her ass and slammed her against him, the rubbing becoming a frantic seeking. A fever.</p><p>No, not a fever. His blood was on fire, true, racing through his veins with a swiftness that would have kil ed a lesser man, but the woman he held was becoming colder with every second that passed. Her skin was like ice, her mouth the storm, and as he sucked on her tongue, that icy storm fil ed him.</p><p>The demons had been hiding in the back of his mind, afraid to make themselves known. Now they shrieked, her touch affecting them as if they\u2019d just been hooked to an electric generator. Each one\u2014and gods, there were hundreds\u2014</p><p>scrambled through his head, doing their best to avoid the renewing of Haidee\u2019s pul ...the unavoidable cold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Final y the kiss slowed...slowed...and then Haidee leaned back. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Soft knuckles stroked his cheek.</p><p>Just need...a moment... Amun closed his eyes and settled on his haunches, inhaling unhurriedly, exhaling with care.</p><p>Every muscle in his body was locked in a desperate tug-of-war with his bones, lancing thousands of aches through every part of him. Al at the same time. From the demons, yes, but also from unfulfil ed desire. He hadn\u2019t been ready to stop.</p> <p>\u201cMy internal thermometer gets the better of me sometimes.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean for it to\u2014I could feel it... I\u2019m sorry,\u201d</p><p>she said again, a trace of misery in her tone. \u201cI\u2019l control it, I promise.\u201d</p><p>No apologies, he told her. You did nothing wrong. Besides, I like it.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure why the demons were calmed by her one moment, then roused by her the next. He wasn\u2019t sure how she pul ed on them or why they reacted that way, but he would puzzle over the answer later. With the distance between him and Haidee\u2014minute though it was\u2014the heat returned to him and the demons ceased fighting so stringently. For the moment, that was enough.</p> <p>Secrets, though, had remained unaffected throughout the entire ordeal. Amun didn\u2019t think his soul-companion had liked the change in temperature, but the beast hadn\u2019t been</p><p>\u2014and stil wasn\u2019t, because yes, Amun planned to have another go at his woman\u2014screeching in fear. His woman.</p><p>The phrase delighted him in a way he never would have expected. But she was. His. In every way that mattered\u2014</p><p>and soon in every way imaginable. His friends wouldn\u2019t understand. Might even hate him, might consider him a traitor. He couldn\u2019t make himself care. Just then, her wel -</p><p>being came before his own.</p><p>The change in his mind-set was radical, even to him, and he wasn\u2019t quite used to it yet. That didn\u2019t lessen the impact, though. He\u2019d held her in his lap, listened to her story of loss, had heard the heartbreak in her voice, and something inside him had broken. He\u2019d begun to comprehend the truth. They were alike in so many ways. Determined, constantly bombarded by the worst the world had to offer\u2014</p> <p>people, places, circumstances\u2014yet finding joy where they could.</p><p>He wanted this woman. Would have her. And yeah, maybe he was driven purely by desire right now, convincing himself of feelings he wouldn\u2019t normal y entertain to ease the shame of being with the enemy, but he didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s best that we stopped,\u201d she whispered on a trembling breath. \u201cI\u2014I stil can\u2019t sleep with you.\u201d</p><p>Amun\u2019s eyelids sprang open, and he knew flickers of firelight showcased the dark menace in his eyes.</p><p>Because of him? he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes. I won\u2019t cheat.\u201d</p><p>He popped his jaw. When did you last sleep with him? With every new word, there had been an increase of rage in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. Not once.\u201d</p> <p>The rage vanished in a blink. Had she said yesterday, he would have wanted her stil \u2014he doubted anything could change that\u2014but knowing Micah hadn\u2019t touched her in that way stoked his new sense of possession. When you dated him, you thought he was me, he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Amun gripped her hips, urged her forward and rubbed against her. Then you are cheating on me by staying true to him.</p><p>She moaned, her eyelids drifting to half-mast. When he forced her to steady, she nibbled on her bottom lip, white teeth sinking deep. \u201cMaybe I am, but there\u2019s stil a note of dishonesty there. So, no sex. Not until I tel him we\u2019re over.</p><p>But...\u201d</p><p>But Amun could kiss her, she was saying. The rage returned ful -force. Kissing is a form of cheating, Haidee.</p><p>He knew how he would react if he caught her kissing another man. Blood would flow.</p><p>Her shoulders sagged, her expression suddenly tortured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. I know you\u2019re right. You just make me so...hot. We\u2019l stop, then. For good.</p><p>Until\u2014just until.\u201d</p><p>Break up with him in your mind. Now.</p><p>\u201cIn my heart and in my mind, he and I are done already. But I have to tel him, Amun. He deserves to know. I know you won\u2019t believe me, but he\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>Amun had just realized he would do anything to protect this woman, even give up life as he knew it, simply to be with her. Yet she couldn\u2019t let go of an old boyfriend for him. Not completely. While part of him admired such loyalty, the other part wanted that loyalty directed only at himself.</p><p>No sex, she\u2019d said, and now, because of what he\u2019d said, no kissing, either. Wel , then, by the gods, he would do everything else. Scowling, he caught her by the back of her knees and jerked, tossing her to her back. She landed on the flower petals, their softness cushioning the blow. Before she could suck in a breath, he was atop her, shoving her legs apart and fitting himself against her.</p><p>Don\u2019t cheat me, Haidee. Don\u2019t cheat me. Please.</p><p>She groaned, as if in pain, and then she settled. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014</p><p>maybe I\u2019m a terrible person, but I need you to kiss me.</p><p>Please.\u201d</p><p>Not terrible. Perfect. In that moment, he found he could deny her nothing. So, kiss her? Yes, even though he\u2019d thought to balance the scale. Their mouths met in a frenzied tangle, licking, sucking, biting.</p><p>As promised, she kept her temperature under control. Stil cold, but never freezing.</p><p>How she did so, he didn\u2019t know. And he didn\u2019t like that she couldn\u2019t let go completely, that she had to remain guarded.</p><p>When this was over, he vowed, when he\u2019d gotten rid of the demons inside him, he would have her. Al of her. The cold and every inch of her luscious body. Even her heart. He would shield his own, of course\u2014wanting her, needing her, that was fine, but he would be owned by no one\u2014but by gods, he absolutely would have hers.</p><p>He unsnapped her jeans and kicked them down her legs...</p><p>off. She didn\u2019t protest, didn\u2019t try to stop him. She trusted him not to cross the line she had drawn. Again he found himself torn, liking that she trusted him, hating that she didn\u2019t crave more from him despite everything against them, as he did. Hating that she had him addicted to her, but didn\u2019t seem to be addicted to him.</p><p>Wel , he would just have to change that.</p><p>Amun kissed and nibbled his way to her breasts and once again laved her nipples. When she was writhing, hips lifting, greedy for a touch, any touch, he worked his way to her navel. There, he tormented her with fleeting, gentle bites while his fingers toyed with the band of her panties, at her waist, around her thighs, but never stroking where she needed him most.</p><p>\u201cAmun...baby...please.\u201d</p><p>Begging now. Good, that was good. What he\u2019d wanted.</p><p>Yet, his body ached with such unfulfil ed desire, he wasn\u2019t sure he would live through this encounter.</p><p>Sweat beaded on his brow, his skin pul ed taut and consuming need blistered him inside and out.</p><p>I\u2019m going to taste you again. Take you to the end this time.</p><p>Final y he kissed her between her legs, flicking his tongue against the damp fabric of her panties.</p><p>Her hips shot up, and she cried out uninhibitedly. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re going to give me everything.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2014no.\u201d She undulated, seeking more of his mouth. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I know. But soon.</p><p>\u201cSoon. Yes, soon.\u201d</p><p>With that promise ringing in his ears, he ripped the material away and feasted on her. At the first true glide of his tongue, she screamed with absolute abandon. He tasted her femininity and those frosted apricots he\u2019d scented the night they met. He\u2019d thought himself on fire before, but this...this burned him alive.</p><p>His cock fil ed to the point of bursting, and he ground himself into the hard floor, pumping as if he were already inside his woman. She tugged at his hair, not to pul him away but to urge him on.</p><p>He licked inside her, feeling those tight wal s close around his tongue. He sucked and swal owed, laved and flicked at her clitoris. Soon she wasn\u2019t just writhing, she was making love to his mouth, moving against him, legs finding their way to his shoulders, heels digging into his back.</p><p>Hands over your head, he commanded, and he was immensely glad he could speak into her mind, that he didn\u2019t have to stop what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cWh-why?\u201d</p><p>Do it.</p><p>Hesitantly she released him and drew her arms high.</p><p>Clasp the rock behind you.</p><p>This time she obeyed without question.</p><p>Don\u2019t let go. He grabbed her thighs, lifted, and twisted her so that she faced the ground. Twisted himself, too, ramming himself beneath her, but stil between her legs.</p><p>Her body fel back on him, her core directly over his face.</p><p>Her grip on the rock kept her from smashing face-first into the petals, but didn\u2019t save her from the increase of pressure his mouth caused as his tongue sank deeper than before.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Amun!\u201d Tremors rocked her, vibrating into him.</p><p>So wet. So perfect.</p><p>\u201cAmun. Please, more, need, want.\u201d</p><p>With one hand, he clasped her hip. With the other, he stroked his cock. And as he worked her, he worked himself, pretending they were making love. She pumped against him, up and down, her essence al over his face, and he matched her with the movement of his hand.</p><p>So damned good. Had he ever experienced something this good? Impossible.</p><p>\u201cHurry! Have to...almost...need...\u201d</p><p>Him. She only needed him. He released her hip and reached under her, never ceasing his carnal attentions. On either of them. Feverish, he impaled her with two fingers.</p><p>Tight. She was so tight. And as he slammed those fingers deep, so deep, she convulsed around him, pul ing him even deeper.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d she shouted, the climax razing her voice as every muscle she possessed clamped down, trying to hold him inside.</p><p>Feeling her spasm around him sent him over the edge. He erupted, hot seed jetting onto his stomach.</p><p>And when the last of the shudders left her, when the last drop of come was squeezed from him, she rose on her knees, panting, severing that intimate contact. They moaned in unison at the loss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She scooted down his chest and col apsed atop him.</p><p>Though his first thought was to clean them both, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to move her.

She was his.</p> <p>Now...always.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>FOR HOURS, HAIDEE AND AMUN alternated between sleeping, eating, kissing and talking, careful not to mention their pasts, their circumstances or their future. They were just a man and a woman, their hands never far from each other. Through it al , Haidee remained in a state of bliss, joyful in a way she knew she couldn\u2019t afford.</p><p>For her, joy never lasted.</p><p>This joyful stretch ended when Amun released her to build a campfire\u2014and didn\u2019t return to her side. He fiddled with the backpack, then pul ed out two robes, his motions rigid.</p> <p>Angel robes, he said (just as rigidly). Without looking back at her, he placed the white one at her side.</p><p>The material wil clean you. It\u2019l even untangle your hair when you lift the hood.</p><p>A simple robe could do al that? Wow. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Welcome, he said as he tugged the material over his head.</p><p>And damn if the dirt smudges on the back of his neck didn\u2019t disappear. Now, we do what needs doing.</p><p>\u201cYou mean, now we play the quiet game?\u201d</p> <p>Among other things.</p><p>This formality...how she hated it.</p><p>He had given her the sweetest, most agonizing orgasm of her life, playing her body in a way that conquered al doubt, al inhibition. Passion had fil ed her so inexorably, she hadn\u2019t been able to hold it al inside. She had erupted, barely managing to temper the ice. Her body was now so hyperaware of this man that the ache, the need for him, never left her. Constantly her stomach quivered and her skin tingled.</p><p>His name might not be tattooed on her arm, but she was nonetheless branded by him.</p><p>While they\u2019d touched, there\u2019d been no hesitation on his part. That had astonished her. He hadn\u2019t withheld pleasure, hadn\u2019t whisked her to the brink and walked away, leaving her empty, hol owed. Even though he\u2019d been angry with her.</p><p>No, he\u2019d been almost...reverent as he\u2019d caressed her, as if they were lovers in every sense of the word rather than enemies.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be his enemy. Not now, not ever again.</p><p>But she could think of no way to repair the damage she\u2019d done to him. He hadn\u2019t kil ed her family, another demon had. He wasn\u2019t the one who had kil ed her husband, she was almost positive of that.</p> <p>Another demon must have.</p><p>Probably one of his friends. Stil , it was Amun she had punished, taking someone he loved from him.</p><p>She hated herself for that. Wished she could go back.</p><p>Wished she had never walked into her husband\u2019s bedroom that fateful night. The night everything had changed for her.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t and she had, and she hoped that maybe, just maybe, she could make Amun understand the pain she had experienced. That wouldn\u2019t be enough to earn his forgiveness, but perhaps it would offer an absolution she wouldn\u2019t find otherwise.</p><p>Sighing, Haidee donned the robe. Only a few seconds later, she realized Amun hadn\u2019t done the thing justice. A bar of soap hadn\u2019t touched her, but as the material settled over her, she\u2019d never felt cleaner.</p><p>Amazing!</p><p>Her gaze returned to him. He was peering into the flames.</p><p>He should have looked like a monk, but even draped by the shapeless cloth as he was, he looked wicked and sensual and so damn powerful.</p><p>He\u2019d mental y distanced himself, but she didn\u2019t let that stop her. She settled in front of him, trying not to tremble. He didn\u2019t spare her a glance, but reached inside the backpack and withdrew an apricot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to do something for me,\u201d she said. \u201cThink of it as an extension of the quiet game.\u201d</p><p>He had been in the process of biting into the fruit. His hand stil ed and at last he faced her, his dark eyes wary. Can it wait? We\u2019ve been here too long. We need to leave.</p><p>Suddenly he was in a hurry? Hardly. \u201cNo. We have to do this now.\u201d If they waited, she might lose her nerve.</p><p>He nodded stiffly. Very wel .</p><p>Haidee squared her shoulders and lifted her chin. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen a smal piece of my wedding night. Wil you...wil you now watch the rest?\u201d</p><p>His wariness intensified, and it was almost painful to see. I can\u2019t control what secrets the demon shows me, Haidee.</p><p>\u201cBut you can try.\u201d He had to try.</p><p>I don\u2019t think you\u2019re understanding me. To show you anything, I would have to use my demon.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do understand that. I\u2019d stil like you to try.\u201d</p><p>He studied her. May I ask why?</p><p>So polite, when he stil clearly wanted no part of this. Did he fear she planned to show him a time she\u2019d spent in another man\u2019s bed? Did he think she planned to punish him for being what he was? \u201cYou can ask, but I won\u2019t tel you.\u201d She didn\u2019t want him refusing, and he would if he knew the truth going in.</p><p>Probably not a smart move on her part, though. He would have to trust her. Blind trust, at that.</p><p>Something a Lord could never give a Hunter.</p><p>A sigh wafted through her mind. Al right. I wil try.</p><p>The acquiescence surprised her, and for some reason, that surprise seemed to irritate him.</p><p>Are you ready? he snapped.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No. Butterflies danced through her stomach. \u201cYes,\u201d</p><p>she repeated for her own benefit.</p><p>Motions stiff, Amun set the juicy apricot aside and fit his strong, cal used hands against her temples. As always, he was as warm and welcome as a summer day. But now that she\u2019d had those big hands on her breasts, between her legs, inside her, having them placed so innocently was the most decadent of tortures.</p><p>She wiggled to get closer to him, settling only when their knees were touching, his wild scent surrounding her. If he did indeed tap into her memory, he would see one of the most painful experiences of her too-long life. A recol ection that never failed to tear her up and leave her broken heart bleeding. She would need his strength.</p><p>Concentrate on your breathing, he said, and she jumped at the gentle intrusion in her mind. And close your eyes.</p><p>Every friend she had would have cal ed her stupid for trusting a demon like she was about to do, but she didn\u2019t care. Amun had given her the necessary blind trust, she could do no less. Her eyelids fluttered closed, hiding the features she\u2019d come to crave, and she drew in a large quantity of oxygen. Slowly she released every molecule.</p><p>Good girl.</p><p>On her next inhalation, she felt tendrils of something...warm and dark drifting through her, rattling her mind as the wind often rattled the leaves on trees. She had experienced this before, but she\u2019d been drugged, lethargic, and unaware of what that warmth and darkness represented. Now she knew\u2014and tried not to panic.</p><p>She had asked for this. She wanted this.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t stay calm for long.</p><p>Demon, she thought wildly. Her heart crashed into her ribs, threatening to burst from her chest.</p><p>Blindly she reached up and wrapped her fingers around the solid warmth of Amun\u2019s wrists. In and out she continued to breathe. She held on as tightly as she could, not to push him away, but to remind herself that he was with her. That he wouldn\u2019t let his beastly half hurt her.</p><p>And, to be honest, the demon had never real y tried.</p><p>Actual y, the demon had helped her, revealing her sister\u2019s beautiful face, showing her the joyous minutes before her husband\u2019s death. Why had the creature done that? Why had it shown her good things?</p><p>Weren\u2019t evil beings supposed to focus on the bad?</p><p>Though she couldn\u2019t fathom the answers, she relaxed. And as the rigidity melted from her spine, colorful images began to flash through her mind.</p><p>Once again she saw her little sister\u2019s cherubic face, smiling back at her as they raced through a lush meadow. Innocent, carefree giggles echoed between them, and for a moment, only a moment, the cold completely washed from Haidee\u2019s body, leaving her drenched in radiant heat.</p><p>The image shifted\u2014come back! she mental y shouted, not yet ready to be separated from her sister again. But then she saw the adult version of herself standing on that long-ago veranda, lavender wedding gown draping her slender frame, her golden curls practical y glowing in the moonlight.</p><p>This was it. What she wanted to show Amun\u2014what she dreaded showing Amun.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous, my sweet?\u201d her former servant said, pul ing her back into the vision.</p><p>Haidee watched herself turn, heard herself reply to Leora. A conversation fol owed, dragging into eternity. When would they quiet? When would they\u2014?</p><p>The old woman pivoted on her sandaled heel and led Haidee inside a torch-lit hal way. Toward the master\u2019s bedchamber.</p><p>This was it, she thought again. Haidee\u2019s grip tightened on Amun, tremors rocking her. Just as before, the arching doorway loomed closer...closer stil ...only this time, she didn\u2019t try to stop herself.</p><p>Closer...</p><p>As Leora slowed, she smiled over her shoulder. Final y they reached the door, and the servant stepped aside.</p><p>Haidee wanted to vomit as she saw herself reach out. Saw her fingers curl around the edge of the curtain and move the material aside. Her shoulders squared as she stepped inside the chamber, the curtain fal ing back into place behind her.</p><p>At first, the Haidee in the vision couldn\u2019t make sense of what she was seeing. But the smel , oh, God, the smel ...</p><p>metal ic, coppery...mixed with the stench of emptied bowels. She knew that smel very wel : death.</p><p>Once white wal s were splattered with crimson. On the floor, her husband lay in pieces. Hysteria bubbled inside her as she spun. The carnage\u2014there was no escaping it. Solon...</p><p>a piece here, a piece there, a piece everywhere. The words fil ed her mind, her encroaching madness making them a song. Her knees knocked together, and dizziness nearly drowned her. Frigid breath sawed in and out of her nose, uncontrol able now.</p><p>Then she saw something far worse than the carnage.</p><p>In the center of the room, the creature from her nightmares floated above a coagulated puddle of blood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just as before, the black hood was drawn over his face, shielding his features. But in the midst of the shadows, she could see the glowing red of his eyes.</p><p>Slowly he lifted one arm, a single gnarled finger extended in her direction. Rage pulsed from him, so much rage, enveloping her in malevolence. Hate fol owed. So much hate.</p><p>The eeriness of his presence jolted her out of her quiet horror, and she screamed. Screamed and screamed and screamed. She couldn\u2019t stop herself, even though each new wail scraped her throat raw.</p> <p>She pressed her palms over her ears. That didn\u2019t help. Stil the screaming ravaged her.</p><p>The creature floated toward her, and she at last quieted. So close...almost upon her...she scrambled backward until she hit the wal . Just before he reached her, several black-clad men stormed from the terrace and into the room, their weapons raised.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d one of the men cried.</p><p>\u201cHe was right! The demon\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>Demon? He? How had \u201che\u201d known?</p> <p>They pounded toward her nightmare, blades raised, ready to hack him into bits, just as he\u2019d done to her husband. Oh, God. Her husband. Maybe the creature hadn\u2019t kil ed him after al , because there were others just like him in the room, and now they exited the shadows, their eyes glowing bright red.</p><p>The creature disappeared before either the humans or the others could reach him.</p><p>Beside her, the curtain swished open. Haidee\u2019s knees gave out as Leora and the guards that Solon had ordered to remain nearby stormed inside. There were so many of them, and in their haste to discover what had happened, they failed to see her. She was kicked forward, Solon\u2019s blood soaking her beautiful gown.</p><p>The guards attacked the men from the terrace and the shadows, clearly blaming them al for their master\u2019s murder.</p><p>Metal whistled through air, swords clanged together, skin popped as it ripped and men grunted in pain.</p><p>Then another set of warriors flew into the room. They, too, came from the terrace. They must have scaled the side of the house. They were far bigger and more muscled than any of the others\u2014</p> <p>and their eyes glowed that same shade of evil-red as every one of Solon\u2019s possible kil ers.</p><p>\u201cMore demons!\u201d someone shouted.</p><p>\u201cThese must have fol owed us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunters,\u201d one of the new warriors growled, the word somehow echoing with a thousand other voices.</p><p>Each of them tormented. \u201cDie. Wil die.\u201d</p><p>A new battle began, this one a macabre dance of glinting silver and sharpened claws, and body after body fel around her. Even the aged, defenseless Leora was struck down, a dagger protruding from her chest. There were more grunts, many agonized moans and brutalized screams, each blending with the renewal of her own. She couldn\u2019t breathe, had to breathe. Had to escape.</p><p>More servants and guards rushed into the room, but they, too, quickly became victims of the bloody battle. Breathe, breathe. Haidee tried to scramble away, to hide, but the floor was so slippery, blocked by al the fal en, and she gained no ground. And then someone fisted the back of her robe and dragged her to her feet. Oh, God. This was it, the end.</p><p>In reality, Haidee braced herself, knowing what came next.</p> <p>She tried to distance herself from the scene, to pretend she was only watching a movie. That the people dying around her were actors, that their pain was faked.</p><p>That\u2019s when the scene slowed, and, through Amun and his demon, she was able to see things she\u2019d never noticed before. Suddenly, the players had names, faces she recognized. There was Strider\u2014Defeat\u2014lost to his demon and slashing at a Hunter. There was Lucien\u2014Death\u2014his mismatched eyes colder than the ice storm inside her.</p><p>She\u2019d seen pictures of him over the years, and knew he was now scarred. But he wasn\u2019t scarred as he fought with lethal menace, and his beauty was breathtaking. Or would have been, if someone else\u2019s blood hadn\u2019t dripped from his mouth. He\u2019d just ripped a man\u2019s throat out with his teeth.</p><p>Sabin, Kane, Cameo. Gideon, Paris, Maddox. Reyes.</p><p>Baden, his red hair actual y crackling with living flames.</p><p>Aeron, his black wings outstretched, the ends as sharp as daggers. Al but Torin and Amun were there.</p><p>No, not true, she realized as her gaze caught on the man who had grabbed her robe.</p><p>Amun. Amun held her.</p><p>So dark, wild in a way she had never seen him before. His eyes, like twin rubies plucked from the fires of hel . His lips, etched into a permanent scowl. His teeth, sharp and white and almost...monstrous. His cheekbones were sliced open, bone revealed.</p><p>He had one arm anchored around her waist, preventing her from bolting. Not that she could have. Her muscles were paralyzed with fear. Even as a Hunter leapt toward them, sword raised.</p><p>Amun swung her behind him\u2014and a sword that had been arcing toward him cut her from one side of her throat to the other. A scream of agony gurgled from her as her legs gave out. But she didn\u2019t drop to the floor; Amun stil held her. He turned then, and the real Haidee registered the glint of shock that suddenly consumed his features as he saw what had happened to her.</p><p>She\u2019d always thought the man holding her had used her as a human shield, but just then, she realized he\u2019d tried to save her. Even then. Even lost to his demon.</p><p>In the vision, she sagged from his now-loosened grip, her world going dark.</p><p>That was the first time she died.</p><p>But even then, the vision didn\u2019t fade. Amun\u2019s memory must have picked up where hers had left off, because the fight continued around her lifeless body. She watched as an enraged Amun stepped over her and ripped into the man who had kil ed her, tearing him from limb to limb, just as Solon had been torn.</p><p>Amun made sure the rending hurt. The Hunter screamed with every new slice, horrified pleas for mercy.</p><p>But mercy wasn\u2019t something anyone in that room would experience.</p><p>And because Amun was distracted by his task, another Hunter managed to sneak up on him and make a play for his head.</p><p>Fast as he dodged, the blade merely cut into his neck, nicking him. With a roar, he spun around, arm rising to bat the offender away. The Hunter had already repositioned himself, however, and slashed once again. This time, the blade struck true, hitting spine, and Amun\u2019s throat opened up al the way.</p><p>Blood poured, and he col apsed, his body beside hers.</p><p>They were facing each other, and his blood mingled with hers, pooling between them, soaking into their wounds.</p><p>Binding them, from that moment on?</p><p>Seeing their friend down, the other Lords became al the more enraged\u2014and al the more vicious. The remaining Hunters and guards were soon fel ed in the most savage massacre she\u2019d ever witnessed. And when it was over, the warriors panting, sweating, but far from calm, they gathered Amun and dragged him from the chamber, the home.</p><p>Final y the vision faded and Haidee\u2019s mind catapulted back to the present. She was stil seated in front of Amun, but ice had crystal ized over her skin. Either he hadn\u2019t noticed, or hadn\u2019t cared, because his hands were stil flattened against her temples, the only bit of heat she felt.</p><p>With a moan, he severed contact, tiny ice crystals flying in every direction. His expression was tormented, and his eyes sparkled with red. Strangely, seeing the red didn\u2019t scare her. Even with the memory of what had happened so long ago stil playing through her head.</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry, Haidee. So sorry. His voice was as tormented as his expression.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The single word scraped her raw throat, her voice hoarse and broken. Had she screamed during the vision and just hadn\u2019t realized it? \u201cYou did nothing wrong.\u201d She knew that now. Was amazed by it. He\u2019d done everything right.</p><p>The Hunters must have been chasing the other demon. And I don\u2019t know if the robed creature kil ed your husband or if it was one of the Lords who reached the bedroom first. Al I know is that I was part of the group that arrived last. I wasn\u2019t trying to hurt you, he rushed out. I swear to the gods I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI know. Now.\u201d Just as she knew he had almost died for her, avenging a veritable stranger. God, she\u2019d wanted to absolve herself with the memory. She\u2019d only managed to weaken her case.</p><p>She had destroyed this man for nothing. For nothing!</p><p>I never saw your face that night. I saw a frightened female and tried to move her\u2014you\u2014from the battle.</p><p>But I put you in the middle of it instead. You wouldn\u2019t have died if I\u2019d left you on the floor.</p><p>He would not feel guilty about that. She wouldn\u2019t let him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what would have happened to me, Amun.</p><p>You can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t try to make me feel better. Don\u2019t try to comfort me.</p><p>Gods, I don\u2019t deserve it. Don\u2019t even deserve to be here with you. You, helping me. Me. The man who placed you in the path of a blade. A bitter laugh left him as he flexed and unflexed his hands. Al these centuries, I\u2019ve never understood why the others al owed themselves to be fil ed with remorse over actions they hadn\u2019t been able to control.</p><p>Meanwhile, I\u2019m the worst offender of the lot. Because of me, you died. Because of me, you came after Baden.</p><p>That was not the reaction she\u2019d expected or wanted.</p><p>\u201cAmun, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He tore his gaze from her and pushed to a stand. If you want me to summon the angel, I\u2019l find a way to do so. He can return you to your...friends. You don\u2019t have to do this.</p><p>Don\u2019t have to help me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you,\u201d she told him, angry now. \u201cAnd you saw for yourself that you weren\u2019t the one who kil ed me. You tried to save me. More than that, I blamed you when I\u2014\u201d</p><p>You blamed me, and rightly so! He swiped up the backpack, commanded it to provide clean clothes for both of them and then tossed her a shirt and jeans. The robes are good for the caves, but not for movement. You need to change. We\u2019re leaving.</p><p>\u201cListen to me. I wrongly blamed you and\u2014\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re done discussing this. Change. Now.</p><p>He\u2019d never, ever treated her like this, even when they\u2019d first discovered who the other was, and she had no idea how to reach him, how to make him understand. Shaking, Haidee removed the robe and tugged on the new clothing. \u201cWe\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>we can\u2019t leave yet.

With every second that passed, he seemed even more removed from her, and stil she didn\u2019t understand. She didn\u2019t blame him for what had happened, so why did he blame himself?</p><p>Because he\u2019d failed? Because he feared failing again?</p><p>\u201cAmun,\u201d she said, trying again to reach him. She had to reach him.</p><p>Come, he replied, striding from the cave, forcing her to fol ow or be left behind.</p><p>The scrol crinkled as she unwittingly tightened her grip. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you shut me out,\u201d she said, knowing he couldn\u2019t hear her but feeling better just saying the words.</p> <p>She forced herself to relax and trail after her man\u2014and he was her man, there was no question of that now\u2014as he headed into the unknown.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>VACATION SUCKED. Strider sat in the passenger seat of the caddy Wil iam had stolen, peering out at the barren landscape and waning sunlight. This was the road trip from hel .</p><p>After the debacle with the invisible girl, who just had to be Paris\u2019s obsession, Sienna, Paris had flipped his ever-loving lid and attacked Wil iam for not preventing the god king from leaving with her. It had taken al of Strider\u2019s strength\u2014and a dagger through his friend\u2019s broken heart\u2014</p><p>to defeat the hysterical warrior.</p><p>Afterward, bleeding and far from calm, Paris kicked Strider and Wil iam off his ranch, along with the strippers. But Paris had soon realized Sienna could escape Cronus again and return to him, and without Wil iam, he wouldn\u2019t be able to see her. So, the injured Paris had tracked them down and insisted on coming with them. Not a difficult task since they\u2019d merely hiked to the mailbox at the end of his driveway and decided to rest. For a few hours.</p> <p>Ambrosia hangovers sucked as much as vacations.</p><p>They\u2019d been on the open road for countless hours, and for most of those hours Paris had shouted for Cronus, issuing threats and general y annoying the hel out of everyone.</p><p>Final y, though, he\u2019d quieted and now slept fitful y in the back seat, blood loss having drained him. Just before fal ing asleep, he\u2019d vowed to cal Lucien and demand the keeper of Death flash him to the heavens when his injuries healed.</p><p>Paris was going hunting for his female.</p><p>That kind of obsessive desire for one specific woman wasn\u2019t smart, and Strider acknowledged that he himself had been speeding in that direction with Ex. Unlike Paris, he had wil ingly given the woman up, and suddenly, he was grateful. Had he continued down that path, he eventual y would have fought Amun for her.</p><p>Fighting a friend for a woman was the epitome of stupid.</p><p>Wrong on every level.</p><p>One, he valued his friendships. Two, no woman was worth the trouble she caused when he knew he would one day lose interest in her. Three, a Hunter real y wasn\u2019t worth the trouble she caused. Four, sex was sex. A man could get it anywhere, as proven by his time at Paris\u2019s ranch.</p> <p>He sighed and concentrated on the shitty scenery. Trees.</p><p>Rol ing hil s. And\u2014oh, hel s yeah. A convenience store, dead ahead.</p><p>\u201cPul over,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wil iam flicked him a now\u2019s-not-the-time-to-joke glance. \u201cWe just got a little peace and quiet and you want to ruin it al just to piss? You\u2019re such a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed Hots, dude.\u201d He\u2019d ruin anything for a mouthful of those.</p><p>\u201cNow pul the fuck over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gummy Bears. You should have said so.\u201d</p><p>The car merged right, hit the service road and final y halted abruptly in front of the twenty-four-hour shop. Burly truckers hustled in and out, as wel as families traveling the countryside.</p><p>Wil iam jerked a thumb toward the backseat. \u201cWhat about sleeping beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not gonna kil himself while we\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any self-preservation instincts?\u201d Ice-blue eyes glittered with sardonic humor. \u201cI meant, what if he wakes up, steals our car and abandons us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy. We steal a truck and play chase. I\u2019ve always wanted to drive a big rig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like where your head\u2019s at, Stridey-Man. Maybe we\u2019l do that anyway.\u201d</p><p>Out of habit, Strider performed a perimeter check before exiting. During the drive, when he hadn\u2019t been lost in thought, he\u2019d been watching for a tail. So far, so good. Not once had he spied anything suspicious.</p><p>To be honest, that was kind of disappointing. He\u2019d expected Haidee\u2019s boyfriend to come after him. Shit, the guy had sworn to spil Strider\u2019s guts and remove each of his limbs. Oh, wel .</p><p>He and Wil iam entered the store side by side, then split up.</p><p>They stil wore their swim trunks, but they also wore T-shirts and flip-flops, so they weren\u2019t total y inappropriate as they strutted down the isles, grabbing what they wanted. Stil .</p><p>People stared. Maybe because they were giants compared to everyone else, both in height and muscle mass. Maybe because of the tel tale bulge of weapons at their waists. Or maybe because Wil iam opened a bag of Doritos and ate while he shopped. Hard to tel .</p><p>\u201cYou see any Gummy Bears?\u201d Wil iam cal ed.</p><p>Strider balanced five boxes of Red Hots and five boxes of Hot Tamales in the cradle of one arm as he scanned the racks. \u201cNope. Sorry.\u201d He grabbed a few Twinkies for Paris and threw them on top of his pile. They weren\u2019t fried, but hel . Women ate sweets when they were nursing broken hearts, and Paris was definitely acting like a woman. Guy would be grateful for anything.</p><p>Strider was snickering to himself as he mixed a suicide at the soda fountain. Paris, acting like a woman.</p><p>What was new about that? When the fizzing liquid reached the rim, he popped the lid and straw in place.</p><p>Hard to do one-handed, but he managed it. He sipped. Nice.</p><p>Behind him, gasps resonated. He whipped around, expecting trouble with Wil iam\u2014only to spy a scowling Lucien with his hand resting on the shoulder of a stunning redhead. She was a tiny little thing, only reaching his shoulder, but damn was she curved. Her breasts strained the lacy tank. Her waist flared around low-rise jeans. Real y low-rise. So low it was obvious she wasn\u2019t wearing any panties. She couldn\u2019t be. Her legs were lean and long enough to lock around his back.</p><p>He wanted to curse.</p><p>\u201cKaia?\u201d Strider blinked, certain this was only a nightmare. A Harpy, the deadliest race on the planet.</p><p>Here. Stinking up his vacation even more. And he\u2019d thought the night couldn\u2019t get any worse.</p><p>\u201cOh, yummy. A Big Gulp.\u201d She closed what little distance there was between them and jerked the cup from his kung fu grip. Then, without waiting for his permission, she slurped the contents. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Not a chal enge, not a damn chal enge, he told his demon.</p><p>Stil . Defeat perked up inside his head. Thank the gods the beast didn\u2019t urge him to act. Yet.</p><p>Kaia\u2019s features wrinkled with distaste. \u201cYuck! What is this stuff? Battery acid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little of every kind of soda they\u2019ve got,\u201d he gritted, reaching out his free hand and waving his fingers. \u201cNow give it back and tel me what you\u2019re doing here.\u201d</p><p>Her sensuous lips pul ed back from her teeth as she hissed, her gray-gold eyes flickering with incandescent striations of silver and deep, dark lines of black. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a chal enge, he mental y shouted.</p><p>Defeat practical y twitched against his skul , a wee bit agitated but stil not insisting Strider do anything.</p><p>He al owed his arm to fal to his side. Harpies could only eat what they stole or earned, everything else made them sick, so he knew she had to take what she could, when she could. He also knew Harpies were as possessive about their stuff as he was, and Kaia now considered the drink hers. But if she pushed any more, his demon would want him to do something. Strider knew it, felt it. Yet there was no damn way he could chal enge a Harpy in front of humans. That was something better done in private\u2014where he could have his ass handed to him without being humiliated in front of others.</p><p>\u201cI asked once, but I\u2019l do it again. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He switched his focus to Lucien before she could reply.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing here?\u201d</p><p>Lucien met his stare and gave a pitying sigh. \u201cShe was bored, so she cal ed me and asked me to take her to you, and because I like my testicles where they are, I decided to indulge her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake her to me?\u201d Strider thumped his chest to make sure Lucien and Kaia understood who \u201cme\u201d was.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>Neither responded to his question.</p><p>\u201cMy friend, I wish you a good night. She\u2019s your pain in the ass now,\u201d Lucien said, and after saluting Strider with the same irreverent pinky wave Anya was fond of giving, he strode out of the store to find a nice, deserted corner outside where he could disappear without witnesses.</p><p>Strider returned his attention to Kaia. She fluttered her lashes at him, al innocence and feminine wiles. If he hadn\u2019t sparred with her a few times in the past, if he hadn\u2019t known exactly how dirty she fought, going for the groin at every opportunity, he might have believed the act. Even knowing, he had a hard time convincing himself of her extraordinary ability to deceive.</p><p>She was here for a reason, and he wasn\u2019t going to like it.</p><p>His only consolation was that he liked looking at her. Truly, if the gods had asked him to design a female, Kaia would have been it. She had a deceptively delicate bone structure and long red hair that curled to her waist. She had the face of a wicked pixie, the fangs of a pissed off snake and the body of a porn star, minus the implants. And her skin, oh, gods, her skin.</p><p>Al Harpies possessed skin like hers. Like polished opals and crushed diamonds, glinting with al the colors of the rainbow. They had to cover every visible inch with cosmetics and clothing because men became slobbering fools whenever they saw that skin. Strider had caught a glimpse only once\u2014during one of their practice sessions, her shirt had ridden up to her navel\u2014and he\u2019d instantly lost control of his body. He\u2019d become consumed by the need to penetrate her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d covered herself before he had attacked, and the urge had passed. Eventual y. Even then, remembering, he wanted to strip her, take her.</p><p>No way. No way in hel . She might be the loveliest female he\u2019d ever beheld, but she would be more trouble than a Hunter. She was a consummate liar and an unrepentant thief. She kil ed indiscriminately, and wel , she was stronger than him. Talk about embarrassing!</p><p>Plus, the first time she had visited her sister Gwen at the fortress, Strider had noticed several of the warriors eyeing her as if she were a lol ipop. She hadn\u2019t seemed to notice or care, and he hadn\u2019t wanted to compete for her affections. He\u2019d made the right decision, too.</p> <p>He stil couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d slept with Paris.</p><p>Paris. Ah, okay. Her need to find \u201cStrider\u201d was beginning to make a little sense. He was with Paris, so what better way to spend time with the warrior without admitting what she real y wanted?</p><p>That didn\u2019t bother Strider, but damn it al to hel , he didn\u2019t like being used. \u201cIf you\u2019re here to win Paris\u2019s everlasting love, you\u2019ve already failed. He now knows beyond any doubt that Sienna is stil out there, and he\u2019s desperate to reach her. You\u2019re not going to make him jealous by cuddling up to me and you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWil you just shut up?\u201d Kaia snatched a box of Red Hots and popped open the lid.</p><p>He snatched it back before she could eat a single one, and Defeat purred with satisfaction.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he snapped. Enough was enough.</p><p>Rather than attack him, she merely anchored her free hand on her perfectly shaped hips. \u201cLookit. I didn\u2019t want to kick things off this way, but you\u2019re being an asshat. So here it is.</p><p>Paris was a one-time thing and not just because he can\u2019t ever come back for seconds. Yeah, he gave me about a bazil ion orgasms, but afterward I didn\u2019t like how I felt and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking\u2014never mind.\u201d She was scowling as she shook her head. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that I\u2019m not here to see him.</p><p>I wanted to see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaia, darling,\u201d Wil iam said, nearly leaping over a stand of beef jerky in his haste to reach her.</p> <p>Strider frowned, but he wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>As Wil iam pul ed her close for a hug, the bastard grinned with utter delight, as if Kaia was just the thing he\u2019d needed to relieve an eternity of boredom. \u201cAre you here to fight the strippers who just enjoyed hours of my company?\u201d He patted her ass in approval.</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d she said, tossing her glorious mane of hair over her shoulder with a single flip of her wrist. \u201cI\u2019m here to thank them for keeping you occupied. Please tel me they\u2019re stil with you.\u201d</p><p>Wil iam pretended to wipe away a tear. \u201cKnife through the heart, my sweet. Knife through the heart.\u201d</p><p>Gods, they were annoying. Wil iam had been trying to get into Kaia\u2019s pants for months. She, of course, liked to string him along.</p><p>Which was another reason Strider would never make a play for her.</p><p>Kaia would chal enge him more than most, and she wouldn\u2019t care if he lost. Hel , she would want him to lose, even though the loss would bring him days of physical agony. Her sense of rivalry was just as highly developed as his own.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on vacation, Kaia,\u201d Strider grumbled. \u201cYou weren\u2019t invited.\u201d</p> <p>She waved away his words as if they were unimportant.</p><p>\u201cDeep down I knew you meant to invite me, so ta-da. Here I am. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s scary how wel you know us. Here, pay for this,\u201d Wil iam said, dumping his candy into Strider\u2019s arms. \u201cWe\u2019l be in the car. Making out.\u201d</p><p>At first, Kaia remained in place, watching Strider. Whatever she wanted from him, he must not have given to her, because she blew him a kiss and al owed the black-haired warrior to lead her off. Not even trying to hide her actions, she stuffed a Twinkie in the back pocket of her jeans and grabbed a couple magazines before stepping outside.</p><p>Strider\u2019s jaw ached from the grind of his teeth as he strode to the register. For some reason, people moved out of his way as quickly as possible. Even the ones standing in line, waiting their turn.</p><p>\u201cUh, I wouldn\u2019t bring this up, except I kinda have to and everything,\u201d the overweight cashier began nervously, \u201csince it\u2019s on camera and my boss, like, watches the film sometimes, but, uh, the little lady took a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Just add it al up.\u201d After he paid, he stomped outside, the bag fil ed with candy slapping his thigh with every step. The cool night air failed to dampen his sudden black mood. At least you\u2019re not thinking about Ex now.</p><p>Hardly a silver lining. And one that didn\u2019t last. He\u2019d maybe, big maybe, exaggerated his attraction to Ex.</p><p>If he\u2019d real y wanted her, he wouldn\u2019t have slept with someone else earlier today. He would have fought for her affections now rather than eventual y, no matter how foolish fighting your friends over a woman was.</p><p>Look at Paris. Guy needed sex to freaking survive, but he hadn\u2019t spent quality sheet time with any of those strippers.</p><p>That didn\u2019t lessen the sting of being rebuffed, though, and maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019d thought he wanted Ex so damn badly. Because she hadn\u2019t wanted him. Because she\u2019d been a\u2014what? A chal enge. A chal enge he claimed he hadn\u2019t wanted. And he didn\u2019t!</p><p>Damn it. No more chal enges. He was taking a break if it kil ed him.</p><p>He reached the car, saw that Kaia had stolen his seat in front and practical y ripped the back door from its hinges.</p><p>He climbed inside and settled beside the stil sleeping Paris. And what the fuck was that smel ? Cinnamon rol s?</p><p>He decided to take his irritation out on her. \u201cYou wearing perfume?\u201d he growled, kicking her stolen seat so she\u2019d know he was talking to her.</p><p>She twisted to peer back at him, a smile clinging to the edges of her I\u2019m-not-wearing-any-panties mouth.</p><p>He\u2019d known she wasn\u2019t wearing any, the little teaser, but he hadn\u2019t needed that kind of confirmation.</p><p>Dude. It\u2019s a smile, not a glance up a skirt.</p><p>Oh, shut up.</p><p>He was talking to himself now. Wasn\u2019t that just great?</p><p>\u201cWel ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, no perfume, but I did visit a bakery just before I hunted Lucien down. Why? Do I smel as sweet as sugar?\u201d</p><p>No, damn it, she smel ed like she needed a good licking.</p><p>Kaia, in bed. Naked. Splayed. His mind liked the image, and hel , so did his demon. While Strider would rather die than accept another chal enge\u2014figuratively speaking, of course\u2014his demon would go insane without them. Beast fed off the high that came with their victories.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t going to let himself go there with Kaia. Not today, and not ever. Kaia wouldn\u2019t just chal enge him more than most; she would chal enge him about everything, and he would never have a moment of peace.</p><p>Defeat practical y rubbed his hands together in glee.</p><p>Strider frowned. No, no, hel , no. We aren\u2019t going there.</p><p>She\u2019s a Harpy. We can\u2019t win against her. We\u2019l suffer.</p><p>Constantly.</p><p>A growl. A whimper. Anger and fear, wrapped tightly together and sprinkled with Oh, please, gods, no.</p><p>That was more like it. Even if some part of Strider liked the idea of constantly sparring with Kaia, \u2019cause yeah, matching wits and daggers could be fun and peace was sometimes overrated, he stil couldn\u2019t al ow himself to be with her. Unlike the other warriors, he had never been able to sleep with a woman who had already tasted one of his friends. It was that possessive streak of his. There was simply no way around it.</p><p>Although...for Ex, Haidee, he\u2019d been wil ing to make an exception. Which meant his competitive nature was stronger than his possessiveness. Kaia, though, wouldn\u2019t be extended the same wil ingness.</p><p>Defeat gave another growl, this one laced with...</p><p>disappointment? No way. I\u2019m just tired. Imagining things.</p><p>His demon only cared about battles, not a specific woman.</p><p>Kaia final y gave up on Strider and turned back around.</p><p>Wil iam maneuvered onto the highway, the caddy gobbling up the miles. Of course, he resumed his flirtation with the Harpy.</p><p>For a little over an hour, Strider ate his candy and fumed.</p><p>Yes, vacations sucked. At the next rest stop, he might just ditch his companions and head off on his own. Except, when Kaia giggled at something Wil iam said, Strider decided waiting to reach a rest stop was dumb. He\u2019d get out now and hitchhike. That kind of feminine delight was grating to his nerves. Yes, grating. Not enchanting.</p><p>He definitely needed distance between him and Kaia. Then he\u2019d stop thinking about her. Stop reacting to her. Stop caring about her past. After al , he\u2019d just gotten out of a bad</p><p>\u201crelationship\u201d and didn\u2019t need to endure another. Plus, that\u2019s what had happened the last time he\u2019d left her. He\u2019d left, and al the torment had stopped. Granted, his reactions hadn\u2019t been quite as strong back then, but there was no reason to think this time would be any different.</p><p>\u201cSo where are we going?\u201d Kaia asked no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cNowhere,\u201d Strider replied.</p><p>\u201cTo kil Gil y\u2019s family,\u201d Wil iam answered easily.</p><p>Strider needed to have a chat with the man. You didn\u2019t undermine your friends. It was worse than cock-blocking.</p><p>Kaia tossed Strider a shut-your-mouth frown before bouncing in her seat. \u201cDo I get to help? Please!</p><p>Can I? You may not know this, but I\u2019m very handy with a blade of any kind, a hacksaw, a whip, a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Someone went through my bag,\u201d Wil iam said.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Kaia continued, as if Wil iam hadn\u2019t spoken.</p><p>\u201cWhatever the weapon, I\u2019m good with it.\u201d</p><p>He would not be impressed. \u201cWe won\u2019t be using weapons.</p><p>We\u2019l be smashing jugulars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, oh! We can play Who Can Smash More!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t because you can\u2019t help,\u201d Strider said at the same time Wil iam blurted out, \u201cI\u2019d be disappointed if you didn\u2019t help.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kaia hmphed at him.</p><p>\u201cJust try not to destroy the entire neighborhood,\u201d he snapped. Nobody listened to him anymore.</p><p>Slitted eyes returned to him. There was no hint of black in the whites, so he knew her Harpy was under control. \u201cWhy are you so grouchy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not grouchy. Only women are grouchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re grouchy,\u201d Wil iam said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re grouchy,\u201d Strider said. Realizing he sounded like a child, he leaned forward and propped his elbows on his knees, his face in his upraised hands. What the hel was wrong with him?</p><p>Wil iam snickered at him. Kaia simply continued to watch him, her expression unreadable.</p><p>\u201cWel , grouchy or not, Stridey,\u201d she said, \u201cI have news that wil cheer you up.\u201d</p> <p>Leaning forward had been a dumb move. The scent of cinnamon and sugar was stronger now, enveloping him, making his mouth water. Would Kaia taste as delicious as she smel ed?</p><p>Suddenly she stiffened. \u201cYou smel like a woman\u2019s peach-flavored body oil.\u201d</p><p>Did he? He thought back to the stripper he\u2019d had on his lap at Paris\u2019s ranch, and yep, he remembered smel ing peaches. Kaia must have hated peaches, though, because she was obviously planning to murder the maker of that oil.</p><p>\u201cI. Wil . Destroy. You.\u201d And yep, black now bled into the white of her eyes. Her nails had already lengthened and sharpened into claws, and those claws were embedded in the plastic console between the driver and passenger seat.</p><p>Hel o, raging beast.</p><p>Mental note: never eat peaches in front of Kaia.</p> <p>Win? Defeat said on a trembling breath, the question having nothing to do with uncertainty this time, and everything to do with being cowed.</p><p>Yeah. Good luck with that, buddy. She\u2019l eat you for lunch and spit out your scales. \u201cI\u2019l wash, okay.\u201d</p><p>Strider jerked upright, as far away from her heavenly aroma as he could get. \u201cAnd just so you know, I don\u2019t care about your news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot kil him,\u201d she muttered to herself. \u201cI cannot kil him. I promised Bianka I\u2019d stop at ten bodies a day, and I\u2019ve already surpassed my quota for the fifth day in a row. I cannot kil him.\u201d</p><p>As far as pep talks went, that one kind of blew. But it calmed her, the black in her eyes fading and those claws receding.</p><p>Strider peered out the window, wil ing to count the trees that whizzed by rather than peer at that too-pretty face. \u201cNow listen up, buttercup. Stri-Stri is going to take a little nappie-poo. Everyone hush their big, fat mouths.\u201d Better to be bored pretending to snooze than accidental y piss Kaia off again.</p><p>\u201cFine. Sleep.\u201d Al kinds of irritation layered her husky voice.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t squawking, though, which was another excel ent sign that the danger had passed. \u201cJust know that while you\u2019re catching up on your much needed beauty rest, you\u2019l miss my story about how many Hunters I bagged and tagged this week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d She\u2019d bagged and tagged a few? He tried not to look intrigued, even as he rethought his strategy. \u201cGo ahead and start your story. I\u2019m sure I\u2019l be so bored I\u2019l nod right off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ve been a bad boy and don\u2019t deserve a reward.</p><p>Therefore, I won\u2019t tel you that there\u2019s a certain Hunter on your trail and he\u2019s closing in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone always is.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cI also won\u2019t tel you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He snored as loud as he could, just to be contrary, and almost laughed when she uttered a quiet shriek.</p><p>Part of him liked this verbal sparring. Liked annoying her and feeling the sparks that nearly sizzled from that petite body.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! Do you hear me, Strider? That\u2019s it! I chal enge you to listen to me. Now.\u201d</p><p>That he didn\u2019t like.</p><p>As his demon jumped up and down in his head, now desperate to win, Strider glared at Kaia, pretty face be damned. And he didn\u2019t give a shit if he pissed her off, either. \u201cI knew you\u2019d do this. I knew you\u2019d chal enge me.</p><p>You\u2019re just like every other female I\u2019ve ever known. No, wait.</p><p>You\u2019re worse. You know what happens to me when I lose, but you chal enge me anyway.\u201d</p><p>Hurt flashed over her features, there one moment, gone the next. Surely he was mistaken.</p><p>Harpies\u2014especial y this infuriating Harpy\u2014didn\u2019t do hurt. Ever. \u201cYou know you can win this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo go on, then,\u201d he snapped. \u201cTalk. I\u2019m literal y dying to hear what you have to say.\u201d</p><p>Kaia ran the pink tip of her tongue over her teeth, and his stomach clenched in reaction. She could have refused him and sent him to his knees in gut-wrenching pain. Instead, she finished her little speech. \u201cYou captured Haidee. Her boyfriend and his fol owers have been chasing you. There.</p><p>Done. You listened and won.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t feel like he\u2019d won. And neither did his demon.</p><p>There was no rush of pleasure, only a need for a real chal enge. Something he\u2019d have to work for. I don\u2019t wanna work for anything, remember? Stil . Everything inside him froze. His heartbeat, his lungs.</p><p>The rush of blood in his veins. \u201cThere\u2019s more. Tel me the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Here it is. While you\u2019ve been playing around, I\u2019ve been chasing the boyfriend and those fol owers of his.</p><p>There\u2019s something odd about each of them, by the way, but the boyfriend most of al . They\u2019re...I don\u2019t know, darker than other humans I\u2019ve been around. They made me feel...icky, which is why I made them hurt real bad before I disposed of them. You should have seen them. After I took my blade and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re digressing, Kaia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not! Now where was I? Oh, yeah. The boyfriend. I couldn\u2019t get close enough to him to figure out what bothered me. He\u2019s dark and wily and like I said, he managed to evade me, which means he\u2019s good, very, very good at evading because I\u2019m very, very good at tracking. Did I ever tel you about the time I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaia!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, you haven\u2019t been able to evade him. He\u2019s close, he\u2019s fil ed with piss and vinegar and he wants to make you his bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow close is he?\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted stubbornly. \u201cClose enough that you\u2019re lucky you weren\u2019t shot down inside that little gas station.\u201d</p><p>Yet she hadn\u2019t said anything while they were there. Hadn\u2019t given him a chance to set a trap. She\u2019d laughed and stolen food and let him take his time. Then she\u2019d carried on a conversation with Wil iam, mile after mile, as if there were no pressing issues. To punish him for not welcoming her to their group, he knew. Harpies were as vindictive as they were destructive.</p><p>Most. Frustrating. Female. Ever.</p><p>His fingers dug into his thighs to keep from strangling her, and he knew he\u2019d have long-lasting bruises.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you fol owing him?\u201d</p><p>One delicate shoulder, bared because of the lacy pink top she wore, lifted in a shrug. \u201cWhen everyone left the fortress, going their separate ways to hide artifacts and stash their women safely away blah, blah, blah, I fol owed you. I figured you\u2019d see the most action, and I was right.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. He must be losing his touch. He\u2019d never even sensed her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, by the way,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou grabbed Haidee and carted her off, but you left a blood trail straight to your motel room door. They were set to raid the entire building when I took al but the leader down. That little bastard escaped, and you should have taken him out when you had the chance, because he gathered more men. I\u2019ve been hot on his heels ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hot, al right. But seriously, how\u2019d you meet up with Lucien?\u201d Wil iam asked, inserting himself into the conversation.</p><p>\u201cAnya and I keep in touch. I told her I needed to borrow her gentleman friend and she agreed. For a price,\u201d Kaia added with a tinge of anger. \u201cAnd someone in this car is going to reimburse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentleman friend. Nice.\u201d Wil iam opened his mouth to add something else, probably to tel her he would gladly pay.</p><p>Strider beat him to it. \u201cWhatever it was, I\u2019l take care of it.\u201d</p><p>He owed her. He guessed. But he didn\u2019t like it, and didn\u2019t want to be indebted to anyone.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then you owe me a ten-minute Frencher.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, certain he\u2019d misheard. He\u2019d expected Hunter hearts or severed limbs. \u201cAnya made you kiss her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And at our next stop, I\u2019l expect you to deliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l pay,\u201d Wil iam piped up. \u201cAfter you describe everything about that kiss you two shared. Did you cop a feel? You did, didn\u2019t you, you little hussy. I bet you moaned a lot, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for you to pay,\u201d she said in a sing-song voice.</p><p>\u201cStrider already offered, and I already accepted. And no, I won\u2019t do any describing. You can just imagine how sexy it was. Oh, and Wil ie. Just so you know, your imagination won\u2019t do it justice.\u201d</p><p>She was lying. She had to be lying. But why would she lie about a kiss? What could she possibly hope to gain by forcing him to kiss her? Strider leaned back in his seat and stared up at the roof. No answers were forthcoming, and he doubted they ever would be.</p><p>Besides, he had more pressing matters to deal with. Like Haidee\u2019s psycho boyfriend. How close was the son of a bitch?</p><p>Win, Defeat said inside his head. Win, win. It wasn\u2019t a question this time. On any level.</p><p>Great. The boyfriend wasn\u2019t even here, but the chal enge had been heard, accepted and must now be met.</p><p>\u201cPul over,\u201d he told Wil iam for the second time that night.</p><p>\u201cWhy? There\u2019s no store.\u201d</p><p>Kaia flicked Strider another glance and grinned. \u201cNow there\u2019s the demon warrior I\u2019ve come to know and love. He wants to set a trap, Wil ie, and we\u2019re going to help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m getting out and doing this solo,\u201d Strider announced. Wil iam had people of his own to kil , and Strider didn\u2019t want to spend any more time with Kaia than necessary. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her grin remained in place, though the edges darkened with an emotion he couldn\u2019t name. \u201cOh, real y?</p><p>Wel , I seem to recal you tel ing me I\u2019m worse than a stomach virus, and I think it\u2019s time I proved that.</p><p>I\u2019m chal enging you to let me help you, Strider.

Nervous, excited. Okay, mostly nervous.</p><p>Win, win, win. Please, win.</p><p>Suddenly hating Kaia with every fiber of his being, Strider gave her a stiff nod.

Or what had driven her to hate him and his friends, hate that led her to aid in Baden\u2019s destruction. No matter how good Amun\u2019s intentions had been, he\u2019d stil flung her right into an attacker\u2019s blade.</p><p>Gods. The blood pouring from her...the agony in her expression...</p><p>His friends only remembered bits and pieces of their time in ancient Greece. They knew they\u2019d burned, pil aged and destroyed, but not specifics. Like who and what. Amun, however, recal ed every detail. Or rather, Secrets wouldn\u2019t al ow him to forget. Mysteries of that nature weren\u2019t ever al owed to remain unsolved, even within himself.</p><p>Very clearly Amun remembered the rage he\u2019d felt as he had fol owed the Hunters to the nobleman\u2019s home. They\u2019d had a particularly violent battle earlier that morning, before the Hunters had cut their losses and retreated. Having none of that, Amun and the others had fol owed them. The warriors had been sliced, diced and bleeding, and they\u2019d been determined to annihilate those responsible.</p><p>What he hadn\u2019t pieced together then\u2014the information lost in the tangle of everything else\u2014but what he determined now, was that they\u2019d been herded, purposely led into that house. Not by the Hunters, but by the \u201che\u201d who pul ed their strings. Not the robed being Haidee had seen, but the \u201che\u201d</p> <p>the Hunters had mentioned when they\u2019d spotted the creature. \u201cHe\u201d had known a demon would be there.</p><p>\u201cHe\u201d</p><p>had wanted everyone inside that room to be slaughtered.</p><p>Even his own people.</p><p>Galen, even then? Or the man who had \u201crescued\u201d little Haidee and taught her to blame the Lords for her parents\u2019</p><p>deaths? The Bad Man? Amun might never know, and real y, just then, he didn\u2019t care. No one\u2019s actions had been as despicable as his own.</p><p>He didn\u2019t deserve the woman behind him, the woman trudging without complaint through cavern after cavern simply to save him. He was responsible for the danger she now found herself in. He might be the cause of her next death.</p><p>A death she feared with every ounce of her being. Terror had fil ed those pearl-gray eyes when she\u2019d spoken of her rebirths. Terror and residual pain, as if even speaking of the events had lanced her with an agony few in the world could even understand. She deserved peace and happiness, a family to cherish her.</p> <p>Everything she\u2019d ever loved had been taken from her. While his mind had been merged with hers, he\u2019d sensed thousands of hidden memories\u2014the memories she thought had been wiped. They were buried deep, secrets even from herself. His demon had reacted rapturously and now viewed her head as the Holy Grail. Secrets wanted back inside. Amun wanted back on top of her strong little body.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t touch her again, wouldn\u2019t deepen the already sizzling awareness between them.</p><p>Because...</p><p>damn it! He hated this line of thought, but he didn\u2019t al ow himself to back away from it. This was part of his penance.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t touch her again because he was going to give her back to Micah.</p><p>Amun\u2019s fingers tightened around the blade hilts he held in both hands, and red dots flickered through his vision.</p><p>Haidee wouldn\u2019t come to hate herself for being with Micah, a Hunter. She wouldn\u2019t wal ow in guilt she shouldn\u2019t feel.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t lose the life she\u2019d managed to build for herself.</p><p>With Amun, she would come to hate herself. How could she not? Giving herself to a Lord had to top her list of Things Never To Do. She would wal ow in guilt, berating herself for choosing the very evil she\u2019d fought against for so long. And she would lose the life she\u2019d built. No way she could be with him and not cut ties with his enemy.</p><p>She must have sensed, or heard, the direction of his thoughts because she sighed, her cool breath wafting down his back. He\u2019d removed his shirt, the heat too much, sweat constantly trickling over his flesh. If Haidee hadn\u2019t been with him, that wonderful y cool breeze wafting from her, enveloping him, he might have actual y burst into flames.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk now?\u201d she said. \u201cAbout what happened?\u201d</p><p>Amun was wil ing to do anything she wanted. Except that. If he told her of his guilt, his regret, she would do everything in her power to ease him. No matter what she did, she would only increase his guilt, because she would be acting against her nature. The woman could nurse a grudge as stubbornly as his friends. Except with Amun. Him, she wanted to forgive. Him, she wanted to absolve. Him, she wanted to...love. He\u2019d sensed the need inside her.</p><p>Because of the blood bond they shared?</p><p>\u201cAmun?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cSo stubborn,\u201d she said, tsking under her tongue. \u201cFine.</p><p>Let\u2019s talk about something else, then.\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>As strong as he was, he was helpless against that word.</p><p>Very wel . What do you wish to discuss?</p><p>\u201cYou know some of my secrets, but I don\u2019t know any of yours. Wil you tel me something that no one else knows about you?\u201d</p><p>Had his friends heard that question, they would have rol ed their eyes and snorted, certain Haidee was playing Bait, trying to learn everything she could about him to share with the Hunters. And they would have shaken Amun had they realized he planned to answer anyway. That he actual y trusted her.</p><p>Her, the only person in the world his demon couldn\u2019t read automatical y. Her, the only person in the world who could read him.</p><p>Point me in the right direction. What type of secret would you like?</p><p>She inhaled sharply, as if she hadn\u2019t expected him to respond. Then she expel ed the breath with a torturous slowness that caused the sweat on his back to freeze.</p><p>Rather than numb him, that ice reminded him of her touch, and his shaft twitched in anticipation.</p><p>Perhaps you should increase the distance between us, he said. He wouldn\u2019t turn around, wouldn\u2019t look at her to see how she took his request. Just in case you trip. You don\u2019t want to slam into me, do you?</p><p>\u201cIf I trip, I need to be closer to you. You\u2019d prevent a face-plant.\u201d</p><p>Logical. Damn it. He increased his pace. So did she. A few minutes ticked by in silence. Sometimes he felt as if he was walking in circles, the cave widening, then narrowing, then widening again, leading up, then down, but never actual y taking him anywhere. But there was no other direction to take. This was it.</p><p>They snaked a corner, and stil Haidee remained silent.</p><p>Tension bloomed as he considered everything she could ask him. Details about his last lover. His plans for her, the future.</p><p>You have yet to point me in the right direction, Haidee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking.\u201d Speaking must have distracted her because she tripped, stumbling right into him, her breasts pressing into his back. She huffed. \u201cSee? Saved from a face-plant.\u201d</p><p>The stinging arousal that next consumed him made a mockery of the twitching that had come before. He wanted her to reach around and wrap her fingers around his erection. Stroke him up and down. Perhaps step in front of him, drop to her knees and suck him deep.</p><p>Of course, she straightened, ending the contact but not the fantasy.</p><p>A moan nearly escaped him. Don\u2019t think like that, he commanded himself.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d she asked, confused.</p><p>Gods, he had to be more careful. Sorry. The command was for myself.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What were you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>No way he\u2019d tel her. No damn way. What secret would you like from me?</p><p>A moment passed before she said, \u201cThat. I want to know what you were thinking about.\u201d</p><p>Should have expected that. He could have refused her, but he didn\u2019t. She had requested, he had agreed, and he would do as promised. Stil . He couldn\u2019t speak about what he\u2019d been imagining without begging her to truly do it. I\u2019l have to show you. If he could.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>When he had lived in the heavens, a minor goddess had performed the act on him, once, only once, and he had loved every moment of it. Sadly, no one had ever done it since. Maybe because he\u2019d never been able to ask for it, and when he\u2019d tried to angle his few lovers into that position, they had resisted. He was big, so he\u2019d understood their reservations and hadn\u2019t pressed.</p><p>So, before Haidee, the time with the goddess had been the best sexual experience of his life. Just thinking about Haidee sucking his shaft, however, was even better than that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting,\u201d Haidee sang.</p><p>And she had cal ed him stubborn. Very wel , sweetheart.</p><p>Just remember, you asked for this. He pushed the vision out of his mind and into hers, praying it worked.</p><p>It worked. She gave another sharp intake of breath, this one shaky around the edges. \u201cAmun,\u201d she said on a moan.</p><p>A moan of need?</p><p>Even as they continued to march forward, her hands slid up his back, then around his sides...playing with his nipples...</p><p>Her breasts once again smashed into him, but this time her fingers traced a path down...down... Holy hel . She would do it, he thought, awed and guilty and so aroused his hunger and need were probably seeping from his skin. She would give him what he wanted, without any hesitation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Right here, right now.</p><p>He would have to stop her, couldn\u2019t let her\u2014she rubbed his cock through his pants, and his lips parted on a silent groan.

You are a beautiful man, and just looking at you arouses me. You\u2019re al I think about anymore.</p><p>Al I crave.\u201d</p><p>Oh, gods. He was going to spil . She\u2019d done nothing but stroke him, and he was going to spil . Haidee, I\u2014</p><p>One moment they were surrounded by the rocky wal s of the cave, hearing the drip, drip of water, the harsh rasp of their breathing, and the next they were encompassed by absolute darkness and utter silence, by sensory deprivation.</p> <p>\u201cAmun?\u201d Her voice was shaky and soft, but there. Thank the gods, he could stil hear her voice. \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d entered the Realm of Shadows, he realized, dread joining ranks with his lingering desire. Final y.</p><p>Progress.</p><p>Damn the timing, though.</p><p>Amun stopped abruptly. Haidee stumbled into him, but his body absorbed the impact. So good, even then. More than hearing her, he could feel her. They weren\u2019t so deprived, after al . He reached back to steady her, careful not to let his blade touch her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>He moved his grip to her wrist and drew her hand to his mouth, pressing a quick kiss into the wild flutter of her pulse. Do you remember what the scrol said?</p><p>The scrol from the backpack. She\u2019d asked for instructions on how to successful y navigate the next realm, and the backpack had provided them. Only, the instructions had been convoluted and asinine.</p><p>You must see</p><p>See through the shadows? Sure. His pleasure. He\u2019d taken the scrol from her as he\u2019d wondered how. A flashlight?</p><p>Shockingly, the moment the question had formed in his mind, ink had begun dripping over the paper, new words forming.</p><p>All of you</p><p>Another convoluted answer. Stil . He\u2019d demanded the backpack provide him with a light source that would push through the darkness, but nothing had fil ed the pack. Which had to mean a flashlight wouldn\u2019t work. Which also had to mean the pack could not provide \u201cal of you.\u201d And that had to mean he already had \u201cal of you,\u201d whatever it was, because the pack was here to help them and wouldn\u2019t leave them in the lurch.</p><p>He\u2019d then returned his attention to the scrol and demanded to know what awaited them in the shadows if they failed to find the mysterious, al of you light. Once again, ink had dripped down the tattered, yel ow page.</p> <p>Death</p><p>Then he\u2019d demanded to know what \u201cal of you\u201d meant.</p><p>All of you</p><p>Funny. Al of him\u2014his body, perhaps?</p><p>\u201cWe must see. We must use al of you, or us,\u201d Haidee said, words trembling from her and bringing him back to the present. \u201cI stil don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>Him either, but he didn\u2019t tel her that. Keep your fingers hooked on my belt loop. Whatever happens, we can\u2019t be separated.</p><p>\u201cAl \u2014al right.\u201d</p><p>When she complied, removing her free hand from his stil burning erection, he released her other one and gingerly started forward. He kept his arms outstretched, hoping to feel his way.</p><p>Soon he noticed that as quickly as the darkness had arrived, it was dissipating in spots, leaving little pockets of light. Would have been wonderful, except shadows danced around the light\u2014and those shadows had fangs.</p><p>Something sharp sliced into his arm, and he mental y cursed. He shoved Haidee into one of those golden beams, but the beam moved several inches away, returning her to the dark. Something else sliced into his arm. The fangs, he was sure. They must have gotten Haidee, too, because she stiffened, moaned.</p><p>Damn this!</p><p>What should I do? he demanded of his demon, abandoning thoughts about \u201cal of you.\u201d They\u2019d gotten him nowhere. As Strider would say, the backpack and scrol could suck it.</p><p>At first, Secrets remained silent, stil . Sleeping? Now? Or was Amun\u2019s other half stil beaten to the back of his mind with the others? But the demon must have been searching for answers because suddenly Amun knew to fol ow the light. The shadows weren\u2019t al owed to touch\u2014or bite\u2014</p><p>anything in the center of those glowing pools.</p><p>He watched the macabre dance of light and dark for a moment, enduring several more nibbles, until Secrets locked on a pattern.</p><p>Move with me, Haidee. Now! Amun leapt forward, straight into the center of one of those beams.</p><p>Haidee remained directly behind him. One second, two, he waited. Again!</p><p>They leapt once more, fol owing the light to its next destination. On and on they continued, jumping, pausing, jumping again. For hours. He knew Haidee was tiring, could feel the tremble in her slight form.</p><p>You\u2019re doing great, sweetheart, he praised her.</p><p>Before she could reply, a thick, cloying darkness once again enveloped them. No longer were there any pockets of light. No more fangs, either. Thank the gods. He stil ed, Haidee pressing into his back. They could rest for a moment, decide what to do.</p><p>Secrets prowled through his mind, agitated, and suddenly Amun knew. More shadow-dwel ers were coming. Close...</p><p>closer...</p><p>Be ready, he told Haidee.</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>Something worse. He didn\u2019t yet know what a shadow-dwel er was, but he knew that much. At least with the total cessation of sight his other senses kicked into hyperdrive.</p><p>His ears picked up the whistling sound of wind. Or was he hearing...screams? His nose scented sulfur, and his mouth tasted copper. His palms tingled, sensing a spike of aggression in the air.</p><p>Demons, he said. Shadow-dwel ers were demons.</p><p>Minions, like the ones he\u2019d absorbed. They approached, and dread detonated inside him. Would he absorb them?</p><p>Haidee first, his sanity second, he decided, switching direction. Rather than moving forward, he inched to the side until he encountered the solid length of the wal . He placed himself in front of her, offering what shelter he could.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t lie to her. She needed to know the danger they were in. I told you. Demons approach. I won\u2019t let them reach you.</p><p>\u201cI can help you fight,\u201d she replied, far from scared.</p><p>I won\u2019t risk you.</p><p>A growl of menace sounded beside him, fol owed by another. And another. Haidee stiffened. So did he.</p><p>A jumble of thoughts suddenly slammed into his head, each revolving around the taste of his organs. The demons had spotted him, were utterly starved and looked forward to eating every part of him.</p><p>And then, suddenly, they were there, attacking from every angle. Amun swiped out with his arms and knew he\u2019d made contact with several of the creatures. Maybe he\u2019d delivered kil ing blows, maybe not, but it didn\u2019t matter how many he fel ed. There were so many, they converged on him en masse.</p><p>He threw off as many as he could, continual y slashing, kicking his legs to dislodge those who were chewing through his pants. Like the shadows, they had fangs. Only theirs were a lot sharper. And they had claws, such diamond-hard claws. But at least their evil remained with them, rather than being sucked into him, becoming a part of him.</p><p>Despite the rapid movement of his arms, several managed to attach themselves to his biceps. He felt what seemed to be a thousand prickly stings, not just in his biceps, but al over his body.</p><p>Warm blood leaked from him, and the scent of it tossed the creatures into a feeding frenzy. They snapped, growled and ripped out hunks of muscle. That quickly, he was losing the battle, weakening, and shit! He didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>Didn\u2019t know where to find the light, or even how to use al of himself. Unless \u201cal \u201d meant offering his entire body up as a smorgasbord.</p><p>When Haidee screamed, the creatures working their way behind him to take little nibbles out of her, he stopped caring about the light and concentrated on kil ing\u2014however necessary. No one hurt his woman.</p><p>No one. And those who tried would suffer.</p><p>As rage suffused him, total y, completely, Amun bit back, clamping as many of the creatures as possible between his teeth and shaking like a shark that had final y snatched its prey. They were smal , he realized, and easily breakable, those he held quickly going limp. He spit them out and snapped for more.</p><p>Secrets continued to prowl through his head like a caged lion, wanting to hurt, to destroy, and wipe al conscious thought from the primitive minds around them. Amun held tight to his other half, afraid the beast would hurt Haidee in the process. But when she released another scream, this one slightly weaker than the other, proving she was losing blood and deteriorating, Amun\u2019s guard dropped. The agitated demon roared, wrenching control from him and overtaking Amun completely. No longer were they man and beast. They were simply beast.</p><p>Some of those minds were indeed wiped, thoughts and hungers slinking into Amun. Absorbed, as he\u2019d feared. His mouth watered as he imagined tasting blood. Drinking...</p><p>drowning in the flooding life-force...</p><p>The images and urges didn\u2019t last long. They quickly joined the muted chorus in the back of his consciousness.</p><p>More, he needed more. As his demon\u2019s hold on him strengthened, red flicked to life in his eyes, glowing, lighting up the cavern and il uminating hundreds of tiny, piranha-like creatures. They had white, hairless skin and pink-tinted gazes that looked as if they\u2019d never glimpsed a single ray of light.</p><p>When they encountered the wash of red, they shrank back with a shriek, trying to escape it. Why would\u2014</p><p>Al of him, he thought then, understanding. Al of himself, and al of his demon. So simple, so easy. He was ashamed he hadn\u2019t realized it sooner and saved Haidee from her newest injuries.</p><p>Another sin to place at his door.</p><p>Secrets continued to roar, out loud this time, frightening the creatures into backing farther away, and with the sound, Amun began to talk, unable to halt the words. Only he didn\u2019t reveal devastating truths and vile crimes, the things that had constantly swirled inside his head until Haidee entered his life. He spoke of something sweet and tender.</p><p>\u201cI have to tel you something, sweet child.\u201d Ancient Greek, a language he\u2019d only recently heard when inside Haidee\u2019s mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMother?\u201d she said now, awed and confused by what she was hearing from him.</p><p>Any time the demon spoke through him, revealing something, the voices of those involved were used, rather than his own.

So special.\u201d</p> <p>There was a pause, his voice slipping into a softer, childlike timbre. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Another pause, the return of the huskier voice. \u201cFor years, I could not conceive, and so I prayed and prayed, beseeching the gods to bless my barren body with fruit.</p><p>And one night, a being appeared to me in my dreams. She told me I had only to promise to relinquish rights to my firstborn, and I would have many children. I agreed. It was the hardest decision I\u2019d ever had to make, but I was so desperate, I agreed, and nine months later you were born.\u201d</p><p>Another pause, that switch of voices. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>Yet another pause, yet another switch. \u201cOh, yes, sweet darling. And soon after, your sister was born.</p> <p>And now, another babe grows in my bel y.\u201d</p><p>Pause. \u201cI shal be a sister again?\u201d</p><p>Pause. \u201cYes. But, darling, listen to M\u00e0na. The being has returned. She wants to take you from us.\u201d</p><p>Pause. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you.\u201d</p><p>Pause. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want you to leave us. Therefore, you wil not. We wil pack our belongings and flee from this place. I don\u2019t tel you this to frighten you, only to warn you. If ever someone approaches you, intending to take you away from us, run, my darling, run. Run and hide, and we wil find you.\u201d</p><p>The voices continued, the mother easing the child with teasing stories and tickles, until both were laughing. The father and sister soon joined them, and their love for each other echoed in every word.</p> <p>Real-life Haidee wrapped a trembling arm around Amun\u2019s waist. Distantly, he thought she might have taken one of his weapons from him, might have been slashing with her free hand to discourage the creatures from approaching his side, where the red light didn\u2019t reach, but he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby,\u201d she urged between one of his pauses.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes on those little bastards, and I\u2019l get us out of here, okay?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t reply, could only weave the rest of the tale, the family spending what would be their last night together.</p><p>Haidee never ceased dragging him away from the hungry fiends until final y, the shadows gave way and another cave surrounded them. This one was wel -lit.</p><p>She eased him to the ground as gently as she could, and he lay there, stil talking, unable to do anything else. His mind was consumed by his demon, by the images forming, but soon the memory took a darker turn, the murders clearly imminent.</p><p>Amun didn\u2019t want to go there, didn\u2019t want Haidee to hear their screams, their pleas for mercy.</p><p>Somehow, someway, he managed to fight his way to the surface and peer up at her. The worst was yet to come, yet she was already staring down at him with horror. Horror she\u2019d never before directed at him.</p> <p>\u201cKnock...me...out...\u201d he managed between pauses.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She gulped, trembled as she reached down and clasped one of his blades. But when she straightened, she made no move toward him. \u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t, Amun. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Must. No other...way.\u201d His eyes beseeched her, the memory trying to jerk him back down, escape him. Any second now, and the screams and pleas were going to burst from his mouth. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Something hard suddenly crashed into his temple.</p><p>But he was stil awake, stil talking. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Once more, twice more, she hit him with the hilt of the blade. \u201cSo sorry.\u201d A third time. Harder and harder.</p><p>Good girl. He smiled as darkness consumed him, at last quieting his demon.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>HAIDEE STOOD OVER AMUN\u2019S unconscious body for a long while, content to watch him, guard him, as he had often done for her. His breathing remained deep and even, and the torment etching his features eventual y smoothed out.</p><p>He looked like an innocent little boy, she mused, with his dark lashes curling out, his lips soft and parted.</p><p>Only the dried blood on his temple ruined the il usion. Wel , that, and his ginormous warrior frame. Such a beautiful man, and what the hel was dripping on him?</p><p>Her gaze narrowed on the red splatter now marring his cheek. Blood. Not his, though. Frowning, she moved her attention to her arm. She stil held the blade she\u2019d stuck him with, she realized. She dropped the weapon, heard the clatter of metal against rock, and looked at her hand. There were multiple puncture wounds.</p><p>Her frown intensified when she swayed, overcome by dizziness. Wasn\u2019t that just typical? She\u2019d felt fine until she actual y spotted the wound. But damn, she must have lost quite a bit of blood. Which made sense. Those piranha-like creatures had chomped on each of her limbs. And God, did she remember the pain. Like having acid-tipped pins dril ed into her bones.</p><p>If she had suffered, shielded by Amun as she\u2019d been, how much had he suffered, completely out in the open?</p><p>And how had she repaid him? By knocking him into a stupor.</p><p>He wanted you to do it, she reminded herself, but that didn\u2019t ease her guilt. Maybe because, deep down, she had wanted to do it. She\u2019d heard her mother\u2019s voice, her father\u2019s, her sister\u2019s, had known their deaths were approaching and had almost col apsed. If she\u2019d had to listen to them die\u2014again\u2014she would have col apsed, no question.</p><p>Amun had known that, and had fought to spare her. Always he considered her wel -being first, no matter the cost to himself. He\u2019d known what he was saying, what he was about to say, and hadn\u2019t wanted her hurt by it.</p><p>Until that moment, she hadn\u2019t truly realized the constant burden he carried. He ascertained the dark thoughts and vile pasts of those around him and drew them inside himself. Unwittingly, yes, but rather than al ow those poisons to spil from him, he held every drop inside himself. That way, no one else had to be tainted.</p><p>The strength of wil such an act required... Haidee knew she would have crumbled long before now.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do with you, Amun?\u201d she muttered. She hated that he hurt himself that way, that his only means of purging the darkness inside him came at such a high price.</p><p>For him, for those he loved.</p><p>Sighing, she grabbed the backpack and gathered the supplies necessary to clean and bandage him, then herself.</p><p>Then she ate a turkey sandwich and an apple and drained a bottle of water. Several more hours passed, but Amun didn\u2019t awaken.</p><p>Had she caused permanent damage?</p><p>Concern rocked her, and she paced the spacious cavern.</p><p>Soon a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu overtook her. The enclosure looked exactly like the one the angel, Zacharel, had brought them to that first night: rocky wal s splattered with red, bones in every corner. Had they made no progress?</p><p>This was hel . Maybe every cavern looked like this.</p><p>As she paced, her heart ached and swel ed, any resistance she stil might have harbored toward Amun vanishing. He gave her what no one else had ever been able to give. A past to cherish. A present to enjoy. A future to anticipate.</p><p>And he wanted her, too. She knew he did. When he had pushed that image inside her head, the one of her in front of him, on her knees, his pants at his ankles and his hands in her hair, her mouth swal owing every inch of his massive erection, her own hands tugging at his testicles, she had nearly melted. She\u2019d felt the raw need pulsing from him, the consuming hunger...the primal satisfaction.</p><p>She\u2019d also felt his reasons for resisting her so steadfastly.</p><p>Guilt, fear and remorse. Guilt for having inadvertently helped to kil her that first time\u2014she\u2019d known that already.</p><p>Fear that he would hurt her again\u2014that had been a surprise</p><p>\u2014and remorse for giving her up, even though it was for her own good. That wasn\u2019t going to be tolerated.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her to regret what happened between them.</p><p>Didn\u2019t want her to later hate him. He would learn. She wouldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t hate him. Not for any reason.</p><p>There had to be some way to prove how wrong he was.</p><p>That the only way he could hurt her was by giving her up.</p><p>That she would never regret being with him.</p><p>Amazed, she ground to a halt. It was true, she realized. She would never regret being with him. The Hunters would view her as a traitor, and they would target her as they targeted the Lords, but she didn\u2019t care. And Micah, wel , he would turn on her, too.</p><p>He would feel betrayed, personal y and emotional y, but maybe one day, when he final y experienced the sizzle for himself, he would realize their split was the best thing that had ever happened to him.</p><p>Now that she\u2019d experienced it, she only wanted more.</p><p>Now that she\u2019d experienced it, she only wanted more.</p><p>Would do whatever was needed to have more. Even seduce Amun within an inch of his life.</p><p>No more waiting to move forward until she broke things off with Micah. Yes, she stil planned to cal him, to tel him they were finished, but their relationship was already over, done.</p><p>Amun had her loyalty now. Demon, immortal, whatever, he had her loyalty. He deserved her everything.</p><p>And real y, she was operating under a limited amount of time. If she couldn\u2019t reach him before they left these caverns</p><p>\u2014if they ever left these caverns\u2014he would dump her somewhere and take off. For her own good. That, she knew, as wel . Somehow, some way, she had to prove they could make a relationship work before then.</p><p>Turning his vision into a reality would be a good start.</p><p>She gave herself a once-over. Her clothes were ripped, caked in dirt and dried blood, and she probably smel ed like dead piranha. She could clean up with wet wipes from the pack, she supposed, but tiny towelettes could only do so much. And yeah, she could summon another angel robe and that would magical y wash away every unwanted speck, but mental y, she would stil feel dirty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need a bath,\u201d she murmured to the backpack. \u201cA real bath. Can you fit a tub in there? Huh?\u201d</p><p>A whoosh at her side had her twisting and reaching for the blade she\u2019d dropped. Though there had been a rocky wal beside her only a few seconds ago, there was now a wide, bubbling spring of water.</p><p>Haidee\u2019s eyes widened with shock. How had...why...the backpack could manipulate the earth?</p><p>Seriously? Then she thought, who the hel cared? The urge to soak and scrub overwhelmed her and left her trembling with anticipation.</p> <p>\u201cSoap, shampoo, conditioner,\u201d she said giddily.</p><p>The backpack plumped at the sides, signaling it had fil ed with everything she had requested. After lining the items along the edge of the spring\u2014a real freaking spring!\u2014she stripped herself, stripped Amun, and then shook him until his eyelids cracked open. His spirits needed this. Besides, she was stil concerned about him, fearing she had struck him too hard, and if he\u2019d just wake up for a few minutes, she could relax.</p><p>He moaned, the sound broken, his throat obviously tender.</p><p>At least he was rousing.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d she said, covering his mouth with her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t talk out loud, baby. Okay?\u201d Neither one of them was strong enough to deal with the consequences just yet.</p> <p>His black eyes were glassy as he focused on her.</p><p>Something wrong?</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s right. Can you stand? We\u2019re going to take a bath.\u201d</p><p>A bath?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d she told him with a grin. And just then she knew; he was going to be al right.</p><p>\u201cCome on. On your feet, big boy.\u201d</p> <p>He lumbered to a stand and tripped his way to the edge.</p><p>Then he just sort of fel over the side, splashing headfirst into the water. Haidee jumped in after him and dragged him to the surface before he drowned. His eyes had closed again, his head lol ing to the side.</p><p>She chuckled as she settled against the rock and anchored him against her, chest to back. \u201cYou stil awake, baby?\u201d</p><p>Yes. He uttered a soft sigh. Just barely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to scrub us both. Tel me if I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t hurt me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re injured and\u2014\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m in your arms. I\u2019l be fine, I promise.</p> <p>Darling man. She tried to be impersonal, she real y did. He wasn\u2019t ready for the seduction she had planned. Yet. Stil , as her hands lathered the soap and spread the bubbles over his big arms, his corded chest, his strong thighs, her blood heated with desire, a reaction only he could cause.</p><p>His silky skin covered a body built for war, and she marveled. He made her desperate, hungry, mindless of anything except pleasure. Maybe because, when she was with him, she didn\u2019t belong to herself. She belonged to him.</p><p>And that probably should have frightened her. Instead, it only made her trust him more. Amun would die before he hurt her\u2014as he\u2019d proven time and time again.</p><p>\u201cAmun?\u201d</p><p>He gave no response. Poor baby must have fal en asleep again.</p><p>\u201cI love your body,\u201d she admitted, bold because he couldn\u2019t hear her. \u201cDid you know that? Everything about you seems custom-made for me. I mean, it\u2019s almost like I ordered you from a catalog. And I wouldn\u2019t change anything about you.</p><p>You\u2019l probably never believe that, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>One day, she hoped he would feel the same about her.</p><p>After she shampooed his hair, breathing in the scent of sandalwood, she tilted him backward and rinsed every strand. When she finished with him, she gently shook him awake. Or maybe he\u2019d been awake the entire time. His eyes were no longer glassy; they were blazing.</p><p>Her cheeks flushed. \u201cCan you get out on your own?\u201d</p><p>Yes. He climbed out and settled back on the floor, lying on his side to peer over at her. Your turn to scrub up.</p><p>The flush spread as she washed herself from top to bottom.</p><p>Despite her embarrassment, the water soothed the little aches and pains that continuous walking and sporadic fighting\u2014and nearly being eaten alive\u2014had left.</p><p>Haidee? Amun said after she\u2019d rinsed her hair.</p><p>The water splashed as she straightened. She leaned over the edge and stared down at her mighty warrior. His eyes were closed again, lines of tension branching from them.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Come here and hold me.</p><p>For a heartbeat of time, she could only gape at him. He had just requested her touch? No, not requested. Demanded.</p><p>Such sweet progress already, and his true seduction hadn\u2019t even begun.</p><p>\u201cAnything you want,\u201d she rushed out before he could change his mind. Naked and dripping, she moved out of the water.</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother drying off but curled into his side, spooning him, resting her cheek on his outstretched arm.</p><p>He didn\u2019t draw her closer.</p><p>She didn\u2019t let that irk her. Much. She linked their fingers, and though the action wasn\u2019t meant to arouse either of them, it did exactly that. His penis grew and hardened against the crease of her bottom, and liquid need pooled between her legs. God, she wanted to arch back, grind into him, beg him to grind into her, but she didn\u2019t. Not even when his heat wrapped around her, far headier than it had been in the water, the force of it causing her to tremble.</p><p>Not yet, girl. Not yet. He wasn\u2019t ready for her seduction to begin. That tension... Soon, though. Please, God, soon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad at me for bashing your skul in, are you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t expect an answer, but a soft chuckle wafted through her mind. I\u2019m grateful. I\u2019m just too weak to show you how much.</p><p>Show her, he\u2019d said. How? \u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said, suddenly breathless. \u201cNow go to sleep and rebuild your strength.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re going to need it. She kissed the inside of his wrist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be here when you wake up.\u201d And by that time, she would be doing things to his body that he would never be able to forget\u2014things he wouldn\u2019t want her to stop doing.</p><p>Unaware of the sensual assault he would soon experience, he obeyed her, his breathing evening out as he drifted back to sleep.</p><p>AMUN\u2019S MIND JOLTED into sudden awareness, three things instantly, absolutely certain to him. His body was on fire, his cock was being iced and he was loving the hel out of both. He jerked upright, panting, wondering if he\u2019d had an erotic dream and embarrassed himself.</p><p>When he saw a lusciously naked Haidee planted between his legs, licking his hardened shaft from root to tip, then swirling her tongue over the slit, then moaning as if she\u2019d tasted something sweet, he realized he hadn\u2019t been dreaming. He hadn\u2019t embarrassed himself, either, but was probably going to.</p><p>He wanted to come. Desperately.</p><p>Secrets was eerily silent, and hiding in the back of his mind. The other demons were silent and hiding, as wel .</p><p>Again. That icy chil of hers must truly scare them. That, or they feared she\u2019d start doing that tugging thing and they were trying not to draw her notice.</p><p>Sweetheart?</p><p>Haidee paused, lifting her head away from him, and every cel he possessed screamed in protest. Cool breath tickled his skin as she offered him a wicked smile, her breasts firm and taunting, her nipples hard and pouting, almost close enough to rub against his thighs.</p><p>\u201cYes, baby?\u201d she asked throatily.</p><p>I\u2014I\u2014Shit! He didn\u2019t know what to say to her. Except, maybe, continue. But he couldn\u2019t al ow her to do this. She would regret it, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to live with himself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake, right? You\u2019re not in danger of fal ing back asleep?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m only in danger of dying.</p><p>\u201cToo weak, then?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>The huskiness of her laugh echoed between them. \u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>\u201cReal y?\u201d</p><p>She gave him another lick and he was rushing out, No. No, I don\u2019t want you to stop. Oh, gods, he thought. Yes, you have to stop.</p><p>She blew on the weeping tip of his shaft. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to stop?\u201d</p><p>Oh, gods, he thought again. The torture...the pleasure...the possible repercussions...he\u2019d never been this torn.</p><p>\u201cAmun, darling, say the word and I\u2019l suck you so deep you\u2019l feel my throat closed around you for days.\u201d</p><p>Another chil y breath coasted over his slit. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this, needing it. Craving it. Let me have it.\u201d</p><p>His resistance shattered. Do it. Please, do it. You can blame me later. Hate me later, but please don\u2019t stop. He didn\u2019t care about later, didn\u2019t care that he was begging. He had to have this, couldn\u2019t exist another moment without it.</p><p>\u201cI wil , I\u2019l do it,\u201d she said, fingers tracing up one side of his shaft, then down the other. \u201cAnd I promise I\u2019l blame you later.\u201d</p><p>He knew he should be concerned but couldn\u2019t manage the emotion. Sweat beaded over him in an effort to purge the intensity of his hunger. She hadn\u2019t fit her mouth back over his length, but her breath stil stroked him. So good, felt so good. And then that was the only word he could say. Good.</p><p>He was trembling, aching, desperate. Good, good, good.</p><p>Her voice lowered. \u201cI\u2019l blame you because you\u2019re too beautiful to resist. Because you think of my wel</p><p>-being even when you\u2019re in danger yourself. Because you\u2019re mine. My warrior. My...demon.\u201d</p><p>The admission affected him as potently as her actions, and he found new words to give her. You\u2019re kil ing me, sweetheart. You\u2019re kil ing me, yes, yes, yes, please kil me.</p><p>Any moment and he would start arching his hips, thrusting up, unable to stop himself.</p><p>Her wicked grin returned. \u201cLie back and conserve your strength, baby. Sweet little Haidee\u2019s gonna do al the work.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t lie back. He\u2019d been yearning for this forever.</p><p>Yearning for her forever. He wanted to see every move she made. Like this. Just like this.</p><p>\u201cWhatever my warrior desires...\u201d Lips of scarlet at last closed over the tip of him. She moaned in delight.</p><p>His back bowed. Her cold little tongue flicked the slit it had suckled only moments before, and he had to brace his arms behind him to remain upright. Down, down she sucked him, taking every inch, just as she\u2019d promised, not backing off even when he hit deeper than she\u2019d probably wanted him to go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, not true. His little Haidee hummed in satisfaction, in more of that delight, and he felt the vibrations in his bones.</p><p>He had to grit his teeth to prevent himself from exploding then and there. Then she began to move, up and down, slowly at first, tormenting him, laving him with sensation, sensitizing his skin.</p><p>The ice of her touch should have numbed him, but combined with the heat his body exuded, he was kept in a continual state of need, ready to beg for one or the other to final y push him over the edge. And soon he was crying out in his mind, trying not to pump into her mouth.</p> <p>That blond-and-pink hair bobbed, and with every upward glide, he saw slim, elegant fingers playing at his base. He started thinking about what he wanted to do with his own fingers. Glide them down the bumps of her spine, cup that trim little ass, spread each digit until he hit the warm, wet center of her. Sink deep with one, retreat, go back in with two, retreat, then go back in with three, until he stretched her.</p><p>Until she squirmed and rode him and gasped and cried.</p><p>Haidee groaned, her body trembling, her teeth scraping up his shaft. \u201cYes,\u201d she rasped. \u201cYes. Fingers, deep. So deep.\u201d</p><p>Amun\u2019s heart thundered against his ribs. Was he pushing the images inside her head? He must be, he thought. Was glad. He wanted her to see, to know.</p><p>Al the while she licked at him, she nibbled, her hips undulating over his legs, searching for something to fil her.</p> <p>He cupped her nape and massaged the muscles knotted underneath. When she began to relax against his hold, he tried to spin her around so that he could please her as she was pleasing him. She resisted.</p><p>\u201cNo. You first.\u201d</p><p>Haidee.</p><p>\u201cNo. Just...need a moment...control...slipping...\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if she meant control of her body or control of the ice, but either way, he didn\u2019t care. She wanted him. She needed him. And he wanted to taste her. Needed to taste her, too.</p><p>As those tormenting lol ipop licks continued, he tossed another image into her mind. One of his head buried between her thighs, sampling al the sweetness waiting there. Sucking her clitoris, flicking with his eager tongue, his fingers pinching her nipples into hard little pearls.</p> <p>He\u2019d shove her legs as far apart as they would go, burrow as deep as possible, and make her feel more vulnerable than she\u2019d ever been. She would be helpless, his to control, command...his to own. He would take everything, swal ow her up, devour her completely, then rear up and slam home.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t be gentle. But then, she wouldn\u2019t want gentleness. She would want a hard pounding, a punishing ride onto oblivion. She would scream and she would cry out. She would clutch at him and leave bloody trails on his back, her nails like talons as her legs wrapped around him, ankles locking.</p><p>He would make her forget her husband, forget every man she\u2019d ever been with. Only Amun would matter. Only Amun would have rights to her. Anyone who tried to reach her, who wanted to see her like that, taste and touch her like that, would die. He would murder them.</p><p>She. Belonged. To. Him. Not even Haidee would be able to doubt that afterward.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she moaned, then lapped at his pre-come. Her trembling intensified.</p><p>I told myself to stay away from you, he said into her mind. I told myself to leave you alone.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>But I can\u2019t, he continued. Let me taste you.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she repeated. Less savagely, yes, but not completely broken. \u201cLet me finish you. Because I swear to God, baby, you\u2019re going to have this memory if it kil s me. And it just might. You taste so damn good.\u201d With that, her mouth plunged, once again taking his entire length.</p><p>Amun final y let go of the gossamer threads of his control.</p><p>He fel back, hips thrusting up, fingers tangling in her hair.</p><p>She claimed him wildly, wantonly, as if she couldn\u2019t live another moment without his seed; soon he was helpless to do anything but let her have every drop.</p><p>Fire rushed through his veins, burning them to ash, al owing the inferno to spread, consume him, burst from him. He bucked up as she slammed down, and that seed rose up his length and exploded from him.</p><p>Her cheeks hol owed as she swal owed, taking everything he had to give and stil demanding more.</p><p>She wrung him dry, reduced him to a shel of himself, and he sagged against the ground. She didn\u2019t pul from him right away, but licked and purred as if unwil ing to give him up even then. His muscles continued to spasm with aftershocks of sensation, pleasure humming through him as potently as she had hummed on him.</p><p>He would have recovered\u2014eventual y\u2014and could have final y possessed her completely. But she wanted to cal Micah before they took that step, and Amun wouldn\u2019t force that issue now. Not after what she\u2019d just done for him. So he somehow found the strength to sit up, clasp her under the arms and lift her until she straddled his chest.</p><p>Her eyes were glazed with passion, her cheeks flushed a deep rose. Those beautiful locks of hair hung in rapturous tangles around her shoulders. Never had a woman looked more mussed, more ready for loving\u2014or better loved.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He slid one of his hands between their bodies and thrust a finger deep. Immediately her head fel back and a cry parted her lips.</p><p>\u201cYes! Yes, please, yes.\u201d</p><p>Just as he\u2019d imagined, he used two fingers on the inward glide. She was so wet she drenched his hand, so needy her inner wal s clung to him, trying to hold him captive. This was how a woman should always feel. Ready. On the next inward glide, he used three, just as he\u2019d craved. His thumb rubbed at her clitoris, never ceasing the pressure.</p><p>So desperate was her need, she erupted quickly and violently. Her scream echoed from the wal s, her knees squeezed his sides so tightly he knew his ribs would crack, and her nails raked his pecs, leaving welts. And when the last tremor left her, she col apsed on top of him, panting, eyes closed, skin sheened by a delicate layer of ice.</p><p>Amun was panting just as forceful y. What had just happened...he\u2019d never experienced anything like it.</p><p>That hadn\u2019t been the simple fulfil ment of a need. That had been the birthing of an addiction. An obsession. He had to have more. Had to have everything. Now, always.</p><p>Haidee\u2019s lack of inhibition, her wil ingness to please him, her absolute claiming of him\u2014for that\u2019s what she\u2019d done\u2014</p><p>had utterly changed him. In an instant, the old Amun had been burned to ash, and a new Amun had risen up.</p><p>Haidee\u2019s man.</p><p>He\u2019d been stupid to try and push her away, he realized now.</p><p>Stupid to try to ignore the attraction between them. He\u2019d only hurt and frustrated them both. Here, they could be together.</p><p>No one would ever have to know, which meant she wouldn\u2019t be ridiculed, wouldn\u2019t be punished or ostracized by her friends. And so they would; they would be together. He simply couldn\u2019t be without her.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t be without her.</p><p>While they were here, he was forced to remind himself.</p><p>When they left hel , they would part. He wouldn\u2019t disturb her life any more than he already had.</p><p>His hands curled into fists. Gods, even the thought of being without her blackened his mood. He would not be swayed from that course, however. Through his suffering, he would know Haidee lived as she was meant. Happily. Final y.</p><p>Secrets gave a little whimper, and Amun frowned. Did the demon not want to lose Haidee, either? I thought you were scared of her. He was careful to hold the thought inside his mind.</p><p>Another whimper sounded.</p><p>Understanding dawned. You aren\u2019t done digging through her mind.</p><p>The demon gave no response, but a response wasn\u2019t necessary. He knew.</p><p>He and Secrets had never had a true conversation, and he could hardly believe they were (almost) doing so now.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t matter, though. We can\u2019t keep her. For her own good, we can\u2019t keep her.</p><p>As if Haidee sensed the direction of his thoughts, she struggled to sit up. Amun held tight, forcing her to remain against him.</p><p>Sleep, sweetheart. We\u2019l talk later.</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d she asked, the word slurred with exhaustion.</p><p>Promise.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d She hadn\u2019t noticed his failure to specify exactly what they\u2019d discuss, and she went limp, slipping into a deep slumber.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>SOMETHING HARD AND INEXORABLE shook Haidee from the most peaceful sleep of her life.</p><p>She tried to bat the offender away. The shaking continued. She cursed and blinked open her eyes to see Amun looming above her, his expression tense, his black eyes unreadable.</p><p>He pressed a firm finger over her mouth before she could utter a single word. Something\u2019s out there, his deep voice said into her mind. Urgency radiated from him, as contagious as a virus. Get dressed.</p><p>Of course someone was out there, she thought dryly. She and Amun were in a division of hel ; they weren\u2019t al owed a single moment\u2019s respite. And now, their long overdue relationship talk would have to wait. Again. Stil , this was better than the alternative. Like, say, dying.</p><p>As she donned the bra, panties, jeans, T-shirt, boots and countless blade and sheaths he\u2019d laid out for her, she marveled at the change in herself. Only a few days ago, she had jolted to awareness every time she\u2019d awoken, mind already locked on escape. Now, when danger had never been so prevalent, she\u2019d let down her guard. She even had to remind herself not to think about what they\u2019d done last night, how she\u2019d sucked and swal owed him, how she\u2019d ridden his fingers and cried his name.</p><p>She shivered as she listened for whatever had disturbed Amun. Nothing, she heard nothing. She wiped the sleep from her eyes and anchored the backpack on her shoulders. When they\u2014 Her ear twitched, and she frowned.</p><p>Was that a...whistle of wind? No, she thought. Laughter.</p><p>Faint but unmistakable now\u2014and coming from more than one source.</p><p>Laughter in hel . Not good. No, not good at al . She glanced at Amun to gauge his reaction.</p><p>He looked alert, on edge, as he stood guard at the cave entrance, his back to her. He wore a black shirt and black slacks, and each looked buttery soft and flexible. That way, he wouldn\u2019t be restricted during a fight. Silently she moved behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sensed her approach and started forward. She remained close on his heels as they left her new favorite place in the world. They should have entered another cave, a rocky hal way at the very least.</p><p>That\u2019s what had happened every time before. This time, however, they entered\u2014no, surely not. She shook her head, blinked her eyes. She couldn\u2019t be seeing what she thought she was seeing, but the image never varied.</p><p>A...circus? Amun asked, incredulous.</p> <p>He saw it, too, then. A freaking circus. Unreal! After the Realm of Shadows, a circus seemed like a spa vacation.</p><p>Seriously. The restrictive wal s of the underground had given way, stretching into what seemed to be a pretty, moonlit night. Stars even twinkled from their perch in the black-velvet sky, a cool breeze dancing past.</p><p>A moon...a sky...in a cave. How? She stopped wondering when she saw that several fires crackled nearby, and there were bearded women and jaundiced-eyed men holding their hands inside the actual flames, watching her and Amun with palpable menace.</p><p>Okay, so \u201cspa vacation\u201d had been the wrong term to use.</p><p>\u201cAmun?\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know, he said, answering her unasked question.</p><p>What the hel was going on?</p><p>Too-tal men with legs that knifed toward the sky walked by them, thankful y paying them no heed. The animals they led, however...the elephant whined, its trunk lifting, revealing fangs sharper than any demon\u2019s. Worse, there were several winged lions, two unicorns that were foaming at the mouth and three crocodiles with blades rather than scales protruding from their backs. Each of the animals was bound to the men by a fraying rope\u2014and each was fighting for freedom, their gazes locked on her, the tasty-looking human.</p><p>She gulped, glanced away for fear of egging them on. \u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d</p><p>I won\u2019t let anything bad happen to you.</p><p>Just like I won\u2019t let anything bad happen to you, she thought.</p> <p>Tent after tent lined either side of her, a graveled pathway between them. At the end of that pathway was a booth, and inside that booth sat an obese man in a sweat-stained wifebeater. A neon sign flashed above him. ADMISSION: ONE HUMAN HEART.</p><p>I understand now, Amun told her flatly. We\u2019ve reached the Realm of Destruction.</p><p>Another realm. She almost groaned. \u201cNone of this was here last night,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have noticed on our way into the cave.\u201d</p><p>Wel , it\u2019s here now.</p><p>No denying that. But how? Did she and Amun not actual y have to hike anywhere to reach a new realm?</p><p>Could the realms simply come to them? How odd, if so. Was that normal?</p><p>Was anything normal in hel ? she thought with a humorless laugh.</p><p>They stopped at the booth.</p> <p>\u201cYou want tickets or not?\u201d the sweating man demanded in a voice so low, so deep, there were echoes of darkness bubbling beneath the surface.</p><p>Shuddering, Haidee opened her mouth to shout, \u201cHel , no,\u201d</p><p>but Amun\u2019s next words stopped her. Tel him yes.</p><p>Damn it. Why? Just then, she hated that their mind-connection didn\u2019t go both ways. \u201cYes,\u201d she forced herself to say. \u201cWe want tickets.\u201d</p><p>Glittering red eyes swept over them both. He raised his arm, fingers opening to reveal a dul , bloodstained blade in his palm. \u201cFirst, I\u2019l need your hearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis heart isn\u2019t human,\u201d Haidee said, jabbing her thumb in Amun\u2019s direction.</p><p>The big man gave Haidee his ful attention and licked his greasy lips. \u201cYours wil do. You can pay for him another way.\u201d He stroked himself. \u201cKnow what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Amun stiffened, and suddenly utter menace poured from him. Take what we need from the backpack, he said. His timbre was flat, but al the more fiery for it.</p><p>She pul ed the backpack forward. I need two\u2014she gulped</p><p>\u2014human hearts, she thought and reached inside. What would she do if nothing\u2014</p><p>She almost gagged when she encountered two warm, velvet-wrapped...things. \u201cPaying another way won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d She did gag when she handed both to the man, and he greedily ripped away the material to view the stil -</p><p>thumping organs inside. And when he tore a hunk from both with his teeth, tasting the tissue as he would a fine wine, she had to swal ow a surge of bile.</p><p>He nodded in satisfaction, al three of his chins bobbing with the movement. \u201cGo ahead and pass.\u201d An evil grin split his lips, and she saw the crimson...food stuck between his teeth. \u201cEnjoy yourselves, you hear? I have a real good feeling the performers\u2019l enjoy you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she could only stare at him. He loved to torture females and animals\u2014in that order. How she knew, she couldn\u2019t have said. She just knew. And she wanted to kil him. Badly.</p><p>Why shouldn\u2019t she? she thought next, her skin chil ing several degrees. She was loaded down with blades. A simple jab, jab and he would\u2014</p><p>You can\u2019t kil him, Amun told her.</p><p>Her eyes widened. How had he known what she was planning? Could he now read her thoughts? Or had his demon\u2014his demon, she thought, nodding. Secrets. There was a warm, dark cloud whisking through her head. The same warm, dark cloud she\u2019d noticed the two times Amun had shown her bits and pieces of her past.</p><p>That\u2019s how she knew about the man. That\u2019s why her temperature had dropped.</p><p>When the demon claimed Amun\u2019s attention, or sought her own, his skin warmed and hers chil ed, the same as when they were making love. Right now, Amun was practical y on fire.</p><p>\u201cYou just gonna stand there?\u201d the beefy man cackled, dragging her from her thoughts.</p><p>Shit! She\u2019d al owed herself to be distracted. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I kil him?\u201d</p><p>Come on. Amun twined their fingers and started forward, maneuvering around the man\u2014only to twist and strike with his free hand, embedding a blade in the man\u2019s spinal cord.</p><p>Crack. There was a gurgle, that beefy body convulsing, slumping, fal ing over. Skin turned to ash, and bone to liquid, the ash drifting away in the breeze, the liquid forming a black, oozing puddle. Oh, and to answer your question, you couldn\u2019t kil him because the privilege belonged to me.</p><p>When Amun straightened, looking anywhere but at Haidee, he once again started forward. She could only gape up at him, astonished. \u201cWhy\u2019d you get the privilege?\u201d</p><p>He planned to find you later and...do things to you.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d She knew the answer before she finished asking the question. His demon. Again.</p><p>I told you. I read al minds but yours.</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d She pushed out a breath. \u201cAnd thank you.\u201d</p><p>Thank you? You don\u2019t think me malicious? I just kil ed in cold blood.</p><p>\u201cMalicious? For avenging me? No.\u201d Amun must have forgotten that she had wanted to plant a blade in the man, too. \u201cI think you\u2019re sweet and maybe even went a little easy on the bastard. I would have forced him to eat his own intestines.\u201d</p><p>A warm chuckle drifted through her mind as Amun\u2019s fingers squeezed hers in thanks of his own. He\u2019d truly expected her to balk, she realized. Later, she would have to tel him about some of the things she had done over the years, al in the name of vengeance and, foolishly, world peace.</p><p>As if the world would be a better place without Amun.</p><p>They remained on the gravel path for several minutes. Over and over Haidee\u2019s attention strayed as she searched for the animals she\u2019d seen earlier. She expected them to reappear and launch at her, jaws snapping. Constantly she tripped, but Amun never let her fal . Even better, he never berated her for her lack of concentration as Micah would have done. To him, it was mission first, feelings second.</p><p>When you were stalking evil or being stalked by evil yourself, you were to think only of destroying that evil. You weren\u2019t to worry about any physical pain you might suffer.</p><p>You weren\u2019t to consider what might happen to the innocents around you. And most assuredly, you weren\u2019t to place your fate in anyone else\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d a withered female in front of one of the tents suddenly cal ed. \u201cI tel you what awaits. You pay me with a scream.\u201d</p><p>Haidee replied before she could think better of it. \u201cI\u2019m not screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wil . Oh, you wil .\u201d A gnarled finger pointed at her, and a cackling laugh sounded. \u201cBest go no farther, hateful girl.</p><p>Death, death is what awaits you. And pain, so much pain.</p><p>Soon. Soon you pay me.\u201d</p><p>The prediction was so close to what Haidee had endured countless times in the past, she couldn\u2019t shake a sudden sense of unease. Soon, the old crone had said, and the urge to rush over there and shake the woman, to demand answers, overwhelmed her. She would shake the bitch, she thought, starting forward.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019l pay you al right.\u201d</p><p>Cackling.</p><p>Distantly, she thought she felt something\u2014someone, Amun</p><p>\u2014tugging at her back. She didn\u2019t care. Couldn\u2019t care.</p><p>When she tried to pul from Amun\u2019s hold, he tightened his grip.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to her. Have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t listen to her. Remember what the angel told us? Trust no one.</p><p>It took a superhuman effort, but Haidee managed to stop and look away from that stooped body. The moment she did, the overwhelming urge left her. \u201cThank you. Again.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no need to thank me, Haidee. He stuffed a piece of paper in his pocket. Come on.</p><p>He ushered her off the pathway. He zigzagged and ducked behind the tents, always maintaining a tight grip on her. She had been chased over the years and had chased others, so she knew what he was doing. Preventing anyone from locking on them, their every move random, unpredictable.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the game plan?\u201d she asked.</p><p>While you chatted with the self-professed seer, I had the pack provide instructions for successful y navigating this place.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Another scrol . It said we must find the Horsemen.</p><p>Horsemen? \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>We must find the Horsemen, he repeated. Of the Apocalypse.</p><p>Oh, dear God. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me.\u201d Please let him be kidding. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wish I were. Through death or some other means, the scrol said they were our only way out of here.</p><p>She gulped a mouthful of what felt like sand. \u201cAnd what do you mean by \u2018some other means\u2019? We\u2019re supposed to ride them to safety?\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, Amun chuckled softly. I have no idea. The scrol told me nothing else. But I do know the Horsemen are in some way related to Wil iam, and\u2014</p> <p>\u201cWil iam?\u201d</p><p>You haven\u2019t met him. He\u2019s immortal, a god of some sort, I think, and on our side.</p><p>\u201cOur\u201d side. As if they were partners rather than enemies. As if he trusted her completely. As if he no longer saw her as a Hunter responsible for his friend\u2019s murder, but as a woman worthy of him. Inside she glowed, tendrils of his warmth traipsing through her.</p><p>\u201cSo, if the Horsemen are related to this Wil iam person, who\u2019s on our side\u2014\u201d she stressed the word</p><p>\u201c\u2014the Horsemen should be on our side, as wel ?\u201d</p> <p>We can hope.</p><p>For some reason, that wasn\u2019t promising.</p><p>A shriek sounded at her left, and she stopped to wheel in that direction.</p><p>Easy, Amun instructed, stil ing beside her. Someone\u2019s playing a game, that\u2019s al .</p><p>That was al ? The beings here weren\u2019t playing with darts, bal oons or plastic bal s\u2014and the prizes weren\u2019t stuffed animals. Severed heads were being tossed at boiling tubs of oil, and though the heads were bodiless, their mouths stil managed to scream in pain when splashed with the oil, skin melting away.</p><p>The little boy who\u2019d just won jumped up and down, clapping, his hoofed feet clomping hard into the ground and spraying dirt in every direction. The proprietor handed him a beautiful golden bird trying desperately to escape the string around its neck, wings flapping erratical y, glitter raining from them like fairy dust.</p> <p>The loveliness of the bird was surprising, considering the ugliness of everything else down here.</p><p>The little boy gently held the bird in both hands, muttering soothing words. Those golden wings gradual y stopped flapping. Of course, that\u2019s when the boy shoved the tiny creature into his mouth and bit off the head.</p><p>Haidee gagged and quickly looked away\u2014right at a group of men who\u2019d locked their sights on her and Amun. Those men were striding toward them, closing the distance. Damn it. She never should have paused to watch the games.</p><p>\u201cAmun,\u201d she whispered fiercely.</p><p>I see them. He released her, gearing for a fight they both knew would happen. If I tel you to run, you run and hide and don\u2019t return. Understand?</p><p>As if. But rather than tel him she planned to stay and help, possibly distracting him, she remained silent and palmed two blades in each hand. The men were almost upon them...they were big, bigger than Amun, with paper-thin skin that draped loosely over pitted bone, their eyes merely sunken holes of black...and stil they drew ever closer...</p><p>Just as he\u2019d done with the ticket handler, Amun stiffened.</p><p>And not in preparation for battle.</p> <p>\u201cCan you read their minds?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>He said no more, but then, he didn\u2019t have to. The men intended to do something vile. To her, she was sure.</p><p>\u201cSix against two. Let\u2019s see if we can even out those odds.\u201d</p><p>Haidee threw two of her weapons. The first hit the biggest of the men in the jugular, and he instantly toppled. The second hit the man next to him right in the eye socket. He screamed as he fel .</p><p>The other four paid their fal en comrades no heed, continuing forward.</p><p>Run, Amun commanded her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>Haidee! Now!</p><p>Okay. She had to tel him. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you fly solo on this.</p><p>I\u2019m here. I\u2019l help.\u201d</p><p>He growled.</p><p>The men reached them and formed a circle around them, effectively surrounding them with a wal of muscle and menace. Wouldn\u2019t have been so bad, except the two men she\u2019d fel ed suddenly rose, jerked the weapons from their bodies and took their places in the circle, far angrier than they\u2019d been before.</p><p>Oh...shit. They couldn\u2019t be kil ed. Dread slithered through her, choking her.</p><p>\u201cWe want the girl,\u201d one of them said, and al of them gave her a once-over, lingering on her breasts, between her legs, mental y stripping her and making her shudder in revulsion.</p><p>\u201cWel , news flash. You can\u2019t have me,\u201d she snapped. She would rather die. Again.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t talking to you, bitch.\u201d The shithead\u2019s gaze never left Amun. \u201cGive her to us, and you can go on your way. Alive.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019l pay for disrespecting you, I swear it, Amun told her, and he sounded so calm he could have been discussing his favorite type of doughnut. But first, since you refused to obey me, and yes, we wil be discussing that, ask him if he\u2019s seen the Horsemen.</p><p>That, she obeyed. And as her words echoed between them, an almost visible wave of fear swept over the men.</p><p>They began to tremble, their skin taking on a grayish cast.</p><p>The Horsemen were so depraved they frightened even psychos, huh? Awesome. Then the fear turned to anger, and the men scowled at Amun with more fury than before, as if they blamed him for what they\u2019d felt.</p><p>\u201cForget those that shal not be named and tel us what you want for her,\u201d one of the men said.</p><p>Those that shal not be named?</p><p>A muscle ticked below Amun\u2019s eye as he took each guy\u2019s measure.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you talk, demon?\u201d another growled. \u201cWe want the woman. Now.\u201d</p><p>So they recognized what he was, but they weren\u2019t scared of him as they evidently were of the Horsemen. If that was the case, though, why didn\u2019t they simply attack him?</p><p>\u201cYou can have her back when we\u2019re done,\u201d stil another said.</p><p>They laughed in eerie unison.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course, she\u2019l be in pieces, and we\u2019l probably keep the good ones, but you can have what\u2019s left.\u201d</p><p>Run, Haidee, Amun repeated into her mind. And this time, do it. He didn\u2019t wait to see if she had\u2014she hadn\u2019t\u2014but launched himself at the men. He moved so quickly, she registered only the blur of his slashing hands and glistening blades.</p><p>The men converged on him with the same eerie unison in which they\u2019d laughed, kicking at him, swinging their arms like clubs. She couldn\u2019t throw herself into the fray because there was no way to tel which body parts belonged to Amun and which to the shitheads. Their positions changed too swiftly.</p><p>Blood sprayed, some red, some black. Grunts and groans resounded. Then Amun landed at her feet, wheezing, his face already sliced to ribbons. The men were on him an instant later, their momentum shoving her backward.</p><p>She righted herself, that image of Amun fil ing her with a rage so potent, her blood began to thicken with ice. No one hurt her man. No one. Mist formed a cloud in front of her nose each time she exhaled. She knew anyone who looked at her would see actual crystals glinting in her hair, on her skin. This strong a reaction hadn\u2019t happened in so long, she\u2019d almost forgotten she was capable of it.</p><p>Hate fil ed her, joining the ice. So much hate. She hated these men, hated what they\u2019d planned. Hated that they lived.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t al ow them to live.</p><p>Amun managed to throw the bundle of bodies off him and jump to his feet. His weapons had been ripped from his grip, so he used his fists now, pummeling with al his might.</p><p>But every time he cracked one of those fatheads to the side, breaking the spinal cord, the men would shake off the blow and attack with new fervor. Then one of them realized Haidee was alone, seemingly unprotected and disengaged.</p><p>His grin was evil.</p><p>Hers was worse. \u201cCome here,\u201d she said with such calm even she was surprised.</p><p>Those black eyes narrowed, a forked tongue swiping over too-thin lips. Though he was obviously suspicious about her sudden eagerness, the man complied, moving closer.</p><p>He pushed her down the moment he reached her, throwing himself on top of her, trying to rip off her jeans. Haidee let him, helped him, wrapping her arms around him and pressing her lips into his.</p><p>His tongue thrust out, hard, attempting to pry her teeth apart. He needn\u2019t have bothered. She opened wil ingly, blowing the ice of her breath, the very hate of her soul, straight into his mouth. He convulsed. In shock, perhaps, or maybe in fear. Or even pain. She wanted him to feel pain.</p><p>Then he stil ed, unable to move, literal y frozen, but that wasn\u2019t enough. He hadn\u2019t suffered enough.</p><p>She shoved him off of her and stood, distantly noting the blue pal or of his skin, the unmoving features, the stiffness of his body. More. She needed more. More ice, more hate, more death. These men deserved to die. Her mind locked on that thought\u2014deserved, deserved, deserved\u2014and glided to the heap of struggling bodies, brushing her fingers over one, then the other. They, too, froze in place, their skin hardening as the ice flowed over them.</p><p>More. Deserved. The remaining three offenders noticed the condition of their friends and leapt away from Amun, watching her through horror-fil ed eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014what\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer!\u201d</p><p>Amun pushed to his feet, stepping away from her, as wel .</p><p>His expression was unreadable.</p><p>More. Deserved. She walked toward the men, and they scampered backward, tripping over their own feet, fal ing.</p><p>More. Deserved.</p><p>Haidee.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d she said. \u201cTaste me.\u201d</p><p>Haidee.</p><p>Amun\u2019s voice pushed through some of the ice, but not the hate. She hated these men, knew they had to die by her hand. She reached out. One touch, just a single touch, and she would have what she wanted.</p><p>Their destruction.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s destruction. Yes, everyone\u2019s. She had only to finish with these two, and she could move on, destroy everyone.</p><p>They crab-crawled backward, desperate to escape her.</p><p>One of them wasn\u2019t fast enough, and she managed to latch onto his ankle. She grinned. He seemed to turn into stone right before her eyes. More. Deserved.</p><p>Haidee, sweetheart. Look at me.</p><p>Sweetheart. She liked when Amun cal ed her sweetheart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He made her feel special. A little more of the ice inside her melted. Until she realized her final target was only a few steps away. More. Deserved. Destruction within her reach.</p><p>Haidee, sweetheart. Look at me. Please.</p><p>Again the ice melted, and this time Amun\u2019s plea reached even her hatred, muting the coldest threads.</p> <p>Slowly she turned to face him. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d The frosty rage in her voice stunned her. Upset her.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t be directed at Amun.</p><p>The last man is gone, sweetheart. You can come back to me now.</p><p>Come back to him? What did he mean by that? She was right here, right in front of him. Frowning, she stepped toward him. She would shake him, make him realize.</p><p>Like the enemy had done, he backed away. Sweetheart.</p> <p>Your eyes are pure white, and even being near you is painful to me. I need you to come back to me.</p><p>Sweetheart again. More of the ice melted, and the hate muted yet another degree, then another, until the emotion was at a low simmer. She hurt him? She didn\u2019t want to hurt Amun. Ever. She just wanted to love...him.</p><p>Her knees almost gave out. Love? Did she love him?</p><p>As the question echoed through her mind, she swayed, a wave of dizziness sweeping her. Just before she hit the ground, strong arms banded around her and kept her upright.</p><p>There you are, sweetheart. I knew you\u2019d come back to me.</p><p>Amun held her tightly to his side, and to her relief, he didn\u2019t freeze. In fact, his heat wrapped around her, melting the rest of the ice.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, voice shaking. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t be sorry. You saved our asses. Now come on. We need to get out of here before reinforcements show up.</p><p>\u201cYe seek the Horsemen, do ye? Don\u2019t deny. I heard,\u201d a smal voice suddenly said behind them. \u201cCome, come. I show ye.\u201d</p><p>Amun turned them both, and when she focused she saw a tiny female with the lower half of a bul and the top half of a human. Smal hands waved them forward.</p><p>\u201cThis be fun,\u201d the female said with a shady giggle. \u201cCome, come, I show ye.\u201d She darted away before they could reply.</p><p>We\u2019re going to go with her. We don\u2019t have any other choice.</p><p>\u201cYes, we do. We can choose not to go with her.\u201d With Haidee\u2019s luck, the creature would lead them into a nest of vipers, piranha and rape-minded giants. Oh, wait. Been there, done that. What came next would probably be worse.</p><p>My demon went silent the moment you\u2014 He stopped himself. The moment she\u2019d...what? Become consumed by the cold? My demon is stil silent, which means I can\u2019t figure out where the Horsemen are located. That little female is our only shot. Just don\u2019t let anything happen to me, okay?</p> <p>Amun said with what seemed to be...humor?</p><p>No, surely not. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever heard him joke with her before. And real y, not many men could tease their woman about being stronger than they were. \u201cI, uh, won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Thank you. The semblance of a smile curled the corners of his lips as he ushered her forward, quickly closing the distance to reach Bul Girl. The almost-grin stunned her more than his teasing. He was just so beautiful, and as amused as he clearly was, he was also distracting.</p><p>Love, she thought again.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t love him. She was careful, always careful, to guard her heart. Yes, she lusted for Amun, cared for him, wanted him safe and happy. That didn\u2019t mean she loved him, though. Love weakened, made you vulnerable.</p><p>Especial y love that wasn\u2019t returned.</p><p>\u201cHere, here,\u201d the now-bouncing creature said. She stopped in front of the biggest tent in the area, laughter and smoke drifting from the seams in the front flap. \u201cThey be here. This be fun.\u201d</p><p>Only then did Haidee recal the old woman\u2019s earlier warning. Death. Pain. Screaming.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>THEY WERE SMOKING CIGARS and playing poker.</p><p>Amun had never seen the four horsemen of the Apocalypse before, but despite the crowd of demons hovering around them, he recognized them instantly. They sat around a table comprised of barbed wire, enveloped in a tobacco-scented haze. Three males, one female, and al four were physical y perfect beings. Even more so than Zacharel. Or Wil iam.</p><p>He studied them. Friend or foe? The female had flaxen hair that waved to her waist, iridescent sparkles woven through the strands, and eyes of the deepest purple. The males were a colorful mix, one raven-haired, one sandy-locked, and one completely bald, his scalp tanned to a golden glow.</p><p>They wore clothes very similar to Amun\u2019s. Black shirts, black pants. They were relaxed, laughing seductively as they revealed their cards, then ribbing the losers unmerciful y. What gave them away was the color of their auras. Amun had never noticed anyone\u2019s aura before, but these were undeniable. The shades enveloped them like a second skin, the female\u2019s white, one of the males\u2019 red, one black and one a pale green.</p><p>The Rainbow Brigade, he thought.</p><p>Haidee stepped to his side and was given her first ful look at them. She gasped.</p><p>Amun\u2019s jaw clenched\u2014me, only want me\u2014but the sound prodded Secrets from his hiding place as effectively as her coldness had driven him there earlier. While Amun had battled the six men who\u2019d wanted to \u201cborrow\u201d her, she\u2019d turned into ice walking. Her hair had morphed into icicles, her skin had looked like crystal and her eyes...her eyes had lost al hint of color.</p><p>He\u2019d been riveted by the beauty of her, queen of the winter storm, and awed by the strength of her. His demon had been terrified, retreating as deep into his mind as possible.</p><p>The others had felt the pul of her again, even though she hadn\u2019t touched Amun. They\u2019d fought, screamed. Yeah, they\u2019d done that before, but never that quickly or that determinedly.</p><p>He just didn\u2019t know what to do about it.</p><p>Whatever kept Haidee from dying eternal y, whatever brought her back to life again and again, had to be responsible for her change. No mere human could do that.</p><p>What that made her, what that was, though, he stil didn\u2019t know, and he wasn\u2019t sure Secrets had the bal s to try and find out. Stil . They were going to have to merge with her mind again.</p><p>Amun had to know the truth. And maybe, with the answer, he could find a way to save her from the torture of being reanimated. Of course, that meant she would die permanently one day, and he couldn\u2019t even contemplate that without sickening.</p><p>She was his.</p><p>And he was going to have her. Al of her. Yes, the cold he felt while they pleasured each other could hurt him. He realized that now. But he wasn\u2019t going to let something as minor as freezing to death stop him from being with her.</p><p>He\u2019d already lost the war with his resolve to stay away from her. While they were down here, at least.</p><p>Up there, they would part, and that knowledge only increased his urgency to have her. Tonight. Tonight, he wiped her former boyfriend from her mind and claimed every inch of her.</p><p>At least Secrets wasn\u2019t whimpering, or the others screaming, because she stood at his side. That was a start. Secrets was too focused on the Horsemen and their thoughts\u2014or rather, what consisted of their thoughts\u2014</p><p>enjoying the puzzle of them. There was a strange buzzing noise inside White\u2019s head, shrieks inside Red\u2019s, moans inside Black\u2019s and utter silence inside Green\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cShe the one who iced the congo?\u201d Red asked no one in particular. A cigar hung from the side of his mouth.</p><p>The crowd final y noticed Amun and Haidee. Some snarled and flashed their teeth, some licked their lips in glee, but al left the tent as if their feet were on fire. Only the Horsemen remained.</p><p>The congo. The men who\u2019d thought to beat him to pulp, al owing them to rape and dismember Haidee without interference? Most likely. Guys had been as big as apes, with a mind-set to match, so the name fit.</p><p>\u201cI believe I asked you a question, warrior.\u201d Red tossed the cards atop the tabletop and turned, eyes of the cruelest blue leveling on Amun. The shrieks inside the being\u2019s head increased in volume. Secrets burrowed through them, stil seeking thoughts and intentions. \u201cI\u2019l hear your answer now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Haidee said, answering for him. She sounded confident, unafraid. But for once, Amun could feel the emotions pouring off her. His brave girl was terrified but determined. \u201cI did. I iced them.\u201d</p><p>If the Horsemen thought to punish her... Amun curled his fingers around a blade the congo hadn\u2019t managed to steal from him, ready, almost eager.</p><p>\u201cVery cool,\u201d Black said, waving them over with a smile that did little to soothe Amun\u2019s dark mood. \u201cSit, sit. We\u2019ve been expecting you.\u201d</p><p>They had, had they?</p><p>Amun needed a better read on them, and suspected Secrets would have an easier time sorting through the noise if Haidee wasn\u2019t there. Yet he couldn\u2019t be without her.</p><p>Not just to guard her\u2014not that she needed guarding, because damn, he was stil in shock over her ability\u2014but because the other demons inside him might use her absence to overtake him. He would lose focus, returning to that mindless state of horror and pain.</p><p>Stand behind me and press your back into the tent flap, he told her as he moved forward. He gave her a gentle push in that direction. You\u2019ve got a weapon?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She didn\u2019t question him, but he knew she wanted to. Once again, he wished the connection went both ways, that she could push her voice into his head. Why the hel couldn\u2019t she? Just then he wouldn\u2019t have minded if she heard every thought he had, knew every urge he experienced. Her safety came before everything else.</p><p>He eased into the only empty seat at the table, the horsemen encasing him from every angle. He studied their faces more intently, noting the flawlessness of their skin, the purity of their eyes, the utter amusement in their expressions.</p><p>Amusement? Why?</p><p>Amusement? Why?</p><p>Amun knew the moment Haidee did as he\u2019d ordered and increased the distance between them, because Secrets sighed in relief and homed in on the three males and the female, at last digging past the buzzing, shrieking, moaning and silence.</p><p>\u2014so damn bored... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2014most fun I\u2019ve had in a while...</p><p>\u2014too bad we have to kil him...</p><p>\u2014girl might be useful, though...</p> <p>The other demons cackled, a thousand wind chimes in a storm. They weren\u2019t so loud that they overpowered Amun\u2019s other thoughts, and they weren\u2019t so stalwart they overwhelmed him with dark urges. Oh, he could feel the things they wanted him to do. Taste the Horsemen\u2019s blood, cause their screams. They\u2019d been locked away so long, they were desperate. They also sensed Haidee was nearby, the frost of her skin like an invisible tether, and so they behaved. He could deal.</p><p>\u201cYou want safe passage from this realm,\u201d Red said, a statement of fact, not a question.</p><p>\u201cAs with everything here, you must buy that passage,\u201d White added, her voice as lilting and delicate as a snowfal .</p><p>Black smiled at him, al teeth and menace. \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready for this.\u201d</p><p>Green, he noticed, never spoke a word. Just watched them al through enigmatic eyes. Amun felt a momentary sense of kinship.</p> <p>He nodded at each of them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l play two hands,\u201d Red said. \u201cNo more, no less. If you lose, you wil give me a hand. And I don\u2019t mean a round of applause. Feel me?\u201d</p><p>Behind him, Haidee choked on a breath.</p><p>I\u2019l be fine, sweetheart, he told her, even as he arched a brow at his opponents. Ask them what happens if they lose to me.</p><p>She obeyed, her voice strained. He was proud of her. She was scared but unbending, used to being in control, but al owing him to lead.</p><p>Red shrugged one of his massive shoulders, his attention never veering from Amun. \u201cIf I lose, I\u2019l escort you out of this realm myself.\u201d</p> <p>Secrets released an uneasy sigh. Over the centuries, Amun had learned the subtle nuances of his demon and knew Secrets sensed something amiss but hadn\u2019t yet figured out what.</p><p>So now came the real negotiation. Ask them what happens to you during\u2014and after\u2014al of this, he told Haidee. What happens to you if I win, and what happens to you if I lose.</p><p>Once again she obeyed, and al four of the Horsemen grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhy does the woman speak for you?\u201d White asked in that snowflake voice, ignoring the question. She was frowning, clearly unable to think up a logical reason on her own.</p><p>\u201cTel us what we want to know,\u201d Haidee insisted, ignoring the question.</p><p>Good girl.</p><p>Black lost his battle to hide his amusement and gave them another toothy grin. \u201cWe keep you no matter the outcome, of course.\u201d</p><p>Amun leapt to his feet and slammed his dagger into the middle of the deck, causing the table to rattle.</p> <p>\u201cDo you need me to interpret that?\u201d Haidee asked with false sweetness.</p><p>Rather than angering them, Amun\u2019s outburst and Haidee\u2019s insult increased their enjoyment. Chuckling, Red waved him back in his seat. \u201cFine, fine. The girl wil share your fate. If you lose a hand, she loses a hand. If you win, she wins and leaves with you. Happy now?\u201d Hardly. Tel them if I lose the first game, they may take both my hands but neither of yours.</p><p>Of course, Haidee did not obey.</p><p>Mine wil grow back, woman. Eventual y. Tel them.</p><p>Stil she remained silent.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t turn back and glare at her; they would suspect he communicated with her telepathical y. Not knowing what else to do, he signed the words, hoping one of the Horsemen knew the language. To his astonishment, al of them did, for they al nodded with satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cVery wel ,\u201d Red said, \u201cwe wil take both of yours and neither of hers. But then there won\u2019t be a reason to play a second game. We\u2019l have what we wanted. Both of your hands.\u201d</p><p>Why did they want them? Just pick a different prize for the second. Like...my feet.</p><p>Haidee growled low in her throat, a predator ready to pounce. He knew she could hear his thoughts as he signed, but there was nothing he could do to comfort her. \u201cI don\u2019t agree to those terms.\u201d</p><p>Everyone ignored her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Red nodded. \u201cYour feet wil be a nice addition to our col ection. We accept. Two rounds wil be played, after al .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmun\u2014\u201d Haidee began.</p><p>Amun held up his hand for silence, and he could feel the malevolence pulsing off her. Later, she would make him pay. But she would have the necessary appendages to do so, so he wasn\u2019t too concerned. To the Horsemen, he signed, What are the rules?</p><p>They looked at each other, genuinely perplexed by his question.</p><p>\u201cRules?\u201d White asked, blinking.</p><p>O-kay. Clearly the Rainbow Brigade lived by a code of its own making.</p><p>Secrets confirmed the suspicion. Suddenly Amun knew that there was no black and white with them, only shades of gray, and they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to lie, cheat or trick to get what they wanted.</p><p>Trusting them in any way would guarantee his loss. Use the backpack to produce a new deck of cards, he told Haidee.</p><p>A few seconds later, she was strol ing to his side. Secrets whimpered, the other demons cried out in pain, and then utter silence claimed his head. She angrily slapped the deck into his hand and stomped back to her post without a word. When they were once again distanced from each other, al of the demons peeked from their hiding places.</p><p>Secrets was a bit more subdued, afraid she would return at any moment.</p><p>The fear would have to be addressed, he realized. Secrets was a part of him. Amun relied on the beast and needed him at his best in dangerous situations. And as each new realm offered more danger than the last, that would have to be addressed soon.</p><p>Red leaned forward to study the new stack, and their fingers brushed.</p><p>In that split second, Secrets soaked up as much information as possible. Wil iam had created these creatures. Whether through conventional means or not, the demon couldn\u2019t tel . Al he knew was that they had purged some of the darkness inside of Wil iam and they both hated and adored the man for it, at once wanting to destroy and worship him.</p><p>They were too destructive to be loosed on earth, and so they had been bound to this underworld, but those bonds had begun to wither the day Wil iam had left them, and were now worn thin. Every kindness they dealt freed them a little more. But kindness was not part of their makeup and they had to actively ponder how to be nice.</p><p>One day, they would be free of this place. One day, they would return to their creator. Until then, they waited impatiently, biding their time, amusing themselves as best they could. And they planned to use Amun as fodder for their amusement for a long, long time.</p><p>They had no plans to cheat. That was their kindness to Amun\u2014and they\u2019d been considering how to go about this for centuries. Centuries. Here, there was no past or future.</p><p>Only present, a present that somehow bled into that nonexistent past and future. They had known he would come. Just as they knew he would lose.</p><p>\u201cEverything is acceptable, I take it,\u201d Red said. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>He had Secrets; he could win. He hoped. He nodded.</p><p>Black\u2019s lips twitched at the corners, as if he fought another grin. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t asking if you agreed, demon. He was tel ing you to deal the cards. You know Texas Hold \u2019Em, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Amun gave another nod. Tense, he shuffled the deck and tossed the cards. He\u2019d played before. Anyone who was friends with Strider had played. Defeat fed on victories, and between battles with Hunters, he often chal enged the men around him.</p><p>Amun couldn\u2019t afford to lose, and even though his opponents were playing honorably, that didn\u2019t mean he had to.</p><p>Secrets. I need you. What do they have? Even as he asked, he looked at his own hand. Al right. Not bad. A pair of eights to kick things off. If there was another eight in the flop, giving him a three of a kind, he just might bring home the first victory.</p><p>As usual, Secrets didn\u2019t speak to him outright, but suddenly Amun knew that White and Black were his only competition this round. White had an ace and a king, and Black had the potential for a flush.</p><p>He knew, too, that the card he wanted for himself waited at the bottom of the deck. So Amun bottom dealt the turn and the river and ended up with three of a kind, just as he\u2019d wanted. His excitement was short-lived, however. Black beat him with the aforementioned flush. That quickly, and that easily.</p><p>Damn. His stomach tightened with dread as he leaned back in his chair. If ever a man needed his hands, it was Amun. But he wouldn\u2019t fight the Horsemen when they removed his. He had another round to play, after al .</p><p>A grinning Black withdrew a serrated blade from his boot.</p><p>A blade already coated with blood. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s see the prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can he play the next round without his hands?\u201d</p><p>Haidee yel ed. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019l have to deal the next round for him,\u201d White interjected without a hint of mercy.</p><p>No, Amun signed. If she remained near him during the next round, his demon wouldn\u2019t be able to read the Horsemen and their cards. He would lose his advantage\u2014not that it had helped him so far.</p><p>Haidee\u2019s clothing rustled, as if she were moving away from her perch. I agreed to this, he told her. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019l be fine. I\u2019l find a way to play. Again, he hoped. I need you to stay where you are. That\u2019s the most important thing right now.</p><p>Thank the gods, the rustling stopped. He placed his arms on the tabletop. Gideon had had his hands chopped off twice in his lifetime. If Gideon could survive, Amun could, too. He only regretted the fact that he wouldn\u2019t be able to touch Haidee tonight as he\u2019d dreamed.</p><p>Before he had time to move, or protest, or change his mind, Black struck. Boom. Metal sliced through the bone in his left wrist before hitting the barbed table. Blood squirted, and sharp, agonizing pain exploded through Amun\u2019s arm, swiftly sharp, agonizing pain exploded through Amun\u2019s arm, swiftly traveling through the rest of his body. He thought he heard Haidee scream, then soft hands were smoothing over his back, feminine whispers drifting through his ears.</p><p>Worth it, he thought, panting, sweating. He wouldn\u2019t have let them take one of her precious hands for any reason.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t hurt him again,\u201d she was crying. \u201cPlease, take one of mine. Don\u2019t do this to\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Black struck again, taking the other hand.</p><p>Haidee released another agonized scream. Dizziness swam through him, as did more of that pain, but he didn\u2019t al ow himself to even grunt. He compressed his lips and held everything inside, watching as White lifted the unattached hands and studied them.</p><p>\u201cNice and strong,\u201d she said with satisfaction.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019l like his feet better,\u201d Red said. \u201cWe can actual y walk a mile in his shoes.\u201d</p><p>Every member of the Rainbow Brigade laughed.</p><p>Tel them...tel them to start...the next round, he managed to gasp to Haidee. He didn\u2019t dare look up at her. She was sobbing, he could feel the icy splash of her tears on his cheeks. Those tears would unman him, enrage him, and now wasn\u2019t actual y an optimal time to fight the Horsemen.</p><p>Silent, ignoring his demand, she placed her own hands over his gushing wrists and an icy sheen spread, stopping the crimson flow and causing Secrets to scramble to the back of Amun\u2019s mind...fade. The other demons screamed as Haidee had done, rushing to hide deeper inside him.</p><p>\u201cThe old cards are covered in blood,\u201d she said. \u201cHere\u2019s a new set.\u201d Then she released him, picked up the new deck and shuffled. She was trembling. Amun couldn\u2019t find the strength to send her away, no matter how desperately he needed his demon\u2019s aid.</p> <p>The second game started a moment later, but his brain was foggy, his reactions slow. He wasn\u2019t sure how he remained in his chair, but he did. He wasn\u2019t sure what cards the Horsemen possessed, or even what kind of cards he possessed. His vision swam, blurring the numbers and pictures.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d Haidee asked him, fear wafting from the words.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d White said. \u201cTel us al .\u201d</p><p>Do you know how to play? he asked, ignoring the Horsewoman.</p><p>Haidee gave the slightest nod.</p><p>He peered at his cards, wil ing away the haze. His determination paid off, and he final y saw what he had.</p> <p>Better than what he\u2019d expected. He concentrated on the flop, again staring until his eyesight cleared. He needed an ace of hearts and he\u2019d have a royal flush. Anything else, and he\u2019d have nothing.</p><p>What did his opponents have?</p><p>Nothing with the potential of his hand; he would just have to work that to his advantage.</p><p>In the first hand, no one had folded. Because they hadn\u2019t been playing for stakes, just the end results.</p><p>Time to change that. Tel them we want to up the pot.</p><p>After only a moment\u2019s hesitation, she did, and each of the four leaned forward, utterly interested. Amun outlined his demands to Haidee, and she peered down at him for a long while, eyes wide and face pale.</p><p>Do it! he snapped.</p><p>\u201cI have a proposition for you al ,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you lose, each of you wil owe my friend here a year of service when you final y leave this place.\u201d Something they would find reprehensible, Amun knew. \u201cAnd if he loses, wel , he\u2019l give you more than just his feet. He\u2019l give you me.\u201d</p> <p>That isn\u2019t what I said, damn it! He\u2019d told her to offer him, al of him. Tel them what I real y said. Now.</p><p>She shook her head, enraging him.</p><p>The Horsemen studied the flop, gauging what cards Amun might have. They had to know how close he was to that royal flush\u2014or think he had one already, since he was risking everything.</p><p>\u201cIf you fold now, however,\u201d she went on, \u201cyou wil be exempt from the new agreement.\u201d</p><p>Haidee, damn it. Tel them they can\u2019t have you! If you don\u2019t, I\u2019l do it. I\u2019l start speaking, and you know what happens then. He wouldn\u2019t risk her, not for any reason.</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>He opened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThe new terms are acceptable,\u201d Red said before he could utter a single word.</p><p>And just like that, there was no backing down. The stakes had been set. Amun wanted to vomit.</p><p>White and Black folded, eliminating fifty percent of the competition and leaving only Red and Green. As he\u2019d hoped. The rest of the flop was dealt, and Red practical y hummed with satisfaction.</p><p>Green threw his cards onto the floor and spit on them. He hadn\u2019t gotten what he\u2019d wanted.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have?\u201d Haidee demanded of Red.</p><p>He flipped one card, then the other. Ful house, Amun realized, queen over nines.</p><p>Haidee sucked in a breath. \u201cAmun wins.\u201d Grinning now, she tossed his cards at Red. \u201cYou lose. Both you and your friend owe him a year of service.\u201d</p><p>Merciful gods. He\u2019d gotten his royal flush.</p><p>Al four Horsemen pushed to their feet, scowling over at him, their auras pulsing brightly. Red and Green even leapt at him. But everything\u2014the males, the female, the smoke, the tent\u2014disappeared in flash, before a single point of contact could be made.</p><p>The cave once again surrounded him and Haidee.</p><p>They were alone, he realized just before the haze returned.</p><p>He was bombarded with relief, and that relief wiped out the adrenaline rush he\u2019d fought so hard to maintain. He col apsed, unable to hold his own weight a second longer.</p><p>He was panting harder, sweating more profusely, the pain no longer hidden by duty.</p><p>How? he asked. He was certain he\u2019d won that final round How? he asked. He was certain he\u2019d won that final round through dishonorable means. Not that he cared. He simply needed to know in case the Horsemen returned and chal enged him.</p><p>Haidee crouched at his side and placed the backpack on his stomach. \u201cThe angel said the pack would give us everything we needed to survive, so I asked for a deck of cards that would stay ordered in a way that would give you an undefeatable hand, even after I shuffled them. And now I\u2019m asking for literal hands.\u201d As she spoke, she stuffed his arms inside.</p><p>The movement blasted the pain to another level, and he passed out before he discovered the results.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>STRIDER POSITIONED HIMSELF on the thick branch of an oak tree, surrounded by lush foliage and darkness. The clouds were thick and gray tonight, shielding the moon and stars and scenting the air with promised rain. The perfect atmosphere for fighting. Of course, he would have said the same thing if the sun had been shining brightly.</p><p>Planning an ambush was a lot more fun than vacationing with a horny immortal of questionable morals, a depressed, drugged-out warrior looking for his lost love and a forked-tongued little Harpy who rubbed his nerves raw.</p><p>Wil iam had decided he wanted no part in the coming battle. Said he couldn\u2019t risk injury when he had more important things to do, or some shit like that. So he\u2019d taken off for Gil y\u2019s family home. Paris had just screwed a random stranger, his strength returned, his body healed, and was in the process of gathering weapons for The Stupid-Ass Chase, as Strider was now cal ing it. But Kaia, wel , she was perched in the tree across from Strider\u2019s, waiting for the Hunters to find them.</p><p>They\u2019d left a subtle but clear trail, acting as if they only wanted to camp and screw.</p><p>Below them was a tent, a crackling fire that cast only the barest hint of gold, hot dog weenies roasting on a portable gril \u2014turned to its lowest setting, of course\u2014and a lawn chair with a CPR dummy lounging on the plastic. How Kaia had produced the thing, he didn\u2019t know and wasn\u2019t going to ask. The stupid thing looked like him and had clearly been stabbed. Repeatedly. In the groin.</p><p>He thought she might have used the dummy for target practice, and tried not to be offended. Key word: tried.</p><p>What had he ever done to piss her off? Wel , besides annoy the hel out of her. But that had only happened recently, and she must have had that dummy for weeks.</p><p>There were just so many slashes.</p><p>Suddenly his branch bounced, the leaves rattling together.</p><p>He bit the inside of his cheek. He didn\u2019t have to look to know what had just happened. Kaia had decided to join him. She stil smel ed like cinnamon rol s, and his mouth stil watered every time she neared him.</p><p>\u201cYou have your own tree, woman,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cYou said you\u2019d stay on yours, and I\u2019d stay on mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, wel , I lied.\u201d Kaia settled next to him, completely at ease. \u201cThat happens. Get used to it. Besides, yours is prettier.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t al ow himself the luxury of looking at her. One, he\u2019d already memorized her features. In his mind, he saw the glossy red of her hair, so much like flames. Saw those gray-gold hawk eyes framed by lashes the same shade of red as her hair. Saw that pixie nose, those siren lips. Two, she would distract him\u2014more than she already was. And with her litany of chal enges stil ringing in his head, she\u2019d made certain he couldn\u2019t afford a distraction.</p><p>He wished his demon would get the message.</p><p>Ever since she\u2019d opened that fire-and-brimstone mouth of hers in the car, Defeat had been supercharged. Eager, humming with nervousness, but also with great waves of anticipation. She was a worthy opponent, strong, brave and fearless. Besting her would be a thril unlike any other, and a sexual high the likes of which he\u2019d never experienced. As many battles as he\u2019d fought over the centuries, he knew it, felt it. Wanted it.</p><p>And yeah, some of Strider\u2019s anger with Kaia had drained as they\u2019d staged the campsite. She was just so unabashedly female, so unrepentantly aggressive, and he admired those qualities. But that didn\u2019t mean he liked her liked her.</p><p>The burn of her gaze brought him back to the present. She was studying him, taking his measure.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asked, checking the site on the rifle mounted beside him. \u201cWhy did you ask Lucien to find me?</p><p>The truth this time.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, her breath warm as it drifted over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I wanted to be with Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Try again. You\u2019ve slept with Paris, and you know he can\u2019t have you again.\u201d Irritation had crept into his voice, and he didn\u2019t know why. What did he care if this gorgeous Harpy had welcomed his friend into her bed? She wasn\u2019t his, and he felt no sense of possession toward her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I wanted to make Wil iam jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Strider said, his irritation rising for whatever reason. \u201cLucien said you\u2019d specifical y asked for me, and you don\u2019t need me to make Wil iam jealous. He\u2019d offer himself up for your pleasure, even if you just wanted to carve the Chinese symbol for dumbass in his chest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She paused, tensed. Then she grumbled, \u201cFine. I admit it. I wanted to be with you.\u201d</p><p>Harpies were notorious liars, as she\u2019d admitted, but in this instance, he suspected she was final y tel ing the truth. Not because he was hot and most females wanted him. Wel , yeah, he was hot and most females wanted him. But there had to be another reason.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he insisted. \u201cAnd don\u2019t give me that shit about being bored, because I also want to know why you tracked my Hunters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour Hunters?\u201d She snorted, every inch the warrior. \u201cWhen you weren\u2019t tracking them yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaia. Please.\u201d</p><p>She sighed again, the second caress of her breath making his muscles go rigid. \u201cLookit. You don\u2019t know this, but I was in the clouds with Bianka when you brought that female Hunter to the fortress.</p><p>You...desired her and hated yourself for it.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. If there was one topic guaranteed to blacken his mood, it was Haidee. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDuh. While I\u2019m in the clouds, I can watch anyone I want.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d wanted to watch him? \u201cWhy me?\u201d he demanded again.</p><p>Another pause, this one brittle with increased tension. \u201cI...</p><p>like you,\u201d she eventual y admitted.</p><p>The words had him stiffening al over again. There was so much longing in her tone, he wanted to cover his ears. \u201cAs a friend, right?\u201d He did not need a Harpy crushing on him.</p><p>Especial y now. Harpies were more determined, more stubborn than a pack of rabid pit bul s.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, tracing something on the space between them. \u201cNot as a friend.\u201d</p><p>Defeat\u2019s attention switched from the coming battle to the Harpy. Winning her heart would be\u2014</p><p>No. His hands curled into fists. No. He didn\u2019t want to win her heart. Her body, yes. His cock was fil ing, hardening, suddenly desperate to feel the slick glide of her inner wal s.</p><p>He shook his head when he realized the direction of his thoughts. He didn\u2019t want to win her body, either.</p><p>Gentle, he had to be gentle with her. If he hurt her feelings with a rejection, she would hurt his face with her claws. The situation was as simple as that. \u201cKaia. You slept with Paris.</p><p>One of my best friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever made a mistake? I mean, you stil smel like the stripper you banged. The one wearing the peach-scented body oil.\u201d</p><p>He understood her hatred for peaches now. She\u2019d been\u2014</p> <p>was\u2014jealous. That did not please him. \u201cOkay, so, yeah. I\u2019ve clearly made mistakes, and I don\u2019t blame you for yours. But I\u2019m not going to sleep with you.\u201d Defeat might have whimpered. You\u2019re afraid of her, remember? \u201cSome of the guys can share. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I wouldn\u2019t be with anyone else while we were together,\u201d</p><p>she whispered, and his chest ached.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t know better, he would think she was...vulnerable right now. But he did know better.</p><p>Harpies were as hard as steel. Nothing intimidated them, nothing softened them.</p><p>They wanted something badly enough, they took it, and that was that. She probably just saw him as a chal enge, something to tame. Gods knew enough women had tried and failed over the centuries. Gods also knew he understood the al ure of a chal enge.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said, stil using that gentle tone. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to share with Amun,\u201d she replied, trembling now. \u201cYou wanted his woman. Would have taken her if she\u2019d wanted you in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t, and I won\u2019t. Why do you think I left the fortress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel ,\u201d she huffed, \u201cjust so you know, I didn\u2019t ask you to nail me. I just wanted to go on a date with you, maybe get to know you better.\u201d</p><p>So she could hop into bed with Paris, no preliminaries, but Strider needed to wine and dine her first?</p><p>And don\u2019t you dare take this as a chal enge, he snapped at his demon. The beast had gone quiet, ceasing that annoying humming, waiting for Strider to reply to her, waiting for Kaia\u2019s next response.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s backtrack a little,\u201d he said. Maybe, if he prodded her enough, her desire for him would fade.</p><p>\u201cYou saw that I wanted the Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I realized I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Again, he doubted she lied. \u201cSo you tracked the other Hunters because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you distracted by them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you focused on me.\u201d</p><p>He was not pleased by that, either. When are you going to stop lying to yourself? \u201cOn dating you, not sleeping with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though I wanted someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>Time to go in for the kil . \u201cI\u2019l be honest with you, Kaia.</p><p>Ultimately, I need a woman who won\u2019t chal enge me.\u201d Which wil bore the hel out of you, common sense piped up.</p><p>Strider ignored his stupid common sense. \u201cI hate what happens when I lose, and with you, everything would be a chal enge.\u201d And exciting. And nerve-racking.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held up his hand for silence. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to help yourself. Look where we are, think about what we\u2019re doing. You chal enged me to kil more Hunters than you do, for gods\u2019 sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was for your own good,\u201d she protested. \u201cYou were depressed or something and not taking care of business, which placed you in al kinds of danger. I was helping you, damn it!\u201d</p><p>Maybe. Maybe not. \u201cWel , your help has ensured that I slaughter anyone who\u2019s foolish enough to track me. Your help ruined my much-needed vacation.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Final y he al owed himself to look at her. She was stil watching him, those beautiful gray-gold eyes wide and glassy, as if she was fighting tears. A Harpy, cry? Not bloody likely. She was just disappointed that she wasn\u2019t getting her way, he rationalized, but that didn\u2019t stop the ache from blooming in his chest again.</p><p>Didn\u2019t stop a wave of guilt and remorse from winding through him. He had hurt her.</p><p>\u201cKaia,\u201d he began, then paused. He didn\u2019t know what else to say.</p><p>In the distance, a twig had snapped.</p><p>Both he and Kaia stil ed, not even daring to breathe. They waited...waited...but no other sounds were forthcoming.</p><p>Neither relaxed their guard, however. They knew.</p><p>The Hunters had final y arrived.</p><p>How many men had Haidee\u2019s man brought with him?</p><p>Defeat started humming again, prowling through Strider\u2019s head as he focused on the battle. Win. Win, win, win.</p><p>Strider leaned into the rifle he\u2019d propped at his side, studying his surroundings through the night-vision scope.</p><p>Night-vision was both a blessing and a curse. Using the scope cut through the darkness, sure, but afterward, he wouldn\u2019t be able to see shit without it, even in the light.</p><p>There. He spotted...six men inching toward the camp. A slight adjustment of his alignment, and he saw...six more men doing the same on the other side. Twelve soldiers, then. Unless there were more behind him, of course, and he would bet his ass there were.</p><p>His heartbeat quickened with a hot surge of excitement.</p><p>Much as he\u2019d chastised Kaia, he real y did love to fight. He loved the adrenaline rush, the knowledge that he was one step closer to final y winning the war with the Hunters.</p><p>The branch he perched upon suddenly shuddered the slightest bit. His jaw clenched as the leaves rattled together, announcing his location. Kaia had just jumped down. No one seemed to notice her, or him, however.</p><p>Win, Defeat said. Win!</p><p>I know. I wil .</p><p>A shriek rent the air. A Harpy\u2019s high-pitched shriek.</p><p>A second later, he heard a pop and a whiz. The sounds of silencers, bul ets. Next he heard a crack. The sound of a target being hit. The lawn chair shook, the dummy\u2019s body jolting.</p><p>Strider lined a target of his own in his sights\u2014chest, dead center\u2014and softly squeezed the rifle\u2019s trigger.</p><p>There was a scream, then a grunt, and his victim tumbled down, face-first in the dirt.</p><p>The rest of the Hunters rushed into the camp, a few attacking the dummy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fake,\u201d someone snapped.</p><p>\u201cAmbush?\u201d someone else said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay on alert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpread out. Anything moves, anything at al , shoot to kil . I don\u2019t give a flying fuck about setting some crazed demon free. I want the host dead. The keeper of Defeat deserves to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate that bastard,\u201d another murmured.</p><p>There was another scream, this one shril and desperate.</p><p>Kaia must have struck\u2014with her claws. Damn it. He couldn\u2019t al ow her to best him.</p><p>Strider angled his gun. Fired. Hit someone else in the chest. Angled. Fired. Hit again. Over and over he repeated the process, quick, so quick, before anyone realized what he was doing or where he hid.</p><p>Bodies piled around his tree.</p><p>Final y the Hunters gained their bearings and spotted him.</p><p>They peppered his branch with round after round. Strider jumped, only one bul et grazing him as he fel .</p><p>Fire lanced through his arm, but it wasn\u2019t enough to slow him.</p><p>Win!</p><p>As anticipated, he only had one good eye, the other shrouded with black. He could see there were quite a few Hunters left standing, and they\u2019d already ferreted out his new locale. They converged, firing as they approached; he fired back. Before meeting them in the middle, he was struck twice, once in the shoulder and once in the stomach.</p><p>He mental y blocked the pain.</p><p>WIN!</p><p>Guns were dropped and knives grabbed. This close together, bul ets were simply too risky. Strider slashed.</p><p>Someone screamed. He slashed again. Someone else screamed. A blade slicked through his wrist, but he maintained his grip and ducked, punching, tip extended. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Contact. He hit al the way to the spine.</p><p>On and on the lethal dance continued. He was bleeding profusely but stil energized. He was winning. He even managed to toss someone into the fire.

Firelight licked at her, il uminating her beautiful skin. The makeup she always wore must have sweated off, because she glimmered with every color of the rainbow.</p> <p>In seconds, his cock was painful y hard. It\u2019s just the sexual high, he told himself. You don\u2019t want her.</p><p>Not real y. Gods, her skin...his mouth watered for a taste.</p><p>Concentrate, he had to concentrate. He hadn\u2019t seen her fight, but he had heard the results. Now her hair was in tangles, and blood was splattered over her cheeks and arms. \u201cWel ?\u201d he demanded. \u201cHow\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>Frowning at his waspish tone, she gestured behind her. He wanted to curse when he spied the pile of men she\u2019d defeated. He didn\u2019t have to count to know she\u2019d won their chal enge. His stomach tightened with dread as he waited for his knees to buckle and acid to fil his veins, destroying the pleasure.</p><p>One minute passed, then another. Nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kil any of mine,\u201d she said, buffing her claws. \u201cI just knocked them out. So feel free to do the honors yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Wait. What? She\u2019d let him win? Surely not. That was as un-Harpylike as, shit, baking an apple pie with ingredients she\u2019d purchased\u2014with money she\u2019d actual y earned. \u201cKaia</p><p>\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t say anything. The main guy, the one who wants you a lot more dead than even these guys did, isn\u2019t here. I checked. I told you he was wily, so there\u2019s no tel ing where he is or what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaia,\u201d he repeated, trying again. What he would say, though, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>She spun away from him, as if she couldn\u2019t bear to look at him a second more. \u201cI\u2019l leave you to it, then.</p><p>Goodbye, Strider.\u201d</p><p>Before he could say another word, she was gone, the tiny wings on her back giving her a speed he could never hope to match.</p><p>He stood there for the longest while, peering down at the mound of unconscious men she\u2019d left for him.</p> <p>He\u2019d won, she had made sure of that, yet in that moment, he\u2019d never felt more like a loser, and he didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>HAIDEE KNEW SHE WAS DREAMING. How else would she be seeing flashes of Amun\u2019s life?</p><p>How else would she hear what he was thinking? Currently, she saw him pacing through a sunlit bedroom she didn\u2019t recognize, his hands alternating between scrubbing over his eyes and pressing into his ears as he fought to subdue the many voices chattering inside his head. Voices that whispered one human memory after another.</p><p>He could deal with them, he knew, but his friends could not.</p><p>They had enough to agonize over and didn\u2019t need to know the vile things people thought about them, the atrocities committed every day in the homes around them.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have patrol ed the city for Hunters tonight.</p><p>Strider and Gideon could have handled the duty, no problem, despite their recent injuries. They\u2019d offered; he\u2019d turned them down, already sensing trouble on the outside and wanting to keep them safe.</p><p>Thankful y, he\u2019d only found three enemy soldiers, and kil ing them hadn\u2019t been a hardship.</p><p>The Hunters hadn\u2019t planned to engage. Amun\u2019s demon had sensed that right away. The men had wanted their female, their Bait, on the inside first. They thought she had succeeded, but they were waiting for confirmation. The moment he\u2019d realized that, Amun knew he\u2019d have to wipe one of the Hunter\u2019s minds to find out who \u201cshe\u201d was and when and where she would contact them. He\u2019d have to absorb memories, perhaps even memories of mutilating his own friends. \u2019Cause yeah, he\u2019d see through Hunter eyes, as if he was a Hunter.</p><p>\u201cAmun, man,\u201d someone cal ed from outside his room. It was Sabin. \u201cChow time.\u201d</p><p>He walked to the door and knocked, signaling he\u2019d heard.</p><p>Just as soon as he cleared his head, he\u2019d join them. The memories were stil unfolding, even though he\u2019d already uncovered the information he\u2019d wanted. The \u201cshe\u201d belonged to Kane, keeper of Disaster.</p><p>The warrior rarely dated, too afraid of hurting those around him, but the human female had captured his interest. He\u2019d have to be told. Amun would have to be the one to tel him.</p><p>Amun was always the one to break the bad news.</p><p>First, there would be denials. Then rage. Then sorrowful acceptance. But damn it, they shouldn\u2019t have to live like this! They shouldn\u2019t have to suspect everyone they encountered of using them.</p><p>For a moment, Amun\u2019s image faded from Haidee\u2019s mind and his thoughts quieted. She was shrouded in darkness and thought she might be lying down. What was that tickling her bel y? she wondered.</p><p>Before she could discover the answer, those images of Amun returned, shifted. Now he was whaling on a human male, knuckles dril ing into bone. The human was average height, on the thin side, and begging for mercy Amun refused to show.</p><p>Haidee didn\u2019t have to wonder why. Like Amun, she somehow knew what this man had been doing to his little girl. And when Amun was done, when the man was dead, he used his demon to find the little girl a safe, loving home.</p><p>Images, fading again. Voices, quieting again. Seriously.</p><p>What was tickling her bel y? Whatever it was brushed whisper-soft heat over her sensitized skin. But again, before she could reason out what was happening to her, the images in her head returned, shifted and claimed her ful attention.</p><p>This time she saw a shirtless, cut-up and bleeding Amun playing basketbal with his friends. He was grinning, laughing silently and slapping each of his buddies on their backs between cheap shots.</p><p>The boys shouted good-natured insults at him. Insults he could only return with the lifting of a single finger. No one stuck to any rules, so there was lots of tripping, elbowing and even punching, and Amun loved it. No one could beat him because he knew every move everyone planned to make before they actual y made it. Only, any time Strider went for the bal , Amun let him have it, even slowing his steps and pretending to stumble.</p><p>His past was as varied as hers, Haidee mused. But while she had always been a Hunter, driven by hate, he was so much more than a Lord of the Underworld. Which should not have been possible. A demon should be a demon. Evil, ruined. Amun cared, though. He uplifted.</p><p>He shouldered such a heavy burden. A burden he shared with no one because he would rather suffer forever than cause one of his friends to suffer a single moment more.</p><p>That was love, not evil.</p><p>Love.</p><p>The word echoed through her mind. Maybe because she felt utterly connected to Amun just then, she couldn\u2019t keep secrets, even from herself. She loved him, she realized.</p><p>There was no denying it now, no questioning it. For al that he was, al that he\u2019d been and al that he would be, she loved him. He was a warrior to his very soul, would always fight for what he believed in, would never buckle under pressure. When he cared, he cared deeply, intensely, and nothing and no one could shake that affection from him. Oh, yes. She loved him.</p><p>How did he feel about her?</p><p>She wanted him to care for her. Desperately. Because if they were going to be together, and she prayed that they were, his friends would be angry. Actual y, \u201cangry\u201d was too mild a word. She doubted there was a word to accurately express the rage they would unleash upon him. But if he loved her in return, he could bear it.</p><p>How could she ask him to bear it? Even if he did, in fact, love her?</p><p>How could she ask him to carry yet another burden?</p><p>God, what a mess. If they were together, her friends\u2014no, that wasn\u2019t the right word. They\u2019d never truly been her friends. Her coworkers would fume at her, too. They wouldn\u2019t understand how she could adore a demon. They would attack Amun; they would punish her. And she knew that was exactly why Amun had pushed her away. He didn\u2019t want her to suffer. Didn\u2019t want her to have to \u201cbear it,\u201d either.</p><p>That bespoke caring, right?</p><p>What he didn\u2019t know, however, and what she had to somehow show him, was that nothing would cause her more suffering than trying to live without him. For him, she could bear anything.</p><p>Perhaps he would one day feel the same for her. If he did, losing their friends wouldn\u2019t be something to bear because they would have each other, could rely on each other, comfort each other...cling to each other.</p><p>They had shared each other\u2019s blood al those centuries ago, creating a bond far more powerful than the hatred always simmering inside her. They belonged together; she knew it. She\u2019d have to show him that, too.</p><p>Yes, she had loathed his kind for centuries. Yes, she had hurt him, and yes, he had hurt her. But that was in the past.</p><p>Now, she only wanted to look ahead.</p><p>Look ahead. Again, the words echoed through her mind, and she was forced to face a hard truth. She couldn\u2019t ask Amun to give up his friends. She couldn\u2019t al ow him to cut those friends from his life, whether he could bear the loss of them or not, whether he would cling to her or not. How could she expect such a thing? Those warriors had helped shape Amun into the wonderful man he was. He needed them, and they needed him.</p><p>If Amun would just give her a chance, she would do everything in her power to smooth things over.</p><p>After a time, if his friends stil couldn\u2019t accept her, no matter what she did, she would leave.</p><p>So many ifs...so many possibilities.</p><p>Leaving would kil her, but for Amun, for his happiness, she Leaving would kil her, but for Amun, for his happiness, she would do it. Al she needed was that chance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Haidee. Wake up for me, sweetheart.</p><p>Amun\u2019s deep voice reverberated inside her head, much louder than in her dreams, jolting her into awareness. She blinked open her eyes. Several seconds passed before she was able to orient herself, and when she did, she took stock. Muted light fil ed the cave. In the distance, she heard the drip, drip of water. She was sprawled flat on her back, practical y...sweating?</p><p>Haidee, sweetheart. Can you hear me?</p> <p>Amun again. \u201cYes,\u201d she drawled. She stretched her arms over her head, back arching. The ground beneath her was soft, as if she rested on pil ows.</p><p>Final y. Now look at me.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Something tickled her bel y again, causing goose bumps to sprout in every direction.</p><p>Her gaze descended, and what she found left her gaping. A shirtless Amun was on his knees in front of her, her spread legs braced on his thighs. He wore pants. She wore panties. Only panties.</p><p>Both of his hands rested on her stomach, his fingers tracing designs around her navel, on her hips, just above the tiny patch of curls guarding her where she already ached.</p> <p>\u201cYou have hands,\u201d was the first thing she thought to say.</p><p>She\u2019d been so afraid, so uncertain.</p><p>His lips quirked at the corners, revealing an amusement he rarely displayed. Yes. I have my hands. I\u2019m glad you noticed.</p><p>She\u2019d stuffed his injured arms into the backpack, eased him to his back when he had passed out, and then she\u2019d paced, checked on him, prayed, bathed, checked on him, prayed some more, cursed, checked on him and final y fal en asleep beside him. At last check, he had stil been handless.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>The backpack, as you thought. Just took a while for everything to regrow. Now, enough about that. Do you remember when you woke me up with your mouth on my cock?</p> <p>She gulped, licked her lips. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened and he flattened his palms on his thighs, as if he didn\u2019t trust himself to keep them on her. His gaze drifted to her core, and a ragged breath left him. Good. You can\u2019t dispute that it\u2019s my turn to wake you up properly.</p><p>Meaning it was his turn to taste her...oh, yes, please, yes.</p><p>Yet he didn\u2019t lower his head. Didn\u2019t make any other moves toward her, and every nerve ending she possessed went on alert, readying for his touch. Craving his touch.</p><p>\u201cAmun,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>A muscle ticked in his jaw. First, he said, reaching back, you\u2019re going to cal Micah.</p><p>Wait. What?</p><p>He lifted a smal black cel phone. I asked the pack for a phone that would reach the outside world.</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014it\u2019s okay.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t have to...not anymore, because I\u2014\u201d</p><p>You wanted to cal him, and so you wil . He held out the phone, forcing her to accept it.</p><p>She stared at the device for a long while, unsure whether Amun was trusting her or testing her. If she made the cal , would she hurt him? Make him think she wouldn\u2019t take him anytime, anywhere, without his meeting certain conditions?</p><p>As soon as you\u2019re done, I\u2019l start. The sensuality in his tone left no doubt as to what he meant. Just know that by doing this, you\u2019re giving up your friends. You\u2019l never be able to return to them. They\u2019l despise you.</p><p>Was he...giving her a chance? The very chance she\u2019d wanted? \u201cI know,\u201d she replied softly.</p><p>They might even hunt you.</p><p>\u201cI know that, too.\u201d</p><p>And you don\u2019t mind?</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019l have you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes, you\u2019l have me. His expression became fierce. I thought I could let myself have you for a little while, but I know now that a little while isn\u2019t going to be enough. I\u2019m going to find a way back, and I\u2019m going to keep you. Now, always.</p><p>He wanted her now...always; she almost couldn\u2019t process the news. Amun, with her, forever. He hadn\u2019t offered any words of love, and she wasn\u2019t going to ask for them. That could come later. For now, this was enough.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? Make the cal .</p><p>Maybe he was trusting her as she hoped, maybe he was testing her as part of her feared, but in the end, anticipation decided her. She dialed, shocked when the sound of ringing fil ed her ear. She wanted this over and done with, Micah out of the picture completely.</p><p>Her former boyfriend answered on the second ring, a snarled, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicah?\u201d she asked hesitantly. Her gaze locked on Amun, gauging his every reaction. He wasn\u2019t looking at her, was looking just beyond her, his expression now a blank mask.</p><p>\u201cHaidee?\u201d Micah sounded baffled, relieved and overjoyed</p><p>\u2014and stil angry\u2014al at once. \u201cWhere are you? Tel me.</p><p>Now.\u201d With every word, his emotions were overtaken by determination.</p><p>She experienced a pang of guilt. \u201cYes. I\u2019m alive. But no, I won\u2019t tel you where I am. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre the bastards monitoring this cal ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Not real y. \u201cListen, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTel me where you are, then, and I\u2019l come and get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m cal ing. I just wanted you to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were dead,\u201d he interjected, once more cutting her off. Now he sounded accusing. \u201cI mourned you. I tried to track you, tried to save you. Tel me, damn it. Tel me where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m alive, and that\u2019s al you need to know.\u201d Except... \u201cI real y need you to listen to me. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d a female voice murmured sleepily from Micah\u2019s end of the line.</p><p>There was a beat of static, then a shuffle of footsteps as if he was pounding away from the intruder. In that moment, Haidee knew that he was sleeping with someone. Might have been sleeping with someone else even while they were dating. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to care.</p><p>Had he ever wanted her, though? With her, he\u2019d been content to keep things mostly hands-off. She hadn\u2019t wondered why because she\u2019d been happy with the status quo. But if he hadn\u2019t wanted her, why had he stayed with her?</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re alive, that means you\u2019re helping them.\u201d She didn\u2019t have to ask who \u201cthem\u201d was. And he didn\u2019t even address the fact that a woman had spoken. \u201cOtherwise, they would have kil ed you by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d was al she said on the subject. Let him take that answer however he chose. \u201cI just wanted to cal and tel you that we\u2019re over. I don\u2019t want to date you anymore.\u201d</p><p>Amun, she noticed, had tensed, his fingers digging into his thighs and probably leaving bruises. He had no idea what Micah was saying, no idea why she\u2019d said yes to the man.</p><p>Yet he wasn\u2019t interfering.</p><p>He was trusting her, she realized.</p><p>\u201cNow you listen to me, you fucking bitch,\u201d Micah suddenly growled, and there was so much hatred in his tone she was momentarily speechless. \u201cYou tel me where the hel you are, who you\u2019re with and what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019m going to find you and take back what\u2019s mine. Then I\u2019m going to cut your fucking throat and dance in the blood. You don\u2019t deserve\u2014\u201d</p><p>Click. Haidee severed the connection before he could finish berating her, shocked, at last upset, and unsure what had just happened.</p><p>Amun\u2019s gaze final y met hers. He didn\u2019t ask questions, just took the phone and tossed it over his shoulder. Then, without another word, he lifted her hips and stripped the panties from her, pul ing her legs in front of him, one at a time. Mouth set in a grim line, he tossed the panties beside the phone. He repositioned their bodies the way they\u2019d been.</p><p>Tears suddenly burned her eyes. How could Micah have said those things to her? Fucking bitch. Cut your fucking throat. Bitch, bitch, bitch. He\u2019d been her friend. Hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>And yes, she had expected the Hunters to turn on her, but not that quickly. Not that violently.</p><p>You\u2019re that distressed to lose him? Amun asked, and though the words were soft, she heard the fury\u2014and even the insecurity\u2014behind them.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She was the one who couldn\u2019t meet his eyes this time.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014he cal ed me a terrible name, said terrible things.\u201d</p><p>And she didn\u2019t want Amun to ever think of her that way.</p><p>Even though he, more than anyone, had the right.</p><p>Like what? What name?</p><p>Amun hadn\u2019t been furious before, she realized then. Now he was furious. If Micah had walked into the cavern, Amun would have kil ed him without hesitation. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a...a bitch?\u201d</p><p>No, he answered without any hesitation. His expression softened, gentled. I think you\u2019re perfect, sweet...mine. And now I also think he can\u2019t be related to me. He\u2019s an idiot.</p><p>\u201cReal y?\u201d She swiped her watery eyes with the backs of her wrists. \u201cYou don\u2019t think badly of me, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Real y. We\u2019re together, now and always, remember?</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d The hurt inside her eased. She was with the man she loved. That was al that mattered.</p><p>\u201cAmun?\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>As she final y met his gaze, her heart skipped a beat. His expression was heated, his gaze heavy-lidded, his brows a determined slash. His lips were red, as if flushed. Did his blood race as swiftly as hers?</p><p>Wonderful y dark skin pul ed taut over the muscles of a warrior. She couldn\u2019t see his butterfly tattoo, but she vowed to trace every inch with her tongue one day soon. Between his legs, his cock stretched past the waist of his pants, the head already beaded with moisture. Her mouth watered.</p><p>She knew his taste, would forever be addicted to it.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Then by gods, you\u2019l have me.</p><p>Yes. Final y, they were going to make love. The restriction she\u2019d so foolishly placed on their physical relationship had been vanquished. But even if she hadn\u2019t spoken to Micah, she stil would have given herself to Amun this night.</p><p>Such a pretty pink, he said, gaze moving to her sex. So wet for me already.</p><p>Even his words were a turn-on. \u201cI ache for you. There, everywhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hands slid to her inner thighs, and he spread his fingers, almost, but not quite, brushing her where she most needed. Soft. One finger, two, glided up her slit, and she quivered, whimpered.</p><p>Like silk.</p><p>She wanted those fingers on her again, gliding yes, but lingering, too. Pressing. She lifted her hips, silently beseeching. He gave her what she wanted\u2014sort of. He traced between those pouty lips, and he did linger, but not where she so desperately needed. He al owed one fingertip to push past her opening, but not deeply. He pushed just enough to swirl and stoke her need higher.</p> <p>Play with your breasts. Let me see how you like them touched.</p><p>Not for a single moment did she consider objecting. She plumped them, kneaded them, pinched her nipples while he watched. The heat inside her grew...grew... \u201cI want you to take me the rest of the way now,\u201d she gasped out. She wasn\u2019t sure how much more she could take. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>A long moment passed in silence before he nodded. He didn\u2019t fal on her, licking and sucking and tonguing between her legs as she expected, thought she wanted, but leaned forward, pressing them together. Since her thighs were draped over his own, the action spread her wider, brought her core into contact with his pant-clad erection, rubbing, creating the most delicious sense of friction between her legs and on her breasts. Her nipples rasped his chest.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to...\u201d</p><p>I am. First, though, I\u2019m going to prepare you.</p> <p>She gasped, hands sliding around his neck, nails sinking into his back. His head lowered, and his mouth opened up on one of her nipples. The heat was nearly unbearable, so much greater than what swirled inside her, but so necessary she didn\u2019t even think about trying to shove him away. Then he was at last licking and sucking and tonguing her there, shooting startling sensation after startling sensation through her entire body.</p><p>She knew he was a big man. How could she not? He probably outweighed her by more than a hundred pounds and was nearly a foot tal er than she was. But just then, the width of his shoulders practical y engulfing her, she felt almost...dainty.</p><p>\u201cTake off your pants,\u201d she managed to gasp out as she arched against him. Sweet heaven, that felt good.</p><p>\u201cLet me feel al of you.\u201d</p><p>No. Moment I do, I\u2019l be inside you.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point. I\u2019m prepared, I swear.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re taking our time, woman. Get used to the idea.</p><p>She loved that he could talk to her and continue tormenting her nipple at the same time. And he did.</p><p>Torment her. His teeth scraped the sensitive bud, but then he would quickly kiss away the sting.</p><p>When she was writhing against him, begging him for more, he gave her other nipple the same treatment.</p><p>Hours seemed to pass as he contented himself with her breasts, plumping them, kneading them as she had done, never ceasing to bathe her nipples in the wet heat of his mouth.</p><p>You\u2019re so beautiful, he said.</p><p>\u201cAmun, please. More.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re so strong and brave. And mine. Did I tel you that already? Mine.</p> <p>\u201cYours,\u201d she croaked. She tugged at his hair, forcing him to raise his head or lose a handful of strands.</p><p>Onyx eyes shimmered, lines of tension branching from them. He wasn\u2019t as relaxed as he would have her believe. \u201cKiss me. I need your taste in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>With a moan, he surged up, curling her body higher, tighter, and crushed their lips together. His tongue immediately pushed inside to rol and mate with hers. He tasted of mint and something sweet. Something uniquely his own.</p><p>He released her legs to cup her face, and she locked her ankles around his back. She slid herself against the thickness of his erection, probably wetting his clothes, but she didn\u2019t care. Her need was too strong, and just as she\u2019d kissed him the other times, her mind became focused only on climax.</p><p>Soon he lost his pretend nonchalance, his movements becoming jerky, his arousal slamming against her, grinding into her, ringing gasp after gasp out of her mouth. He swal owed every one of those gasps before angling her head, al owing his tongue to thrust as hard and deep as she wanted his cock to thrust.</p><p>Only with him had she ever felt feverish, burning, the heat of him continuing to pulse inside her, spreading, consuming.</p><p>Somehow, that freed the chil she\u2019d managed to hide. In seconds, she was a writhing cauldron of both fire and ice, thoughts fragmenting, muttering incoherently.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she might have said. She needed to be fil ed, needed some kind of release. This was too much, not enough, and her heart couldn\u2019t take much more. \u201cPlease, baby.\u201d She rubbed her legs up his sides, squeezing him, encouraging him. She tangled her hands in his hair, she scratched at his back, probably drawing blood. \u201cPlease.</p><p>Give me more.\u201d</p><p>He pul ed away from her, and she groaned. He didn\u2019t disappoint her, though. He final y, blessedly, oh, so sweetly, licked between her thighs. Her cry of delight pierced the passion-scented air, and her hips shot up, drawing him closer. Over and over he licked, nibbled, sucked.</p><p>I could do this forever, sweetheart.</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019l never get enough.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d She knew she was only repeating part of what he said, but she couldn\u2019t help herself. Couldn\u2019t concentrate on anything but the pleasure. But always, she maintained a sharp hold on her inner chil , never al owing the ice to seep to the outside, to Amun.</p><p>He pushed her to the brink, and then, with one swirl of his tongue, he pushed her over. She screamed her release, bucking against him, unable to stil for a long while. When her tremors eased, she sagged against the ground, panting. She realized then that her body had gotten what it needed\u2014for now\u2014but her mind had not. The ice, stil churning inside her... Her mind wouldn\u2019t be completely satisfied until she gave Amun everything.</p><p>He flipped her over, and the swift action startled her. Before she could gasp, he was kissing her back.</p><p>Her tattoos.</p><p>Laving them with his tongue as she\u2019d wanted to do to his.</p><p>He was offering absolution, apologizing for what she\u2019d lost in the most basic way. And oh, God, tears fil ed her eyes.</p><p>I\u2019ve imagined taking you in every position, but this first time, I want you facing me. Looking at me.</p><p>Seeing me. He turned her back over. So open your eyes, sweetheart, and I\u2019l give you al that I am.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized she had squeezed her eyelids closed.</p><p>She pried them apart and peered up at the man who had won her heart. He had straightened, was now merely staring down at her. Sweat dripped from his forehead. The moment their gazes met, he reached between their bodies.</p><p>His knuckles brushed her sensitized clitoris as he unfastened his pants, and she again bucked wildly, already needing more, already verging on desperate.</p><p>She wanted total satisfaction this time.</p><p>He didn\u2019t waste a single second shoving his pants off. They were open, and as he\u2019d promised, he lost track of everything else. The thick head of his cock probed her entrance, seeking ful penetration. Except, stil he held back.</p><p>His white teeth were chewing on his bottom lip. His sweat began dripping off him and onto her. You\u2019re mine, Haidee, al mine. I\u2019l take care of you...always...won\u2019t risk you...</p><p>don\u2019t think you can get...pregnant...no worries... Just let me...</p><p>He was trying to reassure her, she knew, but she was past the point of caring. \u201cDo it. Please, do it. I need you. Have to have you. Al of you. Dying without you. Please, Amun, please. Let me give al of me, too.\u201d He could take it.</p><p>Please, God, let him be able to take it.</p><p>Before she could finish her prayer, Amun slammed al the way home, and she arched up to meet him, to drive him so deep they might never be able to part. Haidee released another scream, her relief so potent she couldn\u2019t keep it contained. She\u2019d waited for this moment forever, it seemed.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been with a man in a long, long time, and she had never been this aroused, this wil ing to break apart and reform into someone new. To experience every sensation, nothing held back.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d she said, a promise.</p><p>Everything, he agreed, a vow.</p><p>Then he was kissing her, and he was in her mouth, her blood, her bones, her soul. And yet that stil wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>She wanted to be inside him, too, a part of him always.</p><p>Mine, you\u2019re mine.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>He began to move, pounding forward, withdrawing, pounding forward again. Stretching her, burning her up, catching her on fire. Driving her higher and higher, toward that edge of insanity. She thrashed and she clung to him, almost afraid to fal this time.</p><p>Let go, sweetheart.</p><p>\u201cThe cold...\u201d It was there, waiting.</p><p>Let go. I don\u2019t care what happens. I need you. Al of you, just as you vowed.</p><p>She heard the strain in his voice, knew he was near the edge, as wel . And so she did it. She final y let go. She trusted him completely, opened herself up total y and let down her guard inexorably.</p><p>Instantly satisfaction slammed into her with the same ferocity that Amun did. Her body splintered, flew to the heavens, stars winking behind her eyes as she lost sight of his beautiful face. Al the while, the fire spread...hotter and hotter... Al the while, the ice stormed...colder and colder...</p><p>Amun trembled and bucked against her as wildly as she bucked against him, and then he was roaring, loud and long, coming, coming, coming so hard. She thought distantly that her body had been starved for him, was now drinking from him, and she might never be thirsty again.</p><p>Would probably be sated forever. But stil the fire spread, hotter and hotter. The ice, though, was fading, no longer storming inside her\u2014because it was seeping into Amun.</p><p>At first, she loved the heat. Welcomed it, wanted more and tried to get it, pul ing every bit she could from Amun\u2019s body while giving him the ice, unable to stop herself. Soon, though, he was gasping, groaning, shoving away from her and severing contact.</p><p>Even without his touch, however, it was too late for her. She felt bathed in flames, no hint of ice left.</p><p>She screamed in pain, in agony, not knowing what to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The flames should have lit her up, blazed bright, but they somehow surrounded her in darkness, darkness she couldn\u2019t find her way out of.</p><p>She was dying. She had to be dying. That was the only time she\u2019d ever battled such darkness and pain.</p><p>Sweetheart, oh, gods, sweetheart. What\u2019s wrong? Tel me what\u2019s wrong. His hands smoothed over her face, and for once, it was not heat she felt from him. He was as cold as a meat locker, and she was envious.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong, she wanted to shout, but her jaw was locked together, the pain knotting her muscles and preventing her from moving, even in the slightest way.</p><p>Somehow, Amun heard her and replied. I don\u2019t know, either, sweetheart.</p><p>Help me. Please. Any more and she real y would die. Just then, she wanted to die.</p><p>I\u2019l find a way. I swear to the gods I\u2019l find a way.</p><p>The vow was the last thing she heard from him. The darkness thickened until she could see the slick texture of it, the evil that oozed from it. Like black oil, coating her...</p> <p>destroying her.</p><p>Demons, she realized with a moan. The demons\u2014his demons\u2014were now a part of her.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>WHAT THE HELL HAD HE done to her?</p><p>Amun was in a panic. Physical y, he had never felt better; he was clearheaded, sated, both energized and relaxed.</p><p>Cold, yes. He was far colder than he\u2019d ever been. Rather than destroy him, as the cold had done to the congo, he was strengthened. And yet, his woman now suffered unbearably. Her beautiful skin was flushed a bright red, but not from pleasure. She was racked with pain, her body curled into itself, her fingers actual y gnarling as she screamed, over and over again.</p> <p>He\u2019d promised to help her, but he didn\u2019t know how, had no medicine, could only ask for\u2014the backpack, he thought suddenly. Some of his panic eased as his gaze landed on the angel\u2019s gift. Of course. So simple. Please be simple.</p><p>The backpack had given him back his hands. Now it would give Haidee back her life.</p><p>Amun grabbed the pack, his grip so tight he feared he would rip the material. Give me something to help her, something to save her. Though urgency bombarded him, he waited one second, two.</p><p>Trembling now, he reached inside and found\u2014nothing.</p><p>Help me help her, he demanded. Again, nothing appeared inside. Cursing, Amun upended and shook the material, but stil he found nothing. The bag remained empty.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean...couldn\u2019t mean... No. No! He refused to believe Haidee was beyond saving. She would survive this, whatever \u201cthis\u201d was. She had to; he needed her. Had never needed a person more.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care that she would be reanimated if she...if she...he couldn\u2019t even think the word. She hated when that happened, hated the pain that fol owed. Hated her loss of memories.</p><p>She would survive, he thought again. She was the missing piece of his soul, a necessary part of his soul.</p> <p>How he\u2019d ever lived without her, he didn\u2019t know. But he did know that he loved her. Loved her strength, her courage, her wit and the tender way she cared for him, so at odds with the sexy, tough-girl look of her. He loved the way she gave herself to him, her body his to do with as he pleased, inhibitions vanquished.</p><p>He had only to kiss her, and she became a live wire in his arms. No other woman had ever responded to him like that.</p><p>She truly reveled in his touch and wasn\u2019t ashamed to beg for more. She made him forget they were on a mission, made him forget that anyone or thing existed beyond the two of them.</p><p>And she had chosen him. She\u2019d known the consequences of cutting ties with the Hunters, of becoming Amun\u2019s woman</p><p>\u2014he\u2019d made sure of it\u2014but she had chosen to be with him anyway.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t giving her up. Once, he\u2019d thought he could. Once, he\u2019d thought their time together would end the moment they left this realm. Wrong. He was keeping her. Now, always.</p><p>Just as he\u2019d told her.</p><p>Hot, she whimpered. Hot. Tears trickled from her closed eyelids, catching in her lashes before running down her cheeks.</p><p>She was talking inside his mind. He\u2019d thought he\u2019d heard her earlier, had convinced himself he was mistaken, but now there was no denying the truth. The connection was complete. The barrier that had kept her out of his head, whatever it was, had clearly been shattered. Probably because he had utterly lowered his guard the moment he\u2019d penetrated her.</p><p>He had been defenseless against her, vulnerable, and hadn\u2019t cared. He had welcomed her, every part of her, inside and out. He had craved an unbreakable connection, no matter the consequences, wanting no secrets between them. The good, the bad, he\u2019d wanted to share al of it. With her and no other. Just as she had said. Al , everything.</p><p>He had to save her.</p><p>Amun eased beside her and gently, so gently, lifted her in his arms. He sat with his back propped against a rocky wal and settled her on his lap. At first, she struggled against his hold, every motion probably torturing her. Then the new coolness of his skin seeped past the new burn of hers. She rubbed her cheek against his chest, moaned and cuddled against him.</p><p>So evil, she whimpered.</p><p>He traced his fingertips over her brow, trying to ease the fever there. What\u2019s evil, sweetheart? The demons.</p><p>Demons? Amun stil ed, not even daring to breathe. He\u2019d felt her tugging on them, felt them resisting her, but his pleasure, the cold, he\u2019d lost track of everything else.</p><p>They\u2019re...inside you?</p><p>Yes. Another whimper.</p><p>Mine?</p><p>I think so.</p><p>How could that be? He closed his eyes, searched his mind</p><p>\u2014and found no evidence of the vile essence that had nearly destroyed him before Haidee had entered his life. There were no disgusting urges waiting to pounce, no creatures writhing deep in his cognizance, no painful memories desperate to spring to the surface.</p><p>He should have been happy, but he was infuriated. With himself. He would rather deal with the evil himself than subject Haidee to a single moment of this. Damn it. He had to help her. Another thought struck him, and he flinched.</p><p>If Secrets had left him, too, Amun would die. For the moment Secrets had possessed him, they\u2019d become two halves of a whole. One could not survive without the other.</p><p>Not real y.</p><p>Secrets, he found himself rushing out.</p><p>His voice must have nudged the creature. Secrets sighed with relief. Relief and joy. Once again, it was just the two of them. And though Haidee\u2019s chil \u2014Amun\u2019s chil now\u2014</p><p>cloaked them, there was no more fear. They\u2019d faced the storm and survived. Hel , they\u2019d thrived.</p><p>How had Haidee taken the other demons but not Secrets?</p><p>He didn\u2019t know, but he could find out. And perhaps, in doing so, he could save her. Determination replaced every other emotion inside him. You\u2019re going to find the answer, al the answers, and you\u2019re going to help her.</p><p>Information was the demon\u2019s crack. Eagerly Secrets forced his way into Haidee\u2019s mind. Actual y,</p><p>\u201cforced\u201d was too strong a word. The demon glided on in, as if the welcome mat had been placed at the front door, the windows left open. Even more astonishing, there were no barriers. The floodgate had opened. Whatever the demon wanted to glean, he gleaned.</p><p>Amun swam through the churning, never-ending sea of memories, searching for what he needed and discarding what he didn\u2019t. He discarded most, in fact, but at long last, his efforts were rewarded. The story of Haidee\u2019s life unfolded as if he were turning pages in a book.</p><p>After the Lords of the Underworld were kicked out of the heavens and tossed to earth, Themis, the Greek goddess of Justice, decided to balance the scales. The world had been given demons, and so, to her, the world required demon executioners. Executioners she could control, as the angels\u2014demon-slayers in their own right\u2014refused to do her bidding. Unable to simply create beings from air as Zeus, the god king, Themis was forced to find another way.</p><p>When she heard the prayers of Haidee\u2019s parents, the answer came to her. The couple was childless, barren and desperate, and in their desperation, they agreed to the bargain Themis proposed. The goddess would bless the mother\u2019s womb, and that womb would bear fruit. The couple would raise that child for ten years, and at the end of that tenth year, they would give her to the person of Themis\u2019s choosing, so that she might be trained. They weren\u2019t to worry, though, for the goddess would bless them with other children. Children they would be al owed to keep.</p><p>Al was set.</p><p>The parents tried to distance themselves from their little girl and save their love for their other children.</p><p>But one smile from the sweet little angel, and they fel . Unlike other babies, she was not fussy or contrary or even temperamental. She watched the world around her, thoughtful, always thoughtful.</p><p>As her tenth birthday approached, they realized they would rather die than lose her.</p><p>Themis, being Themis, granted their request. The couple had prevented a demon executioner from learning how to fulfil her purpose, and so they would die at the hand of a demon. Justice would once again be served.</p><p>And so the goddess commanded the keeper of Hate to slaughter the entire family, Haidee included, for she would start again, find someone new, someone she would raise from birth herself.</p><p>Hate was more than happy to comply.</p><p>After murdering Haidee\u2019s parents and little sister, the demon-possessed immortal turned his sights on the god-touched child. But as he peered into her eyes, he remembered how Themis had once planned to use her and realized she might be able to save him. For if she could destroy the demon inside him, he would final y be free.</p><p>So Hate grabbed Haidee, intending to hide her until he figured out how exactly her ability worked. Only the moment he touched her, a strange cold infused him, tearing at his insides. He reacted instinctively, stabbing and releasing her, then running from her, the pain too much to bear.</p><p>As the days passed, he realized she had ripped a smal piece of his demon from him\u2014like a human losing a limb.</p><p>And as time passed and he came to discover what happened to keepers who were severed from their demons... Wel , instead of yearning to break ties with the creature, he wanted to reclaim that missing part of it. But each time he found Haidee, she died before he could touch her, as if Themis had forever cursed him to fail in his quest because he had failed to destroy the girl as promised. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Secrets marveled at the deluge of information, a child at Christmas.</p><p>And stil so many questions remained... How had Haidee taken a piece of the demon High Lord? How had Hate\u2019s host not died? How had Haidee never known Hate was inside her? How had she not known what the demon was thinking, feeling or wanting? Amun always knew. So did his friends. How had she not known Hate was the cause of her reanimation and memory loss? Or was Themis the one responsible?</p><p>How had the demon stayed with her even after she died, when Baden\u2019s demon had been freed after his death?</p> <p>When Aeron\u2019s had been freed after his death?</p><p>More answers flowed... That smal piece of Hate had hidden inside her, strong enough to influence but too weak to do anything more. That\u2019s why she hadn\u2019t known the being was there or what he felt. His wants and needs had simply seemed like her own.</p><p>And Hate had not brought her back to life al those times; Themis had. Inadvertently. Since Haidee had sprung from a womb blessed by the goddess, she\u2019d never been ful y human. So, like the souls who reanimated in hel , she never real y died. Only difference was, her corporal form could walk the earth, as wel as hel .</p><p>So much information...too much...not enough.</p><p>As she\u2019d done for Hate, Haidee had taken the demon minions from Amun. Not just pieces, though, but every part of them. Secrets, a High Lord, was stronger, however, tethered to Amun by godly bonds, while the others hadn\u2019t been.</p> <p>Stil , she could have taken Secrets, but she hadn\u2019t. She\u2019d been careful, even though she hadn\u2019t realized what was happening to her or to Amun.</p><p>Were the new demons forever a part of her now?</p><p>No. No! He couldn\u2019t al ow that. He knew how evil those beings were, how disgusting their thoughts, and he would not leave Haidee to suffer like that. But what could he do?</p><p>He waited for Secrets to tel him, but this time, no response was forthcoming. The demon was stil lost inside those memories.</p><p>Haidee was curled in the fetal position, whimpering, her tears burning his chest as they streaked down his skin. He reasoned out the rest on his own. She\u2019d been a little girl when Hate first attacked her, and she\u2019d probably clung to the dark piece of the demon she\u2019d drawn inside her, needing the emotion to survive the terrible deaths she\u2019d witnessed her parents and sister suffering.</p><p>Hate was as much a part of her as Secrets was to him, but these other demons were new and hadn\u2019t had time to bond with her yet. He hoped. They wouldn\u2019t want to bond with her, either, and would fight the connection. After al , Themis had ensured Haidee was a demon executioner. That meant Haidee had the power to defeat the darkness inside her, even if she didn\u2019t realize it, and the bastards had to sense that.</p> <p>No wonder they\u2019d been so afraid of her, of her pul and her cold.</p><p>Guilt fil ed Amun, surpassing every other emotion because, with this new knowledge, he realized he alone was responsible for her current torment. She had saved him, and he had harmed her.</p><p>Haidee, sweetheart, he said, squeezing her tight. I need you to listen to me.</p><p>Hurt, she moaned. I hurt so bad.</p><p>I know, darling, but fight past the pain and listen to me. Can you do that?</p><p>A pause, another whimper. Then a hesitant, yes. Yes.</p><p>Amun, you\u2019re reading my mind. How are you reading my mind?</p><p>I think I instinctively built a mental wal to block you out when those demons were inside me. The moment you took them, that wal fel . Now I need you to fight the demons, sweetheart. Push them out of your body. Out of your skin.</p> <p>How? Every time I mental y approach them, they dart away.</p><p>Corner them.</p><p>I can\u2019t!</p><p>You can. And you wil . Do it. Now. He put enough steel in his voice to anger her. Do it, or I\u2019l hand you over to Strider.</p><p>You think you\u2019re suffering now, wel , wait until he gets you.</p><p>He wil torture the living hel out of you, and I\u2019l cheer him on.</p><p>Then I\u2019l make love to another woman in front of you.</p><p>Every muscle in her slight, trembling body stiffened. B-bastard.</p><p>I know. Get wel , and you can punish me.</p><p>T-trying. Her body uncurled, stretching taut as a bow.</p><p>They\u2019re stil darting...like little flies...no, close, I\u2019m close...</p><p>they can\u2019t go anywhere else...there they are...</p><p>Her back arched as an agonized groan ripped past her lips.</p><p>Haidee? Talk to me. Tel me what\u2019s going on.</p><p>Pushing, I\u2019m pushing them. They\u2019re screaming, want out.</p><p>Out, out, out.</p><p>That\u2019s the way, sweetheart. You\u2019re doing so good. I\u2019m so proud of you. Keep pushing them. He flattened his palms, his cold, cold palms, on her and stroked. He stroked her everywhere, every inch of her body, wil ing the cold out of him and back into her. Push them out, and then cut any tether that binds them to you. Understand?</p><p>Slowly her skin began to darken. Not tanning, not becoming a lovely gold, but becoming a dark, sickly gray. She was doing it. She was expunging them. He could feel the malevolence pulsing off her.</p><p>Relief only increased his urgency. His hands moved faster, trying to touch every inch of her at once.</p><p>That\u2019s the way.</p><p>The ice. Yes, the ice. Need it. Need it. Need\u2014 She screamed. Screamed until her voice broke, until his eardrums nearly burst just to escape the noise. Darkness was now pouring off her, drifting into the air like dust motes before darting out of the cave entirely.</p><p>Her nails raked at him, drawing blood. She thrashed, she fought, but he never released her from his hold.</p><p>Final y, thank the gods, final y, she sagged against him, silent, not even trembling, as if every bit of strength had been sapped from her and she could barely even manage to breathe.</p><p>Amun never stopped cooing at her. He whispered everything he\u2019d learned about her past, knowing she would want every detail. He promised he would never al ow anyone\u2014not gods, demons or humans\u2014to hurt her. Final y, she ral ied.</p><p>I suspected you were part goddess, you know, he said.</p><p>A smal , sad smile. I almost can\u2019t take this in. Chosen and betrayed by Justice. Targeted by Hate. Part Hate myself. I mean, I\u2019m a demon and I\u2019ve fought demons al my life.</p><p>Lives. It\u2019s ironic and weird and...and...I hate it. Hate. A bitter laugh. Makes sense now.</p><p>No one can blame you for what happened.</p><p>I can. I do.</p><p>You shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>I want to deny it al , so damn badly, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>You are a wonderful person, and what we\u2019ve learned today doesn\u2019t change that.</p><p>I\u2014 Whatever argument she meant to give, she changed her mind. Thank you, Amun. For everything you did, everything you said. For liking me despite this.</p><p>Liking? He more than liked her, but she\u2019d endured enough revelations for the moment. Sleep now, sweetheart.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>The gray cast eventual y faded from her flesh, returning her skin to that lovely golden shimmer. The fever even cooled.</p><p>He, too, sagged, his relief so great he practical y choked on it.</p><p>Hours passed while she dozed, her body trying to fortify itself. Though he was exhausted, he never al owed himself to drift. He remained awake, alert, keeping guard. And as always, just being near Haidee aroused him. More so now, considering how close he\u2019d come to losing her.</p><p>She was naked, he was naked, and her soft scent was imprinted in his sinuses. Her breasts were pressed into his chest. Breasts he\u2019d held, suckled. Her legs were twined with his. Legs he\u2019d spread, caressed. Soon he was sweating, the chil inside him gone as if it had never been.</p><p>He needed to reaffirm that his woman lived, that their bond hadn\u2019t been shattered.</p><p>She\u2019s too weak. She needs a little recovery time. More than that, making love had almost kil ed her. He would not risk her again. Ever. He would be with her, safeguard her, pamper her, but never again would they be together in a sexual way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not too weak,\u201d she murmured sleepily, the coolness of her breath tickling his chest. \u201cI\u2019l never be too weak for that.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled sharply. In that moment, he knew. He knew she was going to be al right. His arms tightened around her, squeezing so tightly he feared he would crack one of her ribs. But he couldn\u2019t temper his reaction, couldn\u2019t dilute his need to hold her and never let go.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d she said. She raised her chin and looked up at him, though she never lifted her cheek from his chest. \u201cRemind me that I\u2019m alive.\u201d</p><p>No, sweetheart. No. We\u2019re just going to hold each other.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Was she...pouting?</p><p>His cock twitched in response. What if there are other demons hiding inside me? Or what if you draw Secrets out this time? Secrets is a High Lord, and the demons you took from me were merely minions.</p><p>High Lords make minions look like infant children in need of a bottle.</p><p>\u201cBut there were hundreds of those minions.\u201d</p><p>Thousands of minions could not compare with one High Lord.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s probably true.\u201d</p><p>Is that piece of Hate stil inside you? he asked. Or did you expunge it, too?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stil with me. I can feel the emotion, weaker than before, but there.\u201d</p><p>Good.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to risk losing you. I\u2019l die if I\u2019m separated from Secrets, and I fear the same wil happen to you if you\u2019re separated from Hate. Even so smal a piece.</p><p>\u201cOh...yeah,\u201d she said, disappointed. \u201cI forgot about that.\u201d</p><p>His heart stuttered to a stop. Does it bother you that I wil always be a demon?</p><p>\u201cNot at al .\u201d She slid one of her hands to his neck and pressed a fingertip against his pulse, jump-starting his heart into action again. \u201cI accept you for who and what you are.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized how badly he\u2019d needed to hear those words until she\u2019d said them. As I accept you.</p><p>She placed a soft kiss on his sternum. \u201cI\u2019m stil in shock. But God, this explains so much, you know?</p><p>Why I have so much trouble loving, why people tend to dislike me when they first meet me. Why moods are sometimes blackened in my presence.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. Sorry that happened to you. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI should be sorry, too. I want to be\u2014wel , more than I am\u2014</p><p>but it brought me to you, so...\u201d</p><p>He kissed her temple in thanks. I wonder how you drew that piece of Hate inside you without kil ing the host. I wonder how you took Hate, but not Secrets.</p> <p>\u201cFrom what you told me, the host of Hate wanted me to free him. Until the pain started. Then he changed his mind. You didn\u2019t want me to take Secrets. Maybe that has something to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I wanted to hurt him, but didn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>That makes more sense. But either way, I never want you to go through a purging again.</p><p>Frowning, she sat up, turned, and straddled his waist. \u201cSo you plan to deny us both for the rest of our lives?\u201d</p> <p>Yes. Even though the word passed from his mind to hers, his tone stil managed to drip with al kinds of irritation. He wanted her, damn it, and resisting her was nearly impossible. Practical y riding him as she was, her breasts uptilted, her nipples hard, she wasn\u2019t making it easy on him.</p><p>She was making it hard. Very, very hard.</p><p>One of her brows arched, and a calculating gleam entered her eyes. She flattened her palms on his pectorals and leaned forward, as if she meant to push off him and stand. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re making me resort to rape, Amun.\u201d</p><p>Haidee\u2014</p><p>In the next instant, she raised her hips and impaled herself on his erection. She was already wet, and took him easily.</p><p>His lips parted on a silent moan of bliss.</p> <p>Her head fel back, and her nails dug deep. \u201cA girl wil do what a girl has to do to prove to her man that the only way to hurt her is to deny her. But then, I guess I\u2019m not a girl. I\u2019m borderline demon, so you should have expected this kind of behavior.\u201d</p><p>You shouldn\u2019t have\u2014you need to\u2014oh, gods... Unable to stop himself, Amun arched his back and surged the rest of the way inside her, hitting her deep, so deep. A hoarse cry left him this time, echoing around him, and in the back of his mind he expected words to start fal ing from his lips.</p><p>They didn\u2019t. So he forced himself to return to that motionless state, panting, afraid and hopeful.</p><p>As her knees squeezed his sides, her stomach quivered from the pleasure of having him inside her. She\u2019d never looked lovelier, he thought. Never looked more pagan, more...his.</p><p>Haidee, he gasped into her mind. I shouldn\u2019t have thrust the rest of the way. You have to...move...off me...on me...you just have to move, damn it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. She remained stil , watching him.</p><p>His fingers banded around her waist, holding tight. She was so wet, so wonderful y cool inside, and she was kil ing him with every second that passed, refusing to move off him\u2014</p><p>or on him.</p> <p>Final y he sagged against the ground. He didn\u2019t have the strength to push her away. And he damn sure didn\u2019t have the courage to urge her on. He wouldn\u2019t hurt her. He wouldn\u2019t risk her.</p><p>Haidee, he said, trying again.</p><p>\u201cJust hold on, baby,\u201d she whispered huskily. \u201cThis little lady is gonna do al the work.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>ALL THE WORK...</p><p>Holy hel , she real y would kil him.</p><p>Especial y since there were no more secrets between them. Not anymore. Amun knew she could now read him as easily as he could read her, and knew why she was doing this. She had felt his fear, his determination never to touch her like this again, and even though he had felt her fear, she was wil ing to risk herself. To try this again.</p><p>But more than he wanted the exquisite pleasure he could find in her body, the utter bliss of feeling her inner wal s clamp around him, holding him close, the thril of sliding inside of her, retreating, then sliding back in, he wanted her safe.</p><p>Secrets, he gritted out. Do you know what wil happen to her if we...if I...take her again?</p><p>His demon was stil lost in her mind, soaking everything in.</p><p>Damn this! Haidee hadn\u2019t moved since her announcement.</p><p>She merely sat there, his shaft buried deep inside her, giving him time to adjust to her plans. If he\u2019d been a stronger man, he would have shoved her off. But he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He was a warrior who had final y found his woman. A warrior who wanted to possess her, body and soul. A warrior who needed to stake his claim, to warn every other man away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l go slow, al right? Just release my hips and I\u2019l rock us both to paradise.\u201d</p><p>No, he managed to growl into her mind. He\u2019d grabbed her again? Yep. He had. I wil protect you. Even from myself.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to go fast, then?\u201d she asked, ignoring the other things he\u2019d said.</p><p>No! Gods, yes.</p><p>\u201cWel , what do I have to say to change your mind? I need your fire, Amun. Your heat.\u201d As she spoke, she leaned down, shifting the slant of his erection inside her and making him groan. She braced her hands beside his head, her breasts meshing into his chest, her nipples stabbing at him, her wanton mouth poised about his. \u201cAnd I think, maybe, you need my chil ?\u201d</p><p>That slight hesitation revealed something her thoughts and tone hadn\u2019t. Uncertainty. She was afraid she couldn\u2019t please him sexual y. That she was too cold for him, that she would hurt him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t al ow her to find fault with herself. To question her power over him. Some men might not like their women knowing just how badly they were whipped, but Amun wasn\u2019t one of them. The better she understood the depths of his feelings, the more confident she would be. He wanted her confident.</p><p>As she nipped at his lower lip, he released her hips, slid his hands under hers, beside his temples, and twined their fingers. She peered down at him, those pearl-gray eyes luminous\u2014and confused, as if she didn\u2019t understand what he was offering.</p><p>I\u2019m not wearing a condom this time, either, he said.</p><p>Her pupils expanded as she realized what his comment meant. Surrender. He was giving in, giving her what she wanted. Risking her, the most important part of his life, to share this moment with her.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d she asked, her radiant expression lighting her up from the inside out.</p><p>No. He imagined her pregnant with his child, as radiant as Ashlyn was with Maddox\u2019s twins, and almost came inside her without a single thrust. Do you? His voice was choked now.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Then move on me, sweetheart. Let me give you fire, while I luxuriate in that ice. When she tried to rise, to ride him, he squeezed her hands, holding her in place. Just like this.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She used her knees as leverage and glided up his length, making both of them gasp.</p><p>Now kiss me.</p><p>On the downward slide, she pressed her mouth into his.</p><p>Immediately he opened, welcoming her tongue. Cool, wet, just the way he liked her. She tasted of his wildest fantasies and unending passion, both of which wiped his thoughts, his concerns, and left only need. He fought the urge to hammer at her, hard and fast, driving them both to the sweetest insanity.</p><p>They would go slowly this time. If, at any point, she seemed to be in pain, he would find the strength to pul from her.</p><p>Up and down she moved on him, savoring. Savoring until they were panting in each other\u2019s mouth, silently gasping each other\u2019s names, her nipples rasping against his chest, creating a decadent friction. His blood was heating, and that heat was seeping into her. Her blood must have been cooling because that chil seeped into him, wrapping them both in fire and ice, one sensation feeding off the other.</p><p>Too fast, he said, even though they were moving at such a leisurely, languid pace, hips rol ing together, her clitoris grinding against him, her desire providing such a tight, perfect glide. Hurting?</p><p>\u201cSo...good...\u201d</p><p>He licked his way to her jaw. Her ear. He nibbled on the outer shel , then dove inside. A shiver raked her spine and her lower body jerked against his. Another nibble and then he was licking down her neck.</p><p>He stopped at the wild thump of her pulse and sucked, drawing the blood higher, just under his tongue.</p><p>That earned another shiver from her.</p><p>\u201cAmun?\u201d</p><p>Yes, sweetheart. Gods, he would never tire of hearing his name on her lips. Tilt your head farther to the right.</p><p>She obeyed, and he sucked at the tendon between nape and shoulder. Her movements quickened, but the thrusts became shal ow, her body riding him only part of the way.</p><p>Sweetest. Torture. Ever. She kept him in a state of unwavering desire, his skin so sensitized even the caress of air stoked him higher.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I love you,\u201d she said.</p><p>W-what? Dare he hope she\u2019d said\u2014</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, sweetheart. She was everything to him. Simply everything. After her declaration, there was no holding back. No going slowly, no taking their time, playing it safe, easing their way to climax. Amun rol ed her over, releasing her hands to grip her knees and shove them as far apart as they would go. Tel me again.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He pul ed nearly al the way out before slamming home.</p><p>Again.</p><p>A cry spil ed from her lips. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Again. In, out. In, out. Hard, fast. The heat spreading, the ice consuming. He stared into her eyes, so deep, losing himself, glad.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Her nails dug into his back, drawing blood. Her head thrashed from side to side.</p><p>In, out. In, out. He released one of her legs and placed it between his own, his testicles suddenly rubbing against her thigh. The new position diminished the space between her core and his hammering erection, the rounded, weeping head scraping against her clitoris with every insistent inward pounding.</p><p>Soon she was gasping, incoherent. So was he. From pleasure, no hint of pain. And if he\u2019d thought their first time intense, he learned the error of such a mind-set. She loved him. He owned her heart, just as she owned his. They were melded by more than their bodies. They were melded in spirit, part of each other forevermore.</p><p>Relief and ecstasy poured off him, enveloped them both, and without thought he closed his teeth over that wel -</p><p>sucked tendon. Immediately she gasped, went rigid. Her back bowed, her hips lifted, forcing him as deep as he could go, her inner wal s clenching on him, milking him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Amun erupted. He gave her every drop, fil ing her up, branding her, staking that claim.</p><p>Mine, mine, mine. No secret. Not to him, and not to his demon, and not to Haidee.</p><p>Final y, when he had nothing left, he col apsed atop her.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t complain. She sagged to the ground, as depleted as he was. He barely managed to angle his body so that he wouldn\u2019t crush her, but he didn\u2019t move off her al the way, didn\u2019t pul out of her. He was where he belonged, and he was loath to lose the connection.</p><p>Hurting?</p><p>Her eyes were closed, the long length of her lashes creating a fan of shadows over her cheeks. \u201cNo.</p><p>Dead.\u201d He chuckled. Then my woman is pleased? Even though she had to do most of the work herself?</p><p>She blinked open those pearl-grays. \u201cSo I am your woman?\u201d</p> <p>His humor drained in the face of her doubt. Now. Always.</p><p>\u201cWil you\u2014?\u201d She licked her swol en, wel -kissed lips. \u201cWil you say the words, then?\u201d</p><p>He smoothed his hands over her brow, not surprised to note that he was shaking. He had needed the words, so it stood to reason that she did, as wel . He was ashamed he hadn\u2019t said them before now. Had been so selfish, enjoying her declaration but not offering his own. I love you, Haidee. I love you so much I ache.</p><p>Tension seemed to drain from her, though he\u2019d never felt her stiffen. \u201cDo you forgive me for what I did?</p><p>Al those centuries ago?\u201d</p><p>Sweetheart. What is there to forgive? You were as consumed by your demon as I was by mine.</p> <p>Tears sprinkled from the corners of her eyes, then rained down her cheeks, streaking down her lovely skin. \u201cMy demon. I don\u2019t think I\u2019l ever get used to hearing those words in conjunction with myself.\u201d</p><p>But it\u2019s true. You took a piece of Hate, but didn\u2019t know to purge it. That piece bonded with you, became a part of you.</p><p>That piece drove you.</p><p>She placed her palm over his heart. \u201cYour friends wil never understand that. They\u2019l never accept me.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her jaw and angled her head, forcing her to peer up at him. You\u2019re first with me. They\u2019l accept that or they\u2019l lose me.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to lose them. You need them.\u201d</p><p>I need you.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I accidently take their demons?\u201d</p> <p>You won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d</p><p>Just like with me, you won\u2019t want to. Therefore you won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou trust me that much?\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Her arms banded around his neck and drew him down, al owing her to bury her face in the hol ow of his neck. The tears continued to flow, icy crystals that broke his heart. Her lithe body rocked against him as she sobbed.</p><p>What\u2019s wrong, sweetheart? I wanted to make you happy, not sad.</p><p>\u201cI am happy. I\u2019ve never been first before. I mean, for a while, with my parents, I was. After they\u2019d decided to keep me, I guess, and before my sister was born. But then, when Hate tortured them, they begged him to take me, and that hurt me. Here, now, I know you\u2019l always put me first and I shouldn\u2019t let you do that. Not for me. Not for anyone, and I\u2019m babbling, I know, but if I let you do this, you\u2019l just be unhappy later on.\u201d</p><p>He rol ed to his back, fitting her atop him like a wel -placed puzzle piece. Unhappy? Why, are you planning to leave me?</p><p>\u201cNo, you deliberately obtuse man. I\u2019m too greedy.\u201d</p><p>He found himself chuckling again. As long as I\u2019ve got you, I can never be unhappy.</p><p>\u201cYour friends\u2014\u201d</p><p>Wil accept you. Or else, he thought.</p><p>Secrets remained quiet. Perhaps the demon knew the truth of their reactions, perhaps not. Either way, Amun planned to do everything in his power to ensure his friends did, in fact, accept his woman.</p><p>If they couldn\u2019t, fine. He\u2019d go. He\u2019d miss them, always love them, but he\u2019d go. If they threatened her, he\u2019d go\u2014but he\u2019d hurt them before he did. If they tried to make him choose between them and Haidee, they\u2019d lose. No question.</p><p>His heart beat for this woman. He lived for this woman.</p><p>She\u2019d endured travesty after travesty when she only deserved pleasure. He would now provide that pleasure.</p><p>Nothing would stand in his way.</p><p>She was amazing. She had survived the only way she\u2019d known how, with grit, courage and determination, never realizing she was battling herself as wel as the forces poised against her. With Hate a part of her, she probably shouldn\u2019t have been able to love\u2014by her own admission, loving wasn\u2019t easy for her\u2014but again she had proven just how amazing she was. Her love was stronger than the darkness inside her.</p><p>He held her until she settled, caressing her and whispering to her, then kissed her temple. I want you to know that I\u2019m not going away, sweetheart, and I\u2019m not going to regret choosing you. I\u2019m with you, now and always, just like I said.</p><p>\u201cHow can you love me?\u201d she asked between hiccups.</p><p>How can you love me?</p><p>\u201cI just do. You\u2019re a part of me.\u201d</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>Her arms squeezed at him again, and he felt her chil y sigh.</p><p>\u201cThe demons have been purged from you,\u201d she said sleepily. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to stay down here anymore.\u201d</p><p>She was right. He should have realized. He\u2019d already planned to leave, but now their mission was actual y completed. Funny, but he found he wasn\u2019t quite ready to abandon their cave. He wanted his woman al to himself for just a little longer. Let\u2019s get some rest, and when we wake up, we\u2019l find a way to summon Zacharel. He brought us here, so he can return us to the fortress. If he didn\u2019t, wel , they would simply find another way.</p><p>Nothing was impossible. He knew that now.</p><p>\u201cAl right,\u201d she said.</p><p>Before we go, though, we\u2019re going to use the pack to summon the proper tools to tattoo you. He wanted Micah\u2019s name erased and his own added. Al over. On every limb, finger and toe, so that she would always know the name of the man she belonged with.</p><p>\u201cGood idea. Yours can be the first name on my un-inked arm.\u201d</p><p>More than my name. There\u2019s going to be an entire paragraph dedicated to how much you love me.</p><p>She chuckled, and the husky sound delighted him. Turned him on. Hel , everything about her turned him on.</p><p>Who are the others tattooed on your arm? Skye? Viola?</p><p>\u201cSkye saved my life once. We were prisoners, and I was too injured to escape on my own. And Viola is possessed by the demon of Narcissism. See how the i is dotted with an x? We fought. I don\u2019t remember the outcome.\u201d</p><p>Secrets could help her with that.</p><p>We\u2019l need to send you notes about me, then. Pictures, too.</p><p>If he could find a camera that could capture his face, that is.</p><p>Somehow his demon managed to distort even drawings of him. Stil . He wasn\u2019t taking any chances. Yes, he was going to do everything in his power to defend her, would even die for her, shield her with his own body, but damn it, al their bases were going to be covered. Just in case.</p><p>\u201cAnother good idea,\u201d she said after a big yawn.</p><p>Sleep now, sweetheart.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She drifted into sleep almost immediately, her body relaxing against his.</p><p>He wanted every night to end exactly this way. With Haidee on top of him, sated and trusting him to keep her safe. And he wanted to awaken each morning with her stil in his arms. They\u2019d make love, talk and share, drown in each other.</p><p>He was smiling as he, too, drifted off to sleep.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>CLAWS SCRAPED AGAINST A nearby wal . \u201cHaidee.\u201d</p><p>The eerie howl of her name echoed, blending with the swish of a robe.</p><p>Blood, a river between her mother and her father. Both helpless...dead.</p><p>Haidee\u2019s eyelids popped open, dread already curling in her stomach. She knew those sounds, knew that voice. Only a nightmare, she told herself, or another realm of hel . Trust no one and nothing. Except Amun. A lesson she\u2019d learned wel .</p><p>\u201cLittle Haidee,\u201d the voice sang, a whisper. \u201cI know you\u2019re close by. I can smel you.\u201d</p><p>Please be a nightmare or another realm of hel , she thought desperately.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot hide from me, little Haidee. You have what\u2019s mine. Mine, mine, mine.\u201d Scraaape.</p><p>\u201cHay...dee...final y, you\u2019re going to give it back.\u201d</p><p>Blood, a river between her mother and her father. Both helpless...dead.</p><p>\u201cHay...dee... You hid when you were a little girl, too. Do you remember? I do. The screams, the splatter. The pleas. Your sister squealed like a pig when the blade sank into her bel y. Your mother begged me to stop, to take you away.</p><p>Your father, wel , he was the first to die, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She cringed, fought a wave of sickness. No, not a nightmare, not another realm. There was too much glee in that tone. Too much truth to the memory.</p><p>Hate was here.</p><p>Somehow, the demon had found her. Had come for her.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Denial roaring through her head\u2014not now, please not now</p><p>\u2014she jackknifed to her feet, wild gaze already searching.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see him, but that didn\u2019t lessen her dread. She was stil in the cave, Amun lying on the pal et he\u2019d made for them.</p><p>He must have awoken at her movement, or maybe he\u2019d heard the bastard\u2019s taunts. His eyes were already open. He sat up stiffly, pul ed on a pair of pants and grabbed two blades without pausing to clear his head.</p><p>He asked no questions. Maybe he didn\u2019t have to. Since making love that second time, they\u2019d been utterly attuned to each other, and she\u2019d actual y felt his emotions for her, the sweet depths of his love.</p><p>\u201cHaidee.\u201d Hate was closer now. \u201cCome out, come out wherever you are.\u201d</p><p>Blood, a river between her mother and her father. Both helpless...dead.</p><p>No. No, no, no. The memory would not consume her. Since meeting Amun, she\u2019d barely thought of that night and thought perhaps she was final y healing. She would not be distracted. Not this time.</p><p>She dressed as swiftly as Amun had, then weaponed up.</p><p>She\u2019d known this day would come. She just hadn\u2019t expected it to come now.

The old crone at the circus had tried to warn her, hadn\u2019t she? \u201cSoon\u201d had final y arrived.</p><p>Amun tugged her toward the only entrance to the cave, pressed her to the side, out of striking distance, then turned and waited, ready to attack. His shoulder pressed into the center of her chest, holding her in place.</p><p>\u201cHaidee girl. Dead girl. You have what\u2019s mine. You\u2019re not going to die before I can take it. Not this time. That wil come after.\u201d</p> <p>Blood, a river between her mother and her father. Both helpless...dead.</p><p>Her molars ground together. \u201cWhat are you planning? He\u2019s not like your friends,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNot human in any way.\u201d</p><p>I know, Amun final y said, dark and menacing as their thoughts merged. Secrets knows. He is more than immortal. He is a child of a goddess. Of Themis. Her son.</p><p>Always he enjoyed kil ing, suffering. That\u2019s why he was sent to Tartarus.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hide her sudden spike of terror. Not from Amun. Her breathing grew shal ow. Hate was the child of a goddess. A god himself. How would they defeat a god?</p> <p>Secrets flashed images of Hate through Amun\u2019s head, which in turn caused them to flash in hers. He was fast, too fast, his strength unparal eled. Haidee was the only person who\u2019d ever walked away from him, and she\u2019d done so only because the cold had surprised him. He wouldn\u2019t be surprised this time.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t fight him. We\u2019l lose.\u201d</p><p>I fought gods al the time when I lived in the heavens.</p><p>\u201cYes, and that was thousands of years ago, and you had an immortal army as backup. Right now it\u2019s just me and you.</p><p>He\u2019l slaughter us.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019l think of something.</p> <p>Secrets disagreed, and his certainty swam through her.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what we do, I\u2019m going to die today,\u201d she said flatly. The demon wasn\u2019t even trying to hide the realization, the knowledge now as much a part of her as Hate. She wasn\u2019t ready, though. Needed more time.</p><p>No. No, you\u2019re not. I won\u2019t let you.</p><p>Just as surely as she could discern Secrets\u2019s knowledge, she could feel Amun\u2019s rising panic. She had to fight her own panic al the more stringently or they would feed off each other, make each other worse.</p><p>Someone had to stay calm. Someone had to get Amun out of this alive.</p><p>It was already too late for her.</p><p>\u201cListen to me.\u201d As she spoke, she forced herself to accept her fate. She would die\u2014in her way\u2014and she would hurt.</p><p>So what. She\u2019d done it before. And this time, she\u2019d do it for Amun. There was no greater reason. \u201cIn a few days, I\u2019l be in my cave. No,\u201d she rushed out when his gaze swung to her.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything. And don\u2019t...don\u2019t come for me. I won\u2019t remember you, and I\u2019l attack you. But I think\u2014\u201d hoped \u201c\u2014I\u2019l dream of you again and when the hate settles, I\u2019l come for you. We\u2019l be together again.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re not dying. Not this time. I\u2019l die first.</p><p>That\u2019s what she feared most. \u201cJust...let him have a go at me,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cYou heard him. He wants his demon back, and he\u2019s not leaving without it.\u201d</p><p>He won\u2019t be leaving, anyway.</p><p>Oh, Amun. Stubborn to his core. \u201cSomething\u2019s changed.</p><p>Always before, he kept his distance when he found me, afraid to touch me. This time, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s afraid.\u201d</p><p>He is. A little.</p><p>But not enough. \u201cGood,\u201d she forced herself to say. \u201cI can work with that. You\u2019l stay here, and I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>No!</p><p>She knew she\u2019d just insulted Amun\u2019s warrior core, but she didn\u2019t want to risk his life. She would come back. He would not. \u201cAmun, just listen to me. I don\u2019t want you to fight him, either. He\u2019s a freaking god.\u201d</p><p>Demigod. And you can\u2019t stop me.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. You know the outcome. We both know the outcome. Your demon is not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaidee...mine...mine, you have what\u2019s mine,\u201d that despised voice from her past said. Hate didn\u2019t sweep through the cave\u2019s only opening. He simply walked through the wal to stand in front of her and Amun. \u201cTogether again, at long last. The thief wil final y have her due. You took what\u2019s mine. I want it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRepeat ourselves much?\u201d As the past col ided with present, she wanted to vomit. As always, he wore a hooded black robe, his face cast in thick, impenetrable shadows.</p><p>His feet floated just above the ground, a wind she couldn\u2019t feel ghosting around him.</p><p>Don\u2019t approach him, Amun growled, inching away from her, severing contact. And don\u2019t touch me.</p><p>Okay? We need to engage him verbal y if we\u2019re to learn how to best him without engaging him physical y.</p><p>Okay, she said. Lied. Maybe. She wasn\u2019t sure. And why couldn\u2019t she touch Amun? When his shoulder had pressed into her, she\u2019d read his mind, his demon. Now, there was...</p><p>nothing.</p><p>Amun gave a jerky nod to let her know he\u2019d heard her reply before their connection had been severed.</p><p>Hate hadn\u2019t spoken during the byplay, had merely watched them. Now a low growl erupted from his throat. \u201cYou\u2019ve been together. Demon and Hunter.\u201d The words carried a hint of fire. \u201cYou do not deserve pleasure, Haidee my girl.</p><p>Mine. After what you did to me, you deserve only pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here is none of your business,\u201d she said, raising her chin.</p><p>Haidee, watch your words. I said engage him, not infuriate him.</p><p>Good, they could stil talk to each other. And just what can I say to make him want to stick around and chat, rather than do what he came to do?</p><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><p>Before she could respond, Hate\u2019s growl sharpened like the deadliest of blades. \u201cI want what\u2019s mine, and you wil give it to me.\u201d</p><p>Amun\u2019s arm stretched out, a hard block that prevented her from moving forward\u2014or Hate from launching at her directly. She almost pushed that arm aside, but remembered his command not to touch him. Damn it. She wanted to save him, not offer him up as a replacement dinner.</p><p>\u201cDo you have no response, little Haidee? Dead Haidee?\u201d</p><p>Even as Amun warned her to keep quiet, she said, \u201cWhat if I decide to keep it?\u201d She didn\u2019t want the bastard\u2019s attention riveted on her man. Hate could move too quickly, kil before his victim could even blink. Hel , Hate could walk through wal s, as he\u2019d already proven, and simply attack Amun from behind. \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>Damn it, Amun cursed. Are you trying to ring the starting bel ? I just need a little more time. I\u2019m having trouble reading him.</p><p>Clawed hands curled into fists, peeking out of the long sleeves of that dark robe. \u201cYou wil give me what\u2019s mine.</p><p>Give it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with false calm, \u201cI don\u2019t think I wil .\u201d</p><p>The wind whipped up, agitating the hem of his robe. \u201cI\u2019l make you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWil you real y? Then why haven\u2019t you already?\u201d</p><p>Wind, wind, so much wind.</p><p>If she wasn\u2019t careful, the bastard would attack no matter what she did or said. \u201cWil I die if I do give you what you want?\u201d she asked, pretending she was thinking it over.</p><p>Good. That\u2019s good.</p><p>\u201cGive. Me.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t answered her question, she noticed. \u201cYou know what? If you want that piece of the demon back so badly, you come over here and take it.\u201d</p><p>What? Amun shouted, the wind rocking through the entire cavern.</p><p>Like I said, he can\u2019t do it on his own or he would have already. He has to have my cooperation. I\u2019m just reminding him of that.</p><p>Dark tension pulsed from that floating body. \u201cNow, Haidee.</p><p>Is that any way to speak to your lover?\u201d For the first time in their sporadic, centuries-long acquaintance, Hate flipped back the hood of his robe, freeing his features from those too-thick shadows.</p><p>She gaped, horrified. He was grotesque. His skin was rotted, pitted, and most of his hair was missing.</p><p>The few patches there were were thin and coarse, frizzed. Rather than eyes, he watched her through two black holes of despair.</p><p>\u201cYou have never been my lover,\u201d she spat.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Before her eyes, his skin smoothed out, darkened. His hair grew, thick and black, glossy like silk.</p><p>Beautiful brown eyes appeared in those fathomless holes.</p><p>Soon, beautiful Micah stood before her. Nearly identical to Amun, but without the sizzle of awareness.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head violently. \u201cNo!\u201d She would have known. Would have sensed. There would have been a clue. Something, anything. Right? Like the fact that he\u2019d gotten it wrong. She and Micah had never been lovers. Not real y.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the Micah you were with, sweetheart. Amun\u2019s voice soothed her rising disgust.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Hate said. \u201cI know you better than you know yourself, and knew you wanted this face.</p><p>Therefore I gave you this face.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s lying, I swear to you. But keep him talking. My demon is stil rooting through his head and we\u2019re close, so close to discovering how to defeat him.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d she growled.</p><p>Hate glared at her, but he said, \u201cThe phone cal , how else?</p><p>Once I locked onto your voice, it was only a matter of hours before I found you, wherever you happened to be. I admit, I didn\u2019t expect to find you here, reeking of another demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how do you have Micah\u2019s face? How long have you been Micah? Where is the real Micah?\u201d</p><p>Familiar lips curled into a smile. \u201cPerhaps I was your Micah al along.\u201d</p><p>No, Amun said. He became Micah a few days after Strider grabbed you.</p><p>Was Secrets revealing the truth to him? Because she believed Amun. Always. Which meant she hadn\u2019t kissed this creature, hadn\u2019t completed missions with this creature.</p><p>Only Micah. Her relief was palpable. \u201cAnd now the human is...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead? Yes. I kil ed him. And do you know what? While he lay dying, I showed him your face.\u201d For a split second, she saw her own face staring over at her. Then he returned to Micah\u2019s image. \u201cI told him how much you despised him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That is the truth. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>Dead. Micah was dead. And he\u2019d been kil ed so cruel y, thinking she loathed him. Even though she had never truly loved Micah, she found that she mourned his loss. He\u2019d had many flaws, but he had fought for what he\u2019d believed in.</p><p>\u201cHave you nothing more to say, dead Haidee, before I kil this warrior, too? And I wil , you know. I wil force you to watch\u2014unless you give me what I seek. Now, now, now.\u201d</p> <p>He would, too, which meant they\u2019d run out of time. Her gaze shot to Amun. Have you learned the way to kil him without fighting him yet? Please, please, please.</p><p>A muscle jumped in Amun\u2019s jaw, and several seconds ticked away. No.</p><p>That hesitation... He was lying. And suddenly, even without touching him, she knew what he was keeping from her, what he\u2019d tried so hard to prevent, so desperate to find another way. And she couldn\u2019t believe she hadn\u2019t thought of it before. Removing his demon completely wil kil him the same way it would kil you. Won\u2019t it?</p><p>His head whipped in her direction, his eyes giving the briefest flare before he refocused on Hate. Haidee.</p><p>You cannot do that. Because there are only two possible outcomes. You\u2019l be stuck with al of Hate, perhaps losing yourself to him, or, when Hate is final y put back together, you\u2019l expunge him and die.</p> <p>I don\u2019t care. If I die, I\u2019l come back.</p><p>And I don\u2019t want your hands on him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want her hands on him, either. Didn\u2019t want to touch the being that had slaughtered her family.</p><p>For Amun, though...anything.</p><p>\u201cAl right. I\u2019m wil ing to give you what you want,\u201d she said to Hate.</p><p>Haidee, Amun warned.</p> <p>She continued anyway. \u201cFor me to return your demon to you, you\u2019l have to let me touch you. And as you know, I can\u2019t touch you without hurting you. That tiny piece of the demon hurt you coming out, right, so it stands to reason it\u2019l hurt going back into you. So don\u2019t fight me, okay?\u201d Because she wasn\u2019t going to give him the demon. She was going to take it. Al of it.</p><p>No matter the consequences to herself.</p><p>A long while passed in silence, Hate rigid as he pondered whether or not to trust her. Final y, perhaps realizing he could not have what he wanted any other way, he nodded. \u201cI wil let you touch me.\u201d</p><p>She experienced another beat of hope. Until\u2014</p><p>\u201cAfter I ensure your cooperation,\u201d he finished. \u201cBetray me, and your warrior dies. See?\u201d</p><p>Hope, completely dashed. And there was no more time to think, to prepare. One second Hate was in front of them, the next he was behind them, just as she\u2019d feared. He shoved her out of the way, careful not to connect with her skin, and slammed a mighty fist into Amun\u2019s head. Her warrior stumbled to the side but was quick to right himself\u2014and just as quick to spin, blade slashing out.</p><p>Hate anticipated the move and dematerialized, reappearing behind Amun. Again. The creature had no weapons, but then, he\u2019d never needed them before, so why would he now? He always used his claws.</p><p>He slashed those claws at Amun, scraping the back of the warrior\u2019s neck.</p> <p>Amun howled inside his head, no sound escaping his lips.</p><p>He spun, launched himself at Hate a second time. That black robe swished as the creature danced out of the way, and an eerie laugh fil ed the cave.</p><p>\u201cYou are stronger than the others I kil ed on Haidee\u2019s behalf, but like them, you wil fal . I won\u2019t slay you, though.</p><p>No, I\u2019l just keep you close to the brink. And afterward, when I have al of my demon, I\u2019l let you go.\u201d</p><p>A lie. She knew that soul-deep. He had no plans to let either of them go.</p><p>Haidee narrowed her eyes on the creature responsible for so much of her pain. He was Hate in its purest form. And she had a piece of him inside her. She had Hate. She drew on the emotion now, letting it fil her, consume her. The ice always churning inside her blossomed in her veins, turning her blood to sludge.</p><p>Good. Yes. This was her purpose, after al . This was what the goddess had wanted her to do.</p><p>Destroy.</p><p>The warriors continued to fight, lashing out, connecting, blood spraying. Amun was faster than she\u2019d realized and managed to land several blows. In fact, the more he fought, the faster he became, until he seemed to anticipate exactly where Hate would reappear. Soon Amun was landing more punches and slices than his enemy.</p><p>Stil . That wouldn\u2019t stop her from doing what needed to be done. Final y, she would end this.</p><p>The two slammed into the rocky wal s of the cave, dust pluming around them. One would throw the other, and they would spring apart, only to fly at each other again. Snarls and growls reverberated, fol owed by the crack of broken bones, the sick whisper of flesh splitting apart.</p><p>She would have to jump into their midst.</p><p>A strange turn of events, one she\u2019d never seen coming.</p><p>She\u2019d fought al her life to stay alive, to avoid the sting of death and rebirth. Not this time, though. Better to die herself than to al ow Hate to live. Better to die herself than to al ow Amun to be hurt. She\u2019d hurt him enough. She loved him more than her own life. More than that, she owed him. Hel , she owed his friends. They\u2019d lost one brother because of her. She wouldn\u2019t be the cause of Amun\u2019s loss.</p><p>Though she trembled, knowing deep down that this was going to hurt her more than it would hurt Hate, Haidee focused on Amun. On his thoughts. They weren\u2019t touching, but he was too busy to block her and soon she heard a whirl of commands, absorbed his knowledge and his fury, al the while sifting though the massive influx to find what she needed\u2014the urgings of his demon.</p><p>There! Suddenly she knew what Hate planned, three moves There! Suddenly she knew what Hate planned, three moves in advance. She watched. Waited. Amun was so focused on his opponent, he paid her invasion\u2014and her intentions</p><p>\u2014no heed. She counted down...stil watching...stil waiting...final y launching herself into the fray. She plowed into Hate just as he reappeared, her head connecting with his middle and her hands wrapping around his neck. They were skin to skin as they plummeted to the ground. Better yet, they were out of Amun\u2019s range.</p><p>The moment they hit, she unleashed the cold. Hate screamed as ice formed on his heated body, connecting them, and he was unable to jerk away.</p><p>Haidee, she heard Amun scream inside her head.</p><p>She tuned him out, concentrating ful y on her task. When she\u2019d taken those demons from Amun, she\u2019d had to lower her guard. She\u2019d had to stop fighting him and let him in.</p><p>Welcome him. She did that now, with Hate. Lowered her guard. Fighting him no longer.</p><p>She wanted his demon, and she would have it.</p><p>At first, the demon\u2014that hot, hot darkness inside him, scaled, with glowing red eyes\u2014ran from her as the demons she\u2019d absorbed had done. She was having none of that, however, and gave chase, the ice spreading. Soon there was nowhere else for the terrified demon to run. She had consumed Hate\u2019s entire body.</p><p>She latched on to a sharpened claw. At the first moment of contact, pain exploded through her. She wanted to balk, to jump as far away as she could, but she merely held on tighter, heaving the being from Hate\u2019s body into hers. Tug-of-war, and she would win.</p><p>Despite the ice, Hate thrashed against her, pushed against her. Stil she held on, stil she tugged. Then that ice began to melt, leaving her. Just as before, fire bloomed in its place, spreading, and acid started flowing through her veins. Spiderwebs winked through her vision, and dizziness bombarded her.</p><p>The darkness that had been a part of her for centuries cried out in welcome as the demon High Lord slipped into her little by little. No longer did she have to tug. The demon wanted inside her now, was even aiding her, desperate to crawl in, to be whole again.</p><p>Almost over, she thought, hurting so badly tears were streaking down her cheeks.</p><p>Suddenly there was a pain of another kind tearing through her neck, her back\u2014Amun started shouting again, perhaps crying, but she hardly noticed. Her insides were too busy burning to ash.</p><p>And then she was being pul ed away from the former keeper of Hate. She didn\u2019t protest; she had the demon now. Al of the demon, and it was zipping through her mind, banging into her skul , fil ing her up, consuming her.</p><p>Haidee, sweetheart. Please. Let me see those beautiful eyes.</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered open, and she saw that Amun was looming over her, bathed in red. Blood? But blood had never glowed like that before.</p><p>Sweetheart, oh, gods, sweetheart. He\u2019d never looked so tormented.</p><p>She opened her mouth to reply, but something warm flowed from her mouth rather than words. Is he dead? She didn\u2019t have the strength to push the words into his mind, but somehow he heard her anyway.</p><p>Yes, sweetheart, he\u2019s dead. Tears glistened in his black gaze.</p><p>You\u2019re sad? Don\u2019t be sad, baby. We won. She tried to reach up, to brush those tears away, but again, she didn\u2019t have the strength.</p><p>Oh, sweetheart. Soft fingers smoothed her brow.</p><p>Her heartbeat was slowing, then fluttering, almost nonexistent. Thankful y, though, the cold was returning to her limbs, dousing the fire. Once the ice returned, she thought, she could expel the demon, right? And she and Amun could be together.</p><p>Amun had feared she wouldn\u2019t be able to expel the demon, that he would forever be a part of her. If that were the case, she would deal.</p><p>He...fought you. He ravaged your throat.</p><p>She blinked, not understanding. Sweetheart, you\u2019re...</p><p>fading.</p><p>Fading? The red glow bathing his face was dimming. Did that mean... I\u2019m...dying?</p><p>No! I\u2019l do something. There has to be something. Amun leapt into motion, dragging the backpack next to her. With shaky hands, he reached inside and withdrew bandages and other materials to try and save her. Stay with me, sweetheart. Okay?</p><p>She was. She was dying.</p><p>She tried to obey him, she real y did. Not because she feared the pain that awaited her, but because she wanted to be with this man always. She didn\u2019t want him hurt by images of her death the way she\u2019d been hurt by images of her family. So she fought the cold, the weakness. And while she fought, she realized she could expunge the demon, because a scaled, fanged and clawed creature rose from her skin, its eyes bright red. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Amun watched, horrified. She watched, too, amazed that she hadn\u2019t had to corner him and force him out. Amazed that she didn\u2019t hurt anymore. But when the beast darted out of the cave, roaring hysterical y, she found there was nothing left to tether her to her body. Darkness was pul ing at her.</p><p>Her organs were shutting down, the ice that had saved her now kil ing her. She knew the feeling wel .</p><p>Had experienced it hundreds of times before.

Haidee had died. Died. Her heart had stopped, her ruined body had gone stil and her eyes had glazed. She\u2019d had no breath left inside her lungs, even when he\u2019d pumped at her chest for hours, her blood al over his hands. And then she\u2019d disappeared. Simply vanished, as if she\u2019d never existed.</p><p>He screamed for hours more\u2014and Secrets screamed along with him.</p><p>While Amun had been making love with Haidee that second time, the demon had realized that she would never hurt them, no matter how powerful she was. That she would always strive to make life better for them.</p><p>With the realization, affection for her had grown. Not just because she possessed so many secrets, but because of her. Even though she was a demon-slayer, a justice-dealer, she was the demon\u2019s favorite playground.</p><p>How could Themis have sentenced such a precious female to die? Where was the justice in such a vile action?</p><p>Amun was suddenly happy the goddess was currently rotting in Tartarus with the rest of the Greeks.</p> <p>After everything she\u2019d done, she deserved that and more.</p><p>Only, if she hadn\u2019t acted, Amun never would have had this second chance with Haidee. Or even met her at al . She was a gift. His gift. And he\u2019d failed her. In every way that mattered, he\u2019d failed her. Twice she\u2019d died because of him.</p><p>And she hated to die, feared the pain, the loss of her memories.</p><p>My fault, he thought.</p><p>The first time had been an accident on his part. This second time, she had rushed headlong into danger to save him. He\u2019d been too focused on slaying their enemy to take note of her plan. Foolish of him. He was the keeper of Secrets, damn it! He should have guessed her intentions, and he should have stopped her.</p><p>When she had locked on Hate, Amun hadn\u2019t known what to do or how to separate them. Al Secrets had known was that breaking the link between the pair would hurt Haidee far more than letting her finish drawing the demon into herself. But then Hate had begun fighting her, chomping at her, clawing at her, and Amun hadn\u2019t cared about her pain</p><p>\u2014he\u2019d cared only about saving her life. He\u2019d ripped them apart.</p><p>But he was too late.</p> <p>The wound in Haidee\u2019s neck had been fatal.</p><p>Amun paced. If he summoned the angel, Zacharel, he would be escorted home. His demon knew this, sensed it now as if the knowledge had always been there, yet Amun could not force himself to do so.</p><p>This was the last place he\u2019d seen Haidee, the last place he\u2019d held her, tasted her, and he didn\u2019t want to leave just yet, didn\u2019t want to give up the sweet scent of her that lingered in the air or the chil of her that was wrapped around him like a cloak.</p><p>He needed to formulate a plan. Without interference from his friends.</p><p>Haidee had told him not to try to find her cave. That, he would ignore. He would find that cave. He would help her through those waves of hate. If she stil possessed any hint of the demon inside her, that is.</p><p>The creature had risen from her, and had seemed intact. Nothing missing.</p><p>But even without the demon, she wouldn\u2019t stay dead. She\u2019d said so herself. She would come back to him.</p><p>And if she was without even that smal piece, she could very wel remember him.</p><p>Suddenly hope wel ed within him. First, he had to find her.</p><p>And he would. She was out there. She had to be out there.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t remember him and fought him, he would let her go, wouldn\u2019t hurt her, even to save himself.</p><p>But then what?</p><p>What if she returned to the Hunters?</p><p>He would just have to fol ow her, guard her from a distance.</p><p>He\u2019d slipped past her defenses once. He could do so again.</p><p>Al he had to do was reach her.</p><p>Decided on his course of action, he grabbed the backpack and at last shouted for Zacharel in his mind.</p><p>A few seconds later, as expected, the angel appeared. No bright light, just blink, and the winged warrior was there. Those wings arched over the wide expanse of his shoulders, white threaded with gold. He stil wore a colorless robe, his dark hair slicked back from his face.</p><p>Those bril iant green eyes regarded Amun with satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cAnd so you are saved.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he signed. Now take me to my woman.</p><p>His demand elicited a single shake of that dark head.</p><p>There was no sorrow in the angel\u2019s expression. No emotion whatsoever. \u201cI cannot do so. She is dead.\u201d</p><p>So simply stated. Amun almost pounded over and stabbed the bastard in the heart. She wil be reanimated in Greece.</p><p>You wil take me to her. Now.</p><p>\u201cNo. She is not in Greece.\u201d</p><p>Yes. She is.</p><p>Stil emotionless, the angel said, \u201cWhen she drew the rest of Hate inside her, the demon reformed in its entirety. When she released it, she released every bit of it, even the part that had bonded to her. A bond that was never supposed to happen. She was supposed to draw and release. But because she did bond, she could no longer live without Hate. Just as you cannot live without your demon.\u201d The layer of truth in his voice was devastating. \u201cThis, you already know.\u201d</p><p>Stil he fought the very idea of it. She\u2019s alive, I tel you.</p><p>Aeron died, but then he lived.</p><p>\u201cAmun, Haidee had already died. She was already a soul, like those in the heavens and hel . A soul that has now withered once and for al , its source of life gone.\u201d</p><p>No! She\u2019s out there. She\u2019s alive. She had to be. Souls reanimate in hel . I\u2019ve seen them. You said so yourself.</p><p>\u201cThose souls never bonded to a demon. Never then lost that demon.\u201d</p><p>No! he repeated. She was blessed by a goddess.</p><p>\u201cA goddess who later turned her back.\u201d</p><p>Haidee is alive, damn you. A blessing is a blessing, and cannot be taken back.</p><p>\u201cJust as the favored cannot fal into disfavor and be kicked from the heavens?\u201d</p><p>That is not the same, and you know it. Why did she keep coming back to life after the goddess turned her back, then?</p><p>\u201cBecause she was stil intact. This time, she was not. I can take you to her cave, if you\u2019d like. Though I warn you now, it is empty. I checked, just to be sure.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t panic. Yet. He concentrated on his breathing, on drawing the stil -chil ed air through his nose, letting it fil his lungs, clear his mind. But with the breath, his demon\u2014who didn\u2019t like the angel, but couldn\u2019t stay out of his head, searching for answers\u2014at last discerned what was the fantasy Amun desired and what was the reality he feared.</p><p>Haidee had not returned to Greece.</p><p>There was no way to save her.</p><p>She. Was. Dead.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>Zacharel had spoken the truth. As always.</p><p>A roar nearly split Amun\u2019s head in two. He gripped his ears, trying to block the noise. That didn\u2019t help.</p><p>On and on the roar tormented him. His eardrums shattered. Blood leaked onto his shoulders. Eventual y, his knees gave out. He fel to the ground, hot tears springing into his eyes. No. No, no, no. She couldn\u2019t be dead.</p><p>She was dead.</p><p>She is waiting for me in her cave.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t waiting for him in her cave.</p><p>She wil remember me.</p><p>She would remember nothing. She was dead. Now, always.</p><p>Any il usion he tried to create, his demon instantly destroyed. In that moment, he hated his demon.</p><p>Hated so much he could have been possessed by the essence of the demon Haidee had harbored inside her. The truth...oh, gods, the truth. Nothing had ever hurt him so intensely. She was dead, she was dead, she was dead, and there was nothing he could do to bring her back.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have died. He should have died.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he died?</p><p>Other questions swirled through the crushing grief, and he found himself glaring up at the angel. Did you know she would...that she would end up that way when you brought us here?</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Zacharel offered without any hesitation. \u201cHer death was the only way to save you.\u201d</p><p>No reaction. Not yet. What do you mean? She had pul ed the demons from Amun and successful y released them, al without messing with Secrets. Afterward, she had been healthy, whole. Until Hate. But Hate had not been a part of Amun. So, after healing him, she could have walked away.</p><p>Oh, gods. She could have walked away.</p><p>If he had cal ed for Zacharel then...</p><p>\u201cHave you not realized yet? You never needed to visit hel to release those demons. You had only to learn to trust each other. That was the only way Haidee could discover the truth about her abilities. That was the only way you would let her close enough to use those abilities on you.\u201d</p><p>Then why did you send us here? Why? I would rather have died myself. Me!</p><p>\u201cYou were sent here because nothing draws people together faster than perilous situations. More than that, I was not told to save Haidee. Only you.\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t have to die. His motions were jerky now. We could have left before Hate found her. You could have swooped in.</p><p>\u201cShe was going to die whether Hate found her or not. She loved you. Eventual y, that love would have weakened her demon. Just as your demon feeds on secrets, hers fed on hate. Ultimately, that love would have kil ed her.\u201d</p><p>No. She loved before. Others loved her.</p><p>\u201cDid she? Did they? No, she did not. No, they did not. Many overcame their dislike for her, some even came to care for her, but no one loved her with their whole heart. Until you.\u201d</p><p>Secrets found no deception in the confession. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So Amun had kil ed her. Again. His love for her had doomed her for eternity. She would have lived if he\u2019d left her alone, if he had refused to bring her down here. If he hadn\u2019t given in to his craving for her.</p><p>He hated himself.</p><p>He hated Zacharel now, too.</p> <p>They had moved her around like a chess piece. They had set her up for failure. And why? To save him.</p><p>If Haidee had survived this, Amun could have continued on with his life. Even if she\u2019d hated him, he could have continued on, happy in the knowledge that she was out there somewhere. But this...this shattered him. She was gone forevermore, and he was responsible. The knowledge ruined him. He was raw, eternal y wounded, unable to heal.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t need Secrets to confirm that.</p><p>There was only one thing left to do.</p><p>Take me home, he signed, as determined as he was defeated.</p> <p>\u201cI find I am oddly...troubled by your reaction. I did not expect this, nor do I understand what I am feeling. What I know is that I do not like it and something must be done.\u201d</p><p>In less than a heartbeat of time, Amun\u2019s surroundings changed. Gone were the bleak rocks he\u2019d shared with Haidee, and in their place were the smooth white wal s of his bedroom. He took no comfort from the familiar setting.</p><p>He moved to his bed and sat down on the edge. The angel never reappeared, and that was probably for the best.</p><p>Amun wanted to kil him for hiding the truth\u2014however he\u2019d done so\u2014and for al owing Amun to save himself and condemn his woman. And he would kil the angel. Soon, but not yet, for the action would earn him a death sentence of his own. A sentence he would welcome just as soon as he said goodbye to his friends.</p><p>That was al he had left to do.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to live without Haidee; it was as simple as that.</p> <p>AFTER ZACHAREL BRIEFED TORIN on everything that had happened to Amun and Haidee, gathered the rest of his angels and final y left the fortress for good, their job now done, the keeper of Disease studied his friend on several of his computer monitors. The cameras Strider had placed in Secrets\u2019s bedroom hadn\u2019t yet been disabled, so Torin had a clear view of his friend from multiple angles.</p><p>The warrior might be back to normal, but he wasn\u2019t even close to being happy. Desolation seemed to cling to him.</p><p>His dark skin was dul ed, and his eyes were bleaker than Torin had ever seen them.</p><p>Torin ached for him. Even though he didn\u2019t understand how Amun had fal en for such a woman, he stil ached for the man. And he wouldn\u2019t judge. Amun would get enough of that from the others. What he needed right now was compassion and unconditional support. Support Torin would give him.</p><p>Once upon a time, Torin had kil ed a woman he lusted after.</p><p>He\u2019d worshipped her from afar and had final y given in and touched her. Just a simple brush of his knuckles on her soft cheek, but soon afterward, he\u2019d been forced to watch her sicken and die. He\u2019d been helpless to save her.</p><p>Knowing he was responsible had torn him up inside. And if Zacharel was right, Amun blamed himself for Haidee\u2019s loss.</p><p>And the fact that Torin had merely lusted but Amun had loved...wel , he doubted his pain could compare.</p> <p>Torin tugged at an earlobe. Things were stil calm here.</p><p>Hunters were stil missing, stil disappearing for seemingly no reason, but now Rhea had disappeared, as wel . As Cronus had done with Strider, he\u2019d just popped in and informed him. So...</p><p>Whether the warriors here would judge Amun or not, Amun needed them. Needed a distraction from his guilt. That wouldn\u2019t be the same as compassion and support, but those things would fol ow. Hopeful y.</p><p>So Torin lifted his cel phone and sent everyone the same message. Amun\u2019s here &amp; sane. Angels gone.</p><p>Return ASAP. He needs help.</p><p>Replies began arriving seconds after he pressed send, and soon every single one of the warriors (besides Wil iam) had agreed to come home.</p><p>On way. He OK? Aeron.</p><p>Coming. Something wrong? Lucien.</p><p>Take me out of your address book. Wil iam.</p><p>Wil make it. Gideon.</p><p>Cameo &amp; me just hit town. We\u2019l be there in 10. Kane.</p><p>Let me get Ash situated 1st. Maddox.</p><p>Done &amp; done. Sabin.</p><p>Me &amp; Paris R in the States. Might take a bit, but we\u2019l B</p><p>there. Strider.</p><p>Had a tail 4 few days. Wil show as soon as I lose it. Reyes.</p><p>Pleased at their show of loyalty amid this crisis, Torin settled back in his chair and waited.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>AMUN\u2019S FRIENDS TRIED TO CHEER him up, they real y did. They hugged him, slapped him on the back and told him what they\u2019d been up to. Strider, fighting Hunters. Aeron, playing with his Olivia in the clouds. Lucien, guarding the Cage of Compulsion with his Anya. Gideon, honeymooning with his Scarlet.</p><p>Kane and Cameo, scouring the city for any sign of the enemy. Maddox, playing nursemaid to his Ashlyn, who was \u201cbig as a house.\u201d Her words, not Amun\u2019s.</p><p>Sabin, begging the Unspoken Ones to give back the artifact Strider had parted with. Reyes, guarding his Danika while she painted glimpses into the future. Paris, getting high on ambrosia and preparing to go to war in the heavens.</p><p>Amun spent two days with them. No one mentioned Haidee. They al avoided talk of her. But as he seated himself at the dinner table, he decided to change that. They didn\u2019t know it, but this was to be his last dinner with them.</p><p>Tomorrow he would leave the fortress. Tomorrow he would chal enge Zacharel.</p><p>Tomorrow he would lose his head.</p><p>He knew what Aeron had experienced after his death.</p><p>Knew the warrior\u2019s soul had gone to another realm, a place where formerly demon-possessed immortals were supposedly to be trapped, unable to taint any other souls with their darkness. Baden was there. Pandora, too.</p><p>But Aeron, Baden and Pandora had merely died as mortals did. Their souls hadn\u2019t been burned to ash, as an angel\u2019s sword of fire could make happen.</p><p>That\u2019s the death Amun wanted for himself. An end. Total y, completely.</p><p>First, though, he wanted these men to know the kind of woman Haidee had been. To know her as he had, as sweetness and light. As worthy. As the best among them.</p><p>He wanted them to know what she had given up. And so, while they piled their plates high with food, he started talking.</p><p>\u201cHaidee was not the monster we painted her. She was strong and courageous.\u201d</p><p>Conversations tapered to quiet as everyone stared at him in shock. He\u2019d never begun a conversation before. Had rarely spoken anything but other people\u2019s memories since his possession.</p><p>He continued before his demon decided to take over and spil the secrets hiding inside everyone around him. \u201cShe had every reason to despise us. A demon kil ed her mother, her father, her sister and her husband. A demon, just like us. Hel , maybe one of us kil ed her husband. We were there when it happened. And then I helped kil her. Me.</p><p>I threw her in front of my enemy\u2019s sword. Little wonder she came back for us. For vengeance. We would have done the same. We did the same.\u201d</p><p>Thankful y, no one tried to stop him. Not even his demon.</p><p>\u201cThe same demon who kil ed her family managed to infect her, give her a piece of himself. Of Hate. Yet somehow, though she was little more than a human, she managed to defeat that demon\u2019s darkest urges.</p><p>Then she was kil ed again and again and again, and even though every good and decent memory she had was always wiped from her, even though she knew only sadness and pain, she found a way to love me, to save me...to die for me. That is the woman we have hated al this time. Someone we hurt first.</p><p>Someone with the power to kil the rest of us, someone who could have been used against us, yet chose to save us instead. Through her own death.\u201d</p><p>A thick, heavy silence enveloped the entire room.</p><p>Stil Secrets made no attempt to speak through him.</p><p>Perhaps because the taint of memories had been purged inside that cave. Perhaps because the demon mourned Haidee\u2019s passing as he did.</p><p>His friends continued to stare at him, not moving, not even daring to breathe. Their thoughts and emotions grew in intensity, final y piercing the quiet. Some felt sorry for him.</p><p>Some felt guilty for having condemned Haidee. Only Sabin refused to back away from his own hate.</p><p>Strider, though... Strider was the worst. Her death is for the best, the warrior thought. Ultimately, she would have turned on him. She wouldn\u2019t have been able to help herself. And when she hurt him, or us, he would have blamed himself. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to forgive himself, either.</p><p>The statement pushed Amun over the edge. Hel . No.</p><p>Amun didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d launched out of his seat until he had his hands around Strider\u2019s neck. Until he was tossing the warrior into the wal , plaster dusting around him. \u201cWhat the fuck, man?\u201d a scowling Strider demanded as he stood.</p><p>\u201cHer death wasn\u2019t for the best! She was lovely, damn you.</p><p>She deserved to live. I\u2019m the one who should have died.</p><p>And you can wrap up your excuses as prettily as you want, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you just don\u2019t care that she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Okay. Whatever. Just relax. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion, and I\u2019m entitled to mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine is the only one that matters!\u201d With a roar, Amun launched at Strider again. They fel to the floor in a tangle of violence.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Lucien commanded. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them finish,\u201d Sabin said.</p><p>Amun tuned them out. His fists pounded at Strider, his legs kicked. Strider, of course, began fighting back. They rol ed together and slammed into the table. Plates shattered, food splattered. Both of them knew how to fight, and fight dirty.</p><p>Knew how to stop a heart from beating, how to break a femur with a wel -placed kick, how to smash a trachea and prevent oxygen from making it into greedy lungs. They did al of that and more.</p><p>And stil they kept fighting, no one trying to separate them.</p><p>Amun\u2019s hands soon swel ed from continuous impact with bone, his fingers refusing to bend. Dizziness washed through him, black winking over his vision, but even that didn\u2019t slow him. When this was over, Strider was going to regret his thoughts and words. Strider was going to admit how special Haidee had been. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Defeat\u2019s nose broke under the next strike of Amun\u2019s palm.</p><p>Blood poured. That crimson flow reminded him of what Hate had done to Haidee\u2014fangs digging into her beautiful neck\u2014and that only increased the depths of his rage.</p><p>\u201cTel me you appreciate what she did for us. Tel me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want me to lie? She was a Hunter,\u201d Strider shouted, a few of his teeth missing. \u201cA kil er.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re kil ers!\u201d Another strike. Another direct hit. Two pearly whites sailed through the air.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Defeat\u2019s rage increased as wel , and he kneed Amun in the groin. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t be trusted. I realized that.</p><p>Why can\u2019t you?\u201d The words were slurred as they pushed through the empty spaces where his teeth had been.</p><p>Amun shook off the pain. What was physical pain after the emotional agony of losing his woman, anyway? He dove into Strider\u2019s middle, sending the warrior flailing to the ground. On impact, Strider lost his breath. The warrior was quick to recover, and they rol ed, stil pounding on each other\u2014until they slammed into one of the table legs and cracked the wood.</p> <p>Amun stil ed, glaring down at the man he\u2019d once cal ed brother. \u201cI trusted her more than I trusted anyone else. Even you.\u201d</p><p>Strider pushed, sending Amun stumbling to the other side of the room. \u201cHow can you say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get to speak.\u201d Once again, he closed the distance between them. No mercy. Secrets knew Strider planned to kick, and so Amun jumped out of the way, spun, punched and ducked, punched and ducked. \u201cYou wanted her, but you would have tortured her. You would have ruined her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Somehow, Strider dodged every blow.</p><p>\u201cYou might, might, have been able to love her, but only after you\u2019d broken her.\u201d Final y, contact.</p><p>Strider hunched over, trying to catch the breath he\u2019d only just found. \u201cDon\u2019t you see what\u2019s happening?</p> <p>She\u2019s dead, but stil she\u2019s pul ing us apart. I love you. I left this fortress for you. So you could have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left this fortress for you.\u201d No mercy, he thought again.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t win her, and you knew it.\u201d Amun kneed him in the chin, sending Strider tumbling back into another wal . \u201cI would have married her, pampered her, and I would have expected every single one of you to accept her. But you wouldn\u2019t have, would you? She was just another chal enge to you. But you know what? She rejected you, and you walked away from her without a flicker of pain. That changes now. You wil feel pain. You know why? Because I chal enged you, and you just lost.\u201d With that, Amun punched him. Punched him so hard his jawbone dislocated completely.</p><p>Strider was knocked unconscious. Even then, he was in physical pain, moaning from the mental anguish of his defeat.</p><p>Amun kicked him while he was down. Again and again.</p><p>Someone grabbed him from behind and jerked him away, holding him so tightly he couldn\u2019t quite draw in a breath. Yet stil he fought. His woman had been slighted. He wouldn\u2019t stop until he was appeased.</p><p>And he would never be appeased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with her,\u201d he shouted. \u201cDo you hear me? I\u2019m going to die with her! And if you don\u2019t watch your stupid mouth, I\u2019l take you along, too!\u201d</p> <p>Strider released another moan, this one far more pained.</p><p>The warriors holding Amun must have sensed his determination because they ceased trying to hold him and started trying to subdue him.</p><p>\u201cWe need you,\u201d he heard.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that, al right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No!\u201d His body was already badly beaten, weakened, but stil he fought, his rage like a living entity.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be okay, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>They squeezed tighter.</p><p>\u201cLet us help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we spoke to the angel? What if something could be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething can be done,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Tighter stil .</p><p>Haidee, he screamed inside his head then. Soon, I\u2019l be with you soon. We\u2019l be... His thoughts fragmented. His motions were slowing. We\u2019l be together again.</p><p>Darkness rained down like poisoned arrows. He welcomed the storm with open arms.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p><p>\u201cAMUN,\u201d A GENTLE VOICE cal ed.</p><p>Amun fought his way through the darkness, slashing at it as determinedly as he remembered slashing at Strider. That voice, so familiar, so necessary. Forever lost.</p><p>\u201cAmun, baby. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>His struggles increased until final y, amazingly, he was able to blink open his eyes\u2014and what he saw took his breath away. Haidee. His beautiful Haidee. She loomed above him, peering down at him with those pearl-gray eyes.</p><p>Had the warriors kil ed him as he\u2019d wanted? he wondered.</p><p>No, they couldn\u2019t have. Inside his head, Secrets was sighing with relief, picking up on something, a mystery, a truth, but was unable to sort through the details.</p><p>How was Haidee here?</p><p>Am I dreaming? He didn\u2019t dare speak again. Just in case.</p><p>He would not spoil this moment with a spew of secrets.</p><p>Besides, if this moment was steeped in falsehood, he didn\u2019t want to know. Wait. Don\u2019t tel me. Just stay right where you are.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. I\u2019m here.\u201d She smoothed the hair plastered to his brow, and he felt the coolness of her touch. \u201cWe\u2019re in your bedroom, the place we first met.\u201d</p><p>He studied her, certain this had to be a trick. Her pink and blond locks were in tangles around her shoulders, and her lips were swol en from where she\u2019d chewed them. Her eyes were aglow with love and warmth.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a trick,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m real.\u201d</p><p>But you died. I watched you die. Was told you couldn\u2019t be reanimated by Hate any longer.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the truth. I was reanimated by something else this time.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay\u2014I barely understand it myself. What happened to me was kind of like what happened to Aeron\u2014and yeah, I got to hear al about that\u2014only I didn\u2019t need a new body because I was already in soul form. Anyway, this is how it was explained to me. The demons are the negative, and the angels are the positive. Happiness, Joy, Strength, and so on. So, just like I had taken a piece of Hate, I could take a piece of one of those without kil ing the giver. And I did.</p><p>First from you, then from someone else.\u201d</p><p>From me?</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I took your love. Just a little, and I expunged most of it when I expunged Hate. But the little bit I kept was enough to bring me back. I was fading, though, and fading fast.\u201d</p><p>What else did you take? And from whom?</p><p>\u201cWel .\u201d She massaged those swol en lips together.</p><p>\u201cZacharel kind of...gave me another piece of Love.\u201d</p><p>Zacharel? The angel? Jealousy sparked, but vanished just as quickly. Haidee was here. Haidee was alive and with him. Zacharel could share whatever he wanted with her.</p><p>\u201cYes. The angel.\u201d</p><p>Why? Why would he give you something of his? And how was he the keeper of Love?</p><p>She stopped massaging, and her lips twitched at the corners. \u201cFunny story. Apparently there are several keepers of the more overwhelming emotions, and he was keeping his portion of Love in a jar on his nightstand. Weirdest thing I\u2019d ever seen. It was kind of like his personal Pandora\u2019s box, but a treasure chest rather than a prison. He said he wasn\u2019t using it, and that I was welcome to a little pinch of it.</p><p>A few of his angel friends were upset about it, and I heard them say it would cause some problems for him, but now I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m babbling, aren\u2019t I? Say something!\u201d</p><p>First, I owe that angel an apology. And a thank-you.</p><p>Second, I can\u2019t believe this is happening. He reached up with a shaky hand and caressed her cheek. Her skin was as cool as before. As solid. For a moment, he was too numbed with shock, hope and joy to move again.</p><p>She was here, he thought again. She real y was here. Here, with him. Alive.</p><p>And there was the truth Secrets had been trying to reach, to understand. She had defied death, defied what should have been truth, what was truth, and come back for them. She was no longer Hate; she was Love. Just as she\u2019d said.</p><p>Joy quickly overshadowed the other emotions. Amun jerked her on top of him, his arms squeezing her as tight as possible without crushing her ribs. I thought I\u2019d lost you, and it was more than I could bear.</p><p>Tel me you remember me.</p><p>He knew she did, but he had to hear the words. Please, tel me. I know you do, you\u2019re here, but like you, I need the words.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She squeezed him just as tightly before lifting her face and grinning. \u201cI remember everything about you.\u201d</p><p>Gods, Haidee. He pul ed her back down. Every part of him needed to touch every part of her. Tel me the rest. What happened to you...after? I have to know.</p><p>Secrets was even then unraveling the rest of the details, but Amun wanted to hear them from his woman.</p><p>She burrowed her head in the hol ow of his neck and flattened her palm over his heartbeat. \u201cAfter I died, I opened my eyes and found myself\u2014my soul, I guess\u2014in my cave.</p><p>With Zacharel, as I said.\u201d</p><p>Wait. Maybe I won\u2019t apologize to that bastard, after al . He let me think you were dead, and that there was no way to reach you. Because of him, I\u2019ve done nothing but mourn you. In fact, I was going to chal enge him in the morning and al ow him to kil me. I can\u2019t live without you, Haidee. When he\u2019d told her</p><p>\u201cnow and always,\u201d he\u2019d meant it.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t lie, Amun. I did die. For a little while. Believe me, he was as shocked as you when I was reanimated. He was visiting my cave, you see, because something you said real y got to him. At least, I think that\u2019s why. He wasn\u2019t big on explanations. And just so you know, I can\u2019t live without you. So don\u2019t you ever, ever think of dying for me again. I\u2019l always find a way to get back to you.\u201d</p><p>He rol ed her to her back, covering her with his body. I won\u2019t die for you if you won\u2019t die for me, he said, happier in that moment than he\u2019d ever been. His woman was in his arms, underneath him. His. Are you stil somewhat immortal, able to come back again and again? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDefinitely. You\u2019re stuck with me for eternity.\u201d She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed his chin. \u201cNow, no more talk of dying.\u201d</p><p>The kiss wasn\u2019t enough, not nearly enough, but he didn\u2019t press for more. Yet. How did you get here?</p><p>\u201cAs soon as Zacharel realized I was going to survive everything,\u201d she said, tangling her fingers in his hair,</p> <p>\u201che flew me here.\u201d</p><p>How do we thank an angel? Somehow I don\u2019t think a fruit basket wil do the trick.</p><p>Her lips twitched with amusement. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, either.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help himself. He licked his way into her mouth, enjoying her sweetness, her taste. Her legs spread in welcome, and he fel deeper into her, his shaft lengthening, hardening. Groaning, she arched her hips to press more ful y against him.</p><p>Any moment now, and they would both lose control.</p> <p>With a groan of his own, Amun lifted his head. Haidee\u2019s cheeks were flushed, her lips even more swol en. She\u2019d never looked lovelier. The rest. Tel me the rest. How did my friends react to you? If they offended you, we\u2019l leave. I told you, I can\u2019t live without you. I won\u2019t live without you.</p><p>Haidee\u2019s amusement returned. \u201cOh, they\u2019ve accepted me already.\u201d</p><p>So you have spoken to them?</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be welcomed with open arms when Zacharel dropped me off at the front door. He rang the doorbel and disappeared like a coward.\u201d She shouted those last three words, as if she\u2019d been angry at the time and stil harbored a bit of the emotion. \u201cBut a few minutes after that, the one named Torin let me inside. I thought I\u2019d be taken straight to the dungeon, but no. I was asked a few questions, and then brought here to you. I think they realized they would rather put up with me than see you hurting.\u201d</p><p>Back up. What questions?</p><p>\u201cEverything you asked me and more.\u201d</p> <p>His attention snagged on the word \u201cmore.\u201d Such as?</p><p>A blush stained her cheeks. \u201cLike was I going to have telepathic sex with you at the dinner table. Did I know how to cook something other than a PB and J. Was I okay with naked Thursdays. Anyway. After I saw that you were okay and sleeping, I asked some questions of my own.\u201d</p><p>What questions? he repeated.</p><p>She shrugged, trying for an innocence he didn\u2019t buy. \u201cWho you had fought. Where Strider was.\u201d</p><p>Amun arched a brow and tried not to laugh. And?</p><p>\u201cAnd Torin told me. I marched to Strider\u2019s room, prepared to...wel , please don\u2019t be mad,\u201d she said, stiffening, \u201cbut I was going to stab him. That piece of Love wanted me to forgive him, but I was stil going to do it.\u201d</p><p>I like where this story is headed. Continue.</p><p>A sigh left her, seeming to drain the tension right out of her.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. Stab him, I mean. He was in pain. Awake, but in pain, and I guess Love got to me more than I\u2019d realized. He and I had a little chat.\u201d</p><p>Amun was the one to stiffen now. Did he insult you? If he had...</p><p>\u201cNo. Nothing like that, I promise.\u201d She traced her fingertips along his jaw. \u201cHe said that he never wants to fight you again, even at Xbox. He said a determination like yours is a rare and precious thing, and something he respects. He said he loves you and one day, he\u2019l love me, too. Like a sister. But not to expect one day anytime soon.\u201d Truly?</p><p>\u201cYes. Truly.\u201d</p><p>That was completely unexpected. I wil forgive him, then.</p><p>Maybe. One day, he added.</p><p>\u201cYou wil .\u201d Her expression became fierce, that intense determination returning. \u201cI won\u2019t be responsible for any more hate. And why should I? I\u2019m Love!\u201d She laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019l ever get tired of saying that.\u201d</p><p>Amun was wil ing to give her anything she desired, even that. You\u2019re right. I wil forgive him.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sorry for the pain you\u2019ve experienced, sweetheart.</p><p>\u201cI know, baby.\u201d She stopped caressing, settling her hands against his cheeks. \u201cI know. Just like I\u2019m sorry for the pain you\u2019ve experienced. But we\u2019re going to look ahead now.</p><p>Together.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to make you happy, I swear it.</p><p>\u201cYou must have been reading my mind.\u201d</p><p>Final y, he kissed her the way he\u2019d needed to kiss her from the first, a kiss that was more than a kiss. A kiss that was a promise. A kiss that was forever.</p><p>Until, of course, forever was interrupted by the sudden unhinging of his bedroom door. A loud boom echoed, and wood chips rained. He and Haidee sprang apart. Amun grabbed the knife on his nightstand before moving back over his woman to shield her. He calmed when he saw tiny, redheaded Kaia looming in his doorway.</p><p>Perhaps he should have panicked. </p> </body></html>"]
