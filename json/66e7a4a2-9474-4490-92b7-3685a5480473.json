And I really didn\u2019t need Jase\u2019s taunting text messages about why scheduling classes before noon was unhealthy.</p><p>Considering I was going on\u2014oh, I don\u2019t know, two hours of sleep\u2014and I could still taste the tequila and other things I really didn\u2019t want to even think about from last night, I was currently a walking poster child for how not to have a healthy and happy first day of fall classes.</p> <p>I watched the door to astronomy swing shut and then glanced back down at my phone. Jase\u2019s text mocked me.</p><p>Skip. I have beer. X-Box. FIFA \u201913</p><p>Well, shit. That was hella tempting. Ollie had trashed our Xbox the weekend before, during a brutal showdown of Call of Duty.</p><p>I was a few minutes late for class.</p><p>Astronomy, or soccer on the Box? Not really a tough call.</p> <p>Mind made up, I pivoted around and started to respond back to Jase when the double doors flung open like a tornado had ripped through the stairwell. My head jerked up just in time to see something small and something red come barreling straight at me.</p><p>There was no stopping the collision.</p><p>A little body smacked right into me and bounced back, arms flailing like a drowning victim. The bag, which looked like it weighed more than the owner, toppled her over.</p><p>Reacting out of instinct, I shot forward, dropping my own bag and wrapping my arm around her waist, but the backpack went in one direction, the contents in the other. She was still reeling, like one of those inflatable pop bags. I tightened my hold, stilling her before she did some serious damage to herself. She jerked upright. Deep auburn hair flew forward, snapping me in the face. The scent of berries and something musky and good filled me.</p><p>Holy shit, Strawberry Shortcake just ran me over.</p><p>I chuckled and slipped my cell into my pocket, about to let her go, but the girl locked up. Every muscle seemed to go rigid. As tiny as she was, barely reaching my shoulders, she seemed to suddenly get smaller, shrinking into herself. Was she hurt?</p> <p>And did she somehow mistake Shepherd for a nearby middle school?</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d I said. \u201cYou okay, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>No response for about a half minute, and I started to get real concerned. Then she dragged in a deep breath, causing her chest to rise flush against mine. I froze at the feel of her curves. Definitely not a middle schooler, unless they were developing in ways they hadn\u2019t when I was there. And, if so, I was fucking envious of those boys.</p><p>Okay, now I felt like I needed a shower, because even that disturbed me.</p><p>Was I still drunk from last night? I was going to go with a yes.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I tried again, voice lower. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d When there was still no response, I pressed two fingers under her chin. Her skin was soft and too cool. Wondering if it was possible for a person to pass out and remain standing, I gently lifted her head, my mouth opening to ask her again, but words died somewhere between my brain and my mouth.</p><p>I blinked, because like a total dumbass, I thought that would change what I was seeing. Not that I wanted to change what I was seeing, but damn. . .</p><p>What guy didn\u2019t have a soft spot for a redhead?</p> <p>Pretty was too weak of a word to describe her. Her eyes were large and the color of warm whiskey. Freckles dotted the bridge of her small nose and her cheeks were well defined. Lips were a sweet cherry color and wide for her face, full and plump. The kind of lips that belonged to the kind of mouth that could and would bring a man\u2014</p><p>\u201cLet. Go. Of. Me.\u201d</p><p>The hardness of her voice, laced with barely controlled panic, caused me to immediately drop her arm and take a healthy step back.</p><p>She swayed a little at the loss of support, and I almost reached for her again, but I valued my balls. One day I\u2019d like to have a kid or some shit, and I had a feeling if I touched her again, that would not be in my future.</p><p>Pushing strands of thick hair out of her face, she cautiously stepped away from her bag. Thick lashes specked with red lifted, and, for a moment, neither of us moved and then her gaze moved over my face and then down. Chick was blatantly checking me out.</p><p>Perhaps my balls weren\u2019t in danger.</p><p>A pretty pink flush spread across her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was in a hurry to get to class. I\u2019m late and . . .\u201d</p><p>I grinned as I knelt down, gathering up the spilled items. How one girl could have so many damn pens was beyond me. Blue. Purple. Black. Red. Orange. What the fuck? Who wrote with an orange pen?</p><p>She joined me, grabbing the rest of her pens as her head tilted in a way that a wall of coppery hair shielded her face. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem.\u201d I picked up a slip of paper that turned out to be her schedule. Quick glance at the classes confirmed she was a freshman. \u201cAstronomy 101? I\u2019m heading that way, too.\u201d</p><p>Jase and beer and FIFA \u201913 were going to have to wait.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d She was still hiding behind her hair. \u201cI really am sorry.\u201d</p><p>Picking up her last notebook, I shoved it into the bag and stood. I handed it back to her, willing her to look up. I don\u2019t know why, call me a mama\u2019s boy, but I liked my girls smiling and not appearing like they were on the verge of tears. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m used to having girls throw themselves at me.\u201d Her chin lifted up just the slightest, and my grin spread. \u201cTrying to jump on my back is new, though. Kind of liked it.\u201d</p><p>Her head jerked up and all that hair slid back. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to jump on your back or throw myself at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t?\u201d My phone vibrated in my pocket. I ignored it. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a shame. If so, it would have made this the best first day of class in history.\u201d</p><p>She studied me as she clutched her bag to her chest, and my gaze dropped to the piece of paper I held. \u201cAvery Morgansten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>What a touchy little thing. \u201cIt\u2019s on your schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She tucked her hair back and a slight tremor rocked her hand as she took the schedule.</p><p>When I was little, my mom said I had a soft spot for the underdog. Wounded pigeons. Three-legged dogs. Skinny pigs. My sister was the same way. We had a sixth sense when it came to rooting them out, and I may not have known jack about this chick, but she was obviously new to this school, obviously uncomfortable, obviously having a shitty start to her day, and I felt bad for her.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Cameron Hamilton,\u201d I told her. \u201cBut everyone calls me Cam.\u201d</p><p>Her lips moved like she was repeating my name, and I sort of liked how that looked. \u201cThank you again, Cam.\u201d</p><p>Bending down, I picked up my bag and slung it over my shoulder. Knocking my hair out of my face, I smiled the kind of smile that usually got me what I wanted. \u201cWell, let\u2019s make our grand entrance.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d made it to the door to astronomy when I realized she hadn\u2019t moved. Glancing over my shoulder, I frowned as she started to back away. \u201cYou\u2019re going in the wrong direction, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she croaked out.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t what?\u201d I faced her.</p><p>Avery\u2019s eyes met mine for a second and then she spun around and ran. Bag thumping off her hip, hair flying like a cape. The chick ran, actually freaking ran. My mouth dropped open.</p><p>What in the hell had just happened?</p><p>The door opened behind me, and a deep, slightly accented voice called out. \u201cMr. Hamilton, are you joining us today?\u201d</p><p>Shit. I closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOr are you planning to stand in the hallway the remaining time?\u201d Professor Drage asked.</p><p>Sighing, I turned around. \u201cJoining the class, clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly,\u201d the professor repeated, holding a stack of stapled papers. \u201cSyllabus.\u201d</p><p>I took one and then, on second thought, I took another. Just in case Avery Morgansten showed her face again.</p><p>Jase leaned against the back of my truck, one hand shoved through his brown hair, holding it off his glistening forehead. Several strands stuck straight up between his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s as hot as balls.\u201d</p><p>For late August, it was sweltering. Not even the shade provided by the large oaks surrounding the back parking lot across from White Hall provided any relief. I was dreading opening the door to the sweatbox.</p><p>\u201cTruest thing you\u2019ve ever spoken.\u201d Ollie squinted up at the trees. \u201cIt\u2019s so hot the only answer is to get naked.\u201d</p><p>My gaze went to him. \u201cYou\u2019re already as naked as you need to be, dude.\u201d</p><p>Ollie glanced down at himself and grinned. No shirt. Shorts hanging low. Flip-flops. Nothing else. \u201cYou know damn well I could get more naked.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately that was true. We\u2019d shared a three-bedroom apartment in University Heights for the last three years. Within a week of living together, Ollie had said screw it to modesty. I\u2019d seen the guy\u2019s junk more times then I cared to even think about. He was graduating in the spring, as I should\u2019ve been, and I was going to miss the idiot.</p><p>\u201cTicket.\u201d Jase nodded at my windshield.</p><p>I sighed, looking over. A cream-colored slip of paper was neatly placed under my wiper. The parking lot was reserved for staff, but with the lack of parking around these parts, I helped myself to whatever spot I could find. \u201cI\u2019ll add it to my collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is massive.\u201d Ollie pulled a band off his wrist and tugged his shoulder-length blond hair into a ponytail. \u201cSo, party tonight at our place?\u201d</p><p>My brows shot up. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Jase grinned as he folded his arms across his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a back-to-school party.\u201d Ollie stretched, cracking his back as he yawned. \u201cJust a little get-together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>Jase\u2019s grin spread, and I wanted to knock it off his face. The last time Ollie had had a \u2018little get-together\u2019 it had been standing room only in our apartment. Cops might have been involved.</p><p>\u201cOrder some pizza. I need to get\u2014\u201d Ollie stopped midsentence and turned toward a curvy brunette walking past. In a blink of an eye, he ditched us and was dropping an arm around the girl\u2019s shoulders. \u201cHey, girl, hey.\u201d</p><p>The brunette giggled, wrapping an arm around Ollie\u2019s waist.</p><p>I turned, raising my hands. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost cause.\u201d Jase rolled his eyes. \u201cThat fucker has eyes in the back of his head when it comes to girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow he gets laid on a regular basis is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the greatest mystery in life.\u201d I loped around the front of my truck, grabbed the ticket, and then opened the driver\u2019s door. Heat blew into my face. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Jase angled his body toward me. \u201cWhat happened with you today? You didn\u2019t respond to my text. Thought the FIFA hooked you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, did you miss me?\u201d I tugged off my shirt, rolled it up, and tossed it into the truck.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laughing, I grabbed my cap off the seat and shoved it on, shielding my eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we were dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy feelings are hurt now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a beer next time we\u2019re out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat works. I\u2019m easy.\u201d</p> <p>I grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t I know.\u201d</p><p>Jase laughed as he turned, hanging his arms over the side of the truck bed. The easygoing smile faded as he slipped a pair of sunglasses on. I knew that look. Nothing good came from it. Very few people knew just how shitty life could get for Jase. It was easy for everyone to assume otherwise, with how Jase was the go-to guy for fixing other people\u2019s crap, including mine.</p><p>I turned the air on and shut the door, then joined him at the side of the truck. The metal was hot against the skin of my underarms as I leaned in, stretching my calves. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>One dark eyebrow rose above the rim of his glasses. \u201cYou heading to the gym or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking.\u201d I switched my legs, working out the kink. \u201cYou wanna go with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to swing by the farm. Check on a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jack?\u201d</p><p>A wide smile broke out across Jase\u2019s face, causing a young professor walking past the truck to trip in her heels. \u201cHe\u2019s great,\u201d he said, his tone light like it was always was when he talked about his brother. \u201cTold me yesterday that when he grows up, he wants to be Chuck Norris.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cCan\u2019t go wrong with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He looked over, peering at me above his shades. \u201cHow you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I pushed back, smacking my hands off the rail. \u201cWhy you ask?\u201d</p> <p>Jase raised a shoulder. \u201cJust checking in.\u201d</p><p>Some days that comment pissed me off. Other days it did nothing. Luckily for Jase, it was one of those days when the shit just rolled off my back. \u201cI\u2019m not about to end up in a corner, whispering \u2018forever\u2019 anytime soon. It\u2019s all cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to hear.\u201d Jase grinned as he backed off, his head turning toward where the young teacher had disappeared. \u201cParty at your place, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I headed to the driver\u2019s side. \u201cHalf the campus will be there I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Jase pivoted around. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>I climbed into the cool interior and headed out of the parking lot. My lazy ass needed to get to the gym on West Campus, but my ass also wanted to get to the couch for a nap.</p><p>Turning left at the stop sign, I passed the duplexes on the right as a football flew out one of the doors, smacking one of the guys in the back of the head. Laughing, I reached over for the\u2014</p><p>Something red caught my attention.</p> <p>My eyes were heat-seeking missiles, searching out the source, and hot damn. My gaze narrowed. Was that Shortcake?</p><p>A tree obscured my view for a second and then she reappeared, the sun reflecting off the wide bracelet circling her wrist.</p><p>Hells yeah, it was.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even think twice about what I did next. Grinning, I slid the cap around backward and hung a sharp right, blocking the road.</p><p>Avery jumped back onto the curb, her big eyes going round. As I hit the button to the passenger window, rolling it down, her mouth dropped open.</p><p>I grinned, happy to see that Shortcake had made it through her first day alive. \u201cAvery Morgansten, we meet again.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around her, like she thought I might be talking to someone else. \u201cCameron Hamilton . . . hi.\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward, dropping an arm over the steering wheel. She looked damn cute standing there, fidgeting with her bracelet. \u201cWe have to stop meeting like this.\u201d</p><p>Biting down on that plump lower lip, her gaze dropped, zeroing in on my tattoo as she shifted her weight from foot to foot.</p><p>Shortcake was definitely what I would categorize as awkward. Maybe it came from having a younger sister, because the need to make her feel comfortable rode me hard, but it seemed like fighting a losing battle.</p><p>\u201cYou running into me, me almost running over you?\u201d I elaborated. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re a catastrophe waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Try this one more time. \u201cWhere are you heading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy car,\u201d she said, proving to me that she could speak. \u201cI\u2019m about to run out of time. She shifted her weight again. \u201cSo . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hop in, sweetheart. I can give you a ride.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me like I asked her to get in the back of my kidnapper van. \u201cNo. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m right up the hill. No need at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem.\u201d Never had met a female so damn resistant to common courtesy. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do after almost running you over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo! Cam!\u201d Kevin came out of fucking nowhere, jogging past Avery. \u201cWhat you up to, man?\u201d</p><p>Oddly irritated, I kept my gaze on Shortcake and resisted the urge to nudge the dude out of the way with my truck. \u201cNothing, Kevin, just trying to have a conversation.\u201d</p><p>Avery raised her hand, wiggled her fingers, and bolted around Kevin and my truck. My gaze followed her as Kevin went on and on about some shit I didn\u2019t give a flying fuck about.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I muttered, sitting back in the seat.</p><p>Avery ran again.</p><p>And I had the craziest urge to give chase.</p><p>Two</p><p>Shit got real at our parties the second Ollie had Raphael out of his habitat. Every single fucking time. Standing in the middle of the living room, I watched him, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jase asked, tipping the bottle of his beer back.</p><p>I snickered. \u201cDon\u2019t you think if I knew why, I\u2019d find a way to stop him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s cute,\u201d said a soft, feminine voice.</p><p>Jase and I turned toward the couch. No one sat quite the way Stephanie Keith did. One long, shapely tanned leg hooked over the knee of the other in the perfect picture of modesty. But the goddamn denim skirt of hers was as modest as Ollie after taking a shower. If I moved my head just a fraction of inch to the right and tipped my chin down, which I had about three minutes ago, I could see the curve of her ass cheek.</p><p>Steph was a thong girl.</p><p>Or a no-panties girl depending on her mood, and it was looking like she might be in the mood. Steph leaned forward slightly, crossing slender arms under her breasts, giving me and anyone else who happened to be looking\u2014quick check told me Jase was\u2014a nice view of her tits. And they were nice. I\u2019d seen them up close and personal quite a few times. Those baby-blue eyes of hers promised a happy ending and they were fixed on mine.</p><p>Surprisingly, there was absolutely no shrinking of my nylon shorts in the crotch area, which was a damn waste of tits and ass.</p><p>Half of Jase\u2019s frat would give their left nut to be on the receiving end of Stephanie\u2019s attention. There was a time I gave my right one, back when I couldn\u2019t even keep track of who was who, but that felt like ages ago, back when the idea of staying with one girl made me want to chew off my own arm. Now?</p><p>Well, shit, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted now. Hadn\u2019t for a while, which probably explained why I wasn\u2019t scooping Steph up, taking her back to my bedroom, and dropping pants.</p><p>Steph was a good girl, but the time of giving up my right nut had long since passed.</p><p>Averting my gaze to where Ollie was dancing in front of the TV, holding the squirming Raphael in the air, I took a drink of my beer. \u201cHe\u2019s molesting my tortoise.\u201d</p><p>She laughed as she stood. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing.\u201d One arm wrapped around mine and she put her chin on my shoulder. A sheet of inky black hair slipped over the bare skin of my chest. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t mind being molested.\u201d</p><p>Over the music, I heard the oven timer go off. Gently disentangling myself, I shot Jase a look. An unsympathetic grin crossed his face. Bastard. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>Dodging guys, I trotted into the kitchen before Steph could respond. The girl wasn\u2019t going to be that disappointed with my lack of interest. I\u2019d bet ten bucks she\u2019d moved on to Jase or someone else by the time I got back in.</p><p>I sat the beer down on the counter and opened the oven door, inhaling the aroma of freshly baked chocolate-chip cookies. And not that premade crap. This shit was from scratch.</p><p>And they would be banging.</p><p>Setting the sheet aside, I flipped off the oven and scooped up a cookie. So hot, the dough sunk in, squeezing the tiny chips of chocolate onto the chunks of walnut. I broke the cookie in half and popped it into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I groaned.</p><p>Burned like holy fucking hell, but it was worth it. Washing it down with my beer, I stepped out of the kitchen just in time to see Ollie heading toward the front door. With Raphael.</p><p>\u201cOh, come the hell on.\u201d I put my beer down.</p><p>\u201cBe free, little green buddy,\u201d he coaxed, kissing Raphael\u2019s shell. \u201cBe free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring Raphael back!\u201d I yelled, laughing as Ollie drunk-karate-kicked the front door the rest of the way open. \u201cYou fucktard!\u201d</p><p>Ollie put Raphael down and gently nudged his shell. \u201cFree.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing his arm, I spun him around and pushed him back into the apartment. Laughing, Ollie grabbed Steph\u2019s friend and lifted her over his shoulder. A riot of squeals broke out.</p><p>I scooped up the tortoise. \u201cSorry, Raphael. My friends are complete, fucking . . .\u201d A strange tingle broke out across my neck. I looked to my left and then my right, seeing Avery standing in a doorway, her brown eyes wide. \u201cAssholes. What the . . . ?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t drunk nearly enough to be hallucinating, but I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around the fact that Shortcake was standing in my apartment building. The apartment had been empty whenever I\u2019d been around over the summer, but someone, obviously, could\u2019ve moved in.</p><p>And based on the way she was dressed, someone she was very familiar with. The cotton shorts were short, ending at the thigh, and my gaze got hung up on her legs. They were long, not too skinny and perfectly shaped. Who would\u2019ve thought Shortcake would be rocking a pair of legs like that? Blood shot straight to my groin. The long-sleeve shirt she wore covered everything, but it was thin.</p><p>Hell yeah, it was thin.</p><p>Her breasts were soft swells under the shirt, fuller than they had felt pressed against my chest earlier, and those tips . . .</p><p>Her cheeks flushed several shades of pink. \u201cHey . . .\u201d</p><p>I blinked and when she didn\u2019t disappear and neither did my sudden, raging hard-on, I assumed she was real. \u201cAvery Morgansten? This is becoming a habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you live here or are you visiting . . . ?\u201d Raphael started squirming.</p><p>She cleared her throat, watching the tortoise. \u201cI . . . I live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d Holy crap. I made my way around the railing to the stairwell and toward her door. I didn\u2019t miss how her eyes went to my abs. I liked. So did my cock. \u201cYou really live here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I really live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is . . . I don\u2019t even know.\u201d I laughed, somewhat dumbstruck. \u201cReally crazy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Confusion marked her pretty face, crinkling the skin between the delicate brows.</p><p>\u201cI live here.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve been living here for a while\u2014like a couple of years with my roommate. You know, the fucktard who put poor Raphael outside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d Ollie yelled. \u201cI have a name. It\u2019s Se\u00f1or Fucktard!\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cAnyway, did you move in over the weekend?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cMakes sense. I was back home, visiting the fam.\u201d I cradled Raphael against my chest before he wiggled his way to a broken shell. \u201cWell, hell . . .\u201d</p><p>Avery tipped her head back to meet my gaze. For a moment, she held mine with her own soulful gaze, before turning her attention to Raphael. Her eyes . . . they reminded me of something. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . um, your tortoise?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I lifted him up. \u201cRaphael, meet Avery.\u201d</p><p>She bit down on her lip and gave Raphael a wave, and a grin split my lips. Shortcake got pointers for that. \u201cThat\u2019s a very interesting pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd those are very interesting shorts. What are they?\u201d I took another long look at those legs. I couldn\u2019t help myself. \u201cPizza slices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re ice cream cones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. I like them.\u201d I lifted my gaze, taking my time. \u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>She finally let go of her death grip on the door and crossed her arms over her chest. Her eyes narrowed when I grinned. \u201cThanks. That means a lot to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt should. They have my seal of approval.\u201d I watched the flush continue to stain her cheeks. \u201cI need to get Raphael back in his little habitat before he pees on my hand, which he\u2019s bound to do, and that sucks.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched into a small grin. \u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Did Shortcake just grin? It had to be a first. I wondered what she looked like when she actually smiled. \u201cSo, you should come over. The guys are about to leave, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be around for a little longer. You can meet them.\u201d I leaned in, lowering my voice. \u201cThey\u2019re no way as interesting as I am, but they\u2019re not bad.\u201d</p><p>Avery\u2019s gaze flickered over my shoulder. Indecision crawled over her face. Come on, Shortcake, come out and play. She shook her head. \u201cThanks, but I was heading to bed.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment pricked at my skin. \u201cThis early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be after midnight.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s still early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I was about to pull out the big guns. \u201cI have cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCookies?\u201d Two brows rose.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I made them. I\u2019m quite the baker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou baked cookies?\u201d</p><p>The way she asked that was like I\u2019d just admitted to baking a homemade bomb in my kitchen. \u201cI bake a lot of things, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re dying to know all about those things. But tonight, it was chocolate-and-walnut cookies. They are the shit if I do say so myself.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched again. \u201cAs great as that sounds, I\u2019m going to have to pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe later then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She stepped back, reaching for the door. \u201cWell, it\u2019s good seeing you again, Cameron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam,\u201d I corrected. \u201cAnd hey, we didn\u2019t almost run each other over. Look at us, changing up the pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cYou should get back before Raphael pees on your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould be worth it.\u201d</p><p>Confusion marked her features. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to explain it. \u201cIf you change your mind, I\u2019ll be up for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to. Good night, Cam.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Damn. Shortcake just dismissed my ass. For some reason, that made me smile. Maybe because I couldn\u2019t remember the last time a girl outright sent me away. Interesting. Here I thought I was incredibly charming.</p><p>I took a step back as Raphael poked his head out of his shell. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstronomy class? Or are you skipping again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she sighed, flushing, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how far that flush traveled south. The likelihood of me finding out seemed very slim. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I forced myself to back away, because I was pretty sure I could stand there for an hour just to mess with her. \u201cGood night, Avery.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake ducked behind the door like Raphael was about to pee on her head. I chuckled when I heard the lock click in place. I don\u2019t know how long I stood there while Raphael\u2019s little legs flailed, staring at the closed door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Cam?\u201d</p><p>I turned at the sound of Steph\u2019s voice. She stood in the doorway, head tilted against the frame, smiling and the picture of willingness. Unlike the girl on the other side of the door I stood in front of.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, heading back to my apartment. I really didn\u2019t have a friggin\u2019 clue.</p><p>Three</p><p>I\u2019d never been a morning person, but today, I was up at the butt crack of dawn, having only slept a few hours. While Ollie was still passed out on the couch, facedown, one arm flung toward the floor, I boiled four eggs, ate them, and scooped up some cookies for the road.</p><p>Ollie still hadn\u2019t moved when I slammed the door shut behind me.</p><p>I arrived on campus, weirdly early for probably the first time in my life, and headed into the Robert Byrd Building. Once inside the astronomy class, my gaze immediately started scanning the room.</p><p>If I were Shortcake, where would I sit? Probably in the back of the class.</p><p>I searched out a familiar bowed head. In the dimly lit classroom, her hair wasn\u2019t as red as it was in the sunlight. Why I even noticed that was beyond me. And why I headed straight for her went straight over my head.</p><p>In middle school, I had a crush on this girl in my class. She was a lot like Shortcake\u2014tiny, rarely spoke, nervous as one of those small dogs that shook all the time. But when she smiled, the fucking sun seemed to rise. She never gave me the time of day, but like a goober, I looked forward to seeing her every day. Turned out in high school, she liked girls and not boys, which probably explained why she had absolutely no interest in me.</p><p>Sliding my hand up the strap of my book bag, I could easily admit it would be hella disappointing if that were the case with Shortcake.</p><p>I strolled up on Avery, and she had no idea I was even there. Shoulders rolled forward, right hand toying with the bracelet on her left wrist. She was staring straight ahead, the taut expression on her face telling me that she might be physically present, but she wasn\u2019t in this room.</p><p>Was Shortcake ever relaxed? Didn\u2019t seem that way.</p><p>I glanced up at the front of the class, where a few people I knew were sitting. That\u2019s where I should go. Instead, I eased my way down the row of seats. Shortcake still hadn\u2019t registered I was there.</p><p>\u201cMorning, sweetheart,\u201d I said, deciding against sitting down first.</p><p>Shortcake jerked like a startled cat, twisting in the seat. Her jaw dropped as her eyes made contact with me. She said nothing as I slid into the seat next to her and settled back.</p><p>\u201cYou look a little rough this morning,\u201d I commented.</p><p>Her lips pursed. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Glad to see you make it to class this time.\u201d I scooted down, kicking my feet up on the seat in front of me. \u201cThough, I kind of missed the whole running-into-each-other thing. Provided a lot of excitement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t miss that.\u201d She started digging around in her bag, pulling out a pristine notebook. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I bought a new notebook for class. I believed in recycling them. \u201cThat was really embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say. You\u2019re the one who got plowed. I was doing the plowing.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped open as a laugh caught in my throat, but then my brain took the word \u201cplowing\u201d to the gutter, and I had to spread my thighs a little to get comfortable. There were so many things I could do with that comment. They all rushed to the tip of my tongue. Some would burn the ears off of strippers, but one look at Shortcake told me that would not go over well.</p><p>Her face was as red as the cover of the notebook she was currently staring at. The chick . . . damn, she was so awkward\u2014endearingly awkward. I wondered if she was homeschooled through high school.</p><p>While her awkwardness was damn cute and entertaining, I searched for something way off topic to say. \u201cRaphael is doing great, by the way.\u201d</p><p>A small grin appeared on those pretty lips. \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. Did he pee on your hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it was a close call. Brought you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurtle pee?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, amused by her quickness as I pulled out the syllabus, spying the cookies I\u2019d brought with me. \u201cSorry to let you down, but no. It\u2019s a syllabus. I know. Thrilling shit right here, but figured since you didn\u2019t come to class on Monday, you\u2019d need one, so I got it from the professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. That was really thoughtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, prepare yourself. I am all kinds of thoughtful this week. I brought you something else.\u201d</p><p>She started chewing on the edge of her pen as I pulled out the napkin. \u201cCookie for you. Cookie for me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly lowering the pen, she shook her head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t bring her a gold ring. \u201cIt\u2019s just a cookie, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Her head shook again as she stared at me. You\u2019d think I was handing her crack or something. Sighing, I covered one of the cookies with the napkin and unceremoniously dropped the cookie on top of her notebook. \u201cI know they say you shouldn\u2019t take candy from strangers, but it\u2019s a cookie and not candy and technically, I\u2019m not a stranger.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me.</p><p>Watching her from under my lashes, I took a bite of the other cookie and closed my eyes. I tipped my head back as the chocolate-covered walnuts danced over my taste buds. I moaned, knowing exactly what I was doing. My cookies were damn good, so the next sound I made wasn\u2019t an overexaggeration.</p><p>\u201cIs it really that good?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, this is the shit. I told you that last night. Be better if I had some milk.\u201d I took another bite. \u201cMmm, milk.\u201d</p><p>In the following silence, I opened one eye and fought a grin. She was watching me, lips slightly parted. \u201cIt\u2019s the combination of walnut and chocolate. You mix that together and it\u2019s like an explosion of sex in your mouth, but not as messy. The only thing better would be those teeny tiny Reese\u2019s cups. When the dough is warm, you plop those suckers in. . . . Anyway, you just need to try it. Take a small bite.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the cookie in her lap and she let out a low breath. Picking up a cookie, she took a bite.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop watching her. \u201cGood? Right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have a whole ton of them at home. Just saying . . .\u201d My gaze was riveted on her. Who knew watching a girl eat a cookie could be so interesting? As she wiped her slender fingers off, I moved without thinking.</p><p>The warmth of my knee brushing hers traveled up my leg as I twisted in the seat, reached over, and took the napkin from her. \u201cCrumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>With my empty hand, I smoothed my thumb along her bottom lip. A jolt of something zinged up my arm and went straight to my cock. She stilled, her chest rising sharply and eyes widening. My hand lingered longer than it should have, but not as long as I wanted. Her lip was soft under my finger, her chin smooth against my palm. I forced myself to pull away.</p><p>There hadn\u2019t been a damn crumb on her lip. I was a liar. But I wanted to touch her.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>She looked flustered. Not upset, but unnerved. I tried to feel some level of guilt for touching her but couldn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t sure what that said about me.</p><p>But then Professor Drage finally entered the front of the classroom. Drage was an odd fella. The green polyester suit was a staple. When I took this class the first time around, he used to mix up his wardrobe with an orange one. The checkered Vans and bow tie hadn\u2019t changed in years.</p> <p>I shifted in the seat, glancing over at Shortcake. The look on her face was priceless. I chuckled. \u201cProfessor Drage is a very . . . unique man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Professor Drage launched into a lecture. I wasn\u2019t sure what it was about. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t paying attention. Most of this stuff I already knew and hearing the shit again reminded me of my freshman year, something I didn\u2019t like to dwell on.</p><p>One night had completely fucked up the path of my life.</p><p>Pushing that out of my head, I started sketching. Before I knew it, I\u2019d drawn Big Foot and class was coming to an end in typical Drage fashion.</p><p>He started passing out star maps. \u201cI know today is only Wednesday, but here is your first assignment for the weekend. Skies are supposed to be clear as a baby\u2019s bottom on Saturday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClear as a baby\u2019s bottom?\u201d Avery muttered.</p><p>I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI want you to find the Corona Borealis in the sky\u2014the actual, real, honest-to-goodness night sky,\u201d Professor Drage explained. \u201cYou won\u2019t need a telescope. Use your eyes or glasses or contacts or whatever. You can view it either Friday or Saturday night, but the weather is looking sketchy on Friday, so choose wisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d someone from up front said. \u201cHow do you use this map?\u201d</p><p>I handed Shortcake a map and the grid sheets.</p><p>Professor Drage stopped and pinned the kid with a look that asked are you stupid. \u201cYou look at it.\u201d</p><p>The student huffed. \u201cI get that, but do we hold it up to the sky or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You could do that. Or you could just look at each of the constellations, see what they look like and then use your own eyes and brains to find it in the sky.\u201d Drage paused. \u201cOr use Google. I want all of you to start to get familiar with stargazing . . .\u201d I faded out during half of what he was saying, coming back in toward the end. \u201cSo get with your partner and pick out a time. The grid will be turned back in to me on Monday. That\u2019s all for the day. Good luck and may the force of the universe be with you today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPartner?\u201d Avery frantically looked around the classroom. \u201cWhen did we pick partners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Monday,\u201d I explained, shoving the notebook into my backpack. \u201cYou weren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake looked like she was about to pass out as she leaned forward in her seat. \u201cAvery?\u201d</p><p>She took several deep breaths, like she was staving off a panic attack.</p><p>I arched a brow. \u201cAvery.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted to the door Drage had disappeared through. Her knuckles were bleached white from how tight she was holding her notebook.</p><p>\u201cAvery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she snapped, whipping her gaze on me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re partners.\u201d</p><p>A deep crevice formed between her brows. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe. Are. Partners.\u201d I sighed. \u201cApparently, Drage had the class pick their partners right at the beginning of class on Monday. I walked in afterward and at the end he told me to partner with anyone who joined the class on Wednesday or I\u2019d be partner-less. And since I don\u2019t like the idea of being partner-less, you and I are partners.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me like I had just spoken Latin. \u201cWe have a choice to do this on our own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but who wants to go out staring at the sky at night by themselves?\u201d Standing, I hefted my bag over my shoulder and started down the row. \u201cAnyway, I know a perfect place we can do our assignment. Has to be Saturday, because I have plans Friday.\u201d</p><p>Sucking, annoying as fuck plans on Friday.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She rushed after me. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have plans on Saturday?\u201d Hold up. What could she be doing on a Saturday night? I couldn\u2019t skip out on Friday, but . . . \u201cWell, I might\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t have plans on Saturday, but we don\u2019t have to be partners. I can do this by myself.\u201d</p><p>I stopped in front of the doors, unsure if I had heard her right. \u201cWhy would you want to do all the assignments\u2014and if you look at his class outline, there are a lot\u2014all by yourself?\u201d</p><p>She took a step back. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really want to, but you don\u2019t have to be my partner. I mean, you don\u2019t owe me or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get what you\u2019re saying.\u201d I honestly, seriously, a hundred percent, did not get what she was saying.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that . . .\u201d She stopped, brows knitting into the deep V again. \u201cWhy are you being so nice to me?\u201d</p><p>My mouth formed around the words \u201cwhat the fuck.\u201d \u201cIs that a serious question?\u201d</p><p>Shortcake ducked her gaze. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her and waited for her to say she was joking, but she didn\u2019t. A knot formed in my chest, coming out of nowhere. Suddenly it was painfully obvious to me, and I mean painfully. Shortcake wasn\u2019t just awkward, she was obviously on the friendless side of things, and I don\u2019t know why that affected me. It shouldn\u2019t have. I barely knew the girl and guiding her into conversation was as easy as disarming a bomb with your teeth, but it did bother me.</p><p>Underdog syndrome strikes again.</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cAll right, I guess I\u2019m just a nice guy. And you\u2019re obviously new\u2014a freshman. You seemed to be a little out of it on Monday and then you ran off, wouldn\u2019t even come into class and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your pity.\u201d She sucked in a shrill sound.</p><p>I scowled at the insinuation. \u201cYou don\u2019t have my pity, Avery. I\u2019m just saying you seemed out of it on Monday and I figured we\u2019d just be partners.\u201d</p><p>Doubt crossed her features.</p><p>\u201cI can see that you don\u2019t believe me. Maybe it was the cookie? Well, you refused to taste my cookies last night and honestly, I was going to eat the other cookie, but you looked so tired and sad sitting there, I figured you needed the cookie more than I did.\u201d</p><p>Which might have been a lie. There was a good chance that I had brought two cookies because Shortcake might make an appearance. Then again, I may be reading too much into it.</p><p>She was watching me like I was a puzzle, and honestly, I wasn\u2019t that complicated.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re pretty,\u201d I added.</p><p>She blinked \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Trying and failing to hide my amusement, I turned and opened the door, guiding her into the hallway. \u201cDo not tell me you don\u2019t know you\u2019re pretty. If so, I\u2019m about to lose all faith in mankind. You don\u2019t want to be responsible for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m pretty\u2014I mean, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d She paused, groaning. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ugly. That\u2019s what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now we\u2019ve cleared that up.\u201d I tugged on her bag, guiding her to the stairs. \u201cWatch the door. It can be tricky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does the whole pretty comment have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked why I\u2019m so nice to you. It\u2019s mutually beneficial.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake came to a complete stop behind me. \u201cYou\u2019re nice to me because you think I\u2019m pretty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd because you have brown eyes. I\u2019m a sucker for big old brown eyes.\u201d I laughed. \u201cI\u2019m a shallow, shallow boy. Hey, it helps that you\u2019re pretty. It brings out the nice guy in me. Makes me want to share my cookies with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I was ugly, you wouldn\u2019t be nice to me?\u201d</p><p>Spinning around, I faced her. \u201cI\u2019d still be nice to you if you were ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I grinned as I tipped my chin down, bringing our mouths close. \u201cI just wouldn\u2019t offer you any cookies.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think \u2018cookie\u2019 is a code word for something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it is.\u201d I tugged on her bag again as I went down a step. \u201cAnd just think about it. If \u2018cookie\u2019 is a code word, whatever it symbolizes, it\u2019s been in your mouth, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she stared at me and then she laughed. The sound was untried and hoarse, as if she didn\u2019t laugh often, and that caused that weird knot in my chest to throb. \u201cYou are really . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing? Awesome?\u201d I wanted to hear her laugh again. \u201cAstonishing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to go with bizarre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, if I had feelings that might actually hurt.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, and that meant we were close to a smile again. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing that you don\u2019t have feelings then, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d I hopped onto the landing. \u201cYou better hurry or you\u2019re going to be late to your next class.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, and I laughed, stepping out the way so Shortcake didn\u2019t run me over as she darted down the steps. \u201cDamn, if only you moved that fast for my cookies, I\u2019d be a happy guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I came around to the top of the next flight of stairs. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what \u2018cookies\u2019 is a code word for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Good God, no!\u201d</p><p>I tipped back my head and laughed as the last strands of coppery hair disappeared from sight. I didn\u2019t know what it was about Avery Morgansten, but she was better than the quiet girl in middle school who turned out to like girls.</p><p>A lot better.</p><p>Four</p><p>There were moments in my life where I had no idea how I got where I was. Like what exactly had occurred to create the situation I was in?</p><p>Steph, wearing another skirt that barely covered her ass, slid a hand down my arm. She said something, whispered in my ear, but I really wasn\u2019t paying attention.</p><p>My gaze drifted from the TV to the hair band lying on my coffee table.</p><p>Oh, that\u2019s how this all got started.</p><p>A text from Steph claiming that she\u2019d left something \u201csuper important\u201d at my apartment from the night of the party. A rubber band. If I only had known that was what she was looking for, I would\u2019ve walked my ass to the Rite Aid and bought her a whole package of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWant me to get you a beer from the fridge?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She really was the perfect woman. \u201cNo. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>I could feel her eyes on me as I lifted the glass of water and took a drink. Beer. Me. Steph. No one else in the apartment. Not a good combination. Or maybe a good one depending on how you looked at it.</p><p>Cuddling up against my side, her full breasts pressed against my arm.</p> <p>I so needed to look at this as a good thing instead of wondering how a couch that I could stretch out on suddenly felt too small.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you turning over a new leaf or something?\u201d she asked, gaze fixed on the TV as she ran the tips of her nails up and down my arm. I was watching a boxing rerun and I doubted she was that interested. \u201cAre you no longer drinking?\u201d</p><p>I laughed under my breath. \u201cNah. Just not feeling it tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Steph\u2019s hand moved from my forearm to the center of my chest. \u201cWhat are you feeling tonight?\u201d</p><p>Loaded question, so I said nothing as a glove-covered fist slammed into a jaw. Steph perceived my silence the way she wanted, sliding her hand down the bare skin of my abs. Blood followed the tips of her fingers as they drifted below my navel, reaching the band on my shorts.</p> <p>My body was into what was about to happen, thickening and swelling, straining up to meet her wandering fingers. And my body knew her fingers well, remembered exactly how skilled she was. But my head wasn\u2019t even in the same ballpark as my cock.</p><p>Tipping my head back against the couch, I exhaled slowly. There wasn\u2019t a damn thing wrong with what was happening. Her quick fingers skimmed over my limp hand, smoothing along my hip. The muscles jumped in response. So did something else.</p><p>I closed my eyes, inhaled deeply. My heart wasn\u2019t pounding. I was thinking about the meeting I\u2019d have to attend Friday night. And I was thinking about Saturday night and stars when her hand curled around my cock, gripping me through the nylon shorts. A pulse shot straight up my spine as she moved her hand up.</p><p>Pleasure swirled low in my gut, and I knew if I let her continue, I would enjoy it. Already, it felt damn good. Always did, but I wouldn\u2019t return the act. Weeks ago, I would\u2019ve, out of pure principal. Give. Take. But now I didn\u2019t care enough to do it and that wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, voice gruff as I gently grabbed her arm, pulling her hand away.</p><p>Her perfect lips formed a perfect O. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not feeling this.\u201d I brought her hand to my mouth and kissed her palm before placing it back on her thigh. My cock was already soft. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>Surprise shuttled across her face, and a part of me was reeling in shock. Had I really just turned her down? I had.</p><p>Pink mottled her tan cheeks as she turned her gaze to the TV, and I, well, I felt like a dick. Shit. Sitting forward, I dropped my hands on my knees. \u201cYou want anything to eat?\u201d</p><p>Mute, she shook her head no.</p><p>Double shit. \u201cLook, Steph, it\u2019s not you, and I\u2019m being serious about that. I\u2019m just feeling weird tonight. All right?\u201d</p><p>Steph glanced at me and slowly nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I let go of my breath in relief. Like I said before, Steph was a good girl and we had history. Things were just different now. She stayed for a little while longer and then she was ready to go. I got up to walk her out. At the door, she turned and stretched up, kissing my cheek.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p> <p>Steph shrugged as I closed the door behind us. \u201cAre you going to the frat party?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGot plans,\u201d I told her.</p><p>She pouted prettily. \u201cCan\u2019t you skip it Friday night?\u201d</p><p>Reaching over, I tugged on a strand of soft, black hair. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t, sweetheart. Maybe next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suck.\u201d But she smiled as she hip bumped me.</p><p>\u201cThat I do.\u201d</p><p>We headed toward her car and when she caught her heel on a patch of loose gravel, I caught her arm, steadying her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been drinking tonight?\u201d I asked, eyes narrowing. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>Moonlight sliced over her face as she tipped her head back and let out a throaty laugh. \u201cNo.\u201d She smacked my chest. \u201cAnd what if I did? Are you going to let me spend the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d put your little ass in my truck and drive you back to your dorm.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes rolled. \u201cThat sounds like a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>We stopped behind her sedan and I pulled her in for a quick hug. \u201cText me when you get back to your dorm.\u201d</p><p>She laughed again, pulling back. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>I shot her a look. \u201cYou know I\u2019m serious. It\u2019s late. A lot of people fucking suck in the world, so text me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I will.\u201d Steph laughed as she backed toward the driver\u2019s door. \u201cSee you later, Cam.\u201d</p><p>Stepping back, I watched her pull out of the parking spot before I turned and headed back. Halfway across the parking lot, I looked up toward Shortcake\u2019s apartment. There were no lights on, and I bet she was already tucked away in her bed. Did she wear long-sleeve shirts to bed? Or did she sleep naked?</p><p>An image of her naked, her coppery hair spread out around her like a halo, invaded my head.</p><p>My cock swelled to life once again.</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>It was going to be a long night.</p><p>Thursday morning was IHOP morning, or at least that was what Ollie had deemed it when he rolled out of bed and busted up into my room. Snatching my cap off the arm of the couch, I saw Steph\u2019s rubber band on the coffee table and rolled my eyes.</p><p>Super important.</p><p>Ollie was already outside and I as approached the door, I caught the scent of rain in the air. As soon as I closed the door behind me, I realized he wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>\u201cAvery,\u201d Ollie said. \u201cCam told me your name.\u201d</p><p>Mental note to self: punt kick Ollie in the balls later.</p><p>There was a pause and then, \u201cOh. So . . . um, you\u2019re heading to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo douchebag, you left the door open!\u201d I smacked the cap on, rounding the stairs. Below, I got an eyeful of how Avery\u2019s blue jeans hugged her ass. Nice. \u201cHey, what are you doing with my girl?\u201d</p><p>Ollie grinned up at me, but my attention was trained on Shortcake. The girl had to be wearing little or no makeup, because her face was . . . fresh. Natural. I liked it. Her gaze met mine and then flickered away.</p><p>\u201cI was explaining to her how I go by two names,\u201d Ollie said.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d I caught up with them, dropping my arm over her shoulders. Her feet tripped up, and I tightened my arm, tucking her against my side. In the back of my head, I thought she fit perfectly. \u201cWhoa, sweetheart, almost lost you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at you.\u201d Ollie hopped down the stairs like a frog. \u201cGot the girl tripping all over her feet.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, keeping an arm around her as I slid the cap backward. \u201cI can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s my magnetic charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr it could be your smell.\u201d Ollie grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I heard a shower this morning.\u201d</p><p>I gasped. \u201cDo I smell bad, Avery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou smell great,\u201d she said, and then a red flush quickened across her cheeks. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t smell bad.\u201d</p><p>Instinct told me she meant something completely different. \u201cHeading to class?\u201d</p><p>Shortcake didn\u2019t say anything as we walked down the stairs, but her face was pinched as if she was in deep thought about something.</p><p>\u201cAvery?\u201d</p><p>She squirmed away, and my eyes narrowed as she hurried off. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m heading to art. What about you guys?\u201d</p><p>Catching up with her on the third floor, I\u2019d be damned if she got away that easily. \u201cWe\u2019re going out to breakfast. You should skip and join us.\u201d</p><p>She tightened her grip on her bag. \u201cI think I\u2019ve done enough skipping this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m skipping,\u201d Ollie announced, \u201cbut Cam doesn\u2019t have a class until this afternoon, so he\u2019s a good boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a bad boy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He grinned at Shortcake, the kind of smile I\u2019d seen him give countless girls. \u201cOh, I\u2019m a bad, bad boy.\u201d</p><p>My skin prickled as I shot Ollie a look. \u201cYeah, as in bad at spelling, math, English, cleaning up after yourself, talking to people, and I could go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m good at the things that count,\u201d Ollie replied.</p><p>\u201cAnd what are those things?\u201d I asked as we stepped out under clouds fat with rain. It was going to be one of those days.</p><p>Ollie faced us, walking backward. A red truck started to back up, but he kept going, forcing the truck to grind to a halt. I shook my head. He held up a tanned hand and started ticking off his fingers. \u201cDrinking, socializing, snowboarding, and soccer\u2014remember that sport, Cam? Soccer?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. \u201cYeah, I remember it, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Ollie, probably having no idea what he\u2019d just done, spun around and headed for my truck. A muscle started to tick in my jaw. I shoved my hands in my jeans as I glanced at Shortcake. \u201cSee you around, Avery.\u201d</p><p>Leaving her, I joined Ollie by my truck. Instead of hitting the unlock button to all the doors, I only did mine and climbed in, slamming the door shut behind me.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d came Ollie\u2019s muffled voice.</p><p>Ignoring him, I turned on the truck. A big, fat raindrop hit the windshield, and I smiled, looking up at the sky.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I raised my hand, giving him the finger.</p><p>Ollie jumped when the sky opened up in a torrential downpour, howling like a wounded animal. Only when his hair was plastered to his skull did I unlock his door.</p><p>He climbed in, shivering. \u201cWhat the fuck, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserved it.\u201d I shifted into reverse, backing out. One look at Ollie\u2019s creased forehead told me he was racking his brain for what he did. I sighed. \u201cYou really need to lay off the pot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019ve heard that once, I\u2019ve heard that a million times, but Mary Jane loves me, and she\u2019s the only girl I love.\u201d</p><p>Smoothing my hand over the baseball cap, I shook my head. \u201cFucking hippie.\u201d</p><p>Ollie shook his head like a wet dog, spraying the interior with droplets of chilly water. He must\u2019ve knocked something loose in his brain, because he fell back against the seat. \u201cShit, man. I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d</p><p>I coughed out a laugh as I pulled out of the parking lot, a car behind Shortcake. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge surprise.\u201d</p><p>Ollie stared ahead, the normal smile he wore gone. \u201cI forget sometimes, you know? It seems like forever ago.\u201d</p><p>Shit, I wished I could forget, especially now, as I watched Shortcake\u2019s car hang a left, heading toward campus.</p><p>He glanced at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, man. Truly. I know how much soccer meant to you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded absently as I turned right, heading for the bypass that would take us into Charles Town. Soccer had been my life since the moment Dad enrolled me in the local peewee league, and over years, I\u2019d honed my skills as a striker, the middle scoring position. I was damn good, too, and it was no secret that when I registered for Shepherd and made their soccer team three years ago, I had no plans on staying here. I was biding my time before I could score a tryout with D.C. United. Soccer was how I met Jase and Ollie. Soccer had been my sanity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the only thing I was doing with soccer now was coaching a summer rec league program as community service. There would be no more soccer. At least for the foreseeable future, and one act of anger had ensured that.</p><p>Most people my age spent Friday night drinking and hanging out with friends. I spent my Friday night sitting in a circle\u2014yes, a fucking circle\u2014listening to people\u2019s problems. Some of the guys in the group weren\u2019t bad. Like Henry. He got drunk one night and got into a fight at a bar. He wasn\u2019t a psychopath. Neither was Aaron, who apparently had some road-rage problems. A couple of the other guys, and that one chick with the pasty-white makeup and heavy black eyeliner, I wasn\u2019t so sure about. They were kind of scary.</p><p>Screwed-up thing was that I wasn\u2019t the youngest person here. Not by far.</p><p>I only had . . . ten more motherfucking months of this.</p> <p>I could do this. Seriously. I could easily do this.</p><p>\u201cCameron?\u201d Dr. Bale cleared his throat, and I wanted to punch myself in the throat. \u201cIs there anything you would like to share tonight?\u201d</p><p>This was the part I couldn\u2019t do. The talking-about-me shit with a whole bunch of strangers staring at me. I looked up, and a sympathetic look crossed Henry\u2019s face before looking away.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Goth chick\u2014who apparently had a penchant for knives\u2014threw herself back in her seat, crossing her arms covered in black ink. \u201cHe never shares anything.\u201d</p> <p>I pressed my lips together to keep from getting stabbed.</p><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d Dr. Bale adjusted his wire-frame glasses. \u201cYou barely contribute to the group, Cameron.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, I sat back and slid the baseball cap down lower. \u201cI\u2019m just taking it all in.\u201d</p><p>Henry jumped in, thankfully, diverting the attention, and I floated under the radar until the end of the session, but when I got up to leave, Dr. Bale summoned me.</p><p>Great.</p><p>As everyone filed out of the room, I dropped back in the metal folding chair and leaned forward, resting my elbows on my knees. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?</p> <p>Dr. Bale leaned over, picking out a folder from the plastic bin beside him. \u201cI wanted to make sure you were getting something out of these meetings, Cameron.\u201d</p><p>Uh. No. No, I was not. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>He eyed me as he hooked his leg over a knee as he leaned back in his chair. \u201cYou\u2019ve barely spoken about the event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to say.\u201d He smiled, pausing, and the skin around his eyes crinkled. \u201cI know talking in front of people is hard in the beginning, but you have things in common with them.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I have a lot in common with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I averted my gaze to the white walls. Posters lined them. Ones that spoke of talking, instead of throwing punches.</p> <p>\u201cAre you taking this seriously, Cameron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I forced my gaze not to search out the only clock in the room, behind me.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019d hate for you to not take this wonderful opportunity and use it to benefit your life.\u201d</p><p>I kept my expression blank.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize how lucky you are, Cameron?\u201d Dr. Bale asked when I said nothing. \u201cWhat happened to that boy could have put you in jail for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, meaning it. God knows I knew how lucky I was. And for the longest time I believed my ass should\u2019ve been rotting in jail. I would\u2019ve been if it hadn\u2019t been for my father\u2019s pull in the criminal courts and my otherwise spotless record. \u201cI\u2019m a really laid-back guy, Dr. Bale. What happened\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beating you inflicted on that boy would beg to differ.\u201d His gaze flicked down to my file. \u201cSevere head contusions. Broken jaw, nose, and eye socket, along with several broken ribs.\u201d He looked up, meeting my stare. That doesn\u2019t sound like something a \u2018laid-back guy\u2019 would do, now does it?\u201d</p><p>My stomach soured, but I didn\u2019t look away. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of what I did. Looking back, I know there were plenty of other things I could\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>But I didn\u2019t have an \u201canger\u201d or a \u201crage\u201d problem. And as fucked up as it sounded, I still wasn\u2019t sure I regretted what I had done. The fucker had been beating on my sister, and well, I had lost my shit.</p><p>And truth be told, if I had to do the situation all over again, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d handle it any differently. You hurt my sister, you\u2019re fucking with me. It was as simple as that.</p><p>Five</p><p>When it came to my little Shortcake, patience paid off.</p><p>At first, the trip out to Antietam National Battlefield to do our astronomy assignment had started off as painful as my weekly anger-management classes were. She sat in my truck like I lured her in there with the offer of free puppies, tugging on the sleeves of her sweater and sitting as straight as a board. Her nervousness increased as we headed down Bloody Lane, picking a spot that would give us a clear view of the sky and . . . cornfields.</p><p>I learned she was a bit of a history nerd, which was cool, because those brown eyes lit up when she started talking about the battlefield. And I also learned she was in one hell of a hurry to get this done and over with.</p><p>Never in my life did I doubt my ability to attract a girl like I did with Avery. She acted like spending time with me was tantamount to sitting in music appreciation class for two semesters in a row. As cocky as this sounds, I knew I could walk onto that campus and get a date with the nearest available girl. Probably even a girl who wasn\u2019t available, but with Avery, it was like trying to hit on a nun. And not a naughty nun.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think this will take?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I paused as something occurred to me. Maybe my charm wasn\u2019t failing me. Holy shit, how had I not thought about this before? \u201cYou got a hot date tonight?\u201d</p><p>She laughed dryly. \u201cUh, no.\u201d</p><p>Part of me was happy to hear this. The other part was thoroughly confused. \u201cYou sound like that\u2019s an insane idea. That no one would go out on a Saturday night for a date.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, she dropped the piece of hair she\u2019d been messing with. \u201cI\u2019m not dating anyone.\u201d</p><p>I walked on, tapping my hands off my thighs as the breeze stirred the cornstalks, causing them to rattle like dry bones. \u201cSo why the rush?\u201d When there was no response, I glanced over my shoulder at her, grinning. \u201cAre you worried that I\u2019ve brought you out here for my own nefarious plans?\u201d</p><p>Shortcake stopped, her face paling in a way that made her freckles punch out. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Whoa. I faced her, feeling the knot back in my chest and something else. Her reaction was too quick, too real. A bad taste filled my mouth. \u201cHey, Avery, I\u2019m just joking. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me and then averted her gaze, cheeks flushing. \u201cI know. I\u2019m just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJumpy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that.\u201d</p><p>I hoped\u2014fuck, I prayed\u2014that was all this was. Watching her fiddle with the bracelet on her left wrist, I couldn\u2019t let the train of thought go any further. Anger over the possibility of something fucked up in the most minor way happening to her was already pricking at my skin. I was sure I was overreacting. \u201cCome on. It\u2019ll be dark soon.\u201d</p><p>I started walking, heading toward the tower, waving at two students from our class. Picking a spot on the hill overlooking the dirt lane, I pulled out a flashlight before I sat down. The grass was dry and in that stretch of silence, the hum of crickets was almost as loud as my pounding heart. I had no idea why my pulse was racing, but it felt like I\u2019d run from the truck to here instead of walking.</p><p>Looking up, I found Shortcake hovering a few feet behind me. I patted the spot. \u201cJoin me? Pretty please? I\u2019m lonely all by myself over here.\u201d</p><p>She sucked her lower lip in between her teeth, and the muscles in my stomach tensed. Finally, she moved forward and sat . . . three feet from me. My brows rose, but then . . . then our gazes collided, and I took a breath, but it didn\u2019t get really far. How many freckles did she have on the bridge of her nose? Nine. No. Nine and a half. One of them was faded. Her lips were parted, like she was waiting for a kiss.</p><p>The urge to kiss her hit me hard in the gut. Was it the first time? When I wiped the crumb from her lip, I had wanted to kiss her then, to taste those soft-looking lips. Any other girl I would\u2019ve made a move, but not Shortcake.</p><p>And that\u2019s when the strangest damn thing happened.</p><p>I wanted to slow down. How I could slow down this nonexistent relationship was beyond me, but I don\u2019t know. My heart was still pounding.</p><p>Avery ducked her chin, studying her notebook as she cleared her throat.</p><p>Letting out a breath I didn\u2019t realize I was holding, I asked, \u201cWhat constellation are we supposed to be mapping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, the Corona Borealis, I think,\u201d she said, skimming the notes as I held the flashlight.</p><p>\u201cAh, the Northern Crown.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cYou knew that off the top of your head?\u201d</p><p>I laughed at her dubious expression. \u201cI might not take notes, but I do pay attention.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cI really don\u2019t understand how anyone sees shapes in the stars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I moved closer slowly and peeked over her shoulder. \u201cThe shapes are pretty obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me. I mean, it\u2019s just a bunch of stars in the sky. You can probably see whatever you want to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at the Borealis.\u201d I pointed at the map. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a crown.\u201d</p><p>She laughed\u2014a real laugh, and the knot tightened in my chest. \u201cIt does not look like a crown. It looks like an irregular half circle.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, I shook my head. \u201cLook. You can see it now easily. That\u2019s a crown. Come on, see the seven stars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see the seven stars, but I also see about a hundred others peeking out.\u201d She grabbed a pen. \u201cI also see the cookie monster.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>As I watched her, her lips curved up in a smile as she posed her pen over the grid. It was clear she had no idea what latitude line to start at as she glanced up toward the Borealis. Finally, she connected two dots.</p><p>\u201cYou know where the name comes from?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Shortcake shook her head, so I reached over and took the pen from her. In the process, my fingers brushed hers. A jolt zapped up my arm, and she pulled away immediately. \u201cIt represents the crown given from the god Dionysus to Ariadne,\u201d I told her. \u201cWhen she married Bacchus, he placed her crown in the heavens in honor of their marriage.\u201d</p><p>She stared, brows furrowing. \u201cProfessor Drage didn\u2019t teach that in class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you know that?\u201d</p><p>She tipped her head to the side, lips pursed.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Maybe most people wouldn\u2019t know that off the top of their head.\u201d I twirled her pen. \u201cI actually took part of this class as a freshman, but had to drop it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Curiosity filled her brown eyes. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re, what, a junior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I paused, unsure of how much I should say. \u201cI ended up having to take a year off, which put me behind.\u201d</p> <p>She was quiet for a few moments \u201cWhy did you retake astronomy? Is it a part of your major?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just like the class and Professor Drage.\u201d I turned off the flashlight \u201cI\u2019m studying recreation and sport. Would like to get into sport rehabilitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Did you . . .\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t finish her sentence, I looked over and followed her gaze. On the bench, the two from our astronomy class looked like they were about to practice making babies right then and there.</p><p>\u201cNow that is an interesting form of stargazing,\u201d I said.</p> <p>She watched them for a couple of more moments, her eyes wide like she was trying to figure out exactly what they were doing. Which was obvious. There was a lot of tongue involved.</p><p>I poked her with my pen.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s just that . . .\u201d I had no idea how to say this. \u201cYou\u2019re watching them like . . . you\u2019ve never seen a couple do that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSo unless you were raised in a convent, I imagined you\u2019ve been in a lap a time or two, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t!\u201d She cringed, focusing over the cornstalks. \u201cI mean, I haven\u2019t been in a guy\u2019s lap.\u201d</p><p>A grin teased at my lips. \u201cWhat about a girl\u2019s lap?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cWhat? No!\u201d</p><p>I smiled broadly, picturing her in a girl\u2019s lap and that wasn\u2019t a bad image. Made even better when I pictured her in my lap, though. \u201cI was joking, Avery.\u201d</p><p>Her chin jutted out stubbornly. \u201cI know, it\u2019s just that . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I poked her arm with the pen again. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>Never? Never as in ever? No way.</p> <p>Clutching her notebook, she glanced at me. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth, said nothing. I blinked and then shook my head as I tipped my head back, staring at the sky. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been in a relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what no means.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea what to say. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m nineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t been in a single relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My parents . . . they were strict.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI mean, really strict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d I tapped the pen on the notebook, beyond curious, like obsessively curious as to how someone as pretty as Avery made it this far without ever being in a relationship \u201cSo have you gone on a date or anything?\u201d</p><p>A deep sigh emanated from her. \u201cI thought we were supposed to be mapping stars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not. All I have is a scribbly line and you have nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat scribbly line is between the Delta and Gamma.\u201d I leaned over, connecting the dots. \u201cHere is the Theta and this is the Alpha\u2014brightest star. See, we are halfway done.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, slowly shaking her head as she turned her gaze to the sky. While she was distracted, because I was done with the astronomy shit, I leaned in further, my shoulder pressing into hers as I finished the map, completing our homework assignment.</p><p>I turned my head. \u201cNow we\u2019re done mapping stars . . .\u201d Our faces were inches apart, and I heard the soft inhale of breath. She didn\u2019t move away, and my smile went up a notch. \u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t hard.\u201d</p><p>Avery\u2019s gaze dropped, and I knew she wasn\u2019t paying a damn bit of attention to what was coming out of my mouth even though she was staring at it. Not that I was complaining. She could stare at my mouth all she wanted.</p><p>Those thick lashes swept up and our gazes locked once more. A sudden, tangible pull spread out between us. Neither of us moved, and I wanted to. I wanted to pull her into my arms. Where the whole slowing down things went to I had no idea. She moved, visibly uncomfortable, and the good, decent part of me said to look away, to crack a joke and make her feel better, but I couldn\u2019t resist the lure of her eyes. In the darkness, they were like black pools.</p><p>I forced myself to say something. \u201cYou think you learned anything about the stars?\u201d</p><p>There was no response, which was probably a good thing, because that was lame. So I went to what I really wanted to know. \u201cHave you ever been on a date?\u201d</p><p>Still no response.</p><p>My lips curved up. \u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>Shortcake blinked like she was coming out of a daze. \u201cHuh? Yes! Yes. Totally.\u201d</p><p>There was no mistaking she was feeling what I was feeling. Not when she had stared at me that long. \u201cYeah . . . so, you haven\u2019t been on a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cYou really haven\u2019t been listening to me at all. You\u2019ve been too busy staring at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you were.\u201d I nudged her shoulder.</p><p>The expression she made was like she tasted something bad. \u201cYou are so beyond the acceptable level of arrogance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrogant? I\u2019m just stating the truth.\u201d I tossed my notebook aside and leaned back on my arms, watching her. I couldn\u2019t resist teasing her. It was like finding a new hobby. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with staring at me. I like it.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t staring at you. Not really. I sort of . . . dazed out. That\u2019s how thrilling talking to you is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything about me is thrilling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout as thrilling as watching your tortoise cross a road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Keep telling yourself that, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep calling me sweetheart and you\u2019re going to be limping.\u201d</p><p>Ah, I liked that. \u201cOh, listen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should do it.\u201d</p><p>Her lips puckered. \u201cDo what? Go home? I\u2019m all about going home, like right now.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cGo on a date.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>Shortcake stared at me like I\u2019d just suggested that we strip naked and run through the cornstalks. She snapped her notebook closed and grabbed her bag. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m following this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not that complicated.\u201d I laughed at her hateful look. \u201cWe should go out on a date.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me a moment and then shoved her notebook into the bag with lethal force. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t I surprised that she didn\u2019t understand? Lying back, I stretched my arms above my head, feeling the bones pop. I watched her gaze sweep down the length of me, getting hung up on the skin exposed between my shirt and belt.</p><p>My smile spread. \u201cTypically going on a date is when two people go out for the evening or sometimes during the day. Really, it can be any time of the day or night. It usually involves dinner. Sometimes a movie or a walk in the park. Though, I don\u2019t do walks in the park. Maybe on a beach, but since there aren\u2019t any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what a date is.\u201d She jumped to her feet, eyes like chips of black ice in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t understand. So I\u2019m explaining what a date means.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched as she crossed her arms. \u201cThat\u2019s not the part I don\u2019t understand and you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just making sure we were on the same page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Grinning shamelessly, I lowered my arms, but didn\u2019t tug down my shirt. \u201cSo now that we both know what a date entails, we should go out on one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d</p><p>I laughed as I sat up. The confusion on her face was adorable in a weird way. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a response, Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Shaking her head, she took a step back. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Where in the hell did Shortcake get that idea? \u201cA girlfriend? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who was that brunette stumbling out of your apartment Wednesday night?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>As her words sunk in, I smiled from ear to fucking ear. \u201cHave you been watching me, Avery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No!\u201d Her face blanched. \u201cWhat? I wasn\u2019t watching you. I do have a life.\u201d</p><p>I arched a brow. \u201cThen how do you know about Stephanie?\u201d</p><p>Shortcake shifted her weight. \u201cThat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, she has a name and no, she\u2019s not my girlfriend. And she wasn\u2019t stumbling. Maybe shuffling.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo how did you see her if you weren\u2019t watching me?\u201d I crossed my ankles. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mind the idea of you watching me. Remember, I like that.\u201d</p><p>Her chest rose in a deep breath, and I could tell her patience was running thin. \u201cI wasn\u2019t watching you. I couldn\u2019t sleep and I was staring out my living-room window. I just happened to see you walking her out to her car.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t believe her. Hell to the no. Who just happens to be staring out the window at that time of night? As much as I\u2019d love to tease her, it looked like she was about to punt kick my head, but I was a gambling sort of man. \u201cWell, that makes sense. Not nearly as entertaining as you standing by your window hoping to catch a glimpse of me.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me.</p><p>I winked. \u201cSteph\u2019s not my girlfriend by the way. We aren\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>Her hand went to the bracelet on her left wrist. \u201cI\u2019m not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Turning her stare to the many stars, she raised her hands. \u201cI\u2019m not like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t just hook up with guys for fun, okay? I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it. Totally not judging here, but that\u2019s not me. So I\u2019m not interested. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a sec. I\u2019m confused. You\u2019re not judging her, but you\u2019ve made the assumption that she\u2019s into random hookups? That she\u2019s my fuck buddy? Isn\u2019t that kind of making a rash judgment based on assumptions?\u201d</p><p>Her forehead wrinkled. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what you guys are about. Maybe you\u2019re just childhood buddies or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d I grinned. \u201cWe hook up every once in a while.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake\u2019s jaw hit the ground. \u201cI was right! Then why did you accuse me of being judgmental?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just pointing it out.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop teasing her. The array of emotions that crossed her face was fascinating to me. \u201cAnd for the record, we didn\u2019t hook up Wednesday night. Not for the lack of trying on her part, but I wasn\u2019t feeling it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. This is a stupid conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like this conversation.\u201d</p><p>She reached for the bag, but I was faster, grabbing her bag as I stood. A deep, annoyed sigh radiated from her. \u201cGive it to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ducking my chin, I said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to.\u201d I laid the strap over her shoulder, brushing the side of her neck with my fingers. It wasn\u2019t on purpose that time and when she jumped, so did my heart. Backing away, I picked up the flashlight. \u201cSee? I was just being a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a gentleman, but thank you.\u201d</p><p>Her words were an odd mix of sincerity and frustration, and she didn\u2019t say anything else as we started back with only the narrow swath of light from the flashlight.</p><p>\u201cThis place is kind of creepy at night, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded as she looked over at the dark, looming shadows of the monuments. \u201cWell, I guess, if there\u2019s going to be any place in the world haunted, it would be a place like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe in ghosts?\u201d</p><p>Shortcake shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Never seen one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>One side of her lips curved up. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing I suppose.\u201d</p> <p>I stopped at the passenger side of the truck. \u201cMilady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Since there was a little less frustration in her voice, I decided to test my luck. I leaned against the open door, watching the interior light caress the edges of her face. \u201cSo, what about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about what?\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head to the side. \u201cGo out on a date with me.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer.\u201d She grabbed the seatbelt, whipping it around her.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of question was that? How am I\u2014hey, it\u2019s just a seat belt. Not that hard.\u201d I leaned over, taking the belt from her. As our hands brushed, she plastered herself against the seat. It was such a strange reaction that the tiny hairs on the back of my neck rose as I lifted my gaze. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we go out on a date?\u201d</p><p>Her hands balled into fists in her lap. I wanted to let go of the damn seat belt, take her hands in mine, and ease them out of the tight ball. \u201cBecause . . . because we don\u2019t know each other.\u201d</p><p>I smiled slightly as I moved my gaze up, centering on her mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s what a date is all about. Getting to know each other. Go out on a date with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to know about me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there is tons to know about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>I leaned closer, inhaling her sweet scent. \u201cThen we can spend the time with me talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it will be more thrilling than watching Raphael cross a road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d Amusement flashed in her dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cThought you\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flickered to where her bag rested against her legs and then back to mine. \u201cCan we go yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we go on a date?\u201d</p><p>A sound of frustration came from her. \u201cGood God, you don\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake laughed, and I couldn\u2019t stop the smile from forming on my lips. I liked the sound of her laugh, when she really laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are plenty of girls who want to go out on a date with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Modest aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I be? And I want to go out on a date with you. Not them.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why.\u201d</p><p>And I didn\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t get it. \u201cI can think of a few reasons. You\u2019re not like most girls.\u201d True. \u201cThat interests me.\u201d And it really did. \u201cYou\u2019re awkward in this really . . . adorable way. You\u2019re smart. Want me to list more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not at all,\u201d she replied. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go out on a date with you.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t believe it. Call it intuition, experience, or plain old cockiness, I didn\u2019t believe her at all. \u201cI figured you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you ask?\u201d</p><p>I leaned back, grabbing the side of the door. \u201cBecause I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well. Okay. Glad you got it out of your system.\u201d</p><p>What did she think this was? Hell, I didn\u2019t even know what this was. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten it out of my system.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders slumped. \u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s always tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask you again.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThe answer will be the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not.\u201d I tapped the tip of her nose, grinning as she narrowed her eyes at me. \u201cAnd maybe you\u2019ll say yes. I\u2019m a patient guy, and hey, like you said, I don\u2019t give up easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she muttered, but there was a glimmer in her eyes, the same sheen that had been there when she was checking me out.</p><p>\u201cKnew you\u2019d see it that way.\u201d I tweaked the tip of her nose, and she smacked my hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth about what?\u201d</p><p>I moved back in case she swung again. \u201cYou want to say yes, but you\u2019re just not ready.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake looked like she actually did see a ghost.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m a lot to handle, but I can assure you, you\u2019ll have fun handling me.\u201d Before she could respond, I tapped her nose and then closed the door, grinning to myself as I loped around the front of the truck.</p><p>I watched Avery head into her apartment. She stopped halfway in, tucked the glossy copper strands behind her ear as she peeked over her shoulder at me.</p><p>A small, shy smile pulled at her lips as she waved good-bye and then slipped inside, quietly closing the door behind her.</p><p>Standing there a few more moments, like a creeper, I finally turned toward my door. As I reached for the knob, the door swung open.</p><p>Jase appeared, blocking the door. A curious look crossed his expression. \u201cWhat are you doing standing in the hallway of your apartment building like a loser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in my apartment like a freak?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI was hanging out with Ollie, but he ran to Sheetz to get some nachos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, a nachos night.\u201d Which meant Ollie would be up all night. I shifted my weight. \u201cAre you going to let me in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since it is your place.\u201d He cocked his head to the side, casting half of his swarthy face into a shadow. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>Jase stepped aside, allowing me to squeeze past him. I went straight to the fridge, grabbed a beer and then dropped onto the couch. \u201cYou\u2019re not at the farm?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as he joined me, picking up a bottle from the coffee table. \u201cNo. Jack is with the grandparents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d That explained it. Jase was usually at his family farm on the weekends.</p><p>Jase glanced at me. \u201cSooo, you were out with the redhead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShortcake?\u201d</p><p>His dark brows slipped out of the wave of hair and knitted. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery\u2019s the redhead. And no. We were doing an astronomy assignment. We\u2019re partners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He took a swig of his beer and made a face. \u201cSooo,\u201d he said again, and I rolled my eyes. \u201cWhy were you staring at her apartment door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched you through the peephole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d I laughed, taking a drink. A couple of minutes passed and then I said, \u201cI asked her out.\u201d</p><p>Jase didn\u2019t look that interested. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe turned me down.\u201d</p><p>His head swung toward me, his dove-gray eyes sparkling with interest. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I fell back into the couch, grinning. \u201cTurned me down flat.\u201d</p><p>Leaning onto the arm of the couch, Jase laughed so hard I think he hurt his stomach. \u201cI like this girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d I said, sighing. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>Fresh banana-nut bread cooled on the counter, filling the apartment with its savory scent.</p><p>I glanced at the clock on the stove. Five till eight.</p><p>Shoving my hands through my damp hair, I gave up on the idea of actually sleeping. In the living room, Ollie was passed out on the floor snoring, and the last time I\u2019d checked my bedroom, Jase was sprawled across the foot of my bed. And there was no way in hell any part of my skin or clothes were touching any part of Ollie\u2019s bed.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t so much that Jase and Ollie had kept me awake. At any point during the never-ending night, I could\u2019ve locked myself in my bedroom, but my mind wouldn\u2019t shut down. Some of it had to do with the meeting on Friday and how Dr. Bale had laid everything out. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how Jase was going to make things work, because after Ollie had passed out and Jase was more drunk than an entire frat, he started talking, and well, I didn\u2019t know how to help him.</p><p>And I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the girl a few doors down.</p><p>Shortcake had turned me down.</p><p>I grinned, thinking of how I was going to turn that no into a yes.</p><p>Pivoting around, I reached for the fridge and came to a stop. Was that it? The challenge? From the moment I met Avery, she was running from me, and females ran toward me.</p><p>But what I said to her last night about why I wanted to go out on a date was true. Avery did interest me. She wasn\u2019t like the girls I hung out with\u2014the well put together, coy and flirtatious ones. Not that anything was wrong with them, but Avery was different. She made me laugh. Maybe not on purpose, but I loved watching her flush over the simplest things, and when she smiled?</p><p>Shortcake shone brighter than any chick I knew.</p><p>Perhaps it was all that, combined with the challenge. I really didn\u2019t know, and at that moment, as I opened the fridge and grabbed some eggs, I really didn\u2019t care.</p><p>I liked her.</p><p>And I wasn\u2019t sleeping anytime soon, so why should the object of my current restlessness be sleeping in on a Sunday morning?</p><p>The moment the idea sprung to mind, I didn\u2019t even think twice. Shortcake probably wasn\u2019t going to be happy with the plan, but no one\u2014not even her\u2014could resist my banana-nut bread.</p><p>Gathering up my items, I strolled toward the front door. There, I heard Ollie mumble, \u201cNo tomatoes. Extra bacon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the?\u201d I looked over my shoulder at him. He was still on his stomach, his check plastered to a throw pillow my mom had given me, dead to the world. \u201cFreak,\u201d I muttered, slipping out of the apartment.</p><p>At Avery\u2019s door, I knocked softly at first, not wanting to wake the neighbors, but when a full minute passed and I hadn\u2019t heard footsteps, I knocked hard and kept knocking.</p><p>After what felt like an eternity of me banging on her door like the police and turning around to make sure I didn\u2019t have anyone seconds away from shooting my ass, I finally heard footsteps and then the door swung open.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d she asked in what was possibly the sexiest voice I\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>I spun back to the door, getting an eyeful of a bedraggled Avery.</p><p>Coppery hair hung in loose tangles, flowing down her shoulders and grazing the golden skin of her arms. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever seen her in a short-sleeve shirt before. My gaze, all on its own, traveled sideways and stopped, devouring the way the thin shirt she wore stretched across the swell of her breasts. With a will I didn\u2019t know I possessed, I forced my eyes to her flushed face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly unsure of what the hell I was doing, I offered a crooked smile and said to hell with it. \u201cNo, but it will be in about fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-w-what?\u201d She moved out of the way as I slipped past her. All the apartments were the same, so I knew where the kitchen was, but I did a quick scan of the living room. The furnishings looked new\u2014the couch and dark end tables. A black moon chair sat beside a TV. No pictures hung on the walls. The moon chair was possibly the most personal thing in the room.</p><p>\u201cCam, what are you doing? It\u2019s eight in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the update on the time. It\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve never been able to master: the telling of time.\u201d</p> <p>She trailed after me, and I could feel her staring daggers in my back. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that in your own kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy kitchen isn\u2019t as exciting as yours.\u201d I placed the eggs and bread on the counter and faced her. Scrubbing her eyes, she looked so damn cute, and I wished I was wearing something more decent than sweats and a shirt I wasn\u2019t even sure was clean. \u201cAnd Ollie is passed out on the living-room floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the floor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. Facedown, snoring and drooling a little. It\u2019s not an appetizing atmosphere.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched into a quick smile and then quickly disappeared. \u201cWell, neither is my apartment.\u201d</p><p>I folded my arms as I leaned against the counter. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that . . .\u201d I let my gaze wander the exquisite length of hers. Her nipples were hard, pressing against her shirt, begging to be touched, licked, and kissed and God knows what else I would do to them. Lust slammed into my gut and I almost took a step toward her. \u201cYour kitchen, right this second, is very appetizing.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. \u201cI\u2019m not going out with you, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you at this moment, now did I?\u201d I grinned. \u201cBut you will eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re delusional.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m determined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like annoying,\u201d she retorted, brown eyes twinkling.</p><p>\u201cMost would say amazing.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cOnly in your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn many heads is what you meant.\u201d I turned to the stove. \u201cI also brought banana-nut bread baked in my very own oven.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cI\u2019m allergic to bananas.\u201d</p><p>I wheeled around. \u201cAre you shitting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m allergic to bananas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMan, that\u2019s a damn shame. You have no idea what you\u2019re missing out on. Bananas make the world a better place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Well damn. Apparently she could resist my banana-nut bread. \u201cAnything else you\u2019re allergic to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides penicillin and guys who bust up into my apartment? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardy-har-har.\u201d I turned and bent, opening the nearest cabinets. \u201cHow many weaker, less-assured guys have you slayed with that tongue of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not enough.\u201d Her gasp was audible. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea what she was up to, but I doubted she\u2019d leave the apartment. Humming under my breath, I found a pot to boil eggs in and filled it with water. Plopping it on the stove, I cranked up the heat. I could hear her back in her bedroom, her soft footfalls, heavier than I thought they\u2019d be. A couple of moments went by and I turned to the doorway. It was quite possible that she would lock herself in her room.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>\u201cHey! Are you hiding back there?\u201d I yelled. \u201cBecause I will come back there and drag you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare come in here!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>I laughed softly. As appealing as seeing firsthand what she was doing was, I didn\u2019t want to end up in the hospital for doing so. \u201cThen hurry up. My eggs wait for no one.\u201d</p><p>By the time she returned, I found shredded cheese and had decided she was going to eat hers sunny side up. I didn\u2019t say anything even though I knew she was there, staring at me.</p><p>\u201cCam, why are you over here?\u201d she finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI already told you.\u201d I eased the eggs onto a plate and walked it over to the small table pressed up against the wall. \u201cDo you want toast? Wait. Do you have bread? If not, I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t need toast.\u201d She watched me, eyes wide. \u201cDon\u2019t you have anyone else to bother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a shit ton of people that I could reward with my presence, but I chose you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth moved, but there was no sound and then she spun around, hopping up on the chair, pulling her knees to her chest as she picked up a fork. \u201cThanks,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>I raised my brows. \u201cI choose to believe that you mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d</p><p>I turned back to the stove. \u201cI doubt that for some reason.\u201d</p><p>There were several seconds of silence and then. \u201cI do appreciate the eggs. I\u2019m just surprised to see you here . . . at eight in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Waiting for my eggs to finish boiling, I found myself watching her. \u201cWell, to be honest, I was planning to woo you with my banana-nut bread, but that shit ain\u2019t happening now. So all I have left are my delicious eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is really good, but you\u2019re not wooing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m wooing.\u201d I went to her fridge and found some OJ. Grabbing two glasses, I poured some sweetness and sat one in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s just all about the stealth. You don\u2019t realize it yet.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her gaze to her plate. \u201cAren\u2019t you eating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I like boiled eggs.\u201d Sitting across from her, I rested my chin in my palm. Her hair fell forward, nearing hitting the plate. She kept batting the strands away. She was so fucking cute. \u201cSo, Avery Morgansten, I\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes swept up. \u201cI don\u2019t want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. Tell me about yourself.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake pressed her lips into a thin line. \u201cDo you do this often? Just walk into random girls\u2019 apartments and make eggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not random, so technically no.\u201d Pushing up, I checked the eggs. \u201cAnd I might be known to surprise lucky ladies every now and then.\u201d</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t exactly true. I mean, if I somehow found myself in someone else\u2019s place and I was up, I\u2019d make breakfast, but this? This was a first. But she didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? I mean, you do this normally?\u201d</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder. \u201cWith friends, yes, and we\u2019re friends, aren\u2019t we, Avery?\u201d</p><p>She studied me for a few moments and then placed her fork down. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally!\u201d I shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve finally admitted that we are friends. It\u2019s only taken a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only known each other for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill took a week.\u201d</p><p>As I started devouring my eggs, she questioned me on how long it took for me to declare best-friend status. Sitting back at the table, I met her curious stare. \u201cIt usually takes me about five minutes before we\u2019ve moved on to best-friend status.\u201d</p><p>A tiny smile appeared on her lips. \u201cThen I guess I\u2019m just the odd one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s different for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d I peeled the last piece of shell off the egg.</p><p>\u201cI bet you have girls hanging all over you. Dozens would probably kill to be in my spot and here I am, allergic to your bread.\u201d</p><p>I looked up. \u201cWhy? Because of my near godlike perfection?\u201d</p><p>She laughed outright, and that goddamn knot was back in my chest. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, I chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t really think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think about it at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I popped the egg in my mouth and then wiped my hands on a napkin. \u201cI only think about it when it matters.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze bounced off of mine as she toyed with her glass. \u201cSo you\u2019re a reformed player?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you were quite the player in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Who did you hear that from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. Her tongue was sharp as a blade. \u201cWith that mouth of yours, you don\u2019t have a lot of friends, do you?\u201d</p><p>Shortcake flinched. \u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t really popular in high school.\u201d</p><p>Aw fuck, now I felt like a dick. I dropped my egg onto the plate. \u201cShit. I\u2019m sorry. That was an asshole thing for me to say.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>I watched her as I picked up the egg and peeled it, unable to figure her out. \u201cHard to believe though that you weren\u2019t. You can be funny and nice when you\u2019re not insulting me and you\u2019re a pretty girl. Actually, you\u2019re really hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . . thanks.\u201d She wiggled in her seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. You said your parents were strict. They didn\u2019t let you hang out in high school?\u201d I popped the other egg in. Needed my protein. \u201cI still can\u2019t imagine you not being popular in high school. You rock the trifecta\u2014smart, funny, and hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. Okay?\u201d Sitting the glass down, she started fiddling with the hem on her shorts. \u201cI was like the very opposite of popular.\u201d</p><p>Unsure of what to think about that comment, I peeled the third egg. I\u2019d seen her around campus with a girl I went to high school with and Jacob Massey. It wasn\u2019t like she was incapable of making friends. \u201cI am sorry, Avery. That . . . that sucks. High school is a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. You had a lot of friends?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I had a busload of friends.</p><p>\u201cStill talk to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them. Ollie and I went to high school together, but he spent his first two years at WVU and transferred down here and I see a few around campus and back home.\u201d</p><p>She huddled in on herself, looking incredibly small. \u201cHave any brothers or sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sister.\u201d I went for the final egg, smiling. \u201cShe\u2019s younger than me. Just turned eighteen. She graduates this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re close.\u201d I liked that she was asking me questions, but talking about my sister made me think of other things. \u201cShe means a lot to me. How about you? A big brother I have to worry about visiting and kicking my ass for being here?\u201d</p><p>One side of her lips curved up. \u201cNo. I\u2019m an only child. Have a cousin who\u2019s older, but I doubt he\u2019d do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, good.\u201d I finished off the last egg, leaned back and patted my stomach. \u201cWhere you from?\u201d When she didn\u2019t answer, I decided I was so not letting this go. I wanted to know her. Exchange of information was necessary. \u201cOkay. You obviously know where I\u2019m from if you\u2019ve heard of my extracurricular activities in high school, but I\u2019ll just confirm it. I\u2019m from the Fort Hill area. Never heard of that? Well, most people haven\u2019t. It\u2019s near Morgantown. Why didn\u2019t I go to WVU? Everyone wants to know that. Just wanted to get away, but be somewhat close to my family. And yes, I was . . . very busy in high school.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on who you ask.\u201d I laughed. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know.

I probably put more effort into them than I did my classes.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cBut not now?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and went back to what I wanted to know. \u201cSo where are you from?\u201d</p> <p>Shortcake sighed. \u201cI\u2019m from Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTexas?\u201d I leaned onto the table. \u201cReally? You don\u2019t have an accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t born in Texas. My family was originally from Ohio. We moved to Texas when I was eleven and I never picked up any accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTexas to West Virginia? That\u2019s a hell of a difference.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met mine for a fraction of a second and then she stood, picking up her plate and the bowl. \u201cWell, I lived in the strip-mall-hell part of Texas, but besides that, it\u2019s kind of the same here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI should clean up.\u201d I started to stand. \u201cI made the mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shot me a serious look. \u201cYou cooked. I clean.\u201d</p><p>Watching her take care of the dishes, I couldn\u2019t help but think how intimate this was\u2014me cooking, her cleaning. While I may have cooked some breakfasts for girls before, it had been nothing like this.</p><p>And I really wasn\u2019t sure how to process that.</p><p>Turning to the bread, I peeled the foil back. \u201cWhat made you choose here?\u201d</p><p>She finished washing the little frying pan I\u2019d brought over before answering the question. \u201cI just wanted to get away, like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot to be hard though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was incredibly easy to make the decision.\u201d</p><p>It was? I couldn\u2019t imagine moving that far away from my family. I was pretty sure my mom would hunt me down if I did. I broke the bread in half. \u201cYou are an enigma, Avery Morgansten.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the counter. \u201cNot really. More like you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>She gestured at me and my half-eaten loaf of bread. \u201cYou just ate four hard-boiled eggs, you\u2019re eating half of a loaf, and you have abs that look like they belong on a Bowflex ad.\u201d</p><p>My smile was the size of an earthquake crater. \u201cYou\u2019ve been checking me out, haven\u2019t you? In between your flaming insults? I feel like man candy.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and the sound was soft and sweet. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a growing boy.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose at that, and I laughed. In the following silence, I found myself telling her more than I told most girls I\u2019d known for years. \u201cMy dad is a lawyer, runs his own firm back home. So he probably wanted me to go to law school.\u201d</p><p>She stayed by the counter. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaw is not my thing. Mom\u2019s a doctor\u2014cardiologist\u2014and before you ask, med school also wasn\u2019t my thing.\u201d</p><p>Her right hand went to that bracelet, a nervous habit I was beginning to realize. \u201cAnd sports recreation is your thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoccer is my thing. So if I can get on with a team, helping their players, then I\u2019m happy.\u201d I paused, shifting my weight. \u201cOr I\u2019d love to coach, maybe high school or whatever.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dipped to the floor as she crept forward. She reminded me of a scared animal that had been hurt before and was distrustful of those around her. The knot expanded in my chest and the horrible pricking sensation was back, telling me something I didn\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you play soccer?\u201d she asked.</p><p>And that was a subject I didn\u2019t want to touch, but she was asking questions and there was no way I could shoot her down. \u201cIt\u2019s a long . . . complicated story, but it\u2019s not something I can do right now.\u201d</p><p>She was by the table, hovering near the chair. \u201cWhat about later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater . . . later might work.\u201d And that was true. If I kept in shape, kept up with the game, who knew? It just wasn\u2019t something I allowed myself to think about a lot. \u201cSo you flying back to Texas for fall break or Thanksgiving?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot other plans?\u201d</p><p>Avery shrugged and then started asking me about soccer. Hours had passed and I was sure she was as knowledgeable about soccer as she ever would be. It was near noon when I stood. I didn\u2019t really want to leave, but I had sucked up all her morning.</p><p>Flipping the skillet in one hand and carrying the bread in the other, I stopped in front of her door. \u201cSo, Avery . . .\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the couch. \u201cSo, Cam . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatcha you doing Tuesday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Wariness settled in her brow. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you go out with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a no,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d She moved away from the couch, grabbing the door. \u201cThanks for the eggs.\u201d</p><p>I backed away, undaunted. \u201cHow about Wednesday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Cam.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake closed the door, but not before I saw her smile, and I knew it wouldn\u2019t be too much longer before she said yes.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Apparently I had seriously misjudged how long \u201cmuch longer\u201d really was.</p><p>Days had turned into weeks as summer finally slipped into the past and the leaves on all the oaks turned gold and red. The skies had started to grow darker each day a minute earlier, and the clouds that rolled in and the wind that came off the Potomac warned that winter was right around the corner.</p><p>I asked Avery out at least twice a week. Each time, she said no and each time, I became even more determined. At some point in the middle of astronomy, as she hastily took notes, and I sketched the Winchesters\u2019 Chevy Impala, I recognized that the whole challenge aspect of this chase was no longer really in the equation.</p><p>Glancing over at her as she watched Drage float from one side of the raised platform to the other in his acid-wash jeans, a fond smile split my lips.</p><p>The more time I spent around Avery, the more I wanted to be around her, and all we ever did was talk. Hanging out with a chick, just chilling without any physical fun, was uncharted territory for me. While I\u2019d be down for more, lots more, I was content just being with her. And that was so new to me.</p><p>Each Sunday I showed up at her apartment with eggs and a different type of baked goods, learning pretty quickly that anything chocolate was a win with her. The second time I went over, she was as happy to see me as she had been the first time, but she quickly dropped the act. And it was an act, because the way her brown eyes warmed when she saw me told me what she wasn\u2019t willing to say vocally.</p><p>She was always wary, every single time we were together, but after a little while, she would begin to relax and that was when the real Avery poked her head out.</p><p>Professor Drage paused in his lecture and Shortcake stopped, twisting her right hand at the wrist like she was trying to work a kink out of it.</p><p>Dropping my pen in my lap, I didn\u2019t think about what I was doing. When it came to Shortcake, I rarely did think. Maybe that was a problem.</p><p>Shortcake gasped as I snatched the pen from between her fingers and placed it on her notebook. Her head swung sharply toward me, brows raised. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I murmured, shifting toward her.</p><p>Avery\u2019s chest rose as I curved my hands around her right one. \u201cYou\u2019re doing something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d I pressed my thumbs into her hand, gently running them up the side, over her pinky finger and between.</p><p>Her eyes widened as they darted from our hands to my face. \u201cWhat . . . what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d I whispered, moving my thumbs to her ring finger and then the middle, following the path of delicate bones. \u201cYour hand looked like it was cramped. I\u2019m doing my good deed of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush it.\u201d My finger slipped into the fleshy part between her pointer and thumb, and Avery gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get us in trouble.\u201d</p><p>A pink stain bled across her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re the one touching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re the one making noise.\u201d</p><p>She snapped her mouth shut as I turned her hand over, working her palm. She took a deep breath and then eased back in the seat, her arm and body not so rigid. I watched her from under my lashes and when she sucked her bottom lip between her teeth, the action sent a jolt straight through me. My cock jumped, and I suddenly realized what I was doing wasn\u2019t a very good idea. Nothing more awkward than having a hard-on during class.</p><p>But her skin warmed under mine, smooth and soft as satin, and David Beckham could kick a soccer ball off the side of my head, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop.</p><p>My hands wandered up to her wrist, slipping under the sleeve of her light sweater. Her skin was even softer there, the thin blue vein forming a delicate line I wanted to trace with my lips and then my tongue.</p><p>God, I wanted to taste her skin. My jeans felt like they had shrunk about three sizes in the crotch. There was no mistaking that I was attracted to her, but sometimes, like right now, it was almost painful. I wondered if I could kiss her\u2014if anyone would notice if I brought her hand to my lips? We were far enough in the back that Drage would have no clue what we were doing, even if I did kiss her . . . or slipped a hand between those pretty thighs.</p><p>But something . . . that fucking prickling sensation along the nape of my neck held me back. Having no idea where I developed this level of self-control, I made myself put her hand down and lean back before I did anything stupid. And right now, I was capable of a whole lot of stupid. Several seconds passed as I forced my breathing to slow and before I could look at her.</p><p>Shortcake was staring at me, her eyes a wealth of secrets. Our gazes locked and something infinite passed between us, a spark I swore I could almost see with my eyes.</p><p>God, I sounded like a vagina.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, a bit breathlessly as she picked up her pen.</p><p>Sliding down in my seat, I spread my thighs, hoping to ease the ache, but I imagined I\u2019d be walking over to the Butcher Center with a major hard-on. \u201cAvery?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d she responded back, equally low.</p><p>\u201cGo out with me.\u201d</p><p>Her throat worked on a swallow and her lips twitched into a small smile. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Tipping my head against the back of the seat, I grinned.</p><p>On Wednesday, I was supposed to be in Principles of Sports Nutrition, along with Ollie and Jase, but I didn\u2019t feel like walking my ass all the way over to the Butcher Center. If I drove, I\u2019d lose my parking spot and that would be a real bitch.</p><p>And I was outside of the Den, which coincidentally was around the time Avery ate lunch with her friends. Not that my presence had anything to do with Shortcake.</p><p>Oh, who the fuck was I kidding? I knew exactly why my lily-white ass was standing out in front of the Den. I started up the stairs when the doors to the bookstore opened.</p><p>\u201cCam!\u201d</p><p>I started at the shrill cry, turning to see Susan and Sally. Or were they Molly and Mary? I had no idea. The two looked identical to me. One had platinum-blonde hair, the other light brown with platinum streaks. Both were tan. Both had rocking tight bodies, and I think I might have made out with one of them at some point. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or both.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cWhat are you two up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d replied the \u00fcberblonde. She bounced up the stairs, closely followed by her friend. It was then when I realized she was Susan, which meant the other had to be Sally. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike for-ever,\u201d Sally reiterated. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been at any of the parties recently.\u201d</p> <p>That much was true. It had been weeks, if not months, since I\u2019d attended any of the parties being thrown at the frats. I started back up the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>Susan pouted as she flicked her hair over her shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s no fun. Everyone misses you.\u201d</p><p>I wondered who everyone was as I crossed the balcony and opened the blue-and-gold double doors, heading into the Den. \u201cHave I been missing a lot of fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot.\u201d Susan somehow ended up in front of me, and we were stopped in front of the couches crowding the TV. She placed her hand on my chest as my gaze moved beyond her, flickering over the rows of tables. \u201cI\u2019m sure we could get you caught up, Sally and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d The top of a coppery head came into view, and I recognized the dark-skinned boy sitting across from her. The girls said something else, but I wasn\u2019t paying attention. Stepping back, I smiled at the girls. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve got to run. See you guys later.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t wait for a response, slipping away and cutting in front of a group of people heading out into the autumn sun. A wide smile broke out across Jacob\u2019s face as he spotted me. He said something to Shortcake, and her shoulders tensed. I wasn\u2019t surprised. I expected this. Every time we got together, we had to start over. Even I was amazed by my patience when it came to her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cameron!\u201d Jacob said, awfully cheerful. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Jacob. Brittany.\u201d I took the seat next to Shortcake and nudged her arm. \u201cAvery.\u201d</p><p>She murmured hello and then asked, \u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know, mischief and mayhem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat so reminds me of Harry Potter,\u201d Brit said, smiling faintly. \u201cI need a reread.\u201d</p> <p>All eyes turned on her.</p><p>Red bloomed across her cheeks as she ran her hand through her hair. I didn\u2019t know Brittany very well, but knew she had gone to my high school and seemed pretty cool. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed to admit that random things remind me of Harry Potter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat guy over there reminds me of Snape.\u201d I tipped my chin at the table behind us. \u201cSo I understand.\u201d</p><p>A thankful smile crossed Brittany\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, what are you guys doing?\u201d I shifted so that my leg pressed against Shortcake\u2019s. \u201cPlaying with M&amp;M\u2019s and Skittles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that and we\u2019re studying for our history midterm next week. We have to map out Europe,\u201d Jacob explained.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d I knocked my leg into hers.</p><p>She returned the favor.</p> <p>\u201cBut Avery, wonderful, Avery . . .\u201d Jacob\u2019s grin spread as Shortcake\u2019s glare increased. \u201cShe\u2019s been helping us study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she has.\u201d Brittany exchanged a look with Jacob, and my interest peaked.</p><p>Jacob leaned forward, resting his chin in his hand. \u201cBefore we started studying, I was telling Avery that she should wear the color green more often. It makes her sexy with that hair of hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like the color green on her, Cam?\u201d Brit asked.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t noticed what she was wearing, but I turned to her, my gaze slipping over the green sweater. \u201cThe color looks great on her, but she looks beautiful every day.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake flushed as she exhaled.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful?\u201d Brit sighed.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d I repeated, nudging her knee again. \u201cSo did you guys learn anything from studying?\u201d</p><p>Shortcake said, \u201cI think we got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of you.\u201d Jacob shared another look with Brittany. \u201cAvery came up with this song to help me remember where the countries were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSing him your song.\u201d Brittany elbowed her, causing her to bounce into me.</p><p>\u201cWhat song?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI am not singing that song again.\u201d</p><p>Jacob smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s the Croatia song.\u201d</p><p>The look on Avery\u2019s face could kill.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cThe Croatia song? What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not singing again. That is so not my talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of talents do you have?\u201d I asked, and she looked at me, her eyes impossibly large. \u201cAvery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo tell,\u201d Jacob coaxed.</p><p>Brit jumped. \u201cTalents are fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can be.\u201d I was thinking about all the talents I had that I was more than willing to share with her as I bent my head. There was only a mere inch or two between our mouths, and her soft sigh trilled through my blood. \u201cTell me what your talents are, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Jacob murmured, sighing.</p><p>\u201cDancing,\u201d she said. \u201cI danced. I used to dance.\u201d</p><p>Curiosity poured into me. What were the chances? \u201cWhat kind of dancing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She grabbed the package of Skittles, dumping them into her palm. \u201cBallet, jazz, tap, contemporary\u2014that kind of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d Jacob\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cI did tap when I was like six, for about a month, and then decided I wanted to be a fireman or something like that. That shit was hard.\u201d</p><p>Brit snickered. \u201cI tried dance and discovered I had no coordination or grace beyond shaking my ass. Were you any good at it?\u201d</p><p>Shortcake shrugged, her gaze fastened to the pieces of candy. \u201cI took classes for about ten years, did some competitions and a lot of recitals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you were good!\u201d Brit exclaimed. \u201cI bet you did all those crazy turns and tricks.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe it as I stared at her. She was a dancer. I never would\u2019ve thought it, because all the dancers I knew were overflowing with confidence, but it explained the lean muscle I had spied in her legs, the kind of tone that never really went away.</p><p>\u201cMy sister did dance since she was around five,\u201d I told her, somewhat amazed. \u201cStill does. I think she\u2019d cut someone if they made her stop.\u201d</p><p>She finished off the Skittles, nodding. \u201cDancing can be addictive if you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr are good at it,\u201d Brit interjected.</p><p>I bumped her shoulder with mine, drawing her attention. For her to be dancing for that many years, I was surprised that she talked about it in the past tense. \u201cWhy\u2019d you stop?\u201d</p><p>A far-off look appeared in her stare, and I knew that where she was at that moment, it wasn\u2019t in the present. I\u2019d seen that look creep over her a lot and I always wondered where she went in those moments.</p><p>Finally, she shrugged again as she went for the M&amp;M\u2019s. \u201cI guess I got tired of it. Does your sister do competitions?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t believe her. Not one bit. Dancing was in the blood, but I didn\u2019t press it. Not right now. \u201cShe\u2019s traveled all over and spent the summer at the Joffrey Ballet School on a scholarship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Her mouth dropped. \u201cShe must be damn good.\u201d</p><p>Full of pride, I smiled. \u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>Avery smiled up at me, but as the minutes ticked by, that smile faded as her gaze drifted to the empty pack of candy. She really didn\u2019t say anything after that, no matter how hard her friends and I tried to lull her into conversation. Something was up with her and I knew it had to do with where she went when she got quiet.</p><p>When she got up to leave, I said good-bye and followed her out into the cool breeze and bright sun. I was quiet as we headed up the hill, unsure of how to approach her. Although there was a lot I had discovered about Avery, there was still so much I didn\u2019t know. She kept her past and her thoughts close to her.</p><p>Someone yelled my name over by the Byrd Center, and I waved absently as we crossed the street.</p><p>We stopped by the empty benches in front of Knutti, and I took a deep breath. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Tipping her chin up, she squinted. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Are you?\u201d</p><p>Not feeling the smile on my face, I nodded. \u201cWe still on for tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night? Oh! The astronomy assignment. Yeah, it works for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I backed away, knowing I needed to get my ass to class. \u201cSee you then.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake turned and then pivoted back to me. \u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>The knot pulsed in my chest. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>She fiddled with her bracelet as her gaze flicked away before settling back on me. \u201cWhat were you doing in the Den? Don\u2019t you normally have class, like right now?\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I held her gaze. \u201cYeah, I normally have class right now, but I wanted to see you.\u201d</p><p>Shock splashed over her face, and then I saw the smile light up her eyes before it even hit her lips. Feeling that knot do a funny, twisting thing, I pivoted around before I grabbed her and kissed her.</p><p>Because I was really close to doing that.</p><p>I made it across the street before a low whistle caught my attention. Looking toward the left, I saw Jase standing under a tree, cell phone in hand. Damn. He must\u2019ve hightailed his ass from West Campus.</p><p>\u201cSkipping class without me?\u201d he asked as I made my way over to him, his eyes obscured by the aviator shades he was wearing. Very few people could pull off those sunglasses without looking like a douche. I was not one of them.</p><p>I shrugged as my attention drifted beyond Jase\u2019s shoulder, across the street, catching one last glimpse of Shortcake disappearing through the doors of Knutti Hall.</p><p>Jase sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re obsessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>He nodded toward Knutti. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever skipped a class to hang out with a girl before.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cHow do you know I skipped a class to hang out with Avery?\u201d</p><p>His brows rose above the sunglasses. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s up for debate.\u201d</p><p>Jase flipped me off. \u201cWell, let\u2019s see. Class let out early, so I came over here just in time to see you walking along like a good little boy. I called your name. You waved at me and kept going\u2014or staring at her.\u201d</p><p>My brows lifted as I wheeled around, heading for the doors. \u201cThat was you yelling my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he said, sighing. He looked at me, and all I saw was my face in his sunglasses. \u201cHas she agreed to go out with you yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Jase shook his head. \u201cMan, you are so fucked when it comes to this girl.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>\u201cApple pie for you.\u201d I handed the small treat over to Avery and then dug the other one out of the McDonald\u2019s bag. \u201cAnd apple pie for me.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake peeled open the box. \u201cDo you think they use real apples?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I don\u2019t really want to know.\u201d I bit into the crust, groaning at the sweetness. \u201cAh, this shit is so good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes settled on me. \u201cI swear. Every time you eat something, you sound like you\u2019re about to have an orgasm.\u201d She flushed as she said that. \u201cOr whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you know what I sound like when I come.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose as she picked a section of the crust off. \u201cThat is something I\u2019ve been dying to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew it.\u201d</p> <p>Shortcake laughed and then popped the crust in her mouth. \u201cYou are terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfect.\u201d I fixed my gaze out the windshield. We were sitting in the parking lot behind the science building. The dark blue of the sky was quickly turning to night, but the thick clouds rolling in looked ominous. \u201cWe should\u2019ve probably picked a different night to do this.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the bag and scraped off all the sliced apples into it, leaving the bottom crust cleared.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a waste.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were warm as she cast me a side look. \u201cYou want to dig them out of the bag and eat them? You sound like you have a couple more good groans left in you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSweetheart, you haven\u2019t heard anything . . .\u201d I paused, winking at her. \u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cMore like never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the lady protest too much, methinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dork.\u201d Shortcake laughed, and the sound was light. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018the lady doth protest too much, methinks.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I reached over, brushing the thick strands of hair back from her shoulder. She didn\u2019t flinch away, which was huge progress. \u201cThe fact that you can correct that is further proof.\u201d</p><p>Another laugh bubbled up from her as she wiped her fingers cleaned. \u201cWhatever. You ready?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeen ready, but you had to stop and get an apple pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She flipped in the seat toward me. \u201cThat was your idea.\u201d</p><p>I blinked innocently. \u201cThat is not how I recollect the past twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>She pinned me with a dry look.</p><p>\u201cYou were all like \u2018I need an apple pie\u2019 and what could I do? I live to serve you.\u201d</p><p>Rolling up the bag, she tossed it at me, but I caught it. \u201cActually, it was you saying something like \u2018I need food in my belly.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cThat is not how I recall this little adventure.\u201d</p><p>She smacked my arm and as she pulled back, I caught her hand. Her lips parted as I lifted her hand, pressing a quick, completely 100-percent chaste kiss on the center of her palm. \u201cReady?\u201d</p> <p>Eyes wide, she pulled her hand back to her chest and nodded. As we climbed out of the truck and headed into the building, she was flushed. The pretty pink made me want to chase it with my lips, but then she slipped in front of me.</p><p>Not that I was complaining.</p><p>I watched the sweet sway of Avery\u2019s ass as she climbed the stairwell in front of me and by the time we reached the rooftop and were standing in front of the Philips telescope, I was throbbing between my legs.</p><p>This was getting ridiculous.</p><p>It had been months since I\u2019d gotten off with anything except my hand, and I knew Jase would tell me to go screw someone else to just get off, but I couldn\u2019t even think of anyone else besides Avery.</p><p>Jase had been right yesterday.</p><p>I was so fucked when it came to her, and not in the way I wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you know how to use this thing?\u201d she asked, head tilted to the side.</p><p>Moving in front of her, I shot her a look. \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you paying attention in class when Drage went over this and the imaging cameras?\u201d</p><p>She popped a hip out as she folded her arms. \u201cYou were drawing the cast of Duck Dynasty when he was going over that.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, pleased because that was exactly what I had been doing when Drage went over how to operate the telescope. Which meant Shortcake was paying a hell of a lot of attention to me. I adjusted the controls. \u201cI was listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d She shifted closer as the wind picked up, whirling across the roof, picking up strands of her hair and whipping it back from her face. Christ, she looked beautiful standing there. I shook my head, focusing on the telescope again, but it was hard\u2014I was hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually a pretty good artist,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound that wasn\u2019t exactly friendly.</p><p>I shifted the lever. \u201cI\u2019ve used a telescope a time or two in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s random.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I used it when I had the class previously.\u201d I flashed her a quick grin, then checked the positioning of the scope. \u201cMan, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to be able to get anything before those clouds roll in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you better hurry then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake grinned.</p><p>\u201cCome over here and I\u2019ll show you how to use this.\u201d Giving her just enough space to get in, I bit the inside of my cheek as her hip brushed mine, coming fucking close to where I literally ached. \u201cAre you going to pay attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She was still smiling.</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019re honest.\u201d I was into self-torture. That was the only excuse to why I leaned in, caging her with my arms. Her scent, that heavenly mixture of berries and musk, caused a lot of my body parts to twitch. I vaguely realized that she hadn\u2019t stiffened. That was good.</p><p>\u201cThis is a Philips ToUcam Pro II.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cIt hooks to the telescope. At these settings, you should be able to get a clear image of Saturn. Press this and it will capture an image.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She tucked the sides of her hair back behind her ears. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re supposed to be getting an image of Saturn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d What the fuck was Saturn? All I could think about was how close we were, how I could feel the warmth rolling off her body. I didn\u2019t even know why were on the roof. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>She tipped her head back, causing the edges of her hair to glide over my cheek. My pulse pounded as I imagined that hair sliding over other parts of my body. \u201cHey what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo out with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d A grin appeared as she leaned forward, peering into the telescope. Her body brushed mine again, and I bit back a groan. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><p>My laugh sounded strangled. \u201cThat\u2019s because I haven\u2019t taken the lens cap off.\u201d</p><p>She elbowed me in the stomach, which made me laugh again. \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>I was pushing the boundaries tonight. Didn\u2019t even know why, but I couldn\u2019t stop myself as I reached for the lens, pressing against her back. She stilled then, and her soft inhale rattled through me. I waited for her to move away, because she could if she wanted to, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>I glanced down at her and saw that her thick lashes fanned her cheeks. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve been easier for you to just go to the side and do that,\u201d she said, her voice different, heavier.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I bent so that my mouth was beside her ear. \u201cBut what fun would that be?\u201d</p><p>Avery shivered, and my entire body tensed. \u201cGo have fun by yourself.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea how often that was the case. \u201cWell, that\u2019s really no fun.\u201d I paused, not moving. \u201cTry it again.\u201d</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, she then leaned forward, pressing her eye to the telescope. A couple of seconds passed. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see it?\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s pretty cool. I\u2019ve never really seen a planet in real life. I mean, like taken the time to do so. It\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too.\u201d I snatched a few strands of her hair, stopping them from hitting me in the eye. \u201cWhat are we supposed to be looking at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSagittarius and then the Teapot asterism and its steam, whatever\u2014\u201dA nasty, cold raindrop splattered off her forehead and she jerked back against my chest. \u201cOh crap.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake squeaked as another drop came down and she whirled, her eyes meeting mine. We were about to get soaked to the bone. Swearing under my breath, I grabbed her hand, pulling her across the roof. We were almost to dry land when the sky ripped open and freezing rain drenched us.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she shrieked. \u201cIt\u2019s so freaking cold!\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I stopped and spun around, hauling her against my chest. There was a brief second when her wide eyes met mine as rain poured down on us. My smile was my only warning.</p><p>I wrapped an arm around her slim waist as I dipped, lifting her off her feet and tossing her over my shoulder. Her surprised squeal caused me to laugh, and this balloon-like pressure\u2014it was the only way I could explain it\u2014expanded in my chest and it felt good, like scoring a goal.</p><p>\u201cYou were running too slow!\u201d</p><p>Her fingers dug into the back of my sweater. \u201cPut me down, you son of a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on!\u201d I clamped my arm over her hips and took off.</p><p>Slipping in the deep puddles, we almost ate cement as I slid across the roof. The words that were coming out of her mouth, directed at me, would\u2019ve burned the ears off of soldiers.</p><p>I skidded to a stop and yanked open the door, bending down as we escaped the rain. Turning so she wasn\u2019t facing the wall, I grabbed her hips and lowered her down.</p><p>Sharp need punched right through me as her body slid down my front. My hands tightened on her hips and she tipped her head back. Her eyes darkened to a deep chocolate brown, and my brain clicked off as I somehow tugged her closer. I knew she had to feel my arousal, and considering we hadn\u2019t even kissed, something about that seemed wrong, but I couldn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>Her hands pressed against my chest, and I thought she was going to push me away, and swore to God right then and there, no matter how hard it would be, I would let her go if she did.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Avery\u2019s hands flattened against my chest, above my pounding heart, and she had to have felt it.</p><p>My hand moved on its own accord, curving up her waist and then over her arm, to her throat and then her cheek. She gasped when my fingertips grazed her cheeks, catching the hair stuck to her temples. I tucked the strands back behind her ears, my hand lingering.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re soaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>I smoothed my thumb over the slant of her cheek. \u201cI guess we\u2019re going to have to try this another night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she whispered as her eyes flickered shut and then swept back open.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should\u2019ve checked the weather first.\u201d When she smiled, I shifted my hips in response. Her body shuddered in such a mind-blowing way and her lashes lowered. Her lips parted even further, and I didn\u2019t want to let her go. She felt too good this close.</p><p>Her chest rose in short, deep breaths as I lowered my head, wanting and needing to kiss her. Just once. That\u2019s all I wanted. My eyes started to drift closed.</p><p>Avery suddenly jerked back, pressing a hand between her breasts. \u201cI think we . . . we should call it a night.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I couldn\u2019t move and then leaned back, tipping my head against the wall. It took a couple of moments before I could speak. \u201cYeah, we should.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The trip out of the building and back to the apartment wasn\u2019t easy. I was still strung tight as a bow. Nothing seemed to make the raw edge go away. I tried reciting the alphabet backwards, tried thinking about the old lady who lived in the building nearby, who sometimes walked her dog in a white nightgown. The sight was not pretty, but it still didn\u2019t work.</p><p>The rain was still coming down as we dashed across the parking lot and under the awning. I shook my head, spraying water everywhere. Avery stopped at the base of the stairwell leading up to our apartments, and I thought it was all the rain I\u2019d just pelted her with. I opened my mouth to apologize, but she turned sideways, her face pale as she peered up at me.</p><p>A very different kind of ache sliced through my chest, stirring up that knot in there, at the stark confusion and fear in her eyes. Fear. I didn\u2019t get it. Had I done that to her? No. I couldn\u2019t believe that. Not the way she had reacted to me. I saw it in her eyes. She had wanted me to kiss her, probably even as badly as I wanted to kiss her, but she had pulled away because . . . I honestly didn\u2019t know.</p><p>I thrust my hand through my hair, pulling it off my forehead. \u201cGo out with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I grinned slightly, and her chest fell, her shoulders relaxed, as if she needed to hear this. \u201cThere\u2019s always tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She followed me up the stairs. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s not going to change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to see. You\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen it concerns you, it\u2019s never a waste of my time.\u201d</p><p>And that was the damn truth.</p><p>Ten</p><p>The Wednesday before fall break, I skipped nutrition again and searched Avery out, finding her where she always was during this class: in the Den with Brittany and Jacob. It was a good thing that I had. I discovered three important things.</p><p>Shortcake was talking about me to her friends, because they knew that I had been asking her out. Score for that.</p><p>And she also compared me to a serial killer.</p> <p>Not that I was offended, but it wasn\u2019t every day that one found himself mentioned in the same sentence as Ted Bundy.</p><p>But her friends totally supported a date. I liked them.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Brittany was saying, her eyes glimmering with amusement as she stared at a blood-red, absolutely mortified Avery. \u201cThis is not about me and my vast knowledge of serial killers. I can wow you later about that. This is about you, Avery. This fine young gentleman, who is not a serial killer, is asking you out. You\u2019re single. You\u2019re young. You should say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d She moaned, planting her hands against her face. \u201cIs it time for all of you to go home yet?\u201d</p><p>I laughed deeply. \u201cGo out with me, Avery.\u201d</p><p>She turned to me, somewhat surprised-looking. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d I addressed Brittany and Jacob. \u201cKeeps turning me down.\u201d</p><p>Jacob looked dumbfounded. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot, Avery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d She stood, grabbing her bag. \u201cI\u2019m going to class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe love you!\u201d Jacob shouted.</p><p>She muttered, \u201cUh-huh,\u201d but stopped to say good-bye. Fall break kicked off tomorrow and they were going home. I was still surprised that Avery was remaining behind. Traveling to Texas was a hell of trip for four days, but she could\u2019ve gone home with one of them. Admittedly, I didn\u2019t like the idea of her being alone here.</p><p>I waited until she was done and then followed her across the Den. She arched a brow at me. \u201cFollowing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a true serial killer,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cYou know we weren\u2019t being serious, right? And I\u2019m sorry about saying something to them about it. They just started pestering me about you and the next thing I know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I dropped my arm over her shoulders, steering her toward the cluster of trees outside of the building. It was chilly and she hunkered down, pressing closer, whether she realized it or not. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. Maybe it should bother me that there was now an audience to my repeated rejection, but it just didn\u2019t. I glanced down at her and smiled. Her attention was focused on one of the blue vans that were always on campus.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She looked up at me.</p><p>I lowered my arm, catching a strand of hair blowing across her face and tucking it behind her ear. Ever since the night on the roof of Byrd, I took every freaking opportunity to touch her and she let me. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing important.\u201d She smiled absently. It wasn\u2019t a huge smile, but she was smiling more. \u201cYou going home this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d I moved closer, gathering up her hair and separating it into two long sections. I smiled, thinking she looked cute like that. \u201cI\u2019m leaving tomorrow morning, bright and early. I\u2019m not coming back until Sunday night. So, no eggs for you this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoo.\u201d Her face fell a little.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry too much about it.\u201d I brushed the ends of her hair across her cheek and tried again with her doing something this weekend instead of being alone. \u201cAre you going to take Brit up on her offer and go home with her?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head no. \u201cI\u2019m just going to hang out here and get some reading done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNerd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerk.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I spread her hair over her shoulders. \u201cYou know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I stepped back and shoved my hands into the pockets of my jeans. \u201cYou should go out with me tonight since I\u2019ll be gone all weekend.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not going out with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen hang out with me.\u201d</p><p>Her brow puckered. \u201cHow\u2019s that any different from going out with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is me asking you to hang out with me tonight any different than us hanging out on Sunday?\u201d</p><p>The knit between her brows started to fade. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged casually, but my heart was pounding like a drum. \u201cOrder some food in and watch a movie.\u201d</p><p>She shifted her weight, wary. \u201cThat sounds like a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a date with me, sweetheart.\u201d I laughed. \u201cI\u2019d take you out, like out in public. This is just two friends hanging out, watching a movie and eating food.\u201d</p><p>Her lips formed a tight line as she looked away. Several moments passed, and I steeled myself for yet another rejection. For some reason, if she said no to this, it would sting worse than the others. I didn\u2019t know why, but if I couldn\u2019t get her to do this, I was really going to have to reevaluate what the hell I was doing.</p><p>Shortcake sighed. \u201cYeah, sure. Come over.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit? She said yes? I had to force myself to play cool, because I was about to fist pump the sky or some shit. \u201cWow. Calm down before you get too excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am excited.\u201d She playfully shoved my shoulder. \u201cWhen are you coming over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s seven?\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she fiddled with her bracelet. \u201cWorks for me. See you then.\u201d</p><p>I let her get to the sidewalk before I stopped her. \u201cAvery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d she replied, turning.</p><p>My lips curved up as a bolt of nervous energy rolled through me. \u201cSee you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spending a lot of time with this girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d I stepped out of the shower, buck-ass naked, finding Ollie standing in the doorway of the bathroom. \u201cWhat the hell, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNot like I haven\u2019t seen your junk before.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I grabbed a towel and wrapped it around my hips. \u201cWhat in the hell are you yapping about? And can it wait? Kind of have stuff to do.\u201d Namely dinner and movies to acquire.</p><p>Ollie followed me into my bedroom. \u201cI was asking about Avery. You\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with her.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond as I pulled on a pair of jeans, buttoning them up and then dropping the towel.</p><p>\u201cFree balling it tonight?\u201d Ollie grinned as he smacked his hands on the upper frame of the door. \u201cPlanning on getting laid?\u201d</p><p>I shot him a dark look as I turned and grabbed a shirt. \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything better to do?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, stretching out his arms. His hair fell forward, shielding most of his face. \u201cNope. Not at this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I pulled the shirt on.</p><p>\u201cSteve\u2019s having a party tonight. You going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>I arched a brow as I brushed him out the way, heading into the living room to find my sneakers. \u201cIf you\u2019re not surprised, why did you ask?\u201d</p><p>Ollie shrugged. \u201cYou used to go to all the parties.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I pulled my shoes on and straightened. That part was true. So was the fact that my face had been absent from all of them since late August. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the Halloween one. I won\u2019t miss that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Ollie plopped down on the couch.</p><p>I looked at him a moment, then shook my head as I grabbed some movies off the rack. Sometimes I wondered if Ollie even knew what he was talking about or doing.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>He tipped his head back and grinned. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty cool that you\u2019re spending time with Avery. I like her. She\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The moment those words came out of my mouth, I had no idea why I said them. My cheeks heated when Ollie laughed. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>Ollie\u2019s laughter followed me out to the hall and down to my truck. Thank you? That didn\u2019t even make any sense. What the hell was I thanking him for? But as I headed down to the nearby Chinese restaurant and ordered Avery\u2019s favorite\u2014shrimp stir-fry\u2014I realized I felt thankful. Strangest damn thing, because all Shortcake had done was say yes to hanging out, but I knew she didn\u2019t allow people to get very close to her. This . . . this was a big step she was taking.</p><p>Avery was such a mystery to me; a paradox of innocence and allure\u2014a mystery I was determined to solve.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go with Resident Evil,\u201d Avery said as she stood in front of the counter, doling out the shrimp stir-fry. Her hair hung in loose waves all the way to the middle of her back. She was dressed low-key, in a pair of tight workout pants and a loose-fitting shirt that slipped over one shoulder, revealing a swath of smooth, golden skin and a thin strap.</p><p>The girl had no idea how good she looked like that and I resisted the urge to move closer to her. When I\u2019d walked up on her in the kitchen earlier, she had reacted strangely, stiffening and paling.</p><p>\u201cA girl after my own heart,\u201d I replied, picking up two DVDs and taking them into the living room. \u201cZombies for the win.\u201d</p><p>A sudden soft glow alerted me to her presence. \u201cWhat do you want to drink?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder. \u201cDo you have milk?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her nose wrinkled. \u201cYou want that with Chinese food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed my calcium.\u201d</p><p>She made a face and disappeared into the kitchen, returning with a glass of milk and a can of soda. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of gross, you know?\u201d She sat, tucking her legs under her. \u201cWeird combination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever tried it?\u201d I sat, staring at the remote.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how do you know it\u2019s gross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with my assumption that it is.\u201d She picked up her plate, sending me a cheeky grin.</p><p>\u201cBefore the end of the year, I will have you trying milk and Chinese.\u201d</p><p>The look on her face said over her dead body, and I grinned. As Resident Evil kicked off, we dug into our dinner and spent more time discussing how women in a zombie apocalypse managed to look so attractive. As Alice faced down zombie Dobermans, I gathered up our plates and took them into the kitchen. While I was there, I grabbed another glass of milk and a can of root beer for her.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, smiling as I placed the soda on the coffee table.</p><p>I sat down closer to her. \u201cI live to service you.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake grinned and we continued to poke at the movie and its sequel. At one point, her cell phone went off. My gaze flicked to the screen on the iPhone and saw UNKNOWN CALLER flash.</p><p>\u201cNot going to answer?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She quickly leaned forward, snatching the phone and turning off the ringer. Seemed a little strange, how stiff she was when she did it. \u201cI think it\u2019s rude to answer the phone when you have company.\u201d</p><p>All we were doing was being overly critical about the movies. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p> <p>Shortcake sat back, nibbling on her thumbnail as she turned her attention to the TV. Come to think of it, I couldn\u2019t recall a time when I saw her on her phone\u2014not before class or around the campus. Most girls had their phones glued to their hands or the side of their face. She said she wasn\u2019t popular in school and it was obvious she wasn\u2019t that close to her family, but . . .</p><p>Well, something was off about it all, but I didn\u2019t know what.</p><p>Minutes went by and she was still chewing away on her fingernail, something I hadn\u2019t see her do before now. I reached over, wrapping my fingers around her wrist.</p><p>Her chin jerked up and her gaze landed on my hand. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been biting your nail for the last ten minutes.\u201d I lowered her arm to her thigh, but kept my hand around her wrist. The tips of my fingers touched. That was how small her wrist was. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She inhaled sharply. \u201cI\u2019m watching the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re really seeing the movie.\u201d Our gazes met. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand free, and I let go. Reluctantly. \u201cNothing is going on. Watch the movie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I dropped the subject, knowing that pushing Shortcake got me absolutely nowhere.</p><p>She grew quiet, and I checked out the time on the digital box below the DVD player. It was well after ten, and I expected her to kick my ass out any minute now, but when I shifted on the couch, throwing my right arm along the back, the entire left side of her body ended up against mine.</p><p>I froze and I believed my heart literally stopped as I waited for her to squirm away, keeping the mandatory two feet of personal space between us.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Holy shit, she didn\u2019t.</p><p>I glanced down at the top of her head, forcing my breathing to remain steady. Over the next half hour, every cell in my body became aware of her weight, her warmth and her deep, even breaths.</p><p>My heart skipped a beat when her head came down on the spot just below my shoulder. Was she asleep? \u201cAvery?\u201d</p><p>When there was no answer, I determined that she had, in fact, fallen asleep on me. There was a swelling in my chest, bigger and tighter than the knot that seemed to form whenever I was around her. And the strangest damn thing happened as I stared down at her. Parts of my body hardened at her closeness, but my insides softened like butter left out in the sun.</p><p>You\u2019re so fucked when it comes to that girl.</p><p>Those words kept coming back to me, time and time again. Maybe I was fucked, but I wouldn\u2019t trade this moment for anything. Carefully, so that I didn\u2019t wake her, I brought my arm off the back of the couch and gently guided her down so that her head rested on my thigh.</p><p>And something not too far north enlarged. Perhaps that wasn\u2019t the smartest idea, because it was too tempting to have her this close, but this . . . well, it felt right in a way that it had never felt with any other girl.</p><p>My chest lurched as Shortcake snuggled in, folding her hands together under her chin. I watched her for a moment, soaking up the smooth line of her jaw, the curve of her cheek and those rosy lips.</p><p>Damn, I was fucked in all the right ways.</p><p>I tried to pay attention to the movie, but I hadn\u2019t even realized when it ended and the regular channel kicked back in. My eyes were on Avery once more. I wasn\u2019t even sure my attention had ever left her.</p><p>I thought it was cool in the room, so I pulled the brown and green patchwork quilt over the back of the couch and draped it over her body. The bare expanse of her shoulder snagged my attention. Her shirt had slipped down her right arm and there was nothing but that little strap.</p><p>The soft glow of her skin lured me in and I was absolutely powerless to resist it. Lowering my hand, my breath caught as I touched the elegant curve of her shoulder.</p><p>Avery murmured in her sleep and wiggled a bit, but she didn\u2019t wake up. It probably wasn\u2019t cool to keep touching her, but I dragged my fingertips down her arm, relishing in the feel of her. Stopping at the hem of her shirt, my fingers grazed her silky skin all the way up to her cheek.</p><p>I was glad she was asleep, because the thought of her knowing how badly my hands shook would probably have been embarrassing as hell. Boy, they were trembling too, like I\u2019d never touched a girl before.</p><p>Avery . . . hell, she completely undid me.</p><p>Tipping my head back against the couch, I closed my eyes and swallowed hard as I rested my hand on the flare of her hip. I could probably count on two fingers how many times I spent the evening with a beautiful girl curled up against me and asleep, when I was just content to be there with her. Part of my brain was telling me there was a word for this, as crazy as that word sounded and felt, so I ignored that part.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she murmured, and my eyes flew open. Her brow wrinkled, but she seemed to be asleep. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m here . . .\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head to the side, straining to hear what else she said, but the only other word I could pick up was \u201csorry\u201d before she settled back down.</p><p>My heart pounded as I turned those words over. They didn\u2019t make any sense and probably didn\u2019t mean anything, but a ball of unease formed in my gut.</p><p>Time passed, and I didn\u2019t sleep, not really. I was stuck in the weird in-between phase, half awake, half not there. But I knew the moment she woke up. Her body stiffened and she dragged in a deep breath. Several moments passed and she didn\u2019t move or speak. I would\u2019ve cut off my thumb to know what she was thinking.</p><p>Shortcake slowly rolled onto her back, surprising me and leaving no time to react. My hand slipped from her hip and landed on her lower belly, fingers reaching the top of her pants. God knows I should\u2019ve pulled my hand away, but I didn\u2019t.</p><p>My hand had a mind of its own and did something entirely on its own. My thumb moved in slow, idle circles just below her navel. I watched her under my lashes, nearly groaning when she sucked in her lower lip. Then my gaze flicked up and I could see the hardened tips of her breasts, pushing through the thin material. I was hard again. No surprise there.</p><p>I turned my head to the side, my lips tipping up on the corners as she drew in a deep breath. I clenched my jaw as she tipped her head back against my thigh, coming close to my erection.</p><p>\u201cCam.\u201d</p><p>I opened an eye. \u201cAvery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not asleep,\u201d she said, voice husky and unbelievably sexy.</p><p>\u201cYou were.\u201d I turned my head side to side. \u201cAnd I was asleep.\u201d Total lie, but I doubted she\u2019d be cool with knowing I sat here almost the entire time and watched her.</p><p>She wetted her lips, and dammit if I didn\u2019t want to swoop down and catch the tip of that tongue. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I fell asleep on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter midnight,\u201d I said, staring at her moist lips.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even look at the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know these kinds of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a remarkable talent.\u201d Her hand curled into a loose fist on her leg. \u201cWhat time are you leaving in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to miss me?\u201d</p><p>She made a face, but her eyes glimmered up at me. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I was asking. I was just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told my parents I\u2019d be home by lunch.\u201d Using my other hand, I scooped a few strands of hair off her face and then I rested my hand on the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cSo I probably have to leave between eight and nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d When her eyes drifted shut, I wanted to kiss her. \u201cBut the drive is easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not coming back until Sunday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not going to miss me?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, but with anxiety. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like a vacation for me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cThat was entirely mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I know you\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I moved my hand, gently touching her cheek. Her eyes snapped open, and I smiled down at her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to miss me, but you\u2019re not going to admit it.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake was silent as I trailed my fingers from her jaw to her chin, coming close to her bottom lip. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes drifted closed as she relaxed against me once more. I continued to trace a path from her cheek to her lip, haunted by what she had said in her sleep. \u201cYou talk in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened, and I swear she paled. \u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cAre you messing with me? Because I swear to God, if you\u2019re messing with me, I\u2019m going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>That unease was back, and I wasn\u2019t sure why. \u201cI\u2019m not messing with you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, twisting on the couch, facing me. \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real?\u201d Her expression was so earnest and so serious I wished I hadn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>I leaned forward, scrubbing my hands down my face. \u201cYou were just murmuring stuff. I couldn\u2019t really make out what you were saying.\u201d I looked at her. \u201cIt was kind of cute.\u201d</p><p>She held my gaze, seeming to take what I said as word and then glanced at the clock. \u201cHoly crap, you suck at your special ability at knowing the time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shrugged. I knew it was well past three in the morning. \u201cI guess I should be going home.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, closed it, and then tried again. \u201cBe careful when you drive.\u201d</p><p>Standing, I stretched my back. \u201cI will.\u201d And before she could freak on me, I bent down and kissed her on the forehead. \u201cGood night, Avery.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were closed, hands balled together in front of her chest. When she spoke, it sounded like she was whispering a prayer. \u201cGood night, Cam.\u201d</p> <p>I made it to the door before she sprung up like a tight coil, hands gripping the back of the couch. \u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>My heart beat wildly as I stopped. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and that heartfelt expression was back. \u201cI had a really good time tonight.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and was amazed to see her lips do the same. \u201cI know.\u201d I opened the door, stopping on my way out as I turned to her. She was still there, kneeling on the couch, watching me. \u201cI\u2019ll see you Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t want to leave. \u201cBright and early.\u201d</p><p>The smile reached her eyes, lightening them. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>And for the first time in forever, I didn\u2019t want to go home. I wanted to stay here. I had to force myself out the door.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Jase shocked me with a text before I got out of town, asking if he could tag along. Him going home with me wasn\u2019t so much of a surprise, but I had thought with the four-day break, he\u2019d be at the farm.</p><p>He was waiting for me at the house he stayed at when he wasn\u2019t home\u2014a frat-run party central not too far from campus. I\u2019d spent many a night, none recently, passed out in one of the many rooms in the large three-story home.</p> <p>Climbing in, Jase clapped his hands together, rubbing them. \u201cGod, it\u2019s getting fucking cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I slipped the gears into drive and whipped around in a mean U-turn. \u201cYou\u2019re not spending time . . . ?\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair, causing it to flop all over the place. \u201cGot an extra hat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the one on my head. Want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Slinking down in the seat, he sighed as he shook his hair out. \u201cThey decided to head up to Pennsylvania to see some cousins or something.</p><p>I stole a glance at him as I hit the main route, heading for the interstate. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d</p><p>There was definitely something else behind it, because there was no way that Jase would pass up spending that kind of time with Jack, but if I knew anything about Jase, he talked about shit when he was damn well ready to do so.</p> <p>Halfway into the drive, Jase passed out and only woke when I hooked a right onto the narrow lane leading up to my parents\u2019 home. Sunlight sliced through the thick trees, casting patches of shimmery light on the road. When we were kids, my sister and I played a mean game of hide-and-go-seek in these woods.</p><p>I followed the driveway around the back of the house, parking the truck next to the detached garage I\u2019d help Dad put in during my, uh, extended stay.</p><p>The house was silent and toasty warm as we entered through the back patio. There was a faint smell of pumpkin in the air, and I grinned. Mom must\u2019ve been baking. It was still early afternoon though, and neither of my parents or my sister would be home for a while.</p><p>Jase and I devoured the freshly baked pumpkin pie over a beer. There was a pensive, brooding look to his face and when he disappeared upstairs to the guest bedroom he typically stayed in; I let him be and headed to my old bedroom.</p><p>Mom kept it the way it was when I lived here, except neater. The same bed was butted up against the wall, in the middle of the room. Trophies lined the wall shelving that Dad had built. The TV on the dresser and the desk I rarely used hadn\u2019t collected even a speck of dust.</p><p>I smiled as I shuffled toward the bed, kicking off my sneakers. There was a time, after the incident with Teresa\u2019s ex-boyfriend, when I had hated these four walls. I\u2019d loathed this house and this town and this state and myself.</p><p>Crashing on the bed, I stretched out and closed my eyes. Things were . . . different now, better. The only problem with coming home, it was impossible to not think about what happened in the house almost three years ago or Thanksgiving morning when Teresa finally told us the truth. The kind of rage that had slipped over me was something I\u2019d never experienced before, but had only read about.</p><p>Murderous rage. It really did exist and it really was like tasting blood in your mouth. And that anger hadn\u2019t faded in the hours after learning the truth nor had it really dissipated when I found that living punk ass and returned the favor with my fists. Afterward, that anger had warped into something unmanageable and it had eaten away at me like a cancer.</p><p>To this day I wished I had done something different that night, but there still wasn\u2019t an ounce of regret in my veins. The judge, the lawyers, the community service and the weekly meetings had done nothing to change that, but when I thought about Avery, I wished I did feel that way. I doubted that she would want to be around me if she knew the truth.</p><p>Mom gave the best hugs.</p><p>There was a sheen to her eyes and she stepped back, clasping my shoulders. Still dressed in her white lab coat, she had come straight home after surgery. \u201cI see you found the pie I left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had help.\u201d</p><p>Her smile spread. \u201cJase is here?\u201d</p><p>I nodded as I leaned against the counter. \u201cHe\u2019s upstairs sleeping.\u201d</p><p>She smoothed back a few strands of hair that had escaped her twist. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure a certain someone will be thrilled to see that you\u2019ve brought him along with you.\u201d</p><p>My brows lifted and then I groaned. \u201cPlease tell me she is not still infatuated with Jase.\u201d</p><p>Mom laughed softly as she shrugged off her oversized sweater, draping it along the back of her chair. \u201cI think \u2018infatuated\u2019 would be the wrong word to use.\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I groaned. When I\u2019d been on home confinement, Jase had spent almost every free moment up here, pulling my head out of my ass. And Teresa had spent every spare second spying on us and stalking Jase.</p><p>Mom drifted over to the coffeemaker, pulling out the empty pot. \u201cJase is a really nice boy. I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not even think about going there,\u201d I warned, folding my arms. Jase was a good guy\u2014a good guy, with a shit ton of baggage and a long list of broken hearts, who wouldn\u2019t come within ten feet of my little sister. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d I asked, deftly changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still at the office, but he\u2019ll be home shortly.\u201d She filled the pot with water. \u201cI was thinking we all could do dinner at Joe\u2019s. I think both you and Jase like that place, and as long as it serves red meat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad will be happy.\u201d I smiled, pushing off the counter. \u201cThat works for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant a cup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I came up behind her and wrapped my arms around her shoulders, squeezing her. \u201cHave I told you lately that you\u2019re the best mom ever?\u201d</p><p>She laughed as she patted my arms. \u201cI\u2019m the only mom you got, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d I replied. \u201cBest mom.\u201d</p><p>I let go as she shook her head and was in the process of heading upstairs to wake up Jase\u2019s lazy ass when Teresa came in the front door.</p><p>\u201cCam!\u201d She let out a high-pitched squeal when she saw me in the foyer and dropped her book bag. The pint-sized terror took one step and launched herself at me.</p><p>Laughing, I caught her before she knocked me down. \u201cWell, hello to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d she asked once I sat her down.</p><p>\u201cThis morning.\u201d</p><p>She smacked my arm. \u201cYou should\u2019ve texted me! I would\u2019ve skipped my afternoon classes and come home early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that!\u201d yelled Mom from the kitchen.</p><p>Teresa rolled her eyes, and I laughed. Somewhere in the last two years or so, she\u2019d grown up from a gangly child into a stunning young woman. And every time I saw her, I wanted to pull a paper sack over her head. Everywhere she went, guys looked, and they really looked.</p><p>She had inherited the dark hair and blue eyes from Dad, but she had Mom\u2019s delicate features. Her beauty and small frame were really misleading, because she had also developed mom\u2019s snappy, quick wit. When she and Mom got going, no one was safe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to skip dance tonight,\u201d she said, tugging the tie from her hair. It seemed to have grown overnight, falling well past her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019ll be here all weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I never get to see you!\u201d She pouted, giving me the look that probably got her a lot of things. \u201cYou\u2019re too busy and too cool to hang out with your sister anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d I said, grinning.</p><p>She smacked my arm hard. \u201cJerk.\u201d</p><p>Facing the stairs, I saw Jase come down before Teresa did. He was as quiet as a freaking ninja and he came to a stop at the bottom, his hair damp and clothing unwrinkled. He hadn\u2019t made a sound, but Teresa stiffened in front of me. Her eyes, so like mine, widened a fraction of an inch.</p><p>My gaze narrowed on her.</p><p>Teresa whipped around with the elegance of a dancer, and I cringed when she shrieked, \u201cJase!\u201d</p><p>The pensive look that had been on Jase\u2019s face from the moment I picked him up vanished like a bad nightmare. He came down on the landing a second before my sister threw herself at the guy, greeting him in the same way she\u2019d done with me. His eyes were only on her, and while I completely trusted Jase, even he wasn\u2019t immune to her.</p><p>I also didn\u2019t like it when he wrapped his arms around her, keeping them both from tumbling backward.</p><p>\u201cCam didn\u2019t tell me you were here!\u201d she cried, clinging to him like a little monkey. \u201cYou\u2019re staying here the whole weekend, too?\u201d</p><p>Jase smiled down at the top of Teresa\u2019s head\u2014the head that was currently plastered against his chest. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m here until Cam heads back.\u201d</p><p>I knew in that exact moment, Teresa would be bowing out on dance not only tonight, but also the rest of the weekend. I sighed.</p><p>Teresa said something that only Jase could hear and his smile spread in a way that had me taking deep, even breaths. Then he looked up, his gaze meeting mine. He shot me a helpless look, and I rolled my eyes, strolling forward.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I grabbed her arms, physically lifting her away from Jase. \u201cI think you can let him go now. He probably wants to breathe at some point.\u201d</p><p>Jase laughed as Teresa shot me a look that promised death and dismemberment and yanked her arms free. I stepped back, just in case she was going to try to hit me again. My sister had muscles.</p><p>\u201cI think Mom wants to see you in the kitchen,\u201d I said, pushing her in that general direction.</p><p>A frowned pulled the corners of her lips down. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably something to do with all the classes you\u2019re planning to skip,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re skipping classes?\u201d Jase asked, crossing his arms. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be doing that, Tess. It\u2019s your senior year. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tess? Two what the fucks just happened. When had that nickname occurred? I knew the two of them had grown close, but dayum. And that piece of advice coming from Jase of all people?</p><p>A faint pink flush stained her cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t do it often.\u201d</p><p>My brows shot up.</p><p>Jase winked at me.</p> <p>Finally, Teresa left us and I snuck Jase off to the basement. Dad had created one hell of a man cave down there. Pool tables, a bar, air hockey and TV the size of a wall.</p><p>Picking up a pool cue, Jase arched an eyebrow at me. \u201cWho pissed in your Cheerios?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeresa has a crush on you,\u201d I said, knowing I sounded like I\u2019d tasted something bad.</p><p>Jase chuckled as he glanced at me. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>I shot him a look as I grabbed a stick.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He laughed again. \u201cAre you surprised? It\u2019s my stunning charm and good looks. It\u2019s hard to resist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she better resist.\u201d</p><p>Jase watched me as I racked the balls. \u201cDude, as hot as your sister is\u2014sorry.\u201d He raised his hands as I straightened. \u201cAs beautiful as your sister is, that\u2019s your sister. I wouldn\u2019t even dream about what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d</p><p>I smiled tightly. \u201cGood to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I would? She\u2019s a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just turned eighteen, Jase. She\u2019s not a kid anymore.\u201d I scowled as that little ditty sunk in. My stomach roiled. \u201cDamn, she\u2019s really not a kid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s still your sister,\u201d Jase said, pointing the pool stick at me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s never going to change.\u201d</p><p>Go out with me.</p><p>Grinning, I put the phone on the table and waited for Avery\u2019s response. Across from me, my dad studied his cards. There was more gray peppered in his hair, but his face was still absent of wrinkles.</p><p>\u201cAnytime now, old man.\u201d I sat back in the chair. \u201cI\u2019m not getting any younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the truth?\u201d Dad looked up at me, eyes narrowed. \u201cYou cannot rush perfection.\u201d</p><p>Jase chuckled under his breath. Beside him, Teresa\u2019s head hung forward. She hadn\u2019t been able to get out of dance practice since it was Saturday and that had been an all-day event. She would\u2019ve crashed by now, like Mom, who\u2019d dozed off in the living room, but I knew why she was still up.</p><p>I glanced over at Jase, and he arched a brow at me as he took a swig of beer.</p><p>My phone vibrated. Asking me over text is no different from in person.</p> <p>The grin spread into a full smile as I texted her back. Thought I\u2019d give it a try. What r u doing now? I\u2019m beating my dad at poker.</p><p>As Dad threw two cards forward, she responded with a Getting ready for bed.</p><p>Wish I was there. And then I sent, Wait r u naked?</p><p>No!!! came the immediate response.</p><p>I could almost picture her, face blood red and eyes wide, and I grinned. Even miles away, I couldn\u2019t resist teasing her. Hell, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her. It seemed odd to have not seen her on Friday and facing a Sunday without eggs just didn\u2019t seem right. We exchanged a couple of more texts and then I tossed my phone aside before Dad had a shit fit and threw it out the window.</p><p>In the next round, Jase bowed out and then Teresa quickly disappeared and the poker game fell apart after that.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d Dad asked once we were alone.</p><p>Nursing my beer, I leaned back in the chair. \u201cIt\u2019s going good. Got a really easy semester.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as he picked at the label on his bottle. \u201cAnd the meetings? You\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>I sat my bottle down. \u201cDad, you\u2019d be the first to know if I wasn\u2019t going. And I talked to Dr. Bale about this weekend. He was cool with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust want to make sure.\u201d He sat back, hooking his knee over his other leg. If anyone saw my dad now in his flannel shirt and ripped jeans, they wouldn\u2019t believe he was a successful lawyer. \u201cWhat about soccer? You give any more thought about next year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad . . . I won\u2019t be able to join the team at Shepherd my senior year.\u201d I ran my hand through my hair and then dropped my arm. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be twenty-two by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about afterwards?\u201d he asked, not ready to let it go.</p><p>My gaze settled over his shoulder, landing on the fridge. Photos of me scoring goals and Teresa dancing covered almost the entire door. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t fail unless you try,\u201d he said, drinking deep.</p><p>My brows knitted. \u201cIsn\u2019t that you can\u2019t succeed if you don\u2019t try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d He flashed a grin. \u201cCam, you\u2019re a damn good player. Soccer is, or at least, was a passion. We have videos to send to coaches. And you know the coach at Shepherd would help you take new ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sighed, shaking my head slowly. \u201cAnd I keep up my workouts and practice with the guys when I can, but . . . I don\u2019t know. Maybe next year, when I\u2019m about to graduate . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d His gaze was shrewd. \u201cCameron . . . Cameron . . .\u201d</p><p>Yakking on about soccer was hard for me. Wasn\u2019t like a future playing was completely out of the question. That was why I kept up the training, but there was nothing I could do about right now.</p><p>\u201cIs there a young lady in your life now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Perhaps I should\u2019ve let him ask about soccer. \u201cDad . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He smiled again and then finished off the beer. \u201cI like to have the four-one-one on my son\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>My head dropped back. \u201cFour-one-one? Are you drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m buzzing.\u201d</p><p>I laughed out loud. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>Reaching for the bottle, I eyed my father and then laughed at myself, because I knew what the words that were forming on my tongue were before I spoke them. \u201cThere\u2019s . . . there\u2019s someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo tell.\u201d Interest sparked in his eyes.</p><p>I smiled as I took the last gulp from the bottle. \u201cWe\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends as in . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Dad.\u201d I groaned, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He cocked his head to the side. \u201cLike I don\u2019t know what you kids are doing. Like I didn\u2019t do the same thing when I was your age.\u201d</p><p>I might vomit. \u201cWe\u2019re not like that. Avery isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a name? Avery?\u201d</p><p>Shit. I couldn\u2019t believe I even said her name. Was I buzzing? \u201cWe\u2019re friends, Dad. And she\u2019s a . . . she\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s dark brows rose. \u201cShe\u2019s . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Perfect. Beautiful. Smart. Funny. Prideful. Infuriating. The list could go on and on. \u201cI\u2019ve asked her out a couple of times.\u201d A \u201ccouple of times\u201d was literally the understatement of the year. \u201cShe\u2019s turned me down each time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you keep asking?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think she\u2019s going to say yes eventually?\u201d</p><p>Smiling a little, I nodded again.</p><p>Dad leaned forward, crossing his arms on the round, oak table. \u201cDid I ever tell you how many times your mother turned me down before she agreed to go out me? No? A lot of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I hadn\u2019t known that.</p><p>Dad nodded. \u201cI was a bit of a . . . rakehell in college. Had a reputation.\u201d One side of his mouth tipped up, revealing a dimple in his left cheek. \u201cYour mother didn\u2019t make it easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what changed it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAh, she was secretly in love with me from the beginning, but you know what? I had to chase her, and to be honest, if you don\u2019t have to chase a woman, she\u2019s probably not worth the effort. You get what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>Not really. There was a good chance my dad was more than just buzzing, but I nodded, and then he said something that sort of clicked in my head.</p><p>\u201cSurprise,\u201d he said, winking. \u201cSurprise the girl. Do something she\u2019s not expecting. Always do something good she\u2019s not expecting.\u201d</p><p>Surprise her? There were a lot of things I could do that would surprise Shortcake, but I doubted he meant any of those things. But as I said good night to Dad and started toward the stairs, I knew what to do.</p><p>And I wanted to do it.</p><p>I smiled as I took the steps two at a time. As I rounded the second floor, I caught sight of Teresa slipping into her bedroom. I opened my mouth to call out to her, but the door closed quietly before I could utter a word.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Shaking my head, I continued on to the guest bedroom Jase was in\u2014the green room. Or at least that\u2019s what Mom called it, because the walls were painted a deep olive green.</p><p>The door was cracked and I pushed it open. Jase sat at the foot of the bed, bent forward slightly, his arms resting on his thighs, hands over his face.</p><p>\u201cHey, man.\u201d I entered the room, concerned. Had something happened back home? \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah,\u201d he said, standing up and smoothing both hands through his hair. He walked over to where his duffel bag was and pulled out a pair of nylon shorts. \u201cI\u2019m just not feeling . . . well. Beer didn\u2019t settle right, you know? What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t he only drunk like two beers? I watched him toss the shorts on the bed, his back a tense, rigid line. \u201cI was thinking about a change of plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d He moved to the nightstand, dug out his cell and dropped it there. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about leaving really early in the morning,\u201d I told him. \u201cProbably close to five or so. Is that cool with you?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders relaxed. \u201cYeah, man, that works perfectly. Just wake me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d I backed up and stopped at the door. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he replied, sitting down on the bed again. \u201cSee you in the morning.</p><p>As I shut the door behind me, I realized Jase hadn\u2019t looked me in the face the whole time I was in there.</p><p>It was a little before nine a.m. the following morning when I stopped in front of Avery\u2019s apartment and knocked. Hopefully my dad\u2019s advice of \u201csurprising her\u201d didn\u2019t equate to \u201cfreaking her out.\u201d</p><p>Doubt rose swiftly, like fire to a stick house, and I turned around, about to dive-bomb into my apartment. But the door whipped open like she was trying to pull it off its hinges.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I faced her and smiled crookedly. I held up a grocery bag. \u201cSo, I woke up around four this morning and thought I could really eat some eggs. And eggs with you are so much better than eggs with my sister or my dad. Plus my mom made pumpkin bread. I know how you like pumpkin bread.\u201d</p><p>Eyes wide and lips parted, she slowly stepped aside, allowing me in. She wasn\u2019t freaking. That much was good. But she also wasn\u2019t saying anything. I carried the bag into the kitchen and placed it on the counter. Closing my eyes, I cursed under my breath. Maybe this wasn\u2019t the best idea. That ache was back in my chest, this time a different, piercing feeling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pivoted around, about to apologize when I hadn\u2019t apologized for any other time I\u2019d busted up into her apartment, but she was in the kitchen, practically airborne. Coming at me the way Teresa had when she greeted me. The same way my sister had launched herself at Jase.</p><p>I caught her, wrapping my arms around her waist as I stumbled back, hitting the counter. Shock radiated through me, quickly followed by a wild warmth that lit up my veins.</p><p>My arms tightened around her as she pressed her cheek to my chest and held on just as strongly as I held her. I dropped my face to the top of her head, inhaling her scent and soaking her response in, holding her close to my heart.</p><p>Avery inhaled a shaky breath and said, \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p> <p>Thirteen</p><p>A cold snap hit our little speck of the world right before Halloween. Chilly air whipped through the campus, creating a sheer, frigid wind tunnel between the buildings.</p><p>Jase was staring at Ollie with a dumbfounded expression on his face. As cold as it was, Ollie was wearing shorts and sandals. At least he had a hoodie on, but I doubted he wore anything other than that. Or even felt the wind.</p><p>But Shortcake was a different story.</p><p>The four of us stood in between Whitehall and Knutti, waiting for the next class to begin. She was hunkered down in her sweater that was fitted to her slim waist and the flare of her hips.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m doing it,\u201d Ollie said, grinning. \u201cNo one can stop me.\u201d</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>Shortcake brushed a strand of hair that had come loose from the twist at the nape of her neck. \u201cIt will really look weird.\u201d</p><p>Jase nodded. \u201cI have to agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Ollie announced. \u201cI think it\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Wind whipped its way across the clearing, smacking into Shortcake. She pressed her lips into a tight line as a shiver worked its way through her. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen someone put a leash on a tortoise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be done,\u201d Ollie replied, rocking back on his heels. \u201cAnd I kind of like the idea of being the first.\u201d</p><p>Jase rolled his eyes as I shifted toward Shortcake, hoping to block some of the brutal burst of wind. \u201cHow are you even going to get a leash around Raphael?\u201d Jase asked, sounding genuinely curious.</p><p>Another gust of wind rattled our bones, and Shortcake\u2019s lips started to tremble. I\u2019d had enough of just standing here. From behind her, I wrapped an arm around her shoulders and hauled her back against my front. She stiffened and her breath came out in a harsh exhale. Jase and Ollie didn\u2019t notice because they were busying arguing over whether or not it was considered animal cruelty to tie a ball of yarn around Raphael\u2019s shell.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight me,\u201d I said, voice low in her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re freezing cold. So am I. If you don\u2019t like it, then go inside.\u201d</p><p>Her back was stiff against my chest. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will if you do.\u201d</p><p>She muttered something very unflattering under her breath, but she didn\u2019t pull away, and my grin spread, and as each second passed, her muscles relaxed. \u201cThis is probably the stupidest conversation I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d she said, watching Jase and Ollie.</p><p>\u201cI have to agree.\u201d My body reacted when she leaned into me. There was no helping that. \u201cThe thing is, I\u2019d bet a thousand bucks when I go home tonight, there will be a string around Raphael.\u201d</p> <p>She giggled. \u201cI want a picture of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to do that for you.\u201d I closed my eyes, knowing that if Ollie or Jase happened to look over, I\u2019d never live it down, but having her in my arms was too good of a thing to not risk.</p><p>\u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t take him outside though,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s too cold for the little guy.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, I opened my eyes and tilted my head to the side. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged as she turned her head toward mine, putting her lips within kissing distance of mine. \u201cRaphael is a Russian tortoise, right?\u201d When I nodded, she bit down on her lower lip and almost groaned. \u201cI was bored one night and looked them up. He has to be kept in a warm environment, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d For some weird reason, that pleased me to no end to know that she had looked that up. \u201cI won\u2019t let Ollie take him outside.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake let out a little sigh. \u201cI need to get to class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cWe should skip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the kind of influence you need.\u201d When she laughed at that, I felt lighter somehow. \u201cSo you\u2019re really going to go to the Halloween party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetween you and Brittany, I don\u2019t see a way out of it.\u201d She started to pull away, but I tightened my grip. \u201cI told you I was going to go. I will.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure I believed her. I had a feeling that come tomorrow night, she would make up some excuse for how she couldn\u2019t make it, so I wasn\u2019t holding my breath. Avery hadn\u2019t gone to a single party since she started college, even though I knew Brittany and Jacob had.</p><p>Sighing, I let go and stepped back. My class was over in Byrd. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me to give you a ride tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>Ollie\u2019s head whipped around so fast you\u2019d think I said nachos. \u201cIt would be a ride you\u2019d never forget, Avery.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a dark look. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks were flushed, either from what Ollie had said or from the cold. \u201cI know. And it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t need a ride, but I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>I really didn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>There were a lot of angels and cats in high heels, so much so that I had a hell of a time not wanting to separate the girls into two groups: the fallen and the catty.</p><p>Brittany, Avery\u2019s friend, was in the group of the fallen, her white dress absolutely no protection against the chilly night. She was with Jacob, who looked remarkably like Bruno Mars, but I hadn\u2019t seen Avery.</p><p>Figured.</p><p>I\u2019d spent a good part of the evening wondering if she\u2019d really show and if she did, what she would wear. Would she be an angel? A cat? Really stupid, considering that I did have better things to dwell on.</p><p>Irritated, I roamed from one room to the next. The house was packed, standing room only, and people spilled out onto the front porch and the lawn. If the cops didn\u2019t show up at some point tonight, breaking up the party, I\u2019d be amazed.</p><p>There was too much going on inside the house for me. Music thumped loudly, but not quite drowning out the shouts and laughter. Couples were in every corner, some who appeared to have forgotten who their boyfriend/girlfriend was. I used to love this scene, but now, it made my skin itchy.</p><p>I\u2019d retreated outside to the garage with Jase, in the midst of a mean game of beer pong.</p><p>\u201cYou look thrilled to be here,\u201d Jase said, squinting an eye as he held the white ball, lining it up with the plastic cups.</p><p>\u201cNot feeling it tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Jase bounced the ball into a cup in the first row. The guys on the other side of the table groaned. \u201cIs that because I haven\u2019t see Shortcake around?\u201d</p><p>Why I had made the mistake of calling her that in front of Jase was beyond me. I didn\u2019t respond as the ball from the other side bounced right off the table.</p><p>Jase chuckled. \u201cAmateurs.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cBut do you know who I do see? Steph. And she\u2019s been looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thought I\u2019d share that knowledge with you.\u201d He tossed me the ball. \u201cLet\u2019s kick some ass.\u201d</p><p>With nothing else better to do and wanting to get out of my own head, I joined the game. Jase had been right. The group across from us really were amateurs. Fifteen minutes into the game, our opponents were swaying like weeds in the wind.</p><p>\u201cThis is actually shameful,\u201d I muttered, eyeing one of them, who punched the end of the table to hold himself up, rattling the cups.</p><p>Jase grinned evilly. \u201cThey should\u2019ve known better than to challenge me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed as I folded my arms, running a hand over my bare bicep. Jase bounced another perfect throw and the other side erupted in curses. Straightening, Jase raised his hands out to his sides and then he stopped, eyes widening.</p><p>He elbowed me and turned, voice low. \u201cWell, look at who just wandered in here.\u201d</p><p>My brows lifted as I followed his gaze, looking past a group dancing. Air punched out of my lungs. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Unfolding my arms, I stared for a second, absolutely shocked.</p><p>Avery was here.</p><p>Standing next to Brittany and Jacob, she stood out and not because she wasn\u2019t in a costume. Her formfitting black turtleneck revealed a small section of her flat stomach. It was the first time I\u2019d seen her stomach. Crazy.. My mouth dried.</p><p>A big, old goofy-ass smile broke out across my face and I set my cup down. I didn\u2019t even say anything to Jase as I crossed the crowded garage. Jacob said something to her that caused her cheeks to flush and, a second later, I had her in my arms.</p><p>Lifting her up, I spun around as she clutched my shoulders. \u201cHoly shit, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually here.\u201d</p><p>Her warm brown eyes met mine. \u201cI told you I was coming.\u201d</p><p>I set her down, but kept her tucked close. God, she looked gorgeous with her coppery hair falling in waves down her shoulders, curling around the swells of her breasts. \u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Not that long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come say hi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were busy and I didn\u2019t want to bother you.\u201d</p><p>She had been staring at my lips, which was entirely distracting up until those last words left her mouth. I bent my head, my lips brushing her ear as I spoke. I didn\u2019t miss the way she shivered. \u201cYou are never a bother to me.\u201d</p><p>When I lifted my head, our gazes collided and held. The hue of her eyes deepened, almost blending in with her pupils. There was a connection there between us. No mistaking the electricity shimmering in the tiny space between our lips. And when hers parted, I lowered my head, wholly intent on kissing her.</p><p>\u201cYo, Cam!\u201d Jase yelled, obliterating the moment. \u201cYou\u2019re up.\u201d</p><p>I smiled tightly. \u201cDon\u2019t go too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, her hands slipping away.</p><p>Stalking back over to the table, I shot Jase a dirty look. \u201cPerfect timing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He watched me pick up the Ping Pong ball. \u201cDid I interrupt Avery turning you down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d I bounced the ball, missing my target. Cursing, I picked up the cup. \u201cFuck you all.\u201d</p><p>Jase let out a loud laugh and said something, but my narrowed gaze found Avery. I could barely see her. Her friends flanked either side and a red cup had ended up in her hands. She really wasn\u2019t drinking and, for some reason, I was glad to see that. Their group grew and every so often, she disappeared from view, reappearing a few minutes later. Once this stupid game was over, it was her and me, and no interruptions. And, dammit, tonight she would tell me yes when I asked her out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIncoming,\u201d Jase warned.</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize what he was talking about at first, but arms went around me from behind. I knew immediately it wasn\u2019t Avery. I couldn\u2019t get that lucky.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you dressed as?\u201d Steph asked.</p><p>\u201cMyself,\u201d I told her, turning around. She was dressed as if Little Red Riding Hood had wandered onto a porn set.</p> <p>She smiled, twirling the edge of one of her pigtails. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are too awesome to wear costumes,\u201d Jase said, eyeing Steph\u2019s friend.</p><p>I gently untangled Steph\u2019s arms. \u201cYou guys look hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Steph giggled. \u201cCan we join?\u201d she asked, nodding at the game.</p><p>Jase stepped aside, and I knew by the way he was paying attention to Steph\u2019s friend, he wouldn\u2019t be spending the night alone.</p> <p>My attention immediately sought out Shortcake. I was surprised for a second time that night when I saw what she was doing.</p><p>She was dancing.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t be such a big deal, but I had the suspicion that whatever caused her to stop dancing professionally hindered her from doing it at all.</p><p>God, she was . . . there were no words.</p><p>The song was fast, with a lot of beats, and her hips hit them all. Holding on to Brittany\u2019s hand, the two of them danced together. A smile pulled at my lips as Jacob joined them. Her head was tipped back, arms raised, and she was laughing.</p><p>In that moment, I realized I was seeing a very different side of Avery. One I\u2019d never seen before, where she was lively and carefree, and fucking perfect.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to marry that girl one day,\u201d I heard myself say.</p><p>Jase choked on his beer and bent over, dragging in deep breaths. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>I grinned.</p><p>But it immediately began to fade as some guy came up behind her, slapping his hands on her hips. Avery jumped a good half foot off the floor as she looked over her shoulder.</p><p>Tony. That was his name. A freshman who was just initiated into Jase\u2019s frat. He\u2019d been a part of the first group we\u2019d beaten at beer pong\u2014the one who\u2019d almost fallen face-first into the table. I didn\u2019t know him, but I didn\u2019t like him. And I sure as fuck didn\u2019t like what he was doing with his hips.</p><p>Avery twisted to the side and Tony was attached to her like a fucking octopus. He was obviously plastered and it was also obvious that Avery didn\u2019t want to dance with him. Every time she pulled away, he tugged her back.</p><p>Anger exploded in my gut like buckshot. I started forward, ignoring Jase when he called out to me. I was halfway across the garage when Tony slipped his hand across her stomach.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d she yelled.</p> <p>The hair on the back of my neck rose at the real fear in her voice. I tripped\u2014fucking tripped\u2014and then I shot forward, plowing through those in the way. I didn\u2019t even see them.</p><p>Fury tasted like blood in my mouth as I grabbed ahold of Avery\u2019s arm, pulling her away. Her startled gasp was like thunder in my ears as I shoved Tony back. The fucker stumbled as he backpedaled, hitting the wall.</p><p>I was on him in a heartbeat.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>I was going to break this motherfucker\u2019s face. It was as simple as that. He was touching her and it was obvious to anyone with a pea-sized brain that she hadn\u2019t wanted to be touched.</p><p>Shoving my hand into his chest, I slammed him back into the wall as my other hand curled into a fist. \u201cWhat the fuck, man? Do you have a fucking hearing problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Tony raised his hands, shaking. \u201cWe were just dancing. Didn\u2019t mean any shit by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam,\u201d Avery cried out.</p><p>I shoved Tony back as he started to speak again, and Jase was suddenly at my back, grabbing ahold of me. He wrenched me away, and Tony staggered against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou need to chill the fuck out,\u201d Jase said.</p><p>I tried to duck Jase\u2019s hold. \u201cLet me the fuck go, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no.\u201d He was in my face, hands on my chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t need this, remember? Getting into a fight is the last thing you fucking need right now. So back down.\u201d</p><p>My blood boiled with the need to put my fist through the guy\u2019s face, but Jase . . . dammit, Jase was right. I couldn\u2019t get into a fight. My probation would be revoked, and I couldn\u2019t put my family through that, or Avery.</p><p>Avery.</p><p>I spun around. A crowd had gathered between us and she stood with Brittany, her face pale and eyes glittering with unshed tears. I started toward her, but Jase blocked me.</p><p>\u201cYou need to calm down before you do anything.\u201d</p><p>Ollie appeared at my side, shoving a beer in my hand. \u201cJase speaks the truth, man. Avery will be fine, but you . . .\u201d Serious for once in his life, he shook his head. \u201cYou need to chill out for a little while.\u201d</p><p>I let them push me toward the door and when I looked up, I couldn\u2019t find Avery in the crowd. She was gone.</p><p>Sitting on the edge of the bed Jase slept in whenever he stayed in this house, I pulled out my phone, sending Avery a quick text. Jase slammed the door, but I ignored it, waiting for a response. I shouldn\u2019t have let them drag me in here. Right now, Ollie was outside the door, playing guard. I should be with Avery, making sure she was okay.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck got into you, man?\u201d</p><p>I stared up at Jase. \u201cShe used to dance.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he demanded again. \u201cWhat in the fuck does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>Dropping my head into my hands, I shrugged. I had no idea what the hell that had to do with anything, but I had this feeling that dancing for Avery\u2014for her to do that\u2014was a big deal.</p><p>Jase cursed as he spun around and then pivoted right back at me. \u201cWhat is going on with you, Cam? You don\u2019t get pissed off like this. You don\u2019t get bent out of shape over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare say over nothing.\u201d My chin jerked up, eyes narrowing on Jase as fury roared through me like an out of control freight train. I shot to my feet. \u201cHe was touching her, Jase. He was grabbing on her and\u2014\u201d I cut myself off before I said the words I didn\u2019t want to, the ones forming on my tongue.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking serious?\u201d I shot forward, but Jase didn\u2019t back down. He went toe to toe with me. \u201cSo? You okay with a guy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no, I\u2019m not, but Jesus H. Christ in a manger, Cam, he was some drunk idiot freshman and you and I have seen much worse go down than that.\u201d His eyes flashed an intense silver, a sure sign he was about to lose his shit. Good. So was I. Again. \u201cAnd before you say you\u2019ve intervened in those situations, too, I know. We both have, but you\u2019ve never tried to take a guy\u2019s head off.\u201d</p><p>He had a point. What the fuck ever. \u201cThis is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s her?\u201d</p><p>The way he said \u201cher\u201d made me want to put my fist through the wall. \u201cYou better be very careful, bro, when it comes to your next words.\u201d</p><p>His pupils flared wide as he held up his hands. \u201cLook, Avery seems like a nice girl. She does, but the last time I checked, you two aren\u2019t seeing each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I threw the word back at him.</p><p>Jase looked like he now wanted to put his fist through me. \u201cShe\u2019s turned you down how many times? And you\u2019re acting like a pissed-off, possessive boyfriend, and the last thing you need is to get into a fight. Or need I remind you that if you do, you break your probation and you will in up in prison? Not jail, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to remind me.\u201d I turned, shoving my hands through my hair. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t immediately respond. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t understand how this girl is leading you around by your dick. Have you ever considered that\u2019s she playing you, for some fucked-up reason?\u201d</p><p>I whirled on him, hands clenching into fists. If he hadn\u2019t been my closest friend, the one to pull my head out of my ass when I was on home confinement, I would\u2019ve broken his jaw. I took several deep breaths before replying. \u201cShe\u2019s not like that, Jase. I know that\u2019s hard for you to believe. I get it. You\u2019ve been screwed over in a way I can\u2019t even begin to fathom, but she is not like that.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Jase turned and leaned against the closed door. \u201cThat\u2019s what every guy says before they are royally fucked over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery is different,\u201d I told him, pulling out my cell again. No response. A ball of unease formed in my stomach. \u201cYou don\u2019t know her like I do. You don\u2019t know her at all.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me as he scrubbed a palm over his jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t know you right now.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to respond to that.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it about her?\u201d he asked, sounding like he truly wanted to understand the attraction I could barely figure out. \u201cShe\u2019s not like any other girl you\u2019ve gone out with. She\u2019s fucking awkward as hell and quiet. She\u2019s pretty, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fucking beautiful,\u201d I cut in, daring him to disagree.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. \u201cIs she worth this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, glancing at my phone again. Still nothing. \u201cYes, she is, and I need to make sure she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving this room right this fucking second and you\u2019re not going to stop me.\u201d When Jase didn\u2019t move, I cursed under my breath and reminded myself that he was only doing this because he was my friend. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go beat the shit out of someone. I\u2019m going to go find Avery. That\u2019s all I care about right now.\u201d</p><p>Jase looked away, a muscle flexing in his jaw and then he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s okay, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t . . .\u201d I paused, rubbing a spot on my chest as the white walls in the room seemed to blur. My chest constricted. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Jase. I think . . . I think something happened to her before.\u201d</p><p>Comprehension settled across his face and then he stepped aside. \u201cAw, shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I muttered, feeling that horrible sensation along the nape of my neck. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>My heart was pounding as I stared down at Brittany. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, causing her angel wings to droop. \u201cAfter you went inside with Jase and Ollie, she said she was stepping outside for fresh air, but she never came back in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d I glanced down at my phone as I pressed her name on my phone again. Walking out to the driveway, I cursed again when there was no answer. I hadn\u2019t seen Tony inside or anywhere, but I doubted he would\u2019ve gone after her. Jase was right. The guy was just a drunk idiot, but that didn\u2019t tell me where Avery was.</p><p>And I had looked everywhere.</p><p>Brittany trailed behind me. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t answered my calls or Jacob\u2019s. I don\u2019t even think she\u2019s here anymore.\u201d She paused, pushing her hair off her face. \u201cI\u2019m going to go to her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, clenching my phone. \u201cI\u2019m going to go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know if I find her.\u201d I already started walking and then I was jogging to where my truck was parked near the cul-de-sac.</p><p>Slamming the door shut, I turned on the engine and gunned it down the residential street. Unease formed an icy ball in the pit of my stomach. The fear in her voice . . . she had been terrified when Tony grabbed her. The wigged-out feeling was back. As much as I wanted to deny it, to push it out of my thoughts, I couldn\u2019t any longer. Something had happened to her. What, to be exact, I wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>I tried calling her on the way home, but as expected, there was no answer. My hands clenched the steering wheel until my knuckles bleached white. I pulled into the first parking spot I found at University Heights and raced across the parking lot. There was no point in checking for her car. In the darkness, it would be like looking for a needle in a pile of fucking needles.</p> <p>My stomach was in knots when I reached our floor and rapped my knuckles on her door. If she didn\u2019t answer, I would kick this door in, and if she wasn\u2019t here, I would scour this damn county for her.</p><p>Then the door opened and Avery was standing there, eyes swollen and red, mascara and tears laying tracks on her cheeks.</p><p>But she was okay.</p><p>She was okay.</p><p>With my heart reaching my throat, I went inside and wrapped my arms around her, hauling her against my chest. Reaching up, I cradled her close, dropping my chin to the top of her bowed head.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t trust myself to speak at first and when I did, my fingers curled around the strands of her hair. \u201cJesus Christ, why haven\u2019t you answered your damn phone?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t lift her head as she spoke. \u201cI left my phone in the car, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Avery.\u201d I pulled back, cupping her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve been blowing up your phone\u2014so have Jacob and Brittany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been crying.\u201d Anger rose again. \u201cYou\u2019ve been fucking crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you looked in the mirror?\u201d When she shook her head, I closed the door behind me and then took her small hand. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, but let me tug her along. I took her into the bathroom and flipped on the light. She sucked in a sharp breath as she caught sight of her reflection. \u201cOh God . . .\u201d Our gazes met in the mirror, and then she dropped her head into her hands. \u201cPerfect\u2014just perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad, sweetheart.\u201d The knot in my chest ached as I gently pulled her hands away. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>Avery sat on the closed toilet seat and stared down at her fingers. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Grabbing a washcloth, I ran it under the tap and then knelt in front of her. Disbelief kept me from speaking at first. \u201cWhat am I doing here? Is that a serious question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess not.\u201d She hadn\u2019t lifted her gaze.</p><p>\u201cLook at me. Dammit, Avery, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Her chin jerked up, eyes narrowed until only thin strips of dark brown showed. \u201cHappy?\u201d</p> <p>My molars cracked as I grinded my jaw. \u201cWhy would I come here? You left a party without saying a word to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Brittany you were getting some fresh air. That was three hours ago, Avery. They thought you were with me, but when they saw me later they knew you weren\u2019t. After what happened with that asshole, you scared them.\u201d</p><p>Her face fell. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. I just left my phone in the car.\u201d</p><p>Silent, I swiped the washcloth under her cheeks, erasing the streaky makeup. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI overreacted. The guy . . . he really hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. He just surprised me and I overreacted. I ruined the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ruin the party. And that son of a bitch shouldn\u2019t have been grabbing you. Fuck. I heard you say \u2018let me go\u2019 and I know damn well he did, too. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have reacted as . . . strongly as I did, but fuck it. He was grabbing you and I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders slumped forward. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to come here. You should be at the party having fun.\u201d</p><p>I honestly couldn\u2019t believe that she thought I should be at the party while she was here crying. She watched me, her features pinched with confusion. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what friends do. They check on each other. Brittany and Jacob would\u2019ve been here, but I made them stay there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get my phone and call\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text Brittany. I got her number.\u201d I sat back, watching her. \u201cThe fact that you wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to check up on you is . . . I don\u2019t even know what it is.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened, then she shook her head and started to look away. I palmed her cheek, stopping her. Using my thumb, I chased away the last of the tears that had been there. Her damp lashes lifted, and I would give anything to take back every one of her tears that fell.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you crying?\u201d I asked. \u201cWait. Did that fucker hurt you, because I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d I held my breath as she turned her cheek into my palm. \u201cTalk to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I was just being a girl.\u201d</p><p>My brows shot up \u201cYou sure that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>There was more, there had to be, but how did one ask a question like that? I didn\u2019t know. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Shortcake nodded.</p><p>I moved my hand down, brushing my thumb over her lip by accident, but when I did, she inhaled softly. Our eyes locked. The same feeling I had while we were at the party hit me in the chest. I wanted to kiss her. I wanted to make her forget Tony and the party and all those tears. But the first time I kissed her I didn\u2019t want her to taste her own tears.</p><p>Closing the space between us, I pressed my forehead to hers and let out a tired breath. \u201cYou drive me fucking insane sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>I pulled back, searching her face. \u201cDon\u2019t run off like that again, okay? I was worried shitless when I couldn\u2019t find you and no one knew where you were.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake stared at me and then she scooted forward, pressing a kiss to my cheek, surprising the ever-loving shit out of me. My eyes widened as I leaned back, unable to look away from her. I started to say screw the not kissing part right now, but I stopped myself. \u201cAvery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>With all seriousness, I held her gaze. \u201cGo out on a date with me.\u201d</p><p>There was a tiny second of hesitation where her lips parted and two tiny pink spots bloomed on her cheeks, but then she spoke and at first I didn\u2019t think I heard her right, but I did.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>When Brittany cornered me outside of sports management the following Wednesday, I really had no idea what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d she asked, huddled down in her neon-pink hoodie. Short strands of blonde hair framed her face.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I guided her over to one of the empty benches. \u201cIs Avery okay?\u201d</p><p>Her lips tipped up as she leaned forward. The faint smell of smoke lingered on her clothes. In her hand, she turned a lighter over. \u201cShe\u2019s as okay as Avery ever is.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head toward her, frowning slightly. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fastened on mine. \u201cCome on, Cam. As much as you hang out with Avery . . .\u201d She trailed off, shaking her head as her lips pursed. \u201cAnyway, she told me that she finally told you yes? That she\u2019d go out with you?\u201d</p><p>My frown faded, but I really had no idea where this conversation was going. \u201cYes, she did. We\u2019re going out Saturday night.\u201d Or at least I believed so. \u201cUnless she\u2019s changed her mind and is planning to bail on me.\u201d</p><p>Brittany shook her head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to bail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWell, you never really know with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d I paused, turning toward her. \u201cSo, I doubt you wanted to confirm that she said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She took a deep breath as she sat back, twisting the blue lighter between her fingers. \u201cI\u2019m going to be straight with you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, her bright eyes landing on mine, and I fought a grin at the seriousness in her expression. \u201cAvery really does like you. I know she probably doesn\u2019t show it, but she does.\u201d</p><p>I relaxed. \u201cI know she does.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cBut do you really like her?\u201d Another class had let out and a rush of people filled the walkway, blocking the wind. \u201cBecause I know what you were like in high school and you could seriously have any girl here, but you want the one who\u2019s turned you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I folded my arms. \u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because she\u2019s a challenge to you?\u201d she asked, not looking away. \u201cBecause if you\u2019re going out with her because she\u2019s not easy, I swear to God, I will cut you.\u201d</p><p>I burst into laughter. \u201cCut me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201d</p><p>Struggling to stop laughing, I nodded and hopefully plastered a serious look on my face. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She nodded. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>I bit the inside of my cheek. \u201cI like her, Brittany. It has nothing to do with a challenge or any shit like that. And the way I was in school is obviously not the way I am now.\u201d I took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. \u201cAnd I know she\u2019s . . . different.\u201d</p><p>Brittany nodded again and she didn\u2019t say anything to that. Part of me was glad that someone else had picked up on a few of Avery\u2019s behaviors, or she could\u2019ve confided in her, but there was another part that was uneasy. I glanced at her. \u201cDid she tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I laughed. \u201cDid she tell you . . . ?\u201d Still, I had no idea how to ask the question. Luckily, Brittany got what I wasn\u2019t willing to say.</p><p>\u201cIt was the way she acted at the party, so I asked her the other day.\u201d Brittany stood, slipping the lighter into the pocket of her jeans. My stomach tightened as I waited. She gripped the strap on her bag. \u201cShe told me nothing happened to her.\u201d</p><p>Air stopped somewhere in my throat. \u201cDo you believe her?\u201d</p><p>She stepped back and then forward, lowering her voice. \u201cShe looked me straight in the eye and said nothing happened. I don\u2019t know what to believe. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but you\u2019re her friend, she would\u2019ve told you.\u201d I hoped that was the case. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d she replied, smiling tightly. \u201cI\u2019ve got to run before I\u2019m late to history. Yay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I stood.</p><p>Brittany turned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good friend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled as she dug a cigarette out of her bag. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>A certain edginess had me strung tight as I pulled the black sweater over my head and then went in search of my shoes. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I was this nervous, but it made sense. How many weeks\u2014hell months\u2014did it take for me to get Shortcake to say yes? I had a reason to be nervous.</p><p>I slipped out of the apartment before Ollie could make an appearance. My heart was pounding way too fast and my head was full of too much to deal with whatever smartass comments that would come from him.</p><p>When I knocked on Shortcake\u2019s door, it opened almost immediately, and the nervousness turned into something completely different when I laid eyes on Avery.</p> <p>The deep green blouse she wore mixed with the loveliness of her hair and complexion. Part of me couldn\u2019t even believe I noticed that and was about to start waxing poetic verses in my head. The ever-present bracelet was in place. My gaze traveled down the skintight jeans tucked into black boots and then back up, straying where the soft red waves curled over her breasts.</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cYou look . . . really, really great.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her chin as I stepped into her apartment. \u201cThank you. So do you.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, I leaned against the back of her couch. \u201cYou ready? Got a jacket?\u201d</p><p>Shortcake spun around, practically darting back down the hall. She returned with a black coat and started for the door. I picked up her purse and handed it over.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her cheeks flamed and then she breathlessly added, \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite yet.\u201d I stilled her, brushing the strands of hair back over her shoulders and then set about buttoning her jacket. \u201cIt\u2019s freezing outside.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake stared up at me as I continued up her coat, slipping the buttons into the holes. My knuckles grazed where her jacket swelled sweetly and she shuddered in a way that made me want to pull her close.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I murmured, forcing myself to lower my hands. \u201cNow we\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>I held the door open and the moment we stepped out into the hall, Ollie burst out from our apartment, cell phone in one hand and a wiggling Raphael in the other.</p><p>What the . . . ?</p> <p>\u201cSmile!\u201d Ollie snapped a picture. \u201cIt\u2019s like my two kids are going to prom.\u201d</p><p>Oh. My. God.</p><p>\u201cPutting this in my scrapbook. Have fun!\u201d Grinning, Ollie bounced back into the apartment, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Shortcake looked up at me. \u201cUm . . .\u201d</p><p>I laughed loudly. \u201cOh God, that was different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t normally do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I put my hand on her lower back. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here before he tries to go along with us.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cWith Raphael?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRaphael would be welcomed. Ollie, however, would not be.\u201d I grinned as we hit the steps. \u201cThe last thing I\u2019d want is for you to be distracted on this date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d Avery blurted out, and then squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cOkay. Don\u2019t answer that.\u201d</p><p>The small candle on the linen-covered table flickered in the space between us. We\u2019d placed our orders with the waiter, and Avery had nervously bounced from one topic to the next as she nibbled on her bread.</p><p>What had provoked that question had been the truth. I had told her that she didn\u2019t have to worry about impressing me. And she had stared at me like I was a crackhead and had asked that question.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even believe she had asked the question. Sometimes the woman absolutely dumbfounded me.</p><p>The waiter arrived with our food, deterring me for about two minutes. \u201cI\u2019m going to answer that question.\u201d</p><p>She cringed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>I picked up my glass, eyeing her over the rim. \u201cNo, I think I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a stupid question to ask, but you\u2019re gorgeous, Cam.\u201d Her fingers clenched the silverware. \u201cYou\u2019re nice and you\u2019re funny. You\u2019re smart. I\u2019ve been turning you down for two months. You could go out with anyone, but you\u2019re here with me.\u201d</p><p>A grin pulled at my lips. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the girl who\u2019s never been out on a date before.\u201d She looked up, meeting my gaze. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m here with you because I want to be\u2014because I like you. Ah\u2014let me finish.\u201d The look of doubt that crossed her face was obvious. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you. You\u2019re different\u2014in a good way, so get that look off your face.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll admit, some of the times I asked you out, I knew you weren\u2019t going to say yes. And maybe while I wasn\u2019t always being serious when I did, I was always serious about wanting to take you out. You get that? And I like hanging out with you.\u201d I popped a piece of steak into my mouth. \u201cAnd hey, I think I\u2019m a pretty damn good catch for your first date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d She laughed, crinkling the skin around her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said you were a good catch.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI am. Now eat your chicken before I do.\u201d</p><p>And she did.</p><p>More importantly, she finally relaxed enough to be enjoying herself. And wasn\u2019t that the whole point of a date? I liked to think so.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you doing for Thanksgiving?\u201d I asked. \u201cGoing back home to Texas?\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going home?\u201d</p><p>Shortcake finished off the last of her chicken. \u201cI\u2019m staying here. Are you going home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home, not sure exactly when.\u201d I didn\u2019t like the idea of her being here alone. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously not going home at all? It\u2019s more than a week\u2014nine days. You have time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents . . . are traveling, so I\u2019m staying here.\u201d Her gaze flicked away. \u201cDo your parents do the big Thanksgiving dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, distracted.</p><p>As the check arrived and we headed out into the chilly night air, I dropped an arm over her shoulder, tucking her close as we walked across the dark parking lot. She didn\u2019t resist, instead staying pressed to my side.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good dinner?\u201d I asked once inside the truck, smacking my hands together and rubbing them.</p><p>\u201cYes. And thank you for the food. I mean, dinner. Thank you.\u201d She closed her eyes and even though it was too dark for me to see, I knew she blushed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d I grinned. \u201cThank you for finally agreeing to let me take you out.\u201d</p><p>She sent me a tentative smile, and a comforting silence fell between us, which was good. My thoughts kept going back to the fact she wasn\u2019t doing anything for Thanksgiving. It seemed wrong and lonely and about a hundred other things to spend a holiday alone. An idea formed in my head, one I doubted Avery would go for, but I had to try.</p><p>When we got back to University Heights, we stopped in front of her door and the most awkward moment in any date was about to occur. Part of me couldn\u2019t wait to see how she handled this.</p><p>Shortcake turned to me, gaze fixed on my chest as she fiddled with the strap on her purse.</p><p>\u201cSo . . .\u201d I drew the word out, silently praying that she didn\u2019t say good-bye.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d she asked, and I did an internal fist bump. \u201cFor something to drink? I have coffee or hot chocolate. I don\u2019t have any beer or anything more\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot chocolate would be good.\u201d Tap water would be good enough. \u201cOnly if you have the kind with those tiny marshmallows.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake\u2019s wide smile did something funny to my chest. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen lead the way, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>While she headed into the kitchen, I went into the living room. She joined me on the couch with two cups of hot chocolate. She\u2019d kicked off her boots and tucked her feet under her. I decided there was no one cuter than her. Ever.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I took one, watching the steam billow from the top. \u201cGot a question for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Little marshmallows nudged my lips as I took a sip. \u201cSo, based on your first-date experience, would you go out on a second?\u201d</p><p>She smiled lightly. \u201cLike a second in general?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn general.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this was a very good first date. If second dates were like this, then I guess I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I watched her closely. \u201cWith just anyone or . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lowered. \u201cNot with just anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would have to be someone in particular?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI think it would have to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d When she lifted her gaze to mine, her eyes were soft and endless. \u201cIs this someone in particular going to have to wait another two months if they ask you out?\u201d</p><p>Her grin formed around the rim of her mug. \u201cDepends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mood.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cGet ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you out again\u2014not dinner, because I like to change things up. It\u2019s to the movies.\u201d</p><p>She tapped a finger off her cheek. \u201cMovies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a drive-in movie, one of the last ones around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside?\u201d Excitement glimmered in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYep. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019d keep you warm.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, grinning. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay to the movies?\u201d</p><p>Sucking her bottom lip in between her teeth, she nodded.</p><p>Wait. What? It would be that easy? \u201cSeriously, it isn\u2019t going to take me another two months?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head no.</p><p>I laughed under my breath, knowing the hard part waited. \u201cOkay. How about Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext Wednesday?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>She settled against the couch. \u201cThe following Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Her brown eyes pinched into a frown. \u201cWait. That\u2019s the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam, aren\u2019t you going home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d she asked. \u201cAfter the movies, in the middle of the night, or Thanksgiving morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, the drive-in movie theater is just outside of my hometown. About ten miles out.\u201d</p><p>Avery stared at me, her eyes widening. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Drinking the rest of the hot chocolate, I set it aside and then scooted over until very little space separated us. \u201cIf you go on this date with me, you\u2019re going to have to go home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She burst my eardrum as she sat up straight. \u201cGo home with you?\u201d</p><p>To keep from laughing, I pressed my lips together and nodded.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerious as my pierced eardrum,\u201d I told her. \u201cCome home with me. We\u2019ll have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home with you\u2014to your parents\u2019 house? Basically for Thanksgiving?\u201d I nodded and she smacked my arm. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Cam.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not being stupid. I\u2019m being serious. My parents won\u2019t mind.\u201d I thought about what I had told my father. \u201cActually, they\u2019d probably be happy to see someone other than me. And my mom likes to cook way too much food. The more mouths, the better.\u201d</p><p>She continued to stare at me, mouth agape.</p><p>Not looking good. \u201cWe can leave whenever you want, but obviously before Wednesday afternoon. You finishing the rest of your hot chocolate?\u201d I took the mug when she shook her head. \u201cAnd we can come back whenever.\u201d</p><p>Avery watched me finish it off. \u201cI can\u2019t go with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of a hundred obvious reasons, Cam. Your parents are going to think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not going to think anything.\u201d That was probably a lie, but she didn\u2019t need to know that. I sighed. \u201cOkay. Look at it this way. It\u2019s better than you sitting home, by yourself, all week. What are you going to do? Sit around and read? And miss me, because you\u2019re going to miss me. And then I\u2019m going to have spend most of my time texting you and feeling bad that you\u2019re sitting home, all alone, and can\u2019t even eat McDonalds because they\u2019re closed on Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel sorry for me. It\u2019s not a big deal. I have no problem staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you sitting here alone and you\u2019re making this into a big deal. I\u2019m a friend asking a friend to come hang out with me over Thanksgiving break.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a friend who just took a friend out on a date!\u201d she protested.</p><p>I set the mug next to mine. \u201cAh, that\u2019s a good point.\u201d</p><p>Picking up a pillow, she held it to her chest like a shield. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. Visiting family over the holidays? That\u2019s way too\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded furiously. \u201cWay too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then I guess it\u2019s a good thing that we\u2019re not seeing each other then, because yes, it would be too fast if that was the case.\u201d</p> <p>Her head cocked to the side. \u201cWhat the what?\u201d</p><p>I tugged the pillow away from her and slid it behind me. \u201cYou and I are two friends who went out on one date. Maybe two if you come with me. We\u2019re not dating each other. We\u2019re just friends who had one date. So we will be going back to my house as friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make perfect sense. We haven\u2019t even kissed, Avery. We\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw hit the couch.</p><p>\u201cCome home with me, Avery. I promise you it won\u2019t be uncomfortable. My parents would be happy to have you. You will have a good time and it will be better than what you\u2019d end up doing here. And nothing, absolutely nothing is expected from you. Okay?\u201d</p><p>The word no was easily forming on her lips, but she averted her gaze as she turned away, staring at the empty mugs on the coffee table. Several moments passed and then she twisted toward me, her lashes lifting. She swallowed. \u201cYour parents really would be okay with this?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t telling me no now. This was good. \u201cI\u2019ve brought friends home before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGirls?\u201d When I shook my head, she clasped her hands together. \u201cAnd your parents are really going to think we\u2019re just friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I have a reason to tell them we weren\u2019t dating if we were? If I say we\u2019re friends, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll think.\u201d I met her stare and held my breath.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go home with you,\u201d she said in a rush. \u201cThis is an insane idea.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I couldn\u2019t process anything beyond the fact that she had said yes. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect idea.\u201d Since she was in such a wonderfully agreeable mood . . . \u201cLet\u2019s hug on it.\u201d</p><p>Her brow knitted. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHug on it. Once you hug on it, you can\u2019t go back on it.\u201d</p><p>Avery rolled her eyes. \u201cOh my God, are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery serious.\u201d</p><p>She grumbled as she rose onto her knees and stretched out her arms. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s hug to seal our deal before I change\u2014\u201d</p><p>My arms went around her waist and I tugged her closer. Her leg tangled between mine as I hugged her. Within seconds, her scent surrounded me. \u201cDeal is sealed, sweetheart. Thanksgiving is at the Hamiltons\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She murmured something nearly incoherent as she lifted her head. Our mouths lined up and understanding flashed across her face. \u201cYou . . .\u201d</p><p>I chuckled, and her lips parted. \u201cSmooth move, huh? Got you all the way over here. I would\u2019ve taken you on your word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wrong.\u201d Her eyes glimmered, and anticipation rose in a rush.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wrong in all the right ways. I have to admit something.\u201d Lowering my head, I brushed my lips over her smooth, soft cheek, briefly closing my eyes at the sweet sensation that radiated from my lips. \u201cI lied earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Very carefully, so that I didn\u2019t send her screaming to the mountains, I slowly slid my hands to her lower back. \u201cWhen I said you looked great? I wasn\u2019t being completely honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I look great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I trailed a hand up her spine, stopping just below her hair as I pressed my temple against hers. \u201cYou look beautiful tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her soft inhale warmed me. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Kissing her was probably pushing my luck, but she was so close and she wasn\u2019t pulling away. I had been waiting forever to taste her lips. My heart thundered, rushing heated blood through my veins.</p><p>Avery tensed when my lips swept over the hollow of her cheek and then her hands landed on my biceps. As I neared her lips, I could almost taste the hint of chocolate I knew would linger on them. \u201cAvery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>My pulse pounded in several parts of my body. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been kissed before, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cJust so we\u2019re clear. This isn\u2019t a kiss.\u201d</p><p>Before she could speak, I swept my lips over hers. It was barely a kiss, more like a brief meet and greet, but the shock that traveled through my system blew the air out of my lungs.</p><p>\u201cYou kissed me.\u201d Avery\u2019s fingers clenched my arms.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a kiss.\u201d She shuddered as my lips brushed hers. \u201cRemember? If we\u2019ve kissed, then that means you going home with me could potentially mean something more serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she sighed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is also not a kiss.\u201d</p><p>I kissed her for real this time, tracing the pattern of her lips, learning the feel of them. They were as soft as I believed they\u2019d be, absolutely perfect against mine. When she leaned into me, making a tiny breathy sound, lust fueled by something far deeper slammed into me.</p><p>This was her first\u2014I was her first kiss. No one could take that away from us. And no matter what happened a week from now or a month, we would always have this. A primal male pride wrapped itself around me.</p><p>Closer\u2014I needed her closer, to feel her body under mine. I shifted her onto her back, keeping only my mouth on hers, and her lips moved against mine. She was kissing me back, tiny little ones that were clumsy and yet entirely sexy in their artlessness.</p><p>A sound came from deep within me and my body demanded that I sink into her, but I held myself above her, coaxing her lips open. She shuddered under me, and I shook with a need I\u2019d never quite felt before. Her mouth opened, and I slipped inside, flicking my tongue over hers, deepening the kiss. Her back arched and when her breasts grazed my chest I had to throw the brakes on.</p><p>Lifting my head was the hardest thing I\u2019d ever done. It seemed to go against nature, made even more difficult when a whimper escaped her as I nipped at her lower lip.</p><p>She was breathing heavily, like me, eyes unfocused. \u201cStill not a kiss?\u201d</p><p>Sitting back, I pulled her up. My gaze roamed over her face, searching for any sign that she hadn\u2019t enjoyed the kiss. What I found was the exact opposite. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes fevered, and her chest rose and fell rapidly.</p><p>I reached between us, running my thumb over her lower lip as I leaned in. \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t a kiss.\u201d I brushed my lips over hers, swallowing her sweet sigh. \u201cThat was a good night.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>\u201cA girl?\u201d</p><p>I stared at the ceiling of my bedroom. \u201cYes, Mom, a girl.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause on the other end of the phone. \u201cA lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA real, live female?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOpposed to a fake, dead female?\u201d</p><p>Mom shushed me. \u201cYou\u2019re actually bringing a girl with you home?\u201d</p><p>I started to frown. \u201cWhy do you sound so shocked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never bring a girl home, Cameron. You\u2014hold on. Honey!\u201d A rustling sound interrupted her and then, \u201cHoney, Cameron is bringing a real, live girl home for Thanksgiving! Can you believe it? No. I can\u2019t\u2014what . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I groaned, squeezing my eyes shut. Maybe this wasn\u2019t a good idea.</p><p>Her voice was closer to the mouthpiece. \u201cYour father wants to know if her name is Avery?\u201d</p><p>I smacked my hand over my eyes. \u201cYes, it is, but she\u2019s just a friend. I mean it, Mom. She\u2019s only a friend, so don\u2019t act like a freak when you meet her and start planning our wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of insulting.\u201d She huffed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t start planning your wedding unless you brought her home for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>After an absurd amount of time convincing Mom and then Dad that Avery really was just a friend and to not force me to commit patricide on them, I hung up the phone and tossed it onto the pillow next to me.</p><p>A slow smile started across my lips as I pictured Shortcake at home with my parents.</p><p>High-pitched giggles radiated from the living room, mixing with the rough, low laughter of Ollie\u2019s. I didn\u2019t even have to guess what was going on out there.</p><p>Groaning, I yanked the pillow out from under my head and smashed it over my face, trying to drown out the sound. It was bad enough that I was in a constant state of hardness. I didn\u2019t need an amateur porn flick about to go down in the living room.</p><p>I was her first kiss.</p><p>Pride swelled in my chest and other parts of my body were also following the same reaction, which wasn\u2019t helping things. After our date, I\u2019d spent most the night with my hand fisted around my cock. And pretty much every night thereafter. Being around her didn\u2019t make it easier, but I couldn\u2019t stay away from her. Not kissing her again was driving me mad.</p><p>Once it quieted a bit in the living room, I peeked my head out from underneath the pillow. I really hoped that whatever Ollie was doing out there with whoever was not on the couch.</p><p>I had to sit on that thing.</p><p>Rolling onto my side, I grabbed my phone. I told myself not to, because I would see her tomorrow when we left for my house, but I was a loser, so therefore I couldn\u2019t stop myself and I texted her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hey.</p><p>The response was almost immediate. Hey you.</p><p>My lips curled up. What u doing?</p><p>Reading your text. There was a pause and another text came through. Also reading ahead in history.</p> <p>I laughed. Nerd.</p><p>Jerk.</p><p>Easing onto my back, I sent her another text. Admit it.</p><p>Admit what?</p><p>U r excited abt tmrow.</p> <p>About a minute passed, and I sat up, frowning. Finally a response came through. I am.</p><p>Took u that long? I sent back. Fo shame.</p><p>LOL. Sorry. Figured I\u2019d make you sweat.</p><p>Shaking my head, I swung my legs off the bed and went to the bedroom door, peeking outside. The living room was dark, but not empty. Two forms were entangled on a makeshift bed made out of pillows and blankets. Grimacing, I crept around them.</p><p>I sent her one more text. Knock. Knock.</p><p>Goosebumps spread across my bare chest as I slipped out into the hallway. My phone dinged and I glanced down. Sigh. Who\u2019s there?</p> <p>Grinning like an idiot, I hurried to her door, rapping my knuckles.</p><p>About ten seconds later, the door swung open. Avery stood there, her iPhone clutched in her right hand. Her mouth opened, then she snapped it shut and pursed her lips.</p><p>I leaned through her doorway, smiling shamelessly as her gaze drifted over my abs and then my chest, getting hung up on the sun tattoo. \u201cHey, girl, hey . . .\u201d</p><p>She burst into laughter as she took a step back. \u201cYou are . . . oh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a sexy beast, I know. Anyway, there\u2019s something else I want you to admit.\u201d</p><p>Pulling her cardigan around her, she stared at me as she pressed her sock-covered feet together. \u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too hot to be cold.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat do you want me to admit?\u201d</p> <p>I flashed a quick grin and then shot forward, moving quickly. Her chest rose sharply and her lips parted, as if she anticipated a kiss. As I neared, I saw her lashes flutter closed, and hunger surged through me.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t kiss her lips. Damn, I wanted to more than anything at that moment, but I knew I had to take things slow with my little Shortcake.</p><p>So I kissed the tip of her nose.</p><p>Avery jerked back as her eyes flew open and a wide smile broke out across her face. A soft, light giggle erupted from her, and I knew I\u2019d do a ton of terrible things to hear that sound again.</p><p>\u201cAdmit it,\u201d I said, my voice husky. \u201cYou enjoyed that.\u201d</p><p>Eyes dancing and cheeks flushed, she tilted her head to the side. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>It was only after I was back in my own bed that I realized that the bracelet she always wore around her left wrist had been absent.</p><p>The giggling girl from last night was nowhere to be found today. For the last hour of our trip, she had been nibbling on her fingernail for so long I wondered how any of it was left.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure your parents are okay with this?\u201d she asked for the hundredth time, and I nodded for the hundredth time. \u201cAnd you did actually call them and ask, right?\u201d</p><p>Casting a sideways look at her, I couldn\u2019t stop myself from teasing her. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam!\u201d she shrieked.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. Chill out, Avery. I told them the day after you said you\u2019d go. They know you\u2019re coming and they\u2019re excited to meet you.\u201d</p><p>She glared at me as she started chewing on her thumbnail again. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerk,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cNerd.\u201d</p><p>One side of her lips curved up. \u201cBitch-ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I whistled. \u201cThem be fighting words. Keep it up and I\u2019ll turn this truck around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be distraught and in tears.\u201d I reached over, pulling her hand away from her mouth. \u201cStop doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s a bad habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d I threaded my fingers through hers and brought our joined hands down to my thigh, holding it there.</p><p>To distract her, I started talking about the recital my sister was having tonight. Teresa wouldn\u2019t be home until early tomorrow morning. The change of subject seemed to work. Truth be told, as we hit the narrow streets of my hometown, I was nervous.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t brought a girl home since high school, and honestly, those times before really didn\u2019t count. Not in this way.</p><p>I glanced over at Avery as we came to a red light. She was watching the WVU flag billowing in the wind, her hand still neatly tucked within mine.</p><p>\u201cYou hanging in there?\u201d I asked, squeezing her hand.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She squeezed my hand back.</p><p>My throat was dry as I hit the private road leading up to the house. Out of the corner of my eyes, I watched her reaction.</p><p>Her eyes widened as she slipped her hand free and leaned forward. Mom had already broken out some of the Christmas decorations. Large green wreaths hung on the front door and on the windows on the second and third floor.</p><p>I parked next to the garage and faced Shortcake, smiling slightly. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>A brief flash of panic across her face caused me to fear that she\u2019d take off for the woods, but then she nodded and stepped out. When she reached back to grab her bag, I took it.</p><p>\u201cI can carry it,\u201d she said.</p><p>I glanced down at the bag I\u2019d slung over my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll carry it. Besides I think the pink-and-blue flower print looks amazing on me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed nervously. \u201cIt\u2019s very flattering on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought so.\u201d I waited for Shortcake to make her way over to me and then walked up the slate pathway. We headed under the covered patio, passing the wicker furniture that Dad hadn\u2019t stowed away yet. One look at Avery, and I winced. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to have a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose.\u201d Moving closer to her, I tucked a lonely strand of her hair back as I bent down, catching her stare. \u201cYou have no reason to be nervous, okay? I promise.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flickered from my eyes to my mouth. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The urge to capture her mouth and taste the sweetness that was unique to her was hard to resist, but I did. Turning, I opened the door and was met with the scent of apple. My stomach grumbled. That better be pie I was smelling.</p><p>I led a wide-eyed Avery between the pool tables and the air-hockey table to the stairs. Her gaze darted everywhere, not missing a single thing. I found myself hoping that she liked what she saw, which was weird, because none of this was mine.</p><p>\u201cThis is the man cave,\u201d I told her, guiding her to the stairs. \u201cDad spends a lot of time down here. There\u2019s the poker table he kicked my ass on.\u201d</p><p>A small smile pulled at her lips. \u201cI like it down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d I hesitated at the bottom of the steps. \u201cMom and Dad are probably upstairs. . . .\u201d</p><p>She nodded as she pulled away, silently following me up the stairs and through the living room. Magazines were scattered across the coffee table. Meaning that Teresa had had friends over at some point.</p><p>\u201cLiving room,\u201d I said, going through an archway. \u201cAnd this is the second living room or some room that no one sits in. Maybe it\u2019s a sitting room? Who knows? And this is the formal dining room that we never use but have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do too use the dining room!\u201d shouted Mom. \u201cMaybe once or twice a year, when we have company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd break the \u2018good dishes\u2019 out,\u201d I said, glancing down at Avery.</p><p>She came to a complete stop at the end of the coffee table, her face paling. I turned, wanting to make this easier for her, but not sure how, and then Mom strolled into the room, smoothing a strand of hair back into her ponytail.</p><p>Mom made a beeline for me, catching me in a hug before I could move. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where the \u2018good dishes\u2019 are, Cameron.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cWherever they are, they\u2019re probably hiding from the paper plates.\u201d</p><p>Mom laughed as she pulled back, holding on to my shoulders. \u201cGood to have you home. Your father is starting to get on my nerves with all his \u2018going hunting\u2019 talk.\u201d Her gaze drifted to Avery and her smile widened. \u201cAnd this must be Avery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God no,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is Candy, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Color spread across her cheeks as she stepped back, dropping her arms. \u201cUh, I\u2019m . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Avery,\u201d Shortcake said, shooting me a withering look that made me want to kiss her. \u201cYou had it right.\u201d</p><p>Mom spun, smacking me across the arm. My skin stung. \u201cCameron! Oh my God, I thought . . .\u201d She smacked me again, and I laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re terrible.\u201d Shaking her head, she turned back to Avery. \u201cYou must be a patient young lady to have survived a trip here with this idiot.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake blinked and then a laugh burst from her. Of course, she laughed at that. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mom looked over her shoulder at me. \u201cAnd she\u2019s well mannered. It\u2019s okay. I know my son is a . . . handful. By the way, you can call me Dani. Everyone does.\u201d</p><p>Mom hugged Shortcake before the poor girl could even see it coming, and I don\u2019t know why, but seeing those two together did something weird to my chest. My heart started to pound when Avery seemed to unstiffen, wrapping her arms around my mom.</p><p>\u201cThank you for letting me come up,\u201d Shortcake said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem. We love having the company. Come on, let\u2019s go meet the guy who thinks he\u2019s my better half. And dear God, I apologize ahead of time if he starts talking to you about how many eight-point bucks he\u2019s planning to hunt this weekend.\u201d</p><p>I watched as Mom took over, guiding Shortcake through the house, and my heart still hadn\u2019t stopped pounding like a hammer to a stubborn nail.</p><p>Shortcake looked over her shoulder, her gaze finding mine, and she smiled as our eyes met. I winked and . . .</p><p>And her smile widened.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Watching Avery with my sister was painful at first. Shortcake was almost unbearably shy and my sister, God love her, had to lead her through almost every conversation, gently pulling her in. But eventually she relaxed, talking to Teresa about dance, and she even volunteered to help my sister get the sides ready for dinner.</p><p>The moment Dad and I were alone, he turned to me in the recliner, smiling slightly. \u201cShe\u2019s a good girl, Cameron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, she\u2019s a really good girl.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him, brows raised. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Dad watched me closely, that strange smile still playing over his lips. \u201cDid she ever go out on a date with you?\u201d</p><p>My lips twitched. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know the answer.\u201d Dad tipped his head back. \u201cAre you two seeing each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I told you and Mom the truth. She\u2019s not my girlfriend.\u201d I paused, thinking about the conversation I\u2019d overheard this morning between Mom and Avery. I would be bringing her home for Christmas and she would be my girlfriend by then. \u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>Dad looked like he was about to laugh but didn\u2019t. Opening his eyes, he turned his head and looked me dead-on. \u201cHave you told her about what happened?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Muscles in my stomach clenched. I knew what he was talking about, but didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Dad sighed. \u201cBoy, you know how I feel about what happened. Was it necessarily the right thing to do? No. But if you hadn\u2019t done it, I would have. But you need to tell her if you\u2019re serious about her. Secrets are . . . well, sometimes they are necessary and sometimes they kill things before they have a chance to grow. You get what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>I found myself nodding, but as my gaze drifted to where Avery and my sister had disappeared from, I felt knots of unease twist in my stomach. I knew I wasn\u2019t the only one with secrets.</p><p>I was ten seconds from grabbing my sister\u2019s cell phone and throwing it across the room during Thanksgiving dinner. I dumped another mound of yams on my plate. \u201cWho do you keep texting?\u201d</p> <p>Teresa smirked. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>I arched a brow. \u201cI\u2019m your brother, it\u2019s my business. Mom . . .\u201d I paused, looking across the table. \u201cYou should tell your daughter it\u2019s rude to text at the table.\u201d</p><p>Mom sent me a dry look. \u201cIt\u2019s not hurting anyone.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was no help. I nudged Shortcake with my knee, and not for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s hurting my soul,\u201d I murmured to her.</p><p>Avery rolled her eyes as she knocked my leg back.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s sad.\u201d Teresa dropped the phone in her lap. \u201cSo, Avery, how did you end up in West Virginia?\u201d</p><p>She whipped her spoon through the mashed potatoes. \u201cI wanted to go someplace different. My family is originally from Ohio, so West Virginia seemed like a good place to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be honest, I would\u2019ve picked New York or Florida or Virginia or Maryland or\u2014\u201d She looked down when her phone chirped and grabbed her cell.</p><p>My eyes narrowed as I knocked Avery\u2019s knee. Curious as to who my sister could be chatting with, I acted like I was grabbing for turkey, but went for the phone instead.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Teresa shouted. \u201cGive it back!\u201d</p><p>Avoiding her grabby hands, I leaned over into Avery as my gaze flicked to the screen. Murphy? What the fuck? \u201cWho\u2019s Murphy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business! God.\u201d Teresa grabbed for the cell. \u201cGive me back my phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it back when you tell me who Murphy is? A boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>The red cheeks were enough of an answer. Granted, I didn\u2019t expect my sister to stay single forever, but she hadn\u2019t been serious since that dickhead.</p><p>She slammed her back into her seat, folding her arms. \u201cMom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam, give her back the phone,\u201d she ordered, and when I didn\u2019t budge, her smile tightened in the way that was rare for her. \u201cWe\u2019ve met Murphy. He\u2019s a really good boy.\u201d</p><p>I was pretty sure that was what everyone had said about the dickhead.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really nice and I like him,\u201d Teresa said quietly.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s not a ringing\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not Jeremy,\u201d Dad cut in. \u201cGive her back the phone.\u201d</p><p>Avery had been staring at her plate and when her hand landed on my upper thigh, I suddenly wasn\u2019t thinking about Jeremy the Dickhead or Teresa\u2019s phone.</p><p>Her hand was on my thigh, so close to where I wanted it to be, and in that moment, call me what you want, I didn\u2019t give a fuck that it was Thanksgiving dinner. If she just slid her hand up a\u2014</p><p>Avery snatched the cell phone from my hands.</p><p>Son of a bitch. \u201cHey, that was so not fair.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at me as she stretched around me, handing the phone back to Teresa. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, smiling at Shortcake like she was the messiah of cell phones.</p><p>I shot her a very promising look before I twisted toward Teresa. \u201cI want to meet this Murphy.\u201d</p><p>My sister sighed but relented. \u201cOkay. Let me know when.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea what Shortcake thought about this and it wasn\u2019t until after the conversation picked back up that I knew this whole situation had to be weird to her. I thought about what Dad said about secrets and there had been plenty of moments today to bring it up, but none of them had seemed right.</p><p>How do you explain to a girl that it took months to get out on a date that you beat a teenager into a coma? That wasn\u2019t something you brought up over dinner.</p><p>But Dad had been right. I needed to tell her.</p><p>I had to.</p><p>When I left my bedroom that night to go to Avery\u2019s, I had every intention of talking to her. I felt like I did when I used to play soccer, right before a game started and my stomach was located somewhere between my knees and ass.</p><p>Shutting my bedroom door behind me as quiet as a goddamn mouse on Christmas Eve, I jumped a good foot when I heard my name.</p><p>\u201cCam,\u201d Teresa whispered, popping her head out her door several feet down the hall. \u201cYou got a second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I glanced at Shortcake\u2019s door and then forced myself away from it. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to tell you that Murphy\u2019s not really my boyfriend.\u201d Teresa folded her arms along her stomach. \u201cHe\u2019s just a good friend and we\u2019ve gone out on a few dates, but it isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>Relief flooded me. I wanted Teresa to wait until she was thirty and knew how to handle a loaded gun before she started dating again. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, letting out a little breath. \u201cBut if you still want to meet him, I can set that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d No reason not to put the fear of God into a \u201cgood friend.\u201d</p><p>She rocked back on her sock-covered heels as she looked up at me. \u201cI really like Avery, by the way. She\u2019s so sweet and pretty. And smart, which makes me doubt why she\u2019s here with you.\u201d She flashed a quick grin. \u201cI do like her.\u201d</p><p>The change of subject warmed me. \u201cShe is. I\u2019m glad you like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s got my seal of approval.\u201d Teresa stepped back into her bedroom, pausing. She looked like she wanted to say something and then shook her head. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>I waited until I was almost 100 percent positive my little sister wouldn\u2019t catch me sneaking into Shortcake\u2019s room before I knocked on her door as quietly as I could and then opened the door halfway.</p><p>All thoughts of having a nighttime confession went out the window.</p><p>Resting on her elbows, Avery Morgansten was a fucking sight to behold. Her hair hung down her shoulders and her face tilted to the side. There was an impish quality to the look she sent me, part seductress, part na\u00efve. I knew she had no idea how damn good she looked lying there, which made her so much hotter.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Her voice was barely above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to say good night.\u201d That so wasn\u2019t the truth, but I couldn\u2019t remember why I was seeking her out other than I wanted to see her.</p><p>She clenched the bedspread. \u201cYou already told me good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d I slipped into the room, closing the door behind me. I was drawn to her like pencil to paper. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t. Not in the way I want to say good night.\u201d</p><p>Her soft inhale was my undoing, but as I made my way to the bed and sat beside her, I knew that I was always undone around her. And she had no freaking clue.</p><p>My gaze drifted over her upturned face, soaking in the slightly flushed cheeks and parted lips, down to the soft swells under the thin shirt she wore. \u201cI\u2019m glad you decided to come here.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were incredibly wide when they met mine. \u201cI am, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I leaned over her, placing my hand on the other side of her hip. \u201cDid you just admit that?\u201d</p><p>The corners of her lips tilted up. \u201cYeah, I sort of did.\u201d</p><p>My body followed that barely there smile, drawing me toward her until my upper body hovered over hers. \u201cI wish I had my phone to record this moment.\u201d</p><p>Her chest rose sharply as she dragged her gaze to mine. \u201cI\u2019ve . . . had a wonderful time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have I.\u201d I took a breath I didn\u2019t need. \u201cSo what do you think you\u2019re going to do for winter break?\u201d</p><p>She wetted her bottom lip and a wild bolt of need shot through me. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I thought about taking off for D.C. one of the days. I want to see the Smithsonian and the National Mall. I\u2019ve never been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, that could be fun.\u201d My mind was coming up with many different things that could also be fun. \u201cI could be your tour guide.\u201d</p><p>The grin kicked up a notch. \u201cThat . . . that would be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be.\u201d Without knowing it, I\u2019d moved close enough that my breath teased her flushed cheek. \u201cPick a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanuary the second,\u201d she said immediately, and for some reason, that blush of hers deepened. \u201cWill you be available then?\u201d</p><p>My lips curved up. \u201cI\u2019ll be available whenever you want me to be.\u201d My heart thudded in my chest when her smile spread, becoming dazzling. I knew that I hadn\u2019t come in here for this, but I was going to kiss her. There would be no stopping me. \u201cGuess what, Avery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember how you just said you were having a good time?\u201d I tilted my head so that my mouth slanted over hers. \u201cIt\u2019s about to get better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>My nose grazed hers. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you not going to kiss me again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>Long lashes specked with red swept down as my lips brushed over hers. It was such a gentle kiss, but it was like a clap of thunder in my veins. Dropping my weight onto my other arm, I splayed my fingers along her cheek as I pressed a kiss to the corner of her lips and then the other side.</p><p>Sliding my hand along the nape of her neck, I tasted the skin of her jaw, the flesh below her ear. A deep chuckle rumbled through me when she shivered. When I pressed my lips under her ear again, flicking my tongue, she made a sound that blew the thoughts out of my head.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Avery.\u201d</p><p>I kissed her, pressing my lips to hers, working at the seam of her mouth until she opened, allowing me in. The taste of her skin had sparked a fire deep inside me, but the feel of her warm mouth ignited a blazing fire. I couldn\u2019t get enough of her lips, of her kisses or the soft, breathy sounds she was making.</p><p>I groaned as I slid my hand out from underneath her, guiding her onto her back. Her body immediately stiffened, and I knew I needed to tone it down. The last thing I wanted was to scare her.</p><p>God, that was the last thing.</p><p>Cupping her cheek, I softly kissed her until her body relaxed under mine and then, shocking the hell out of me, her small hand ended up under my shirt, pressing against the bare skin of my abs.</p><p>It was like being branded.</p><p>Heat roared through my veins as my body jerked on reflex. Air punched from my lungs. She wanted to touch me? Holy hell, she could touch me. I pulled back, reached down and yanked my shirt over my head.</p><p>Avery\u2019s mouth parted as her gaze moved over my chest, the tattoo, and then down. It was like a touch, but better. My body was burning to feel hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tugged the comforter down and planted my hands on either side of her head, tangling them in her hair. There was a primal part that took over when her hands flattened over the lower part of my stomach. My entire body tightened.</p><p>I dropped my forehead to hers. \u201cYou have no idea what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>She dragged in a deep breath as I lowered my body onto hers. The feel of her softness under me had my pulse pounding like I had run a mile in sand. I clenched my jaw shut as she shifted under me, spreading her thighs and allowing our bodies to meet.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I growled as a tremor shook me to the core.</p> <p>Claiming her lips in a kiss that scorched my skin, I slowly rolled my hips against her. Fuck-a-dee-fuck, pleasure rolled down my spine. I wanted to sink into her, completely lose myself in her. Her hands gripped my sides as I rocked against her, trailing a path down her neck, to the swell of her breast and lower with my hand. I hooked her thigh around my hip, settling deeper against her. Our bodies rocked and her sweet, soft moan echoed in my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI like that sound.\u201d I thrust my hips forward, and she moaned again. \u201cCorrection. I love that fucking sound.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what it was about her, maybe it was everything, but it had never felt this good before, this strong and intense with anyone else. Not even my first time when it had felt like I\u2019d jumped over a hundred-story building.</p><p>My fingers tangled with hers as her tongue flicked over mine, bringing me to an almost painful point where I thought there\u2019d be a good chance I was going to embarrass myself. Even knowing that, I couldn\u2019t stop. I slid my hand up hers, under her sleeve, over delicate skin and\u2014</p><p>My hand stilled as my fingers came to a patch of rough, raised skin. Half of my brain was existing at cock level, but the other part took control. I followed the path of skin, dumbly realizing it formed a thin, straight line down the center of her wrist\u2014the wrist she always covered with a bracelet.</p> <p>No. No fucking way.</p><p>My heart literally stopped as I lifted my head, staring down into her unfocused gaze.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d she said softly, wiggling under me.</p><p>I turned her arm over and I looked. There was no mistaking the deep scar that ran several inches up her vein. My thumb followed it as I realized that this cut\u2014oh God, this cut\u2014had to be severe.</p><p>An ache formed in my chest, pouring through my veins. Muscles tightened and lumps formed. I wanted to wipe the scar away, to erase whatever it was that had caused this, because I knew she had done this to herself.</p><p>\u201cAvery . . . ?\u201d My gaze moved to hers, latching on. I could barely breathe. \u201cOh, Avery, what is this?\u201d</p> <p>A moment or two passed when she stared up at me, the blood leaching from her face, and then she tore her arm free. She clambered out from underneath me, yanking her sleeve down with such force I thought she\u2019d tear the arm off her shirt.</p><p>\u201cAvery . . .\u201d I twisted toward her, reaching out.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, climbing to the end of the bed. \u201cPlease leave.\u201d</p><p>Stomach sinking, I pulled my hand back. \u201cAvery, talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Her entire body trembled as she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAvery\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave!\u201d She shot from the bed, taking a step back like a wounded, caged animal. \u201cJust leave.\u201d</p><p>Every instinct demanded that I not leave, but the wild, horrified glaze to her eyes was more than I could bear. I went to the door and then stopped, trying once more. \u201cAvery, we can talk\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeave.\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The muscles along my back tensed at the broken sound of her voice. I did what she asked. Not because I wanted to, but because it was what she wanted.</p><p>I left.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>The moment I realized that Avery was never coming to astronomy class again, I literally couldn\u2019t believe it. But it had to be the truth. Since the ride back from my parent\u2019s house the Friday after Thanksgiving, I hadn\u2019t heard a peep from her. No response to my calls or my texts. The times that I knocked on her door, there was never an answer even though her car was in the parking lot.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even answered the door for eggs.</p><p>When the weekend came again and the following Monday morning passed without Avery being in astronomy, I knew she had taken an incomplete.</p><p>A motherfucking incomplete.</p><p>It was insane for her to go that far to avoid me, and for what? Because I had seen the scar? I didn\u2019t understand and I wasn\u2019t stupid. She was obviously embarrassed and had gone to great lengths to hide the scar, but it hadn\u2019t been fresh. It was something she had done years ago, so why did she hide from me now?</p><p>I talked to Brittany and even Jacob, since Avery didn\u2019t show in the Den for lunch. Neither of them knew what the hell was going on with Avery. I hadn\u2019t mentioned the scar. I never would, but I had hoped that they had some insight. They had none.</p><p>It was driving me crazy\u2014the silence and the confusion. And the longer it went, the more acid that seemed to collect in the pit of my stomach, the worse the knots and the ache in my chest were getting.</p><p>Short of camping out in front of her door, there was little I could do, but I was determined to talk to her. And it happened on the last day of finals, at the start of winter break. Like a total stalker, I\u2019d been staring out my front window, waiting for Ollie to return with pizza, when I saw her cross the parking lot with her hands full with groceries.</p><p>When I heard the soft footsteps in the hall outside, I threw open the door. Avery was in front of her door, her hair pulled back in a messy ponytail, and the weight of her bags dragging her shoulders down. There was no doubt in my mind that she was trying to ghost through the door before I saw her.</p><p>That hurt.</p><p>And that fucking pissed me off.</p><p>\u201cAvery.\u201d</p><p>Her back stiffened like she\u2019d been shot full of steel. She didn\u2019t turn around or address me, and as my gaze drifted over her, I could see the pink tips of her fingers, strangled from the bags she carried. Some of the steam went out of my anger.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cLet me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look that way.\u201d I stepped closer. \u201cYour fingers are turning purple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She walked into her apartment and I shot forward. Hell to the fucking no. She was not going to disappear on me.</p><p>I took a bag from her, and she jerked like she\u2019d been shocked. She dropped a bag. Items spilled forth. \u201cShit,\u201d she muttered, stooping down.</p><p>I knelt, picking up items I really didn\u2019t see. Her head was bowed as she swiped up a bottle of hair conditioner and then her chin lifted. Our gazes met. Dark shadows had bloomed under eyes, smudges that had not been there before. Was she sleeping? What was she doing during this time? Did she miss me as much as I missed her?</p><p>Avery looked away as she snatched a box of tampons from me. \u201cIf you laugh, I will punch you in the stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare think of laughing.\u201d</p><p>There was also no way in hell that I would let go of anything else because I was getting in that apartment and she was going to talk to me.</p><p>Seeming to sense she wasn\u2019t going to get rid of me, she sighed heavily, like the whole world was about to collapse in on her, and marched into her kitchen.</p><p>She sat the bags on the counter, ripping items out of them. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to help, but thank you. I really need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think you\u2019re going to get rid of me that easily now that I\u2019m in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could only hope.\u201d She shut the fridge door.</p><p>\u201cHa. Funny.\u201d I watched her head back to the counter. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>She stacked the frozen dinners and headed back to the freezer before she spoke. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d Not once did she look at me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m busy. As you can see, I have groceries to put away and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I can help.\u201d I strolled forward, heading to the counter. \u201cAnd we can talk while I help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think you kind of do.\u201d</p><p>Leaving the freezer door open, she spun on me. Her eyes narrowed as cold air wafted out. \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Where in the hell did that come from? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean what you think it does, Avery. Jesus. All I want to do is talk to you. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve been trying to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously I don\u2019t want to talk to you,\u201d she snapped, picking up a pack of hamburger meat and tossing it into the freezer. \u201cAnd you\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Anger pricked over my skin and I struggled to keep control of my temper. \u201cLook, I get that you\u2019re not happy with me, but you have to fill me in on what I did to piss you off so badly that you won\u2019t talk to me or even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything, Cam! I just don\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d She spun around, stalking toward the front door. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not okay.\u201d I followed her into the living room. \u201cThis is not how people act, Avery. They don\u2019t just up and drop a person or hide from them. If there\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to know how people don\u2019t act?\u201d She flinched, and for a moment, she didn\u2019t speak. \u201cPeople also don\u2019t constantly call and harass people who obviously don\u2019t want to see them! How about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarass you? Is that what I\u2019ve been doing?\u201d I laughed hoarsely, unable to comprehend where this conversation had gone. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me? Me being concerned about you is harassing?\u201d</p><p>She took a step back, her eyes wide. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that. You\u2019re not harassing me. I just . . .\u201d She stopped, smoothing her hands over the top of her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>My heart rate kicked up as I stared at her. \u201cThis is about what I saw, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I gestured at her arm. \u201cAvery, you can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her right hand immediately circled the bracelet, as if she could somehow hide what I already knew. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s not about anything. I just don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p><p>My patience stretched thin. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis!\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut and when they reopened, there was a fine sheen. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p><p>Air went out of my lungs like I\u2019d been punched. \u201cGood God, woman, all I\u2019m trying to do is talk to you!\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slowly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery, come on . . .\u201d I started to take a step toward her, but stopped when she moved back, away from me. The look that shot across her face was part fear and part confusion, but it was the fear that drew me to a stop.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. There was no way she was afraid of me, but the look on her face was like being shot through the heart with an UZI.</p><p>That reaction was killer. Had I hurt her somehow? The question was brief as it flashed through my thoughts and I knew the answer. I hadn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>Avery ducked her chin and looked away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My patience snapped. \u201cOkay, you know what? I\u2019m not going to rake myself over fucking hot coals for this. Fuck it.\u201d</p><p>The moment those words left my mouth, part of me wanted to take them back. The other part of me wanted to scream them again from the top of my lungs. I headed for the door and then stopped, cursing under my breath. What came out of my mouth made me wonder if I was a glutton for punishment.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m heading home for winter break. I\u2019ll be back and forth, so if you need anything . . .\u201d She continued to stare at me like she had been, and I laughed again, realizing that all I was doing was making a complete and utter ass out of myself. \u201cYeah, you don\u2019t need anything.\u201d</p><p>I stepped out into the hall and then my body seemed to demand that I make an even bigger ass out of myself. I faced her. Avery hadn\u2019t moved from her spot.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying here, all break by yourself, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I asked. \u201cEven Christmas?\u201d</p><p>Her arms wrapped around her chest and she said nothing.</p><p>I worked my jaw, keeping me from saying a whole shitload of things that wouldn\u2019t help this situation. But that was it. I realized it then. There was nothing that would help this situation. And it wasn\u2019t like I hadn\u2019t tried. Avery was there, in my life, at one point, and then gone the next, as if she had never been there. And that was that.</p><p>An ache burst through my chest, and with startling clarity, it felt real. Too real. \u201cWhatever,\u201d I said, my voice hoarse. \u201cHave a good Christmas, Avery.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never in my life wanted to leave home and head back to my apartment as bad as I had over Christmas. Normally I stayed right up until the start of spring semester, but I couldn\u2019t do it with all the questions.</p> <p>Where is Avery?</p><p>How is she doing?</p><p>Did she go home?</p><p>On and on they went, and I wondered those very same questions a hundred times over during break. I had no answers, and every time I picked up my phone to text her, I stopped myself. She had made it as clear as humanly possible that she didn\u2019t want anything to do with me.</p><p>Whatever we had, as brief as it was, it was over.</p><p>My mood was somewhere between shitty and shitastic the day after New Year\u2019s. I packed up my stuff early that morning and was out by my truck when Teresa followed me out.</p> <p>Stopping beside the front of the truck, she pulled her heavy sweater close to her body as wind whipped between the house and the garage. Sleep clouded her blue eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving without saying good-bye?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged as I shut the passenger door. \u201cDidn\u2019t want to wake them up.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back as I rounded the bumper. \u201cThat\u2019s never stopped you before.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you, Cam?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d I glanced at her. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be wearing shoes? It\u2019s freezing out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlip-flops are shoes.\u201d She hobbled back and forth, squeezing her arms tight against her body. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>Taking my hat off, I scrubbed my hand through my hair and then pulled the cap back on. I opened my mouth and I had no idea what I was about to say, but there turned out to be no words. The hollowness in my stomach, the empty, achy feeling, had grown and now it throbbed with such intensity, there was no ignoring it.</p> <p>My sister looked up, squinting in the harsh, cold sun. \u201cIt\u2019s Avery, isn\u2019t it? You haven\u2019t talked about her at all. And Mom really thought she\u2019d be coming home with you since\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this,\u201d I cut her off, and her eyes widened. The last thing I wanted to think about was the fact that Avery had spent Christmas\u2014Christmas, for God\u2019s sake\u2014alone. I didn\u2019t want to feel bad for her. I didn\u2019t want to feel anything. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to snap at you. I just need to get back to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d she asked, frowning. \u201cYou have days before school starts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I stepped forward, hugging my sister. For a moment, she didn\u2019t move and then she hugged me back. As I stepped back and opened the door, I looked over my shoulder at her. \u201cTell Mom and Dad I\u2019ll text them or call later.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t immediately respond and then she nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay? Right?\u201d</p><p>I climbed in the truck as I barked out a short laugh. Of course I was okay. Wasn\u2019t like Avery and I had this extended history and it wasn\u2019t like I had that strong of feelings for her. My attraction had to have been an infatuation, because she was something new. She was something different. That was all.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, smiling in a way that made my lips feel weird. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Teresa watched me with a look that said she didn\u2019t believe me at all, and I didn\u2019t really believe myself.</p><p>I\u2019d just stepped out of the shower and pulled on a pair of sweats when I heard a knock on the front door. Knowing it couldn\u2019t be Ollie because he was still back home, I expected to see Jase or someone else when I opened the door.</p><p>Brittany stood there, her blonde hair pulled back in a short ponytail and hands clasped together under her chin. It looked like I interrupted her mid-prayer or something.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, unable to hide my surprise. I wondered how she knew what apartment was mine and then I remembered that she\u2019d been here once before with Ollie, like half the college female population had been. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her bottom lip as she glanced behind her, toward Avery\u2019s apartment, and knots twisted in my stomach. I knew Avery was home. Her car had been outside and hadn\u2019t left since I returned.</p><p>\u201cI hate to bother you and you look . . . um, busy.\u201d Her gaze dipped over my bare chest, and I raised my brows. \u201cBut I need your help. Well, Avery needs your help.\u201d</p><p>A sharp set of tingles spread along the back of my neck as I stepped forward. \u201cWhat do you mean, Avery needs my help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really sick. I think she has the flu,\u201d she explained in a rush. \u201cShe hadn\u2019t been returning my calls so I checked in on her and found her passed out in her kitchen and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I brushed past her, heading for Avery\u2019s door. \u201cDid you call an ambulance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Brittany hurried behind me. \u201cIt\u2019s just the flu and I need to get her some meds, but I can\u2019t get her into her bed. She\u2019s too heavy. So I was hoping that you could carry her back and maybe . . .\u201d</p><p>I really wasn\u2019t listening anymore. My whole focus was on Avery as I entered her apartment. The smell of sickness was strong\u2014too strong\u2014and I could see her denim-clad legs and bare feet.</p><p>Darting into the kitchen, I sucked in the sharp breath. Avery was curled on her side, compressed into a fetal position with one cheek plastered to the floor. Dark, sweat-soaked hair clung to the side of her face. Every few seconds, her body would shake and a tiny, breathy moan would come from her. Concern rose swiftly.</p><p>Brittany sighed. \u201cI had her sitting up before I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure we don\u2019t need an ambulance?\u201d I asked, kneeling down. Carefully, I scooped the strands of damp hair off her face. Her lashes twitched, but her eyes did not open.</p><p>\u201cI called my mom\u2014she\u2019s a nurse. She told me Avery should be fine as long as her fever goes down and she gets fluids in her, but I need to get her some meds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with her while you go.\u201d</p><p>Brittany said something else, but I didn\u2019t hear it. I was only vaguely aware of Brittany picking up her purse from the back of the couch as I slipped an arm under Avery.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she moaned, twisting toward the floor feebly. \u201cCool . . . feels good . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you can\u2019t sleep on the floor.\u201d I lifted her up, wincing when her hot cheek landed against my chest. God, she was burning up. I turned, with her in my arms, realizing that Brittany had already left.</p><p>Avery mumbled something as she turned her face, but the words were too muffled and too slurred for me to understand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I told her, because I really had no idea what to say. \u201cYou\u2019re going to feel better soon.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond as I carried her back to her bed. When I laid her down, I sat back and got a good look at the shirt she wore. Areas of the damp material clung to her skin. There were patches that were suspicious and made me think of the stench of sickness.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I said.</p><p>I looked around the room, finding a pair of pajama bottoms and a sleep shirt folded on her dresser. Taking one look at her, I made up my mind.</p><p>Many times over since I\u2019d met Avery, I had imagined undressing her. The very fantasy of doing so had kept me up many nights. I hated to admit that it still did, even though I knew that it would never happen, at least in the way I wanted.</p><p>Stripping her of her ruined clothing happened faster than a heart attack and was just as about as fun as one. Especially considering she was mostly unconscious and was nothing more than dead weight.</p><p>I didn\u2019t peek. Okay. I might\u2019ve peeked at the pink lacy bra, but it was a brief and totally innocent accident.</p><p>Once I had her in fresh clothes, I tucked her legs under the blanket. It was only when I noticed the bracelet did I remember that she didn\u2019t sleep with it on. Wanting her to be comfortable, I slipped it off her wrist and placed it on the nightstand.</p><p>I grabbed two wet cloths from the bathroom and ran them under cold water. When I returned, she hadn\u2019t moved, but she sucked in a sharp breath when I pressed the cloth to her forehead.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how much time passed, but the first cloth warmed and I replaced it with the second one. Avery turned onto her side, wrapping her arm around mine. It was like she was holding me there, but the girl was in a fevered state and was delusional. She didn\u2019t know what she was doing. Several times, she murmured things I couldn\u2019t understand. At one point, she smiled, and my chest tightened.</p><p>\u201cI miss that,\u201d I said hoarsely.</p><p>She wiggled closer, and I smoothed the wet towel to her cheek. As the smile faded from her lips, the knots in my chest eased.</p><p>Brittany returned, and between the two of us, we coaxed flu meds and water down Avery\u2019s throat. It wasn\u2019t pretty. A sick Avery made for an extremely disagreeable Avery.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to open the windows and air out the funk. Clean up the kitchen and stuff.\u201d Brittany hovered by the door. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay, you know, if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t stay. I\u2019d done my good deed for the day, and if Avery woke up and saw me here, she\u2019d probably accuse me of being a creeper. Biting the inside of my cheek as yet another soft whimper reached my ears, I turned to her. Under the rapidly warming cloth, her brow was pinched in discomfort. Her body was still curled toward me and that one arm was still wrapped around mine.</p><p>Adjusting the cloth, I knew I wasn\u2019t going anywhere. \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>I only knew that Avery was feeling better because she had stopped by the apartment. I wasn\u2019t sure why she had and I wasn\u2019t willing to find out. I told Ollie to tell her I wasn\u2019t there. In a moment of rare seriousness, he\u2019d asked if I was being serious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was.</p><p>The afternoon I\u2019d spent with her while she\u2019d been sick hadn\u2019t done a damn good thing for me. All it had done was stir up shit I didn\u2019t want to deal with.</p><p>Once the semester started, I spotted her all over campus. I wanted to talk to her, to see how she was doing, but there would\u2019ve been no point. At least none I could see, but it was on Friday when it happened\u2014when I couldn\u2019t avoid her.</p><p>I was crossing the street, heading toward Knutti, when I heard my name shouted in a hoarse, barely recognizable voice. That was why I stopped and turned around.</p> <p>Avery hurried up the steep hill, coughing so hard her entire body trembled with the force. Concerned, I shoved my hands into my hoodie to keep myself from acting like some kind of white knight and sweeping her into my arms.</p><p>Out of breath, she stopped in front of me. Her face was pale still, but her cheeks were flushed. The shadows were still under her eyes and the sweater she wore enveloped her.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Her voice was horrible sounding. \u201cNeed a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s the Black Death and it never goes away.\u201d She cleared her throat and then swallowed before she lifted her chin.</p> <p>Our gazes met, and I thought . . . I thought I saw something in her eyes. A mirror of what I felt, but there was a good chance the case of beer I drank the night before was still lingering in my veins.</p><p>I looked away, grinding my jaw. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get to class, so . . . ?\u201d</p><p>The look of flight crossed her face, but she remained in front of me. \u201cI just wanted to say thank you for helping Brit out when I was sick.\u201d</p><p>Shifting my gaze to the diner all the way down the hill and across the street, I drew in air. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was to me. So, thank you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and dared a glance at her. It was a mistake. The wind had blown a strand of shimmery hair across her cheek and it was hard not to catch it and sneak it back behind her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d Her brows knitted together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d I said again, turning to the side entrance. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I turned around. Those two words were like being punched in the balls, because what exactly was she sorry for? I shook my head. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>I was probably more sorry than she was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think Ollie is out in the parking lot drinking our beer,\u201d Jase said, leaning against the wall.</p><p>Beside me, Steph nodded in agreement. \u201cWell, whoever thought it was a good idea to send him to Sheetz is the one at fault.\u201d</p><p>She had a point, but we could\u2019ve prepared better for fight night. Our place was packed like it always was for these events.</p> <p>Steph leaned into my side, pressing her breasts against my arm, and I suspected she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra. Wasn\u2019t she supposed to have come with Jase? Sliding my cap around backward, I inched forward and glanced over at him.</p><p>He shrugged one shoulder and then turned to Henry as one of the preliminary fights picked up. The front door opened, letting in a burst of cold air just as the Canadian on the screen dished out a brutal strike down. The room was a mix of cheers and boos.</p><p>\u201cLook who I found!\u201d Ollie shouted.</p><p>I ignored him as the two fighters scrambled across the ring, but then Steph whispered, \u201cYou have a visitor.\u201d</p><p>Distracted, I glanced over to my left and almost did a double take. My brows shot up as my eyes locked with warm, brown ones.</p><p>Avery stood beside Ollie, clenching a bottle of beer to her chest. Her hair was pulled up and she was all pink cheeks and wide eyes.</p><p>She had never been in my apartment before. Never. And I couldn\u2019t believe she was here now and I had no idea why, but seeing her . . . well, it was like seeing the sun after days of rain.</p><p>I smiled slightly. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d The hue of her cheeks deepened.</p><p>For several moments I was unable to look away from her and I wasn\u2019t the only one. Several of the other guys, including Henry, were eyeballing her in a way all guys did when fresh meat was in the building.</p><p>I willed my gaze to the TV, but I was aware of Ollie guiding her to the empty recliner. My eyes were on the screen, but my entire body and my thoughts were to the right of me. A thousand questions rolled through my head. Seeing her in my apartment was the last thing I had expected. I was caught completely off guard.</p><p>\u201cYou want a beer, babe?\u201d Steph asked, curling a hand around my upper arm.</p><p>I shook my head, focused on Henry. The fucker had slowly made his way over to where Avery sat. Nothing was wrong with the dude. I kept telling myself that, but when he said something about her socks, I started picturing him as the next serial killer.</p><p>Avery was drinking, much to my surprise, and I mean really drinking. Tequila shots and at least two beers for someone who didn\u2019t drink was one hell of a way to kick off being a lush.</p><p>Her soft giggle hit me straight in the chest. My eyes narrowed as Henry grinned and Avery smiled.</p><p>\u201cSeems like your friend likes Henry,\u201d Steph commented quietly. \u201cInteresting development.\u201d</p><p>My heart kicked against my ribs in protest. Was she flirting with him? My hands curled around my knees as Avery laughed again. What the fuck? Jealousy\u2014red-hot, ugly jealousy\u2014hit my veins with the consistency of dunking my head in an acid bath.</p><p>I glanced at the screen and then Jase nodded at me, his gaze flickering over to Avery. I sat the beer down on the coffee table as Henry said, \u201cOld enough to know better.\u201d</p><p>Damn right he was fucking old enough not to even be thinking what I knew he had to be thinking.</p><p>\u201cHey Henry,\u201d I called out as my skin stretched tight. \u201cCome here a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Steph muttered, crossing her arms as she leaned back against the couch.</p><p>Henry leaned down when I motioned him closer. \u201cWhat up, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave that girl alone,\u201d I told him, voice low as I met and held the older guy\u2019s gaze. \u201cI\u2019m fucking serious. She\u2019s not for you or anyone in this room.\u201d</p><p>Henry\u2019s brows rose and so did the corner of his lips. \u201cMessage received, buddy.\u201d</p><p>I watched him make his way over to Jase, and I felt a little better. Not much, because I couldn\u2019t fucking believe that after everything with Avery, she\u2019d show up at my apartment, and start drinking and flirting with Henry the Horn Dog. I was absolutely in a state of fucking shock.</p><p>\u201cYou totally cock blocked,\u201d Steph said, placing her hand on my arm again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I twisted to her. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cThey were getting to know each other and you cock blocked.\u201d</p><p>Getting to know each other? Fuck no that wasn\u2019t happening right in front of me. \u201cDo I look like I give a fuck that I stopped it?\u201d</p><p>Steph jerked her hand back, but, honestly, I also didn\u2019t give a fuck about her in that moment. Avery was smiling at Henry. Her smiles were so fucking rare and she was smiling at him. I couldn\u2019t even remember the last time I was jealous, but I recognized the bitter taste in my mouth. It mingled well with anger.</p><p>Avery glanced at me and her smile started to fade.</p><p>\u201cThis is not happening,\u201d I said.</p><p>Steph shot to her feet, and I had no idea what she was pissed about, but I really didn\u2019t care. Standing up, I stalked over to where Avery sat. A big, wide and slightly drunk smile broke out across her face.</p><p>\u201cCome with me for a sec?\u201d I said, surprised by how even my voice sounded.</p><p>Avery shot from the chair like someone lit a fire to her ass. She wobbled way far to the side. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>I caught her arm, holding her still. I couldn\u2019t believe she was this drunk. \u201cYou okay to walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d She bumped into me, giggling. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Wondering exactly how many shots she\u2019d had, I shot a grinning Ollie a death look as I led her into the kitchen. \u201cWhat are you doing, Avery?\u201d</p><p>She held up the bottle. \u201cDrinking. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m getting at and you know that. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She made a face that was sort of cute and a bit weird before she sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d I arched a brow. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA drunk\u2019s famous last words before they fall flat on their face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat has not happened . . . yet.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head as I took ahold of her arm. We needed to talk and the fact that she was here probably meant she wanted to. Or she wanted to hook up with one of the random guys here. I didn\u2019t know what, because who the fuck ever knew what was going on in this girl\u2019s head, but nothing was happening. She was taking her little drunk ass back to her apartment. Any number of those guys in the living room would love to find themselves between her thighs and I didn\u2019t know exactly how far gone she was. I wasn\u2019t her babysitter. Fuck, I wasn\u2019t anything to her.</p><p>\u201cUm . . .\u201d she said, frowning when I led her to the stairwell and closed the door behind us. She looked up at me, confused.</p><p>I pointed to her door. \u201cYou need to go home, Avery.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open as she stared at me. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m fucking serious. You\u2019re drunk and that shit is not going down in front of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat shit?\u201d She took a step back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Ollie invited me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m going to kick his ass later.\u201d I took my hat off and ran my hand through my hair. \u201cJust go home, Avery. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>Avery swallowed heavily. \u201cYou\u2019re mad at me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad at you, Avery.\u201d I was mad at the fucking world right at the moment.</p><p>She looked at me and then quickly glanced away, but not quick enough. I saw the sudden sheen in her eyes. Shit. Shit. Shit.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go home. There\u2019s no one there and I . . .\u201d</p><p>That spot in my chest throbbed. \u201cI\u2019ll come over later and we\u2019ll talk, okay? But go home. Please, just go home.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened and then snapped shut. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The ache grew. \u201cAvery . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s totally okay.\u201d She smiled, but it wasn\u2019t real and it was full of hurt\u2014hurt I knew I put there. She turned and shuffled to her door, and with a low curse, I went back into my apartment.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Jase asked as I headed into the kitchen for another beer. Or three.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I screwed off the lid and tossed it in the trash.</p><p>His dark brows rose. \u201cAre you not okay because she was here or because she left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made her leave.\u201d</p><p>Jase glanced over as Ollie entered the kitchen. I took one look at the pothead. \u201cI should kick you in the balls.\u201d</p><p>Ollie didn\u2019t laugh it off. He stared at me with a level look. \u201cDid you just make that poor girl leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor girl?\u201d I sputtered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know, the girl you\u2019ve been obsessed with since August? She finally came over and you kick her out of the apartment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stared at him as I took off my hat, tossing it onto the counter. \u201cAre you high? You have no idea what has been going on between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOllie,\u201d Jase warned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Ollie.\u201d I brushed past him and headed for the living room.</p> <p>The main fight was about to start. I stopped near the door, realizing I\u2019d left my beer in the kitchen. I started to go back, but I didn\u2019t move. I had been serious when I told Avery I would come over and talk to her, but I planned on waiting until tomorrow, when she was sober, for one thing, and I wasn\u2019t so fucking pissed off about everything. But as I stood there, all I could see were the tears building in her eyes. Tomorrow wasn\u2019t too far away, but . . .</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d I heard Jase say from behind me.</p><p>I was already out the door.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Part of me wasn\u2019t surprised when I opened her apartment door after banging on it and discovered she wasn\u2019t there. Expecting Avery to listen to me just once would obviously be asking too much.</p> <p>Having no idea where she could\u2019ve gone, I walked over to the living room window and peered down.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>There was a slight form sitting on the curb, hunched over in the cold. What in the hell was Shortcake doing? I hurried outside, wincing as the wind lifted my hair right off my forehead.</p><p>\u201cAvery!\u201d I shouted. She started, dropping her beer bottle. It rolled under a nearby car as she twisted toward me. The glassy look, which I couldn\u2019t completely blame on the beer, tore up my insides. \u201cWhat in the fuck are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>She blinked and her damp lashes lifted. \u201cI . . . I\u2019m looking at the stars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I knelt down beside her. \u201cAvery, it\u2019s like thirty degrees outside. You\u2019re going to get sick again.\u201d</p> <p>One shoulder lifted as she looked away. \u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking for you, you little dumbass.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me sharply. \u201cExcuse me? You\u2019re out here, so you\u2019re a dumbass, too, you dumbass.\u201d</p><p>I fought a grin. \u201cI told you I was coming over to talk to you. I checked your apartment first. I knocked and you didn\u2019t answer. The door was unlocked and I went inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went inside my apartment? That\u2019s kind of rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I saw you sitting down here from your window.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause and then she asked, \u201cIs the fight over?\u201d</p><p>Since it didn\u2019t look like she was getting up anytime soon, I sat beside her. The cold of the cement froze my ass in a nanosecond. \u201cNo. The main fight just began.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing it.\u201d</p><p>Running a hand through my hair, I let out a long breath. \u201cGod, Avery . . .\u201d I struggled with what to say. The reaction to seeing her was still too raw, too confusing. \u201cSeeing you tonight? I was fucking surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Steph?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked at her. \u201cNo. Jase invited her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like she was there for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she was, but I don\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d Twisting toward her, I dropped my hands onto my knees. \u201cAvery, I haven\u2019t messed around with Steph since I met you. I haven\u2019t messed around with anyone since I met you.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled deeply. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d I almost laughed and then the shit just unloaded. \u201cSee, you don\u2019t get it. You never fucking got it. You\u2019ve avoided me since Thanksgiving break. Dropped the goddamn class and I know that was because of me, and every time I tried to talk to you, you fucking ran from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to talk to me the day I thanked you for helping me out.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her. \u201cGee, I don\u2019t know why? Maybe because you made it painfully clear you didn\u2019t want anything to do with me. And then you just show up tonight? Out of the fucking blue and get drunk? You don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>She wetted her lips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I am drunk, a little, and I am sorry, because you\u2019re right and . . . I\u2019m rambling.\u201d</p><p>I let out a short, hoarse laugh. What was I thinking? \u201cAll right, it\u2019s not the time for that conversation, obviously. Look, I didn\u2019t mean to be such a dick inside there, making you leave, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m used to people not wanting me at their parties.\u201d She rose to her feet unsteadily. \u201cNo big deal.\u201d</p><p>My skin pricked with awareness as I stood. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want you there, Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . really?\u201d She laughed, but there was no humor to it. \u201cYou asked me to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrection.\u201d She held up her hand. \u201cYou told me to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. It was a dickhead move, but it\u2019s the first time you\u2019re at my place, you come in there, start drinking and then . . .\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cHenry was all over you and you\u2019re giggling\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t look that way, Avery. You\u2019re drunk and I didn\u2019t want you doing something you\u2019d regret. I don\u2019t know what the hell goes on in your head half the time and I had no idea what you were doing here tonight, but I\u2019ve never seen you drink and I didn\u2019t know what you were going to do. I didn\u2019t want someone taking advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen there, done that.\u201d The moment those words left her mouth, she clamped her lips closed.</p><p>A look of horror crossed her face, and everything\u2014oh God\u2014everything about her started to make sense. \u201cWhat?\u201d I whispered, and she started to walk away. I caught her by the shoulders. \u201cOh, hell no. What did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I said. Okay? I\u2019m drunk, Cam. Duh. Who the fuck knows what\u2019s coming out of my mouth? I don\u2019t. I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m even doing out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Avery . . .\u201d My fingers tightened around her shoulders. \u201cWhat are you not telling me? What haven\u2019t you told me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing! I swear. I promise you. I\u2019m just running my mouth, okay?\u201d She blinked furiously. \u201cSo stop looking at me like there\u2019s something wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not staring at you like that, sweetheart.\u201d I searched her face for the truth, for the severity of what happened to her, but the only thing I saw in her expression was fear and desperation. She didn\u2019t want me to pry any further, and I got that. Of all people, I understood the need to keep some things a secret, but I would find out eventually.</p><p>Her eyes welled up, and I thought she mouthed the word please. There was a lot of shit between us. Things that we needed to clear up, but all of that needed to wait.</p><p>I hauled her against me, wrapping my arms around her tightly. She stiffened for a second and then placed her hands on my sides as she pressed her face against my chest. The feel of her went straight through me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>In that moment, whatever happened between us after I had seen her scar didn\u2019t matter. I buried my hand in her hair, pressing her closer. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, sweetheart.\u201d I held onto her, lifting her up in the air and then back down, thrilled to be just holding her again. I cupped her cheeks, laughing at the feel of her. \u201cYou feel like a little ice cube.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel hot.\u201d Our gazes met and she smiled. \u201cYour eyes are really beautiful, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the shots of tequila talking. Come on, let\u2019s get you inside before you freeze.\u201d</p><p>Reaching down, I threaded my fingers through hers. The last thing I wanted was for her to fall and break her neck. Once inside her warm apartment, her fingers spasmed around mine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing the fight,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo I am.\u201d I led her around the couch and tugged her down. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She ran her hands over her thighs. \u201cYour friends are probably wondering where you are.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back, getting comfortable. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>A brief smile crossed her lips as she sat forward and then glanced back at me. I wasn\u2019t planning on going anywhere. The fight and the friends weren\u2019t as important as the one sitting next to me. Besides, I was a little concerned about her alcohol intake, especially when she jumped up and almost ate the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should sit down, Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d She stumbled around the coffee table. \u201cSo . . . what did you want to do? I can, um, turn on the TV or put a movie in, but I don\u2019t have any movies. I guess I can order one from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery, just sit down for a little while.\u201d</p><p>She picked up a pillow and placed it on the couch. I guess she was going to start cleaning the house? But then she went to the moon chair. \u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s hot in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much did you drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . .\u201d Her face screwed up. \u201cNot much\u2014maybe like two or three shots of tequila and two beers? I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh wow.\u201d I grinned as I scooted forward. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve really drank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalloween night.\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head to the side. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you drink Halloween night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this past Halloween night.\u201d Back on her feet, she started tugging on the sleeves of her sweater. \u201cIt was . . . five years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. That\u2019s a long time.\u201d Oh, this wasn\u2019t going to end well. I stood. \u201cYou got water in here? Bottled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>I headed to the fridge, grabbed a bottle and then returned. \u201cYou should drink this.\u201d When she took the bottle, I sat on the edge of the couch. \u201cSo that made you, what? Fourteen? Fifteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen,\u201d she whispered, ducking her chin.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really young to be drinking.\u201d</p><p>Sitting the bottle down, she fixed her ponytail. \u201cYeah, you didn\u2019t drink when you were fourteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI snuck a beer or two at fourteen, but I thought your parents were strict?\u201d</p><p>She snickered as she dropped into the moon chair. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about them or drinking or Halloween.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out those three things were connected. And it also didn\u2019t take a vivid imagination to picture a young Avery getting too drunk at a party and doing something she came to regret later. At least, I hoped it was that. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake watched me a second and then went about trying to take her sweater off. A laugh built up in my throat, but got stuck when she dropped her sweater. She wore a tank top underneath, but the material was thin and exposed a lot of flushed skin. Her nervousness seemed to run deeper than a beer buzz or even because I was here after all the crap between us.</p><p>She stood again and started pacing. When she stopped, in between the kitchen and the hall, she curled her fingers under the hem of her tank top. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond as her slightly unfocused gaze met mine. I had no idea what she was thinking. I never really did, but she sucked her bottom lip between her teeth. Wariness settled in my bones. She was definitely up to\u2014</p><p>Avery pulled her tank top off.</p><p>Holy. Shit.</p> <p>I inhaled sharply. \u201cAvery.\u201d</p><p>Holy. Shit. Shit. Shit. That\u2019s about all I could think as I stared at her in her black bra. I\u2019d seen her when she was sick, but I had not seriously really seen her. Not like now. Her breasts were full, straining against the lacy cups as she dragged in one deep breath after another.</p><p>When she leaned against the wall and let her arms fall to her sides, I clamped my jaws together as I breathed deeply. My gaze dipped from her face again, to her breasts and then down the smooth line of her stomach. Her jeans hung low and her belly concaved around her navel. The sweet curve of her waist begged to be touched.</p><p>She was obviously drunk and if I was a good guy I wouldn\u2019t be staring at her like I wanted to eat her up, but I couldn\u2019t look away. I didn\u2019t remember standing, but I was and somehow I had moved around the couch. Heat built between my legs, thickening and potent.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d she said breathlessly.</p> <p>My body demanded that I go to her and I almost did, but I stopped, clenching my hands. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, but the sight of her was branded into my mind. \u201cThis\u2014don\u2019t do this, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this what you want?\u201d she asked, voice ringing with uncertainty.</p><p>My eyes flew open. What? \u201cI don\u2019t expect that, Avery.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t want her? I could barely remember a time when I hadn\u2019t wanted her, for fuck\u2019s sake. My cock was pushing against the zipper of my jeans, swelling to the point of almost bursting. That\u2019s how badly I wanted her.</p><p>But the look of self-deprecation had crept onto her pretty face.</p><p>I shot forward, slamming my hands onto the wall on either side of her head. I bent down so that we were eye level. \u201cFuck, Avery. You think I don\u2019t want you? There\u2019s not a single part of you that I don\u2019t want, you understand? I want to be on you and inside of you. I want you against the wall, on the couch, in your bed, in my bed, and every fucking place I can possibly think of, and trust me, I have a vast imagination when it comes to these kinds of things. Don\u2019t ever doubt that I want you. That is not what this is about.\u201d</p><p>Confusion poured into her wide eyes.</p><p>I pressed my forehead against hers. \u201cBut not like this\u2014never like this. You\u2019re drunk, Avery, and when we get together\u2014because we will get together, you\u2019re going to be fully aware of everything that I do to you.\u201d</p><p>She held my gaze and then closed her eyes, turning her head to the side, causing our skin to glide together. \u201cYou\u2019re a good guy, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d I breathed her in, making a silent promise that I would always be whatever she needed me to be. \u201cI\u2019m only good with you.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-One</p> <p>It was about an hour after I got Avery to cover up with a blanket that everything she drank decided to make a reappearance.</p><p>Throwing aside the quilt I had wrapped her in like it was covered in snakes, she tore through the living room, making a beeline for the bathroom. I followed quickly, expecting this, considering she didn\u2019t normally drink.</p><p>It was terrible.</p><p>Unable to do anything more than hold her hair and rub her back while she prayed to the porcelain gods, I\u2019d never felt more helpless. When it was finally over, I propped her against the bathtub and grabbed a damp cloth. It was just like when she had been sick, except this time around, she was actually conscious.</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cKinda.\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cOh God, this is so embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>I laughed under my breath. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why you stayed, right?\u201d She moaned pitifully. \u201cYou knew I was going to be sick and here I was, taking off my clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d I brushed the loose strands of hair back from her face. \u201cAs charming as it was to watch you vomit up your guts, that\u2019s not why I stayed and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes drifted shut again. \u201cBecause you want me, but not when I\u2019m drunk and puking all over the place?\u201d</p><p>I let out a loud laugh. Intoxicated Avery was a funny Avery. \u201cYeah, you know, that sounds about right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust making sure we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>One eye opened. \u201cHa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you\u2019d like that.\u201d I moved the cloth under her chin.</p><p>She smiled slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re very . . . good at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad a lot of practice.\u201d Tossing the towel aside, I grabbed a new one and started all over. \u201cBeen where you are quite a few times.\u201d I brought the towel down her neck and over her arms, willing my gaze to stay on her face and not stray to the swells of her breasts so beautifully on display. \u201cWant to get ready for bed?\u201d</p><p>She stared at me with sudden wide eyes.</p><p>I grinned.</p><p>\u201cGet your mind out of the gutter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she murmured, looking chagrined.</p><p>\u201cYeah, oh.\u201d I turned and grabbed a toothbrush. Loading it with paste, I faced her. \u201cThought you\u2019d want to get the taste out of your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are wonderful,\u201d she said, reaching for it.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d When she was all done, I knelt again and unzipped my hoodie. Taking it off, I grabbed the hem of my shirt to slip it over my head. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get you to say I\u2019m wonderful from the first time you plowed into me. If I\u2019d known that all it would take was handing you a toothbrush, I would have done that a long time ago. My loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was my . . .\u201d She managed to sit up straighter. \u201cMy loss\u2014what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where your clothes are.\u201d Which was a lie. I\u2019d found her clothes before.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>I grinned as I watched her gaze move over my chest, fixing on my tattoo. \u201cAnd I figured you\u2019d want to get out of your clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cSo the easiest thing would be to let you borrow my shirt.\u201d</p><p>She took a shallow breath. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d be more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>I had the suspicion she wasn\u2019t listening to a word that was coming out of my mouth. Not when her eyes were traveling south, causing my body to react.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been listening to a single thing I\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh.\u201d</p><p>I grinned as I took ahold of her hips, lifting her onto the edge of the tub.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lift your arms yet, okay.\u201d I told her. She held still as I pulled my shirt on over her. \u201cKeep your arms down.\u201d I let go of the shirt and reached around her, deftly unclasping her bra.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Her voice pitched high.</p><p>I laughed as I slid the straps down her arms, but it died off when she shivered. I think I was into punishing myself, because I wanted to drop her bra and pull her into my arms. \u201cLike I said before, get your mind out of the gutter. Your virtue is safe with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy virtue?\u201d</p><p>I looked at her through my lashes. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cPut your arms through.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, and I rolled up the sleeves. Sitting back, a surge of possession nearly knocked me off my feet. I liked her in my clothes. Really liked it. Sliding my hand down her arm, I stopped above the bracelet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d Panic filled her voice as I unhooked the tiny clasps.</p><p>I tightened my grip, refusing to let her pull her arm away. \u201cI\u2019ve already seen it, Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t.\u201d Her gaze lowered. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing and I can\u2019t take back that you saw this. I wish I could, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>My earlier suspicions were finally confirmed. I wrapped my hands around the bracelet and her wrist. \u201cIt\u2019s because of this, isn\u2019t it? Why you freaked out on me? Wouldn\u2019t talk to me? Dropped the class?\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t speak, I closed my eyes briefly. \u201cOh, sweetheart. We\u2019ve all done stuff we aren\u2019t proud of. If you knew . . .\u201d Now wasn\u2019t the time for that. \u201cThe point is, I don\u2019t know why you did this. I just hope that whatever the reason was, it\u2019s something that you\u2019ve come to terms with. I don\u2019t think any less of you because of it. I never did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you looked so . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish.</p><p>I took the bracelet off with my other hand and placed it on the sink. \u201cI was just surprised and I was concerned. I didn\u2019t know when you got this and I\u2019m not going to ask. Not right now, okay? Just know that you don\u2019t have to hide it around me. All right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but doubt and distrust poured into her brown eyes. Wanting to prove what I said was true, I bent my head as I turned her arm over and pressed my lips to the scar. A shudder rocked Avery.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d just turned sixteen.\u201d Her voice was quiet and terribly young. \u201cThat\u2019s when I did it. I don\u2019t know if I really meant to do it or if I just wanted someone to . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s something I regret every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never do anything like that again. I swear. I\u2019m not the same person I was then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I placed my arm on her leg, wanting to take away the distant, painful look that darkened her eyes. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to take your pants off.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and then laughed. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>I helped her stand. My shirt reached her knees and I think it looked better on her than me. When I reached for the button on her jeans, she smacked my hands away. \u201cI think I can do that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I teased. \u201cBecause I\u2019m here at your service and taking your jeans off is something I feel I\u2019d be exceptionally wonderful at.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched. \u201cI\u2019m sure you would be. Put your hoodie back on.\u201d</p><p>I leaned against the sink, stretching out my back. \u201cI like when you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d She turned and wiggled her ass in the most enticing way, shedding her jeans.</p><p>Looking away, I snatched my hoodie off the floor. \u201cYou think you\u2019ll be good out of the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>Once I had her back in the living room, I found aspirin and grabbed another bottle of water. After she drank up, I sat on the couch and tugged gently on her arm. \u201cSit with me.\u201d When she started to climb over my legs, I stopped her. \u201cNo. Sit with me.\u201d</p><p>Confused, she shook her head. I leaned back and pulled her down. She was stiff as a dollar bill for about a second and then her body caved into my lap. I grabbed the quilt, tossing it over her bare legs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou should try to go to sleep.\u201d I wrapped my arms around her waist as the TV cast flickering shadows across the room. \u201cIt\u2019ll help in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake let out a little sigh as she snuggled against my chest. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt all?\u201d</p> <p>Lowering my chin, I brushed my lips across her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019ll be right here when you wake up, sweetheart. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I woke the following morning the same way I had fallen asleep. Avery was still curled up in my lap, but she was awake now and she kept wiggling around. I groaned, tightening my arms around her as her hip pressed against my erection.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s morning and you\u2019re sitting on me. That\u2019s a combination meant to bring any man down.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes in time to see a flush sweep over Shortcake\u2019s cheeks. I moved a hand to her hip, watching her sleepy expression through heavily hooded eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get off you?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cHell no.\u201d I slid my other hand up her spine, threading my fingers through her soft hair. \u201cAbsolutely fucking not.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally, I think we\u2019re actually agreeing on something.\u201d</p><p>Tilting her head to the side, she studied me for a long moment. \u201cDid last night really happen?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cDepends on what you think happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took my shirt off for you?\u201d</p> <p>At the mention of that, my gaze dipped. The hardened tips of her breasts were nicely visible. \u201cYes. Lovely moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you turned me down?\u201d</p><p>My hand drifted to the side of her thigh. \u201cOnly because our first time together isn\u2019t going to be when you\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur first time together?\u201d</p><p>I grinned lazily. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>She turned a pretty shade of pink. \u201cYou\u2019re really confident about there being a first time between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d I leaned back against the cushion, watching her as I smoothed my hand up and down, from hip to thigh.</p><p>\u201cWe talked, right?\u201d She glanced at her bare wrist. \u201cI told you when I did this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lifted. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t think I\u2019m a raving bitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d</p><p>She pinned me with a dry-as-sand look.</p><p>I grinned as I moved my other hand up to the nape of her neck. \u201cYou want to know what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d</p><p>I led her head down so that our lips almost touched. \u201cI think we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>But the longer she sat in my lap, the less likely we were to talk. I gripped her hips and lifted her up, dropping her on the cushion beside me.</p><p>\u201cI thought we needed to talk,\u201d she asked as I stood.</p><p>\u201cWe do. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Confusion poured into her expression.</p><p>\u201cJust stay there, okay?\u201d I started for the door. \u201cDon\u2019t move from that spot. Don\u2019t think about anything. Just sit there and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She rested her chin on the back of the couch. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it, don\u2019t think about anything.\u201d I opened the door. \u201cNot the last couple of minutes or last night. Not the last month. Or what\u2019s coming next. Just sit there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>I held her gaze for a moment and once I was sure she wasn\u2019t going to lock herself in her bedroom, I hurried to my apartment. It was quiet inside, but there was a pair of heels next to the couch. Smiling, I quickly brushed my teeth and then grabbed the required items from the kitchen. Took me all of five minutes and when I returned to her apartment, she was where I left her.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to what I held in my hands and she smiled. \u201cEggs\u2014you brought eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my skillet.\u201d Using my hip, I nudged the door closed. \u201cAnd I brushed my teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t put a shirt on.\u201d</p><p>I cast her a long look. \u201cI know it would break your heart not to be able to see me shirtless.\u201d</p><p>As I put the eggs on the counter, I heard a muffled squeak and turned toward the door. \u201cAvery, what in the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d was the response.</p><p>I smiled to myself as I turned back to the counter. \u201cThen get your ass in here.\u201d When I heard her feet hit the floor, I frowned. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare change.\u201d I paused. \u201cBecause I really like seeing you in my clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when you put it like that . . .\u201d She appeared in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over my shoulder at her. \u201cYou missed my eggs that badly?\u201d</p><p>She blinked slowly. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have you in my kitchen making eggs again.\u201d</p><p>Those words affected me more than she knew. I adjusted the controls on the stove. \u201cYou missed me that much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I turned to her, running a hand through my hair. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake inhaled deeply. \u201cI want to say I\u2019m sorry for how I acted when you . . . well, when you saw my scar. I\u2019ve never let anyone see it.\u201d She inched forward, worrying her lower lip. \u201cI know that\u2019s not an excuse, because I was a terrible bitch, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll accept your apology on one condition.\u201d I folded my arms.</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d she said passionately.</p><p>\u201cYou trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d I walked to the table and slid out a chair. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>Once she sat and adjusted the borrowed shirt, I went back to the stove and cracked an egg. \u201cIf you trusted me, you wouldn\u2019t have reacted the way you did. And that\u2019s not me judging you or any of that kind of shit. You got to trust me that I\u2019m not going to be an ass or freak out over that kind of stuff. You have to trust that I care enough about you.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of her soft inhale, I turned to her. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t know about you and I hope we fix that. I\u2019m not going to push you, but you can\u2019t shut me out. Okay. You have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze met mine. \u201cI trust you. I will trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI accept your apology.\u201d</p><p>I finished up the eggs and returned to the table with OJ before I broached the issue at hand. \u201cSo where do we go from here? Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>She stopped with a fork full of fluffy eggs. \u201cWhat I want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom me.\u201d I popped a whole egg in my mouth. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>Shortcake sat back, placing her fork down on the plate. She opened her mouth and then squared up her shoulders. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>My chest spasmed and for a moment I couldn\u2019t speak. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she said, flushing. \u201cObviously, I\u2019ve never been in a relationship and I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s what you want. Maybe it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I chuckled, feeling lighter than I had in weeks as I picked up another egg. \u201cYou sound so surprised, like you can\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s really kind of adorable. Please continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease continue . . . ?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>I chewed the egg slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s the second thing we\u2019re in agreement on this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be with me?\u201d</p><p>My lips curved up. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to be with you since the first time you turned me down. I\u2019ve just been waiting for you to come around. So, if we\u2019re going to do this, there are some ground rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRules?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I peeled the third egg. \u201cThere\u2019s not that many. No shutting me out. It\u2019s just you and me and no one else. And finally, you keep looking damn sexy in my shirts.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh burst from her, deep and real. \u201cI think all of them are doable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I wondered if she saw how my hands shook as I peeled the final egg.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done of any of this before, Cam. And I\u2019m not easy to get along with all the time. I know that. I can\u2019t promise this will be easy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing fun in life is easy.\u201d As I finished off the milk, I was done talking for now. I needed to tell her about what happened three years ago and what I had to do every Friday night, but it had to wait. I needed to do what I\u2019d wanted to do since the night of Thanksgiving.</p><p>I stood and went to her side. Taking her hands, I tugged her onto her feet and wrapped my arms around her waist. I lowered my head, brushing my lips across her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m serious about you, Avery. If you want me for real, you have me.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake pressed her palms to my chest. \u201cI want you for real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d I slanted my lips over hers. \u201cBecause, if not, this would get a whole lot awkward.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but the sound was lost when I pressed my mouth to hers. The contact felt right, as necessary as breathing. The kiss was soft and slow, but as she slid her hands into my hair, I deepened the kiss, giving her what she quietly asked for. My lips slid over hers, back and forth, nudging and pushing, and then coaxing them open with my tongue.</p><p>Her moan set a fire to my blood and she tasted like juice and something far sweeter. My hands dropped to her hips and I hauled her against me, lifting her up. Surprise shuttled through me as her legs wrapped around my waist. I pressed her back against the wall, fitting our bodies together.</p><p>Kissing her was all that I\u2019d planned, but the feel of her breasts flattened against my chest and her core hot against me was my undoing. I was lost in her. Shortcake was timid and she was innocent of a lot of things, but she was also very passionate and her response was natural and so very seductive.</p><p>I groaned as she tilted her hips, pressing against me in that wonderful artless way of hers. Her fingers tightened in my hair as she held my mouth to hers. I was so hard and swollen and the scrap of clothing covering her between her thighs wasn\u2019t enough of a barrier. I wanted nothing more than to take her right here, against the wall, and I doubted she\u2019d protest, but it wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>With effort, I lifted my mouth. \u201cI need to go.\u201d</p><p>Her hands slid back down to my cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a saint, sweetheart.\u201d My voice was deep, rough with desire. \u201cSo if I don\u2019t leave now, I won\u2019t be leaving for some time.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered, and my body tightened. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want you to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d I gripped her thighs, briefly squeezing my eyes closed. \u201cYou\u2019re making this very hard to be the good guy you said I was last night.\u201d</p><p>Her lips grazed my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m not drunk.\u201d</p><p>Laughing softly, I pressed my forehead to hers. \u201cYeah, I can see that and while the idea of taking you right now, against the wall, is enough to make me lose control, I want you to know that I\u2019m serious. You\u2019re not a hookup. You\u2019re not a friend with benefits. You\u2019re more than that to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes drifted shut as her chest rose against mine. \u201cWell, that was . . . really sort of perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sort of perfect,\u201d I teased, untangling her legs and setting her on her feet. \u201cEveryone else knows that. You\u2019re just a little slow on the uptake.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, warming her eyes. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a cold shower.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Another laugh bubbled up from her. \u201cYou coming back over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d I kissed her tenderly, pouring what I felt into the quick, all too brief kiss.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Her smile spread across her face and it was the most divine thing I\u2019d ever seen. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty-Two</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not coming over tonight, are you?\u201d Jase asked, his voice barely audible over the thumping music.</p><p>Slipping my feet into my shoes, I held my cell between my cheek and shoulder. \u201cNah. I\u2019m taking Avery out to dinner. I guess if we get back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo explanation needed. I don\u2019t blame you.\u201d He sounded bored, not with me, but with the whole scene. There was a pause. \u201cYour girl doesn\u2019t seem like the type who\u2019s into the party scene.\u201d</p><p>I got hung up on the phrase \u201cyour girl\u201d and the rush of pride it sent through me for what was probably a second too long. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Jase chuckled softly. \u201cShe\u2019s turned you into a changed man, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p> <p>I smiled as I grabbed my keys. Jase might be right. Since I\u2019d met Avery in August, a lot of my habits had changed, even more so during the weeks following fight night. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, have fun. Don\u2019t impregnate her.\u201d</p><p>A laugh burst from me. \u201cJase, man, come on . . .\u201d</p><p>He chuckled again. \u201cI\u2019m kidding.\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I said my good-byes and headed over to Avery\u2019s.</p><p>We had a quick dinner in Martinsburg and then headed back to her apartment. I made a pit stop and picked up Raphael, letting him roam around Avery\u2019s kitchen for a bit. The little guy needed his exercise after all. And Shortcake seemed to enjoy picking him up and turning him around in the other direction, so that he shuffled his way back and forth between us. This wasn\u2019t something I ever thought I\u2019d be doing on a Saturday night, but I wasn\u2019t bored or wanting to be anywhere else. Truth be told, I was having more fun doing this than I ever had at one of the frat parties.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a terrarium,\u201d I corrected her when she called his habitat an aquarium. \u201cAnd he has a rocking terrarium. Got him a new one for his birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know when his birthday is?\u201d She grinned.</p> <p>\u201cYep. July twenty-sixth.\u201d Speaking of such . . . \u201cWhen is your birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, you have a while until you have to worry about that.\u201d She crossed her ankles. \u201cWhen\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune fifteenth.\u201d I would not be deterred. \u201cWhen is yours, Avery?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIt was January second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed your birthday?\u201d My brows rose as I leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI went to the Smithsonian and then I got sick, so it\u2019s probably a good thing you weren\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>Went to the Smithsonian . . . ? It struck me then and I felt like an ass. \u201cAw, man, that\u2019s why you said you wanted to go there on the second. You were alone? Shit. I feel so \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, raising her hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel terrible. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>I knew I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. I would\u2019ve taken her if she had let me, but it still didn\u2019t set well in my chest. \u201cWell, there\u2019s always next year.\u201d</p><p>Her lips split into a wide smile that caused my heart to stutter. Needing a moment to myself before I did something incredibly stupid like get all vagina-emotional, I scooped up Raphael and took him back home, promising to come right back. I planned to talk to her when I did, about what I had done, but when I did return, I discovered Shortcake standing in the hall that led back to her bedrooms with a look on her face that did funny, twisty things to my insides.</p><p>The look on her face was part anticipation, part uncertainty, and the driving force behind it was an innocent curiosity that literally blew my thoughts out of my head. I had no idea why exactly it was important to talk about serious shit right now. Since the Sunday we cleared everything up, I\u2019d been taking things slow, so slow I wondered if I could go any slower. Every night I ended up going one on one with myself to the point that my hand was starting to get numb while I took notes in class.</p><p>It was worth it though. The last thing I wanted to do was rush her, but right now . . .</p><p>Avery wetted her lower lip as I pulled my sweater off, draping it along the back of her couch. Her gaze dipped to the width of skin exposed between my shirt and jeans and a flush spread across her cheeks.</p><p>Yeah, Shortcake looked like she wanted to be rushed.</p><p>I sat on the couch while she remained by the hall, fiddling with the edge of her sweater dress in the soft glow of the TV. When she had pulled off her tights earlier, after returning from dinner, I\u2019d spent an ungodly amount of time staring at her bare legs like a teen who\u2019d never seen so much skin before.</p><p>\u201cYou going to come over here or stare at me the rest of the evening?\u201d I asked, grinning as she took a deep breath and approached the couch slowly. I lifted a hand to pull her down next to me, but little Shortcake had something else entirely planned.</p><p>My grin faded as she put her knees on either side of my thighs and sat in my lap. My body\u2019s response was ridiculously immediate. I hardened as I curled my fingers around her hips. \u201cHey there, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDid you miss me this much? I was only gone a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>She laid her hands on my shoulders as she pressed down, bringing our bodies together in all the right places. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Moving my hands up her sides, I cupped her cheeks. She had to feel me between her thighs. There was no hiding that. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Her tongue darted out, wetting her lips, and I bit back a groan. \u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can think of a few things.\u201d I smoothed my thumbs over her cheeks, waiting to see what she was up to. Truth was, wherever she was taking this, I\u2019d willing to plunge headfirst. \u201cAll of them have me extremely interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterested? That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met mine for the briefest moment and then her lashes swept down, shielding her eyes as she closed the distance between us. She brushed her lips across mine, making slow and sweet passes. Then she increased the pressure. I let her lead, taking her cues as the kiss deepened. My hands splayed across her cheeks as her mouth opened. I flicked my tongue over hers and she returned the gesture tentatively. Something about that drove me insane. Perhaps it was the knowledge that she was learning all of this with me.</p><p>I trailed my hands down her back and she arched into the caress. My hands tightened on her waist as she rocked her hips. Good God, the way she moved in my lap was going to kill me. I shuddered as I balled my right hand into her dress, sliding it up her thighs. I had to touch her.</p><p>Sweeping my other hand around her front, I followed the path of her ribs and cupped one breast in my hand. Learning the curves of her body, I smoothed my hand over the tip. Avery broke the kiss, moaning as I circled my thumb over her peak.</p><p>\u201cYou liked that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Ah, that\u2019s what I wanted to hear. I teased her as I trailed tiny kisses down her neck, guiding her head back. She pressed her breast into my hand as her hips shifted again. Intense pleasure rolled up my spine. Making a sound low in my throat, I pulled back, watching the flush of arousal spread over her.</p><p>Damn, she was beautiful.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, sweetheart.\u201d I covered her other breast, feeling the nipple through her clothes. Wouldn\u2019t want it to get lonely. \u201cAnything. And I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Her chest rose sharply. \u201cTouch me.\u201d</p><p>My body tensed up and then shook. When I spoke, I barely recognized my own voice. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>I slid both hands under the scoop neckline of her dress after she nodded, slipping the material down her shoulders, exposing her. I pulled it down, freeing her arms and letting the dress gather at her waist.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d I traced the edge of the lace on her bra. \u201cLook at that blush. So fucking beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Lowering my head, I closed my mouth over the tip of her breast, kissing her through the thin satin. A strangled cry escaped her as I gripped her hips, sucking deep. My heart thumped against my ribs as her fingers dug deep into my hair, holding me close as I moved to the other breast. I nipped gently and was rewarded with another breathy cry.</p><p>Her body already trembled against mine, but I was nowhere near done with her. I slid my hands under the hem of her skirt, moving them up her smooth thighs as I blazed a trail of kisses to her sweetly swollen lips.</p><p>\u201cTell me something, sweetheart.\u201d I made tiny circles along her inner thigh, coming close to her center. \u201cHave you come before?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened in embarrassment and when she didn\u2019t answer, I made those little circles down her thigh. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d I moved my hand back up her thigh.</p><p>She squirmed closer, pressing down on my erection as she rested her forehead against mine. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I was relieved to hear that, even though I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. I skimmed a finger across the center of her damp panties. Her body jerked in a tempting way. I kept moving my finger, back and forth softly.</p><p>I could touch her forever.</p><p>Maybe I would. We could stay right here, one hand deep between her thighs and the other cradling her breast. I could deal with that.</p><p>But then Avery moved.</p><p>She slid her hand down my chest, over my abs, stopping above the band of my jeans. My cock swelled at how close she was. Part of me wanted to take her hand and finish it off, but the other part worried that I would lose control the moment she touched me. She rocked her hips as I made another pass between her legs, circling the bundle of nerves.</p><p>I was totally willing to risk losing control.</p><p>Nipping at her lower lip, I stilled under her. \u201cWhat do you want, Avery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to . . . I want to touch you.\u201d A look of surprise scuttled across her face. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what you like.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, I groaned at her words and pleasure bubbled up to my tip. I placed my hand over hers. \u201cSweetheart, anything you do is something I\u2019m going to like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah.\u201d I pressed back against the couch, creating space between us. \u201cWhatever you want to do to me, I\u2019m going to love it. You don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>Happiness and heat flared in her gaze and then her lashes swept down as she flicked the button of my jeans open and then pulled down the zipper. I chuckled as she gasped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEasy access.\u201d I reached down between us, easing myself out.</p><p>Avery\u2019s eyes remained fixed, and there was nothing hotter than that. My entire body was taut as a bowstring. I couldn\u2019t help myself. I moved my hand up to my tip and then back down to my base as my heart rate kicked up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Every muscle in my body froze. \u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated. \u201cWhen I . . . touched myself, I thought of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d I growled and then clamped my jaw down. I almost came right then and there. She thought about me while she touched herself? Good God almighty and the devil down below . . . \u201cThat is the hottest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tipped up, and I kissed her, harder and rougher than I probably should\u2019ve, but she didn\u2019t shy away. I brought her hand down to me, coaxing her fingers around my thickness. At first contact, my entire body jerked and then she moved her hand up and down.</p><p>What she lacked in skill, she sure as hell made up in eagerness. The innocence in the way she stroked me was almost too much.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d I murmured against her lips as I slid my hand back between her thighs.</p> <p>Our breaths mingled, fast and hard as I cupped her through her panties, pressing my palm against her clit as I pushed my finger into her warmth, separated only by a flimsy barrier. I kept my mouth on hers, taking her tongue into mine as she rode my hand and I thrust into hers.</p><p>I felt her body tense and then she cried out in a harsh expulsion. \u201cCam!\u201d</p><p>Her body spasmed against my hand, wave after wave as I eased her down. Tremors rocked my body as my release barreled through me. I came harder than I ever had and I was amazed by that. She held on, her head dropped against my shoulder as I clamped one arm around her waist.</p><p>Only when I became too sensitive, I gently removed her hand. She was boneless in my embrace as I tucked her against my chest. I knew I needed to let her go. I\u2019d made a mess of her and me, but I loathed to part with her body just yet.</p><p>Reaching up, I tilted her head back and kissed the lids of her eyes and then her parted lips. The silence stretched out between us, comforting until I felt her tense in my arms. Concern flooded me. I knew I hadn\u2019t hurt her, but maybe it was too much?</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, smoothing my thumb along her cheek. A troubled look filled her gaze. \u201cYou okay? I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was perfect.\u201d She kissed my jaw, closing her eyes. \u201cThis is perfect.\u201d</p><p>Avery was right. Oh God, this was the most perfect moment, but a ball of unease formed in my gut. A cloud had passed over her. It was gone now, but it had been there and I couldn\u2019t help but fear that it would come back.</p><p>Twenty-Three</p><p>Ollie stood on the edge of the bench across from us, Avery\u2019s left-over Chinese food in a carton. The fact that he\u2019d brought that to campus with him was weird. And that food had been in the fridge for a couple of days.</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that Presidents\u2019 Day is more interesting than Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d he said, digging his chopsticks into the noodles. \u201cAfter all, Hallmark created V-Day. It\u2019s not a real day.\u201d</p><p>Sitting next to where he stood, Brittany shook her head. \u201cPresidents\u2019 Day is boring. What happens on Presidents\u2019 Day?\u201d</p><p>Avery sat in my lap, curled up against my chest. It was a brutally cold day in February and I had unzipped my hoodie, gathering the ends around her. \u201cDid those two hook up at some point?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>I laughed under my breath. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019re car sales and furniture sales on Presidents\u2019 Day,\u201d Ollie said, grinning as if he was proud of what he came up with. \u201cAnd banks are closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Brittany exchanged a look with Shortcake and then turned her gaze up at Ollie. \u201cYou don\u2019t get laid on Presidents\u2019 Day. You do on Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><p>Ollie paused, a noodle blowing softly in the wind as he looked down at her. \u201cYou offering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I murmured. \u201cSmooth.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake giggled.</p><p>Throwing out her arm, Brittany knocked Ollie off the bench. \u201cNo. I am not offering.\u201d</p><p>Ollie landed nimbly on his feet. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame.\u201d He bent down so close to Brittany that his blond hair tangled with hers. \u201cI\u2019d change your life, baby.\u201d</p><p>Unable to control herself, Avery laughed out loud, and I dropped my head on her shoulder, hiding my face as secondhand embarrassment washed over me.</p><p>Brittany looked unimpressed. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right. I imagine that after one night with you, I\u2019d be paying a visit to the health clinic for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d He slammed his free hand against his chest. \u201cYou wound me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed then. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>Ollie plopped down next to her and held up his chopsticks. \u201cNoodle?\u201d</p><p>Smiling slightly, she shook her head. \u201cNo. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Avery sat up, and cold air sifted in between us. I reached for her, dragging her back against my chest. \u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d I said, wrapping my arms around her. \u201cYou\u2019re like my heated blanket.\u201d</p><p>She twisted toward me, pressing a kiss to the corner of my lips. \u201cI have to go to class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkip,\u201d I murmured, seeking out her lips. \u201cCome home with me.\u201d I chased down her mouth, slipping my tongue between her cool lips. \u201cI\u2019ll warm you up.\u201d</p><p>Her body shivered, and I doubted it had anything to do with the cold. \u201cThat\u2019s about as classy as Ollie changing Brittany\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Ollie shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t bring me into your little love nest.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake\u2019s cheek flushed, and I wondered if she\u2019d forgotten that we weren\u2019t alone. She wiggled her way free, like she had done that night before in my bedroom, on my bed, and I swallowed a groan.</p><p>I really did not need to be thinking about that right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in a little while?\u201d she said to Brittany, giving her a quick hug.</p><p>Brittany nodded. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>Saying good-bye, I dropped my arm over her slim shoulders, intent on walking her to Whitehall. She smiled up at me, squinting. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be on the other side of campus, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I pulled off my cap and slipped it on her head, shielding the sun. \u201cWhat are you and Brittany doing later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to the mall.\u201d She pushed the brim of the cap up a little as she stepped to the side, reaching out with her hand. \u201cWe have some special shopping to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I threaded my fingers through hers. \u201cWhat kind of special shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><p>I grinned and then inhaled deeply. There was dampness in the air. \u201cDoes it have something to do with a day that\u2019s not Presidents\u2019 Day?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and my grin spread. Shortcake had been laughing a lot lately. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see how it is.\u201d We stopped near the covered entrance of the social-sciences building, and I pulled her toward me. She came willingly, stretching up on the tips of her toes. Sliding the cap around so it was backward on her head, I rested my forehead against hers. \u201cCan you smell it?\u201d</p><p>She laughed as she placed a hand on my chest. \u201cMy breath?\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I wrapped an arm around her waist. \u201cNo, you little dork. There\u2019s snow in the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She giggled.</p><p>I kissed her softly. \u201cWell, be careful on your special, secret shopping trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d She reached up, taking off the cap and then fitting it on me. \u201cYou coming by tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a stupid question.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to let her go.</p><p>She made a face at me. \u201cThought there were no such things as stupid questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d Dipping my head, I kissed her once more and then let go. When she turned to leave, I tapped her ass, causing her to jump and shoot me a dirty look. I laughed. \u201cYou liked it.\u201d</p><p>Her flushed cheeks told me I was right.</p><p>The snow fell outside, coming down pretty fast. I was glad I was able to convince Shortcake to skip with me tomorrow. Classes would still be happening, but the campus would be an ice-pit death trap.</p><p>I glanced down at her and smiled. After eating pizza and hanging out with Ollie, she was tuckered out. Deeply asleep, she was curled on her side, her head resting on my leg. I scooped a strand of her hair off her cheek, tucking it back.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s cute, you know?\u201d Ollie bent forward and picked up the last slice of pizza and stood. \u201cOnly she could pass out in the presence of our awesomeness.\u201d</p><p>I laughed softly. \u201cIt was too much for her. She was overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>He grinned as he stepped over my legs. \u201cI\u2019ll let myself out.\u201d</p><p>In the following silence, I traced the elegant curves of her face with my gaze, committing the sweeps and angles to memory. Earlier in the day, as I\u2019d walked over to West Campus with Ollie, he\u2019d made some kind of comment about me being whipped. Funny thing was, it hadn\u2019t ticked me off. I\u2019d laughed. Maybe I was a little whipped. Maybe I was a little obsessed. Maybe I was\u2014</p><p>On the coffee table, Avery\u2019s phone beeped and the screen lit up, and I looked before I realized what I was doing.</p><p>You\u2019re a lying whore. How can you live with yourself?</p><p>I leaned forward, reading the message three times before the light faded from the screen and the text disappeared.</p><p>Shock made me stupid. I had to have read it wrong. Three times? Not likely. Muscles in my back and neck locked up. I don\u2019t know how long I sat there in stunned silence, but beyond the shock, anger simmered in my veins like a slow-burning brushfire. Who in the fuck would\u2019ve sent that to her? Lying whore? I wanted to find the person responsible and rip their spine right out.</p><p>But why would someone send that to her? If Avery was a whore, so was a nun, but why? A muscle began to thrum in my jaw and didn\u2019t stop when Avery stirred.</p><p>Yawning, she sat up and pushed long strands of hair out of her face. A sleepy smile formed on her lush lips. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep on you.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her, unsure if I should say something.</p><p>She straightened as her gaze flickered over my face. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Fuck it. There was no way I could let this pass. I glanced at the table. \u201cYou got a message while you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Her brows knitted as she followed my gaze and then she lurched forward, snapping up her cell. She inhaled sharply when she tapped on the screen.</p><p>I watched the blood seep out of her face and felt the knots of unease grow. \u201cIt flashed across your screen when it came through.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she sat the phone down with trembling hands. She didn\u2019t look at me, but kept staring at it. \u201cYou looked at the text?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I did it on purpose.\u201d Tense, I leaned forward. \u201cIt was right there, sitting on your screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t have to look!\u201d She stood, hands curling at her sides. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whoa. Hold up. \u201cAvery, I wasn\u2019t sneaking through your stuff. The damn text came through. I looked before I could stop myself. Maybe that was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was wrong!\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cOkay. It was wrong. I\u2019m sorry, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I saw that text.\u201d</p><p>She stopped in the middle of the room and there was no mistaking the look of panic darkening her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cAvery,\u201d I said carefully. Her gaze darted to me. \u201cWhy would you get a text like that?\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said again, and then rushed on. \u201cEvery so often I get a text like this, but I don\u2019t know why. I think it\u2019s a wrong-number kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>I still didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who that\u2019s from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. It says unknown caller. You saw that.\u201d She continued on before I could speak. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for freaking out on you. It just surprised me. I was asleep and I wake up and I could tell something was wrong. Then I thought . . . I don\u2019t know what I thought, but I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop apologizing, Avery.\u201d I hated it when she did that. \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear that you\u2019re sorry. I want you to be honest with me, sweetheart. That\u2019s all I want. If you\u2019re getting messages like that, I need to know about that.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Sometimes I wondered if we spoke the same language. \u201cBecause I\u2019m your boyfriend and I care if someone is calling you a whore!\u201d</p><p>Avery flinched.</p><p>Taking another deep breath, I looked away. \u201cHonestly? It pisses me off, even if it\u2019s an accidental text. No one should be sending you shit like that.\u201d I paused, finding her gaze and holding it. \u201cYou know you can tell me anything, right? I\u2019m not going to judge you or get mad.\u201d</p> <p>The moment those words left my mouth, I realized how absolutely fucking fake I was. Here I was telling Avery she could tell me anything, getting pissed off because I knew she wasn\u2019t, and I was keeping secrets.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered, and then louder, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>My heart kicked in my chest as I stared into her eyes. \u201cAnd you trust me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I growled, and my muscles tensed even further. A ball of ice formed in my chest. Telling her was a risk. She could think I was a violent person and walk away, but I needed to be honest, especially if I expected her to be.</p><p>I was scared shitless.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been entirely honest with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>I scrubbed my hand along my jaw. In for a penny, in for a pound or some shit, right? \u201cI tell you that you should trust me and that you can tell me anything, but I\u2019m not doing the same thing. And eventually you\u2019re going to find out.\u201d</p><p>Avery hurried around the coffee table and sat on the edge of the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Cam?\u201d</p><p>I could lose her, I realized, but I had to tell her the truth. \u201cYou know how I told you we all have done shit in our past we aren\u2019t proud of?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can say that from firsthand experience. Only a few people know about this.\u201d I paused. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the last thing I want to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me,\u201d she said, scooting closer. \u201cSeriously, you can talk to me. Please.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know where to start. It took me a few moments. \u201cI should be graduating this year, along with Ollie, but I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you telling me you had to take some time off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was sophomore year. I hadn\u2019t been home a lot during the summer because I was helping coach a soccer camp in Maryland, but whenever I did go home, my sister . . . she was acting different. I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it, but she was super jumpy and when she was home, she spent all her time in her bedroom. And apparently she was rarely home, according to my parents. My sister, she\u2019s always been this bleeding heart, you know. Picking up stray animals and people, especially stray guys. Even when she was a tiny thing, she always buddied up with the most unpopular kid in the class.\u201d I smiled at the memory. \u201cShe met this guy. He was a year or two older than her and I guess their relationship was serious\u2014as serious as they can be when you\u2019re sixteen. Met the kid once. Didn\u2019t like him. And it had nothing to do with the fact he was trying to get with my little sister. There was just something about him that rubbed me the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my hands to my knees as I felt the familiar anger building inside me. \u201cI was home over Thanksgiving break and I was in the kitchen. Teresa was in there and we were messing around. She pushed me and I pushed her back, on her arm. Not even hard and she cried out like I\u2019d seriously hurt her. At first I thought she was just being dumb, but there were tears in her eyes. She played it off and I forgot about it for that night, but on Thanksgiving morning, Mom walked in on her in a towel and she saw it.\u201d</p><p>Avery took a deep breath, and I shook my head. \u201cMy sister . . . she was covered in bruises. Up and down her arms, on her legs.\u201d I closed my hands into helpless fists. \u201cShe said it was from dancing, but we all knew you couldn\u2019t get bruises like that from dancing. It took almost all morning to get the truth out of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was her boyfriend?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>I swallowed hard. \u201cThe little fuck had been hitting her. He was smart about it, doing it in places that weren\u2019t so easily noticeable. She stayed with him. I didn\u2019t know why at first. Come to find out that she was too scared of him to break up.\u201d Unable to sit still, I stood and prowled toward the window. \u201cWho knows how long it would\u2019ve continued if Mom hadn\u2019t walked in when she did. Would Teresa have finally told someone? Or would that bastard have just kept hitting her one night and killed her?\u201d</p><p>My head hung forward. All of this felt like yesterday\u2014the anger and helplessness. \u201cGod, I was so pissed, Avery. I wanted to kill the fuck. He was beating up my sister and my dad wanted to call the police, but what were they really going to do? Both of them were minors. He\u2019d get his hands slapped and get counseling, whatever. And that\u2019s bullshit. I wasn\u2019t okay with that. I left Thanksgiving night and I found him. Didn\u2019t take much, fucking small town and all. I knocked on his door and he came right out. I told him he couldn\u2019t come around my sister anymore and you know what that little punk did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe got all up in my face, puffing his fucking chest at me. Told me he would do whatever the fuck he wanted.\u201d I laughed, but there was no humor in it. \u201cI lost it. Angry isn\u2019t even the word to use. I was enraged. I hit him and I didn\u2019t stop.\u201d Pulse pounding, I faced her. \u201cI didn\u2019t stop hitting him. Not when his parents came out or when his mom starting screaming. It took two police officers to get me off him.\u201d</p><p>Avery didn\u2019t say anything as she stared at me.</p><p>I rubbed my palms over my cheeks. \u201cI ended up in jail and he ended up in a coma.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened in shock, and there it was. Ducking my chin, I looked away as I sat in the moon chair. \u201cI\u2019d been in fights before\u2014normal shit. But nothing like that. My knuckles were busted wide open and I didn\u2019t even feel it. My dad . . .\u201d I shook my head. \u201cHe worked his magic. I should\u2019ve gone away for a long time for that, but I didn\u2019t. Guess it helped that the kid woke up a few days later.</p><p>\u201cI got off easy\u2014not even a night in jail.\u201d I smiled wryly. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t leave home for several months while it got worked out. I ended up with a year\u2019s worth of community service at the local boys\u2019 club and then another year\u2019s worth of anger management. That\u2019s what I do every Friday. My last session is in the fall. My family had to pay restitution and you don\u2019t even want to know how much that cost. I had to stop playing soccer because of the community-service gig, but . . . like I said, I got off easy.\u201d</p><p>Avery looked away, brows pressing together. Her face was pale and the longer she was silent, the sicker I felt. What had I\u2014</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said quietly. I stared at her, not sure I was hearing her correctly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cI understand why you did it.\u201d</p><p>Did she hear anything I had done? I stood. \u201cAvery\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what it says about me, but you were defending your sister and beating the crap out of someone isn\u2019t the answer, but she\u2019s your sister and . . .\u201d She paused, seeming to search for the right words. \u201cThere are some people who deserve an ass kicking.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her.</p><p>She unfolded her legs. \u201cAnd there are probably some people who don\u2019t even deserve to breathe. It\u2019s a sick and sad thing to say, but it\u2019s true. The guy could\u2019ve killed your sister. Hell, he could have beaten some other girl to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI deserve to be in jail, Avery. I almost killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth, but there were no words. How could she be so understanding?</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you a question. Would you do it again?\u201d</p><p>The million-dollar question. \u201cI still would\u2019ve driven to his house and I would\u2019ve hit him. Maybe not as badly, but honestly, I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve changed anything. The bastard beat my sister.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled deeply. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>I continued to stare at her, feeling as if I should drop to my knees. \u201cYou\u2019re . . .\u201d</p><p>One slim shoulder rose. \u201cTwisted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I smiled, absolutely dumbfounded. \u201cYou\u2019re remarkable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far,\u201d she said, grinning slightly.</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d I sat down beside her on the couch. \u201cI thought you would be disgusted or angry if you knew.\u201d</p><p>Avery shook her head, sending strands of coppery hair everywhere.</p><p>My God, she was . . . there were no words. Dropping my forehead to hers, I cupped her cheeks. It felt like a gorilla had been lifted off my shoulders. \u201cIt feels good getting that off my chest. I don\u2019t want there to be secrets between us.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved up and I kissed their corners. Overcome with relief, I sat back, cradling her to my chest. This girl was . . . she was perfect in all the ways that mattered.</p><p>I kissed the top of her head, and her chest rose sharply. The relief I felt was staggering, and I honestly hadn\u2019t prepared myself for Shortcake to be so accepting. Sighing, I closed my eyes and gathered her as close as I could.</p><p>Avery had accepted my secret. Now if only I could get her to see that I would do the same for her.</p><p>Twenty-Four</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough roses for today?\u201d Ollie asked, nodding at the single-stem rose I held in my hand. And then he glanced at the newest addition in the corner of the living room. \u201cPlus that? You\u2019re making the rest of us guys look bad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jase laughed from his position on the couch, bottle of beer in his hand. \u201cI really don\u2019t think you could appear any badder, Ollie.\u201d</p><p>He huffed as he kicked up his legs onto the coffee table. \u201cAt least I know \u2018badder\u2019 isn\u2019t a word.\u201d</p><p>Jase smirked. \u201cThat\u2019s about all you know.\u201d</p><p>I rolled Shortcake\u2019s present into the outside hallway and then turned back to them, brows raised. \u201cAre you guys going to be here all night getting drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d they replied in unison.</p><p>\u201cWell, have fun with that.\u201d Saluting them, I slipped outside and placed her present beside her door, against the wall. I knocked, fighting an idiotic grin as I heard the soft thuds coming from her gift.</p><p>Avery opened the door, her gaze dropping to the rose. \u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, handing it over as I stepped inside. \u201cI am really sorry about not being able to take you out tonight, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool. I know you have those meetings.\u201d She carried the rose to the vase on her kitchen counter, where the rest of the roses I\u2019d been giving her were. Looking over her shoulder at me, she cocked her head to the side. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cStay right where you are and close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to close my eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Excitement flashed across her face, but she was desperate to play it cool. \u201cSo it\u2019s a surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. So close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched. \u201cYour surprises are just as scary as your ideas.\u201d</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cMy ideas and my surprises are brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when you thought it would be a good idea to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes, Avery.\u201d</p><p>Her grin spread into a wide smile as she obeyed. Spinning around, I hurried out to the hall and rolled the gift inside. I kicked the door shut. \u201cDon\u2019t peek.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cCam . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple more seconds.\u201d I wrapped my hand around hers, leading her from the kitchen into the living room. \u201cKeep your eyes closed, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re closed.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed her hand and then let go. Stepping up from behind her, I slid an arm around her waist and leaned over her, kissing her temple. Her fingers curled around my arm as she sighed.</p> <p>\u201cYou can open your eyes now.\u201d I kissed her cheek. \u201cOr you can stand there with your eyes closed. I like that, too.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and I knew the moment she opened her eyes. \u201cOh my God, Cam . . .\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d decked out a fifty-gallon terrarium, complete with sand and rock bedding and foliage. Peeking out from a hidey-hole was a small tortoise, craning its neck, checking out its new home.</p><p>She made a tiny, squeal-like noise.</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cYou like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d Shortcake pulled free and placed her hands on the glass. \u201cI . . . I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I moved to stand beside her. \u201cI thought Raphael could use a playdate.\u201d</p><p>She laughed as she squeezed her eyes tight and reopened them. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done all of this, Cam. This is . . . too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that much and everyone needs a pet turtle.\u201d I swooped down, kissing her cheek once more. \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><p>Avery spun around and threw her arms around me. She kissed me, stealing my breath. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I brushed my lips over hers. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.</p><p>She slid her arms around my waist and leaned in. \u201cIs it a boy or a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I really don\u2019t know. Supposedly you can tell by the shape of their shell, but hell if I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, boy or girl, I\u2019m going to name him Michelangelo.\u201d</p><p>I threw my head back and laughed. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just need two more.\u201d</p><p>This girl was fucking perfect. \u201cSo true.\u201d</p><p>She wiggled free, smiling. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>Before I could say a word, she pivoted around and took off down the hall. While she was gone, I pushed the terrarium against the wall and turned the heat lamp on. Hearing her approach, I turned around.</p><p>\u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day. It\u2019s not as cool as your gift, but I hope you like it.\u201d</p><p>A card was shoved at my chest. Smiling, I took it and peered down at her. \u201cI\u2019m sure I will.\u201d Carefully, I opened the card. There was a message written inside.</p><p>You mean everything to me.</p><p>I stared at the message for probably what was too long. My heart was pounding and warmth flooded my veins. I smiled\u2014I smiled like I\u2019d just been handed a million dollars. And that was before I even saw the tickets.</p><p>I held them between my fingers. \u201cThis is an absolutely amazing gift, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She clasped her hands together under her chest. \u201cI hoped you\u2019d like it. I mean, I know not playing soccer sucks and I hope this doesn\u2019t make you sad going to the game and you don\u2019t have to take me\u2014\u201d</p><p>I caught the rest of her words with my lips and my tongue. I liked the tickets. The gift was great, but I\u2019d never tell her that it was those five words that I loved. \u201cOf course I\u2019m taking you. The gift is perfect.\u201d I nipped at her lower lip, and she gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>Those words replayed over and over in my hand as I clasped her hips and pulled her against me. I was fully aroused, which seemed like a constant state of being around her.</p><p>My stomach dipped as she looped her arms around my neck. I didn\u2019t have to say anything as I lifted her. Shortcake wrapped those legs right around my waist as I kissed her deeply, drinking her in and refusing to let her go. She moaned, and a painfully intense lust slammed into me.</p><p>I was on a mindless autopilot as I carried her back to her room and my stomach was still dipping as I laid her on her back. I stared down at her for a few seconds and then I leaned back, tugging my sweater off and tossing it aside. I leaned over, planting my hands on either side of her head. My chest was rising and falling in uneven breaths. I needed her as badly as I needed the rush of taking a ball down the field, of scoring. Maybe even more so than that.</p><p>She traced a delicate, slender finger over the flames surrounding the sun on my chest. \u201cI love this tattoo. Why did you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want to know?\u201d</p><p>Her thick lashes lifted. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty lame.\u201d</p><p>She continued to follow the design, sending a bolt of electricity through my body. \u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it after the fight with Teresa\u2019s ex.\u201d I slid my hands under her shirt, smiling at the feel of her soft skin and when she lifted up so I could remove it. \u201cI was kind of messed up for a while. Couldn\u2019t go back to school, was stuck in my home, and I\u2019d done that to myself. I was worried that there had been something wrong with me to lose it like I did.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her hands to her sides as I placed mine on her bare stomach, mere centimeters under the fragile clasp of her bra. My hair fell into my face as I leaned over, placing my other hand beside her head. \u201cI was depressed. I was pissed off at myself and the world and all that bullshit.\u201d I smoothed my hand down her belly, smiling when her hips lifted just a little bit. \u201cI think I drank just about every liquor my dad had in his bar over the course of a couple of weeks. I knew my parents were worried, but . . .\u201d</p><p>The hollow between her raised breasts looked absolutely lonely and distracted me. Lowering my head, I pressed a kiss between them and did it again when she sucked in a soft breath. \u201cJase came to visit me often. So did Ollie. I probably would\u2019ve lost my fucking mind without them.\u201d Placing my fingers on the clasp, I looked up, my eyes locking with hers. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I lowered my gaze as I unhooked the clasp, leaving the rest in place. I\u2019d never seen her bare there before. I wanted to take my sweet-ass time. \u201cIt was something Jase had said to me while I was drunk off my ass. Don\u2019t know why, but it stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>Her chest rose as I dragged a finger up the center of her chest. \u201cWhat did . . . what did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said something like things can\u2019t be that bad if the sun is out and shining. Like I said, that stuck with me. Maybe because it\u2019s the truth. As long as the sun\u2019s shining, shit can\u2019t be that bad. So that\u2019s why I got a tattoo of the sun. Sort of a reminder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not lame.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cHmm . . .\u201d It was pretty lame, but it had worked. I hooked my finger under the edge of her bra and pushed it aside, doing the same to the other cup.</p><p>I devoured her with my gaze. The dusky pink tips of her full breasts immediately puckered, begging me. Staring down at them, I felt like I\u2019d never seen breasts before. I wanted to touch them, lick them, and suck them. All at once.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful, Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>I gently ran my hand over her breasts, marveling in the feel of them. Her back arched and my gaze flicked up to her face. \u201cSo perfect,\u201d I said, the words a rushed, low growl as I captured a hardened nipple between my thumb and finger.</p><p>I wanted to see more of her.</p><p>Meeting her gaze, I lowered my hand to the button on her jeans. When she nodded again, it was like winning the fucking World Cup. I slid her jeans down, stopping at the skull-and-bones socks. \u201cNice socks. Very goth.\u201d</p><p>When her jeans and socks were gone, I slid the bra down her arms. Within seconds, she was in panties. Rocking back, I admired my handiwork. The length of her legs and the curve of her waist were only separated by a scrap of lace. I almost went to remove it, but instinct told me no.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter what had happened in her past. Either way, I knew beyond a doubt she had no experience in any of this. All of these things\u2014the kissing, the touching through clothes, being naked\u2014all of it was a first for her. And I wanted to experience all of those things right along with her.</p><p>I kissed her slowly as I skimmed my hand over her chest, following the swell with my fingers. She moaned softly when I left her lips, trailing a path of tiny kisses down her throat. I hesitated for only a second and then closed my mouth over the tip of her breast.</p><p>Lust pounded like rain from a summer storm as her back arched and her hips moved. The taste of her went straight to my cock, blew a hole through my chest, and scattered all my thoughts. I twirled my tongue around the tightened tip as I slid my hand under the lace covering her.</p><p>Her legs tensed beside mine as my finger brushed her clit and her head fell back as I moved to her other breast and then worked my way down her stomach. I raised my head, my gaze locking with hers as I slowly slid a finger into her slick wetness. God, she was so tight, so wet.</p><p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A smile played over my lips as I pushed with my finger. Her entire body reacted, trembling and flushing. I was shaking. As I held her gaze, I started a slow pace, thrusting my finger in and out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so tight,\u201d I said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lowering my mouth to hers, I kissed her as her hips moved against my hand. The feel of her chest against mine was a sensation I\u2019d long remember. It wasn\u2019t long when she cried out against my mouth and I felt her clenching around my finger. I almost lost it right then and there.</p><p>I burrowed my head on her throat as she shook. \u201cI love how you say my name.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I forced myself to ease my finger out of her and to pull away, but before I could get very far, she surprised me. Sitting up, she placed her hands on my chest, rolling me onto my back. A second later, she had straddled me.</p><p>Hellooo.</p> <p>Drawing in a sharp breath, I almost lost it right there at the sight of her, almost nude as she rose up. Totally unaware of how she appeared made it all the more seductive. I reached for her, but damn, Shortcake was quick when she wanted to be. She slid down, her fingers trembling as she fumbled with the button on my jeans. I started to help her, but then she got them unbuttoned and was sliding them down my legs.</p><p>I clenched the comforter when her hand wrapped around me and her warm breath teased the head of my cock. My heart jumped. \u201cOh shit.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was pure woman. Then her head lowered and her hair slipped forward. I came off the bed, back bowing and hips jerking as her warm, wet mouth closed over me. Fire flooded my blood and I swelled as she gripped me and laved her tongue over the sensitive tip.</p><p>I cupped her hand with mine and wrapped my other around the back of her head, holding her hair back. But as she took me deeper into her mouth, I couldn\u2019t stop myself from pushing her down.</p><p>My moans echoed through the room and it was mere minutes before my release was on me. I pulled her away before I came, hauling her up against my chest and kissing her as I pressed against her belly.</p> <p>Weak and totally spent, I collapsed onto my back and Avery did the same. Both of us were breathing raggedly. \u201cThis was the best fucking Valentine\u2019s Day ever.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI have to agree.\u201d</p><p>I slapped around between us until I found her hand and squeezed. Several moments passed and while I wondered what to say, the stupidest thing came out of my mouth. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She yawned. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>I was an idiot. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Another stretch of silence fell between us and then she asked, \u201cStay with me? The night?\u201d</p> <p>Rolling onto my side, I trailed a hand over her shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask twice.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Five</p><p>Winter hadn\u2019t wanted to loosen its hold on West \u201cby God\u201d Virginia. The sun came out most of February and March, but the temps were brutal. Even over spring break. While most everyone headed south, Avery and I headed west. We spent most of the break at my parents\u2019 house. Needless to say, Mom was happy that I\u2019d brought a real live girl home again.</p><p>As spring recess, or whatever the hell they were calling the four-day weekend in April, came into sweet, sweet view, it seemed like yesterday when Avery sat outside on the curb with a beer bottle and we\u2019d made our way inside. I couldn\u2019t believe how much time had passed.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe Shortcake was also skipping the rest of the day with me and had allowed me to make up for her birthday. On the eve of our mini-break from school, we\u2019d spent the day in D.C. and had returned late.</p><p>\u201cGuess what?\u201d I slid my hands up her sides until they rested under her rib cage. \u201cGot another idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it involve eggs?\u201d</p><p>I laughed as I tugged her hips against mine. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t involve eggs.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes took on the glazed, unfocused quality that I had become familiar with over the last months. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it does involve something equally tasty.\u201d I pressed my mouth to her temple, tracing her cheekbone with my lips. \u201cAnd it involves you, me, a bed, and very little, if any, clothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I moved my hands to her lower back, my fingers brushing the pockets of her jeans. I kissed her brow. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>She tipped her head back, luring me in. The kiss started off slow, but then, like always, it turned into something different. Something hungry. Something that always wanted more.</p><p>My hands found their way under her shirt and I pulled away long enough to tug her shirt off. Our mouths crashed back together\u2014lips, tongues, teeth. We bumped into the couch and I lost my balance. I fell backward, half on the couch, half off.</p><p>Avery\u2019s laughter reached deep inside me and I captured her cheeks in my hands. Staring into her dancing eyes, the words formed in my thoughts.</p><p>I loved her.</p><p>That feeling had been there for a while, probably longer than I dared acknowledge. Maybe even from the first time she\u2019d turned me down, I\u2019d begun to fall in love with her.</p><p>I was in love with her this very second.</p><p>The realization shook me to the core. I stared into those warm, whiskey-colored eyes and I wanted to see my future there\u2014our future there. Never in my life had I ever wanted to see that when I stared into a chick\u2019s eyes, but with Avery Morgansten, I wanted nothing more.</p><p>My brain turned off and everything I did from that point on was fueled by those three words. I loved her. My hands shook and I was surprised by how fast I got her jeans off.</p><p>I cupped her breasts, running my thumbs over her nipples. Her muffled moan reverberated through me. I wanted\u2014no, I needed to hear her call out my name. Dammit, I needed to hear her say those three words or at least feel them.</p><p>Thrusting my hand under her panties, I palmed her, rubbing my thumb over the spot that always made her cry out and it did. She undid my jeans and slipped her hand inside, wrapping her fingers around me.</p><p>The desire was almost too much. I thrust against her palm. \u201cAvery.\u201d</p><p>She came apart at the sound of her name, throwing her head back, and it was fucking beautiful.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember standing, but she wrapped herself around me as I carried her back to the bed. After I placed her in the center, she watched me strip bare. Her lips parted, and I groaned.</p><p>Crawling onto the bed, blood pounded in my ears as I hooked my fingers under her panties and waited for her to give me a sign that it was okay.</p><p>She lifted her hips.</p><p>I praised God and baby Jesus.</p><p>Finally, after so long, there was nothing between us. Not true, whispered a voice in the back of my head, but it fell to the side as my gaze swept over her. I said she was beautiful a million times and I\u2019d say she was beautiful a million more. From the dusky tips of her breasts to the sweet curve of her hips and the shadowy area between her thighs, she was fucking beautiful.</p><p>I tasted my way down her body and back up, too far gone to really taste her. I hovered over her, letting her feel me between her thighs. Avery shuddered and I squeezed my eyes shut as she placed her hands against my chest.</p><p>My body strained to be inside hers. \u201cDo you want this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, and it was like angels harking in my head.</p><p>Our gazes met as I bent my head, kissing her as I lowered my body onto hers. Getting a condom was a distant thought but I couldn\u2019t stop. The tip of my erection slid through and then into her wetness, causing my muscles to tense. The feeling was overwhelming. My kiss turned deeper and I eased my hips\u2014</p><p>Avery twisted her head to the side. \u201cNo. Stop.\u201d She pushed against my chest with surprising strength. \u201cPlease stop.\u201d</p><p>Those words cut through the haze and I froze. \u201cAvery? What the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off.\u201d Her voice pitched high, full of panic. \u201cGet off. Please. Get off me.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea what was going on, but within an instant, I was off her and she was moving. Crawling across the bed, she grabbed the comforter and held it to her chest as she stood. She backed up until she hit the dresser, rattling the bottles and knocking some over. The skin around her lips was pale and her eyes were wide and dark.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she whispered hoarsely.</p><p>Concern and horror warred inside me as I stared at her. \u201cDid I hurt you? I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No!\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me. You didn\u2019t even . . . I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry . . .\u201d</p><p>I rested my hands on the bed. \u201cTalk to me, Avery. What just happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cNothing happened. I just thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought what?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not a big deal\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a big deal?\u201d My brows shot up. Was she serious? \u201cAvery, you just scared the shit out of me. You started panicking like I was hurting you or\u2014\u201d The next words tasted like ash and vomit as I spoke them. \u201cOr like I was forcing you to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t forcing me, Cam. I liked what you were doing.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand what just happened. \u201cYou know I would never hurt you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Tears filled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd I would never force you to do anything you didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d I held her gaze. \u201cYou understand that, right? If you\u2019re not ready, I\u2019m okay with that, but you have to talk to me. You have to let me know before it gets to that point.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but I didn\u2019t feel any better. All I could hear was the terrified note in her voice when she had begged me to stop. Air caught in my lungs and what I knew about Avery flashed through my thoughts, all building to what I had already assumed, what I prayed wasn\u2019t what had happened to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you not telling me?\u201d I asked. When she didn\u2019t say anything, a muscle jumped along my jaw. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d she shouted. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about, dammit. Just fucking drop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d I took a breath. It was time. No more secrets. \u201cYou\u2019re lying to me. Something happened, because that?\u201d I gestured at the bed behind me. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t about not being ready. That was about something else, because you know\u2014you know\u2014I would wait for you, Avery. I swear, but you have to tell me what\u2019s going on in your head.\u201d</p><p>She still said nothing, and my chest began to ache as a terrible realization occurred. Didn\u2019t she trust me? Didn\u2019t she realize how I felt? But did that matter if she didn\u2019t trust me? The answer was an icy wind down my spine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging you, Avery.\u201d I leaned forward, clenching the sheet. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be up-front and honest with me. You said that you trusted me. You\u2019ve got to prove it, because I know there is more to this. I\u2019m not stupid and I\u2019m not blind. I remember how you acted when we first met and I sure as hell remember what you said that night you were drunk. And that text message you got? Are you telling me that has nothing to do with this? If you trust me, you will finally tell me what the hell is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do trust you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I waited for her to say more, to say anything that would prove her words, but she said nothing and there was this horrible cracking feeling in my chest. I threw off the sheets and stood. Grabbing my jeans, I pulled them on as my heart pounded in a way that made me feel sick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Facing her, I smoothed my hands through my hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to do with you, Avery. I\u2019ve told you shit that I\u2019m not proud of. Stuff that hardly anyone in this world knows and yet you keep shit from me. You keep everything from me. You don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I do.\u201d She started toward me but stopped \u201cI trust you with my life.\u201d</p><p>Anger whipped through me like a barb-tipped chain. \u201cBut not with the truth? That\u2019s such bullshit, Avery.\u201d I stalked out of the bedroom. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>She followed me, trailing the thick comforter behind her. \u201cCam\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop it.\u201d I grabbed my sweater off the floor and turned to her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to do and I know I don\u2019t know everything in the world, but I do know that relationships don\u2019t work this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Her voice shook, and I steeled myself against it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m saying, Avery? There are some obvious issues with you, and no, don\u2019t fucking look at me like I kicked your puppy. Do you think I\u2019d break up with you because of whatever the hell went on with you? Just like you thought I\u2019d think differently of you when I saw the scar on your wrist? I know you think that and that\u2019s bullshit.\u201d I sucked in a breath as raw pain hit me in the chest. The next words hurt. \u201cHow can there be any future for us if you can\u2019t be honest with me? If you can\u2019t really trust that how I feel about you is strong enough, then we have nothing. This is the shit that ends relationships. Not the past, Avery, but the present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more, Avery. I told you before. All I asked from you was to trust me and not shut me out.\u201d I forced myself to walk to the door. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t trust me and you shut me out again.\u201d</p> <p>I closed the door behind me, ignoring the burn building up my throat. The one thing I\u2019d asked from Avery was the one thing she couldn\u2019t give me. Nothing, not even love, would work without trust.</p><p>It was over.</p><p>Twenty-Six</p><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s good to see that you\u2019ve showered finally and have left your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>I stopped halfway between the living room and the bathroom. Spying Jase on the couch, I ignored the statement as I pulled a shirt on over my head. \u201cDid I get a new roommate or are you in the habit of just letting yourself into my house now?\u201d</p><p>His lips curved up in a smirk. \u201cActually, while you were scrubbing two days\u2019 worth of funk off your crusty ass, Ollie let me in.\u201d</p> <p>I dropped onto the other end of the couch, picked up my cap and pulled it down low. \u201cAnd where is my esteemed roommate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s over at the house.\u201d Jase rested his legs on the coffee table, crossing his ankles. \u201cThere\u2019s a mean game of Call of Duty going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why aren\u2019t you there?\u201d</p><p>He pinned me with a look as dry as my throat. \u201cReally? Ollie hasn\u2019t seen you in two days. You finally just stepped out of your bedroom. He\u2019s concerned.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>Jase watched me, and I knew that look. I groaned, and he grinned shamelessly. \u201cWhat the hell is going on, Cam?\u201d</p><p>How could I answer that question? And where could I even start? I leaned my head against the back of the couch and sighed. The familiar burning sensation was building in my chest. Thinking about her, knowing that she was so close and completely out of my reach just killed me.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head, laughing dryly. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cCare to explain that further?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d I raised my hands, scrubbing my palms down my cheeks. \u201cShe\u2019s not telling me the truth about . . . well, about something I know that\u2019s really important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it have to do with what you thought that night of the party?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded without saying anything.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Jase sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be some hard shit to talk about, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Fuck. I know, but you don\u2019t understand . . .\u201d I trailed off, swallowing hard. \u201cThere is shit I\u2019m not going to talk about, Jase. I wouldn\u2019t do that to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that. I understand.\u201d Jase dropped his feet onto the floor and hunched forward. He let out another heavy breath. \u201cBut what happened? I\u2019m assuming you guys had a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fight?\u201d I laughed again, but it sounded so wrong. \u201cI left her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Jase pursed his lips. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>I raised my hands helplessly. \u201cI asked her\u2014I begged her to tell me the truth and she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you left her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how it sounds.\u201d I shot him a look. \u201cI feel like a big enough fucking ass without you thinking it.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cDidn\u2019t say a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking it.\u201d My eyes narrowed. \u201cBut you don\u2019t get it. There\u2019s nothing if we don\u2019t trust one another\u2014there\u2019s nothing if she doesn\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>Jase nodded. \u201cI agree. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s obvious you really care for her . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but . . .\u201d</p><p>But I wanted what my parents have. I wanted something that could last with Avery, and how could we build a relationship when she didn\u2019t trust me with the truth of her past? When I trusted her? We couldn\u2019t. And I couldn\u2019t go through what happened with her Wednesday night again. I never wanted to see that horror in her face. I never wanted to think that I had been the cause of it. Thinking about it now still made me sick. Not because of what might have happened to her, but because what I was doing had, in one way or another, terrified her.</p><p>And that would never change until she was honest with me.</p><p>Jase left shortly after that, but not before trying to get me to go with him. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to be around other people, especially a bunch of drunk people. When a knock came about an hour later, I figured it was him again, but when I opened the door, I was caught off guard.</p><p>Avery stood there, arms huddled around her waist. Her eyes were red and swollen. Fresh tears tracked down her cheeks. I opened my mouth, but closed it.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d Her voice cracked in a way that made my chest splinter. \u201cPlease, Cam. I won\u2019t take up much of your time. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Avery?\u201d Concern for her overshadowed everything else.</p><p>\u201cYes. No. I don\u2019t know.\u201d She gave a little shake of her head. \u201cI just need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Drawing in a deep breath, I stepped aside. \u201cOllie\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>A little bit of tension seeped out of her shoulders. I led her into the living room and sat on the couch. I had no idea what was going on, but I doubted she was about to unload a confession. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Avery?\u201d</p><p>She sat on the edge of the tattered recliner that had belonged to Ollie\u2019s dad. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>Tensing, I scooted forward, twisting my cap backward. \u201cAvery, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been honest with you and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her lip started to tremble and the urge to gather her in my arms was hard to resist. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, and you probably don\u2019t have time for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have time for you, Avery. You want to talk to me, I\u2019m here. I\u2019ve been here. And I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>I held her gaze until she let out a deep breath and then she began to talk\u2014to really talk. \u201cWhen I was fourteen, I went to this party on Halloween. I was there with my friends. We were all dressed up and there was this guy there. It was his house and . . . and he was three years older than me and friends with my cousin.\u201d</p><p>Avery\u2019s gaze drifted to her hands. They opened and closed every few seconds. \u201cHe was really popular. So was I.\u201d She laughed dryly. \u201cThat might not seem important, but it was. I never thought someone like him could do\u2014could be like he was. And maybe that was stupid of me, like a fatal flaw or something. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Her lashes lifted, piercing me with watery eyes. \u201cI was talking to him and I was drinking, but I wasn\u2019t drunk. I swear to you, I wasn\u2019t drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you, Avery.\u201d God, I knew where this was heading and I already hurt for her. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were flirting and it was fun. You know, I didn\u2019t think anything of it. He was a good guy and he was a good-looking guy. At one point, he pulled me into his lap and someone took our picture. We were having fun.\u201d The second laugh was just as harsh. \u201cWhen he got up and pulled me into one of the empty guest rooms that was on the ground floor, I didn\u2019t think anything of it. We sat on the couch and talked for a little while. Then he put his arms around me.\u201d</p><p>Avery stopped, rubbing her hands together, and I prepared myself. I truly tried to. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t mind, but he started doing things I didn\u2019t want him to. I told him to stop and he laughed it off. I started crying and I tried to get away from him, but he was stronger than me, and once he got me on my stomach, I couldn\u2019t do anything really, but to tell him to stop.\u201d</p><p>I stopped breathing. \u201cDid he stop?\u201d</p><p>Please tell me he stopped. Please. Please. Please.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cHe never stopped no matter what I did.\u201d</p><p>It was like being shot in the spine. I started to stand, because I had to move, but I couldn\u2019t make my legs work. \u201cHe raped you?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and then . . . then she nodded and opened her eyes, and I wanted nothing more than to change that yes into a no. But I couldn\u2019t. \u201cI am still a virgin. He didn\u2019t touch me there. That\u2019s not how he . . . raped me.\u201d</p><p>At first I didn\u2019t get it. Maybe it was brain overload, because I couldn\u2019t figure out how she could\u2019ve been raped and was still a virgin, but then it hit me. Horror gripped me. He . . . the sick motherfucker had sodomized her. My hands closed into fists. \u201cSon of a bitch, you were fourteen and he did that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I dragged my hands through my hair, wanting to pull it out. \u201cShit. Avery. I suspected something. I thought that something like that might have happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIt was the way you acted sometimes. How jumpy you could be, but I\u2019d just hoped it didn\u2019t go that far. And when you told me you were still a virgin, I thought that was the case. Avery, I\u2019m so, so sorry. You should have never had to go through something like that, especially at that age . . .\u201d Anger for her clogged my throat. \u201cPlease tell me that motherfucker is in jail for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is now.\u201d She turned her gaze to the TV. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have time.\u201d I gave her a moment, not wanting her to shut down on me, not after we came so far, not when I wanted to commit murder. \u201cWhat else, Avery? Please talk to me, because I\u2019m seconds away from booking a flight to Texas and killing a motherfucker.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She leaned back, tucking her knees against her chest. \u201cAfter he stopped, I really don\u2019t think he had a clue that he\u2019d done anything wrong. He just left me there on his couch and when I could get up, I knew I needed to tell someone. I knew I needed to go to the hospital. I was in so much . . .\u201d Pain. She didn\u2019t finish the sentence, but I could see it in her eyes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find my friends, but I found my purse, and I ended up walking out of the house and I kept walking until I remembered I had my phone with me. I called 911.\u201d</p><p>She stood suddenly. \u201cI ended up at the hospital and they did an exam. The police showed up and I told them what happened and it was the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it was the truth.\u201d I watched her pace, her steps quick and agitated.</p><p>\u201cBy the time the police left the hospital, the party was over, but Blaine was at his house,\u201d she continued as if she hadn\u2019t heard me. \u201cThey arrested him and took him in. I went home and I stayed out of school for the next two days, but everyone found out that he\u2019d been arrested for what he\u2019d done. And then his parents showed up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis parents and mine were\u2014are\u2014country-club buddies. All they ever cared about was image. My mom and dad have more money than they could ever want, but . . .\u201d Her voice turned thick and hoarse. \u201cThe Fitzgeralds offered my parents a deal. That if I dropped the charges and remained quiet about what happened, they would pay me and them an ungodly sum of money.\u201d</p><p>I gaped at her. \u201cAnd your parents told them to go fuck themselves, right?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but it sounded broken. \u201cThey showed my parents the picture that was taken of Blaine and me at the party and they said that if this went to court, no one would believe the girl in the \u2018slutty costume sitting in his lap.\u2019 And my parents, they didn\u2019t want to deal with the scandal. They\u2019d rather it all go away, so they agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I whispered hoarsely.</p> <p>\u201cIt happened so fast. I couldn\u2019t believe what my parents were telling me to do. They hadn\u2019t really talked to me about it before, but they . . . they had been so worried about what everyone would think if the whole thing went public\u2014the pictures and the fact that I had been drinking. I was just so scared and confused and you know, I\u2019m not even sure they believed me.\u201d She tugged her hair back, squeezing her eyes shut. \u201cSo I signed the papers.\u201d</p><p>Not only did I want to kill the fucker who did this, I wanted to add her parents to the list.</p><p>\u201cI agreed to take the money, half of which went into my account so that when I turned eighteen, I had access to it, and I agreed to pull the charges and to not speak about it again.\u201d She lowered her hands as she looked at me. \u201cThat makes me a terrible person, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Oh no . . . \u201cYou\u2019re not a terrible person, Avery. Jesus Christ, you were fourteen and your parents should\u2019ve told them to fuck off. If anyone is to blame, besides the fucker who did that to you, it\u2019s them. You don\u2019t have any fault in this.\u201d</p><p>Relief flashed in her eyes, but as she dropped into the recliner, I knew there was more. Fuck. There was more. \u201cWithin days, everyone at school turned on me. Apparently, there was nothing in the agreement about Blaine keeping his mouth shut. He told people that I had lied. That I had done all those things with him willingly and then falsely accused him. Everyone believed him. Why wouldn\u2019t they? I dropped the charges. I wouldn\u2019t talk about it. School was . . . it was terrible after that. I lost all my friends.\u201d</p><p>Things started making sense. \u201cThis is why you stopped dancing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I couldn\u2019t stand people looking at me and whispering about what they\u2019d heard or talking openly about it in front of my face. And I did this . . .\u201d She raised her left arm. \u201cMy mom was so pissed.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe what she had just said. \u201cShe was mad because you . . .\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNo wonder you don\u2019t go home to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s why I picked here, you know. It was far enough to just get away from all of it. I thought that was all I needed to do\u2014to distance myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat message I saw? It was someone who knew about what happened?</p><p>\u201cWhoever came up with the saying you can\u2019t escape your past really knew what they were talking about.\u201d</p><p>I could feel the muscle in my jaw thrumming like crazy. \u201cWhat else has been going on, Avery? You said this Blaine was in jail? But who\u2019s been messaging you?\u201d</p><p>She hunched over, pressing her head into her hands. Her face was shielded with a veil of shimmery hair. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting these messages since August. I just thought it was some asshole and ignored it. And my cousin had been trying to reach me, but I ignored him, too, because . . . well, for obvious reasons. I finally talked to my cousin over winter break, the night before I came over to your apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night of the fight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah . . . he was trying to get in touch with me to tell me that Blaine had been arrested for doing the same thing to another girl at the start of summer. He actually apologized. That meant a lot to me, but . . . I didn\u2019t know that this girl had been the one who has been contacting me this entire time.\u201d Taking a deep breath, she lifted her head. \u201cBlaine had done it to another girl. And she apparently had tried contacting me, because she didn\u2019t know about the money. She contacted the police and held her ground. She put him in jail and I . . . All she thought when I didn\u2019t respond was that either I lied about Blaine or whatever. And the longer I didn\u2019t respond to her, the madder she got. If I hadn\u2019t signed those papers, he would\u2019ve never been able to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWhat happened to her is fucking terrible and I\u2019m glad that bastard\u2019s ass is going to jail. Better yet, he should be fucking castrated, but what happened to her isn\u2019t your fault, sweetheart. You didn\u2019t make him do that to you or her.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes filled. \u201cBut me not telling anyone allowed him to do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I stood. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking tell yourself that. No one knows what would\u2019ve happened if you didn\u2019t drop the charges. You were fourteen, Avery. You did the best you could in the situation. You survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s it, you know? All I\u2019ve been doing is surviving. I haven\u2019t been living. Look at what I\u2019ve done to us. And yes, I\u2019ve done this! I pushed you away again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re telling me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve let what happened to me five years ago still affect me! When we almost had sex? I wasn\u2019t afraid of you or if there\u2019d be pain. It wasn\u2019t that. I was afraid that once we started, that what Blaine had done would ruin it for me or that I would ruin it for myself. I am a coward\u2014I was a coward.\u201d She shot to her feet, face flushed with tears. \u201cBut it\u2019s too late, isn\u2019t it? I should\u2019ve been honest with you months ago so you knew what you were getting into and I\u2019m so sorry that I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I reached out for her. \u201cAvery . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Cam. I know telling you now doesn\u2019t change anything, but I needed to tell you that you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You were perfect\u2014perfect for me\u2014and I love you. And I know you can\u2019t look at me the same now. I understand.\u201d</p><p>What? My arms fell to my sides as I stared at her. And then I was in front of her, cupping her cheeks. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you can\u2019t look at me the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that. Before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I told her. \u201cDo you think I look at you differently? I told you I always suspected that something happened\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you had hope that it wasn\u2019t that!\u201d She tried to pull away, but I wasn\u2019t letting her run away again. No more. \u201cYou looked at me before with hope and you don\u2019t have that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you really think? Has that been what has been stopping you this whole time from telling me?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze. \u201cEveryone looks at me differently once they know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not everyone, Avery! Not to you, not with you. Do you think I still don\u2019t have hope? Hope that you will eventually get past this? That it won\u2019t haunt you five more years from now?\u201d</p><p>Avery looked too afraid to speak as I guided her hands to my chest, above my heart. \u201cI have hope.\u201d I held her gaze. \u201cI have hope because I love you\u2014I\u2019ve been in love with you, Avery. Probably before I even realized that I was.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou loved me?\u201d</p><p>I pressed my forehead to hers. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d</p><p>I smiled slightly. \u201cYes, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Avery held my gaze for a few moments, and I saw the very second she cracked. When the walls she had built around herself to just get by every day finally crumbled. Tears poured out of her eyes, so many I honestly believed it was possible for someone to drown in them. With everything in the open, she was laid bare, for the first time in years.</p><p>Emotion crawled up my throat as I circled my arms around her tightly. She came willingly, clutching my shirt. And she kept sobbing, and I knew I couldn\u2019t stop her. That she had to get this out.</p><p>I lifted her into my arms and carried her back into my bedroom. I laid her down on the bed. I crawled in beside her, cradling her against my chest, and she held on to me as she continued to cry, like she was afraid I would leave her.</p><p>And leaving her was something that would never happen again.</p><p>Twenty-Seven</p><p>It was after midnight when my phone vibrated off my nightstand. Half asleep, I rolled over and smacked around until my hand landed on my cell. The soft white glow lit up the one word text from Shortcake.</p><p>Incoming.</p><p>Things were definitely different in the weeks following the day she had opened up to me.</p><p>I grinned as I threw the sheets off me and hurried through the living room and opened the front door. Avery stood there, barefoot and wearing a pair of tiny sleep shorts and a thin shirt. In the still cool night of early May, the shirt left very little to the imagination.</p><p>She smiled as I took her hand and pulled her inside, quietly shutting the door behind us.</p><p>\u201cWhat the . . . ?\u201d she whispered, staring at the floor between the coffee table and the couch.</p><p>Ollie lay facedown, cheek propped on the pillow I\u2019d shoved under his face before I\u2019d gone to bed. His soft snores would soon turn into chainsaws.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d I whispered back.</p><p>Giggling quietly, she squeezed my hand. We quickly made our way back to the bedroom and once inside, I spun her into my arms. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou have a nine-A.M. exam tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She walked backward, guiding me to the bed. When she sat, I remained on my feet. \u201cBut it\u2019s my last exam and I\u2019ve already studied so much I think my brain is broke.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laughed. Over the last week, the time we spent together we spent studying for our own exams. \u201cBut shouldn\u2019t you be sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was lonely.\u201d Her lips curved up as she tugged on my hands. \u201cAnd I missed you. And I miss . . .\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to finish her sentence. I knew what she was thinking, what she wanted. Knowing the truth about what had happened was a blessing, but I wasn\u2019t sure how to . . . well, how to really initiate things. The last thing I wanted to do was push her into something she wasn\u2019t ready for. So I hadn\u2019t pushed at all.</p><p>\u201cMiss me?\u201d I quickly changed the subject. \u201cI know. Going even a few hours without my presence can cause heart palpitations, abnormal sweating, the occasional\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think your arrogance is actually a disease.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a cocky grin. \u201cI like to think it\u2019s a character strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep telling yourself that.\u201d Sliding her hands free, she rose onto her knees in front of me. My mouth dried as I looked down at her upturned face. \u201cActually, keep telling yourself that quietly. Right now, try not talking.\u201d</p><p>My brows shot up. \u201cWell . . .\u201d</p><p>She grinned, but I could see the deepening color spreading across her cheeks as she reached forward, placing her hands on my bare chest, and then she stretched up, sliding her fingers to my cheeks. She guided my head down to hers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Cam.\u201d The tip of her nose brushed mine. \u201cHaven\u2019t you missed me?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes as I wrapped my fingers along her slender wrists. \u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Her lips grazed mine once and then she kissed me softly. There was nothing like her kisses, especially when our positions were flopped. She pushed, working at the seam of my lips until I opened. The taste of her clouded my thoughts. I didn\u2019t realize she had let go of my face until I felt the tips of her fingers slipping under the band of my nylon shirts.</p><p>My grip tightened around her wrists as I lifted my head. \u201cAvery, maybe we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should let me do this.\u201d Her chest rose sharply as her gaze dipped. There was no hiding that I wanted her to do this. The corners of her lips spread into a winsome smile. \u201cI think you really want me to do this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. God, I do, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She silenced me with a kiss that told me that I needed to let her do whatever she wanted to do. Removing my fingers one at a time, I dropped my hands to the sides.</p><p>This was all her.</p><p>Avery broke away and then placed a kiss on my chest, above my heart. I tensed as she tugged my shorts down. Loosened, the shorts pooled on the floor in a second. I stiffened, aching, as she placed her hands on my hips and kissed her way down my abs. When the edges of her hair brushed me, my hands curled into fists. And she kept going, sliding one hand around my front, causing my body to jerk as she wrapped her fingers around me. I pulsed\u2014my entire body pulsed. Then her breath danced over my hardness.</p><p>I cupped her cheek, stopping her. \u201cAvery, you don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cBut I want to.\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened, but the words\u2014whatever the hell they were\u2014died on my tongue as she took me into her mouth. Sensation exploded in several points. I kicked my head back, groaning as her hand moved, steady and strong in rhythm with her mouth.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to last. My back bowed as she worked me. Fuck. I couldn\u2019t last. There was no way. Release powered through me as my hips jerked. I tried to pull her away, but she was latched on. She wasn\u2019t going anywhere. I came, shouting her name.</p> <p>After what felt like forever, she pulled away. As my chest rose and fell raggedly as I dropped a damn near out-of-breath kiss on her forehead. \u201cAvery . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou liked?\u201d</p><p>I coughed out a laugh. \u201cI loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a quick learner.\u201d</p><p>Damn straight she was. Placing my hands on her shoulders, I guided her onto her back. \u201cAvery?\u201d</p><p>She let her hands fall beside her head. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet ready.\u201d</p><p>A puzzled look crossed her face. \u201cGet ready for what?\u201d</p><p>I captured her mouth, letting my lips and my tongue tell her exactly what to get ready for and it was a hell of a long time before I used those two things for anything other than loving her.</p><p>\u201cCookies! I got cookies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! What kind?\u201d Shortcake\u2019s voice floated from the bedroom.</p><p>She\u2019d left the door unlocked for me, something that I was going to have to talk to her about later, but right now I had a warm plate of special delivery. I headed back to the bedroom, finding her lying on her bed, hands folded across her stomach.</p><p>\u201cPeanut-butter cookies,\u201d I told her. \u201cBut special.\u201d</p><p>She grinned as she stretched her bare feet. \u201cHow are they special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, besides the fact that I just baked them in honor of you finishing your last exam, they\u2019re not just any kind of peanut-butter cookies.\u201d I sat the plate on the nightstand. \u201cBut Reese\u2019s peanut-butter cookies.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cAnd that makes them different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s yeah.\u201d I jumped on the bed, grinning as Shortcake bounced. \u201cWhat are you doing in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing lazy.\u201d</p><p>I studied her closer. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d When she smiled and it reached her eyes, I relaxed. \u201cCookie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCookie . . .\u201d I reached over, eyeing the plate for one that appeared moist. Once I settled on one, I handed it over.</p><p>Holding one hand under her chin, she bit and immediately moaned. \u201cOh my God, these are . . .\u201d She took another bite. \u201cSo damn good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d I picked up one, popping the whole thing in my mouth.</p><p>Shortcake reached for another and I grabbed the plate, holding it away from her. She punched me in the stomach. I gave her a cookie.</p><p>After eating our weight in peanut-butter goodness, I stretched out beside her and picked up a strand of her hair, twirling it around my fingers. I smacked the ends across her nose as her eyes drifted shut. \u201cSo what does it feel like to finally be a sophomore in college?\u201d</p><p>She retrieved her hair from me. \u201cI\u2019m not officially a sophomore. Not until school starts again in the fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI deem you a sophomore now.\u201d Undeterred, I caught another strand and trailed it across her cheek. \u201cWhat I say goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how does it feel finally being a senior? Next year is your last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d I traced her lower lip. \u201cIt feels amazing.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake rolled onto her side, wrapping her fingers around the collar of my shirt. \u201cIt feels pretty damn good to be a sophomore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould be better if you didn\u2019t sign up for summer classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>But it would work out. I was doing the summer soccer camp with the kiddos, so I\u2019d be here anyway.</p><p>She wiggled closer, resting her head on my shoulder as she threw a leg over me.</p><p>\u201cClose enough?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I laughed as I ran my fingers up and down her spine in a slow, idle line as I turned my head, kissing her forehead. These quiet moments were the best. I\u2019d almost dozed off when she rolled suddenly, straddling my hips.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said.</p><p>I liked where this was heading. I skimmed my hands over her waist. \u201cHey there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been doing some thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d She bent down, kissing me softly. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking. There\u2019s something I want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I slid my hands down over her shorts, resting them on her thighs.</p><p>She sucked her bottom lip between her teeth. \u201cI want to go home.\u201d</p><p>Was not expecting that, nor did I like that. \u201cLike back to Texas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>She placed her hands on my stomach and rocked back, pressing down on me. I tensed, eyes narrowing on her. I had a feeling that was totally on purpose.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting rid of me that easy,\u201d she said. \u201cFor just a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. There goes my master plan of spending the summer like a sex-crazed bachelor.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do if you go back there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see my parents. I need to talk to them.\u201d</p><p>I patted her thighs. \u201cAbout what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never talked to them about what happened, not since that night.\u201d She matched my movements with her fingers along my chest. \u201cI need to talk to them. I know this sounds like a bitch fest, but I need to tell them that what they did was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like a bitch fest, but do you think it\u2019s wise?\u201d I placed my hands over hers. \u201cI mean, do you think it\u2019s going to help you and not . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt me?\u201d She smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing more my parents can do that will hurt me, but I feel like I need to confront them. Does that make me a bad person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I didn\u2019t like the sound of this. They could still hurt her.</p><p>\u201cI need to do this. I also need to talk to Molly.\u201d</p><p>Okay. I really didn\u2019t like the sound of this. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to her and try to explain why I did what I did. I know it\u2019s risky and if it comes back and bites me in the ass with the nondisclosure, then it does, but if I can get her to understand just a little bit, then maybe it will help her and she\u2019ll stop contacting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. The girl seems like she\u2019s not the most stable person out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s just mad and she has a reason to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not the reason why it happened to her.\u201d I brought her hands to my lips, kissing the knuckles. \u201cYou know that, right? You\u2019re not responsible.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a few moments. \u201cI need to do this for myself and for Molly. I don\u2019t want to run anymore, Cam. And I know I can never really put this behind me. What happened . . . well, it will always be a part of me, but it won\u2019t be me. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t what I wanted her to do and I didn\u2019t think she truly needed to. What she didn\u2019t realize was that she\u2019d already begun to make peace with everything, but I wouldn\u2019t stop her. \u201cYou know what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awesome?\u201d Her grin was cheeky.</p><p>\u201cBesides that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve already made it that far, Avery. I think you have accepted it will be part of you, but it\u2019s not you. You just haven\u2019t realized that, but if you want to do this, then you\u2019ll do this and I\u2019ll be there with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to go with\u2014\u201d</p><p>She squealed as I shifted, rolling her onto her back. I hovered over her. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing this by yourself. Hell to the motherfucking no. I\u2019m going with you. And you\u2019re not talking me out of it. When do you want to do this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Staring at me for a long moment, she smiled. \u201cGot any plans this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake placed the tips of her fingers against my cheek. \u201cI need to do this.\u201d</p><p>I dropped a kiss to the tip of her nose. \u201cI don\u2019t think you do, sweetheart, but if you think you do, then that\u2019s what matters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou really want to come with me?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a stupid question, Avery. And yes, there is such a thing as stupid questions. That was one of them. Of course I\u2019m going to be there with you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips spread into a wide, beautiful smile. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCocky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConfident.\u201d I kissed her softly. \u201cI love you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She started to wrap her arms around me, but I moved away, climbing over the side of the bed. \u201cHey!\u201d She frowned. \u201cGet back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. We got stuff to do.\u201d I took her hands, hauling her off the bed. \u201cAnd if you start feeling me up, we aren\u2019t going to get anything done.\u201d</p><p>The look on her face was bemused. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</p><p>I bent, picking her up over my shoulder, and then pivoted toward the door. \u201cWe got some tickets to book.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Eight</p> <p>Texas was ungodly hot. Like the circles of hell kind of hot. Even in the shaded interior of the rental car with cool air blasting from the vents, the heat seeped in from every tiny crack.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe that I was actually in Texas.</p><p>My gaze drifted from the marble fountain to the monstrous-sized house. Avery hadn\u2019t been joking when she said her parents were rich. They were like the 1 percent. Hell, maybe even the half of a percent.</p><p>Leaning back in the driver\u2019s seat, I blew out a long breath. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake was inside that place, with a mom that made Anthony Bates mommy look stable and loving. And I was out here, waiting in the car, half tempted to dive into the fountain.</p><p>She\u2019d been in there for at least ten minutes and she hadn\u2019t wanted me to go inside with her. Probably because she knew I\u2019d lose my shit with a quickness. When she had opened up to me that day, she really hadn\u2019t gone into a lot about her parents with the exception of how they had responded to what had happened to her, but over the last couple of weeks she\u2019d told me about them.</p><p>And what I did know, I didn\u2019t like.</p><p>At the fifteen-minute mark, I couldn\u2019t sit any longer. I climbed out of the car and stepped into the sweltering heat. Sliding my cap around, I pulled the brim down to shield the sun.</p> <p>I walked around the rented sedan, eyeing the entrance to the house. The marble columns were a nice touch. As I turned, gazing out over the manicured landscape that went as far as I could see, there wasn\u2019t a single person moving about.</p><p>The place was empty, and in spite of the body-breaking temps, it was cold. I couldn\u2019t picture Shortcake growing up in this kind of atmosphere or figure out how she\u2019d come out as warm and loving as she was.</p><p>My shirt was already beginning to stick to my shoulders as I returned to the fountain. Closing my eyes, I willed my legs not to turn around and bust up into that house. I knew Shortcake needed to do this on her own, but I hated that she was facing them without me by her side.</p><p>I stuck out my hand, letting the warm water trickle across my open palm. What would her parents think if I took a dip? I was half tempted. I was also five seconds away from barging into the house when I heard a door shut behind me. Turning, I saw Avery heading down the wide stone stairs.</p><p>She was smiling broadly.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been expecting that.</p><p>Tension seeped out of my shoulders as I jogged around the car, catching her in the middle of the circular driveway. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d She rose onto the tips of her sandaled feet, slanted her head and kissed me. \u201cIt went as expected.\u201d</p><p>I held on to her hips, my fingers tightening as a surge of lust and love and a thousand other complicated emotions roared through me. \u201cWant to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver dinner?\u201d She started to move away, but I captured her hand, holding her in place. \u201cI\u2019m going to take you to Chuy\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery?\u201d</p><p>Steel poured down my spine at the sound of her name and I tightened my hold on her hand. She turned as my gaze narrowed on the tall man walking down the front stairs.</p><p>This was her father.</p><p>I knew it immediately.</p><p>His dark brown hair was gray at the temples and he didn\u2019t look a day over fifty. He was dressed as if he were heading out to the golf club, pants pressed and polo shirt tucked in.</p><p>\u201cIf he says something ignorant, I cannot promise I will not lay him out right here, right now,\u201d I warned her.</p><p>She squeezed my hand. \u201cHopefully that won\u2019t become an issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust saying.\u201d</p><p>Her father stopped in front of us, his eyes\u2014identical to Shortcake\u2019s\u2014looked from his daughter to where our hands were joined together. I dared him to say one thing.</p><p>\u201cThis is Cameron Hamilton,\u201d she said, clearing her throat. \u201cCam, this is my father.\u201d</p><p>Since it would be rude to give him the middle finger or punch him in the face, I extended my free hand. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>He shook my hand. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Dad?\u201d she asked when I didn\u2019t return the polite greeting.</p><p>Mr. Morgansten dragged his eyes from me, and his gaze landed on his daughter for maybe a fraction of a second before flicking away. I could see the age on him now, settling in the creases around his eyes and mouth.</p><p>His chest rose with a deep breath and then said, \u201cYou know what I\u2019ve missed most of all? I miss watching you dance.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake was handling everything better than I thought she would, which meant I hadn\u2019t given her enough credit. The girl was stronger than any of us realized.</p><p>Over dinner she told me how everything had gone down, and I was angry and disappointed for her when it came to how she was received by her so-called mother, but Avery had done what she had come here to do.</p><p>And it seemed her father expressed at least some amount of remorse or distress. The dancing comment . . . I got what it meant. There were so many things that Avery lost out on, and due to their own ignorance, so had her parents.</p><p>She still wanted to see Molly tomorrow, and no matter what I tried over dinner to change her mind, she was determined and I was going to support her the best I could. But to be honest, I wanted nothing more than to get her back home and away from all of this.</p><p>When we returned to the hotel room that evening, Shortcake immediately disappeared into the bathroom to take a quick shower. I watched her retreating form with an arched brow. She had been acting weird since the end of the dinner, in a hurry to get back here. I had no idea what she was up to, but I forced myself to lie down instead of joining her in the shower, which was something I wanted to do really, really badly.</p><p>I discovered the remote control and was still trying to figure out what channel was what when steam rolled out from the opened bathroom door about twenty minutes later. I looked up and the air halted in my lungs.</p><p>She stood in the doorway, her hair a dark red, clinging to her shoulders. She wore only a white towel.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>I sat up, speechless as my gaze swept over her, starting at the tips of her painted toes and ending at her flushed cheeks. My skin tightened as she walked to where I sat, her fingers curling around the knotted towel between her breasts.</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cAvery.\u201d</p><p>She placed a hand on my shoulder and climbed up, like she had done the evening on the couch, straddling me. \u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>A small grin split my lips; it was all I could manage as I clutched her hips.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She paused. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>My gaze dipped to the knot. \u201cThose are two opposite things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She pressed down on my erection, sending a bolt of red-hot pleasure through me. \u201cKiss me?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give me a chance to respond, which was fine by me. Her lips brushed over mine, a sweet sweeping of her lips. My hold on her hips tightened when she parted my lips with her tongue. The kiss went on until I was aching for her.</p><p>Hell, I was always aching for her.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Who in the hell was I to deny her? I ran my hands under the hem of the towel, gliding them over her thighs, coming close to the center of her heat.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>I laughed at her bold demand, but I wouldn\u2019t be rushed. I brushed the back of my hand over her dampness, smiling when she moaned. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>She made a sound of frustration. \u201cI want you to touch me.\u201d</p><p>Bringing my fingers close to where she wanted me, I retreated quickly. \u201cI am touching you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She pressed her forehead to mine. \u201cPlease touch me, Cam.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back, brushing our lips together. \u201cWell, when you say it like that, I think I get what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d she groaned.</p><p>I laughed again and then nipped at her chin. Her body jerked when I cupped her between the thighs. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>As I kissed the center of her throat, I slipped a finger into her wetness. \u201cAnd this?\u201d My voice was gruff, heavy.</p><p>Her back arched. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping an arm around her so she didn\u2019t tumble backward, I pressed down on her clit. Her body tensed in the most amazing way. \u201cWhat about this?\u201d</p><p>Her hips tipped forward. \u201cOh, yeah. Definitely that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely that?\u201d I pumped my finger in and out of her slowly.</p><p>Avery moaned, and I could listen to a chorus of them all day, but then she reached between us and unraveled the knot. The towel slipped away from her, fluttering to the floor.</p><p>My hand stilled.</p><p>My heart jumped.</p><p>My cock hardened and throbbed.</p><p>Rosy breasts thrust up, cheeks flushed, and legs spread wide over mine. . . . Dammit, she was . . . she was stunning.</p><p>I ran my other hand over her breast, fixated when the tip puckered. \u201cFuck, Avery . . .\u201d</p><p>She placed her hand over mine. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what I meant.\u201d Reaching with her other hand, she found the zipper on my jeans. \u201cI want you, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have me.\u201d I moved to her other breast. \u201cYou so fucking have me.\u201d</p><p>Avery smiled as she wrapped her hand around my wrist, pulling my hand away from her heat. \u201cI really want you.\u201d She unzipped my pants, her fingers brushing me, and I shuddered. \u201cDon\u2019t you want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you know.\u201d I groaned as she palmed me. \u201cAvery . . .\u201d</p><p>Her hand disappeared, and I didn\u2019t know if I should be grateful or if I should start cussing. But then she tugged my shirt up, over my head. \u201cI want this, Cam.\u201d</p><p>When her words sunk in through the red haze fogging my thoughts, I inhaled deeply. \u201cAre you sure, Avery? Because if you\u2019re not, we don\u2019t have\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She kissed me, sliding her hands down my chest. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>I froze, hands on her hips, and then rolled her onto her back. Over her, I caught her lips, kissing her with everything that I had in me. Maybe another guy would\u2019ve asked her again or done something else, but those two words. I\u2019m sure. They broke the tiny hold I had on my self-control.</p><p>Breaking the kiss, I stood and all but ripped off my jeans. When her gaze dropped and eyes widened, I couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>Avery looked almost untouchable as she lay there, staring up at me with those beautiful brown eyes. \u201cI could stare at you for a lifetime. It would never grow old.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven when I\u2019m old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven then.\u201d</p><p>Unable to wait any longer, I came to her. I wanted this moment to be perfect for her. I wanted everything to be beautiful and I wanted her to feel how much I loved her.</p><p>So I started at those tiny toes, working my way up her legs and over her soft stomach with kisses. I took my time, sucking and nipping until the peaks of her breasts were tight and she was panting. Every part of me felt hard, heavy, and swollen, but I wanted her ready, even if raw, intense desire rode me to drive deep inside of her.</p><p>Her body arched against mine as I reached her lips once more. Shifting my weight to one arm, I matched the thrusts of my tongue with my finger and then two, stretching her slowly.</p> <p>She clutched my arms, my sides as she moved restlessly and when I put my mouth to her down there, she came apart in a way that almost undid me right then.</p><p>I was shaking like a weed in the middle of a storm as I rose, positioning myself between her thighs. Wrapping my hand around myself, I lined up our bodies. The first contact with her wetness sent shards of pleasure through me.</p><p>There was a point when you couldn\u2019t stop and I was at that part, my body trembling with need, but I waited for her. I gave her time.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I told her, resting my hand to her cheek. \u201cI love you so very much.\u201d</p><p>Her arms wrapped around me, holding me tight, urging me forward. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Dropping my hand to her hip, I deepened the kiss as I rolled my hips into hers. She stiffened under me, and her soft gasp of surprise went straight to my soul.</p> <p>I stilled. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to hurt her and I knew that had to hurt. I remained still, deep inside her. My heart hammered out of control as I kissed the corner of her lip and then the other. Her mouth opened, and I slipped inside, slowly tasting her, giving her body time to adjust.</p><p>I groaned as she tilted her hips tentatively, creating startling friction between us. \u201cAv . . .\u201d</p><p>She did it again, and I rocked back. A cry of pleasure ripped from her as she gripped me in her tightness, wrapping her legs around my waist. Between that and the way she moved her hips, I lost myself in her in the most glorious way possible.</p><p>God . . . nothing felt like her and nothing compared to the feeling of her, of how she invaded every cell of my being. There was no me. There was no her. As we moved together, our mouths clinging to one another, our hands exploring and our hips sealing together, there was only us.</p><p>Avery broke under me, throwing her head out and crying my name when I slid a hand between us, touching her as I ground against her. Feeling the tight spasms, the way she held on to me was too much.</p><p>\u201cAvery,\u201d I grunted, burying my head in her shoulder as my release blew through me, shocking in its intensity.</p> <p>The release felt like it kept coming in tight waves. I rested above her, my body jerking every couple of moments. Forever went by before I trusted myself to move. A deep sound came from my chest as I eased out of her.</p><p>I kissed her and fuck if I didn\u2019t feel a burning sensation in the back of my throat. I shook my head, dumbfounded by the force of what I felt. \u201cThat was . . . there are no words. You okay?\u201d</p><p>She placed her hands on my cheeks and they trembled slightly. In her steady gaze, I saw the mirror of what I was feeling. \u201cPerfect. You were perfect.\u201d</p><p>The truth was, if I was perfect, it was only because of her. It would only ever be because of her.</p><p>Twenty-Nine</p><p>That\u2019s where I need to be.</p><p>Those were Avery\u2019s words as she\u2019d spoken to the other girl. Molly. I had struggled not be angry when I\u2019d seen the red mark on her cheek. The only thing that helped was hearing those words.</p><p>Shortcake finally got it.</p><p>The healing she needed did rest in the truth, in speaking out to her parents and to talking to Molly, but she had begun to heal all the way back in February, then again in April. Going to Texas was something she felt she needed to do and she had done it.</p><p>So I brought her home and here we were, back in the somewhat cooler state of West Virginia, the night before Avery would start her summer classes and I\u2019d start working with the kids during camp.</p><p>Shortcake sat on the kitchen floor across from me, bare legs tucked under her. She wore one of my shirts and that was all. I had a hard time thinking about anything other than that.</p><p>Between us, Michelangelo and Raphael were currently head-bobbing each other.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a tortoise version of smack talk,\u201d she said, brows pinched. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they like each other.\u201d</p><p>I grinned as I leaned back against the fridge, running my hand over the bare skin of my abs. \u201cThey still need some time. And Mikey-Mike is territorial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, blame it on my tortoise.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cYours started the head-bobbing crap first.\u201d</p><p>The timer dinged, and I climbed to my feet, heading over to the stove. \u201cHe was just showing yours who\u2019s boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichelangelo is boss.\u201d Shortcake picked up her little guy, setting him back several feet.</p><p>Eyeing the chocolate cookies and finding them done, I quickly washed my hands, then retrieved an oven mitt I was sure Shortcake had never used. The tag was still on it. Grinning, I tore it off and then removed the tray from the oven. The cookies were super-sized, golden and oh-so gooey-looking.</p><p>\u201cAre they ready?\u201d She looked up, eyes gleaming.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll burn your tongue.\u201d I tossed the mitt aside. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cBut it is so worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I sauntered up to her, enjoying the way her cheeks still flushed when her eyes dipped below my navel. Swooping down, I kissed her upturned lips. \u201cGive them\u2014\u201d</p><p>My cell went off from the living room. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as I carefully avoided stepping on a poor tortoise and traumatizing myself and Shortcake. I swiped my cell off the coffee table. A sigh of relief exited me as I saw that it was from my sister.</p><p>Out of surgery. Doing ok. Will call u later.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I said a little prayer. It hadn\u2019t been a major surgery, but it was still a surgery and fucked-up things happened in hospitals. She was home. That was good, but . . .</p><p>\u201cWas that Teresa?\u201d</p><p>Putting my phone down, I turned. Avery stood in the door, holding two squirming tortoises. Combining that with the shirt that read I WANNA BE YOUR MANWICH, it was a pretty adorable sight.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She walked the two tortoises over to their habitat and gently placed them inside. While she closed the lid, the two green guys immediately eyed each other from their respective corners. \u201cIs she okay? How did the surgery go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says she\u2019s fine. It was just a text.\u201d I paused. \u201cShe said she\u2019d call me later.\u201d</p><p>Facing me, her brows were pinched in worry. If anyone knew what Teresa was facing right now, it would be Shortcake, with all her years of dancing. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything about dancing?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head as I pressed my lips together. Teresa had torn her ACL a week ago during a recital. For athletes and dancers, it could be an injury fatal to their careers. All my sister had ever wanted to do was become a professional dancer. Only time would tell if that would be possible at all.</p><p>But from what Mom had said, it wasn\u2019t looking good.</p><p>Shortcake disappeared into the kitchen, washed her hands and returned. Coming up to me, she wrapped her arms around my waist and pressed her cheek against my chest. Her skin was warm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you apologizing?\u201d I folded my arms around her, holding her close.</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you\u2019re worried,\u201d she said, rubbing her cheek along my skin. \u201cAnd I know this injury is serious. I just hope it\u2019s not as serious as it can be.\u201d</p><p>I dropped a kiss to the top of her head as I slid my hand up her spine, cradling the back of her neck. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a few moments. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Laughing softly, I leaned back so I could see her face. \u201cNow what are you thanking me for, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for going to Texas with me.\u201d</p><p>I cupped her cheek with one hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve already thanked me for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you told me that I didn\u2019t need to thank you.\u201d She placed her hand over mine. \u201cBut I need to thank you again, because I wouldn\u2019t have done it without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you would\u2019ve.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMaybe I would\u2019ve, but I don\u2019t really know. I needed you there and you were there, no questions asked. I can\u2019t thank you enough for that\u2014for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Shortcake, you still don\u2019t have to thank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I . . .\u201d She stopped, frowning. \u201cShortcake?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth and then realized my slip. Dropping my hands, I stepped back and laughed. \u201cDid I say that out loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You kind of did.\u201d She tugged on the hem of the borrowed shirt. Curiosity filled her face. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with that?\u201d</p><p>Fuck me, but I felt my cheeks start to burn.</p><p>Her eyes widened as she smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re blushing! Oh my God, you\u2019re actually blushing!\u201d She pinched my cheek. \u201cI need to know now why you\u2019re so flushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I get if I tell you?\u201d</p><p>She pinned me with an arched look that said what I wouldn\u2019t get if I didn\u2019t tell her. That pissy look turned me on. Then again, when she breathed, it made me hot.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really kind of stupid.\u201d Catching her hand, I pulled her back to me. Once she was close enough, I dipped low and slid an arm under her legs.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d She smacked my back. \u201cStop trying to distract\u2014\u201d She squealed as her feet went off the floor. \u201cCam!\u201d</p><p>Picking her up, I held her close to my chest as I turned toward the hallway. \u201cI\u2019m not distracting you. I\u2019m helping you back to the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cBesides the fact that I don\u2019t need help going back to the bedroom, why are you carrying me back to the bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t walk fast enough,\u201d I told her as I carried her to her bed. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Her look grew exasperated. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I winked a second before I dropped her over the middle of the bed. Her squeal ended in a grunt as she bounced. Her mouth opened, and I knew she was about to cuss me every way but straight. I was on her before she could start what she was about to say, sliding my hands up under the hem of the shirt. In a second I had it off her and she was beautifully, magnificently bare. I shucked off my pants. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her breath leaked out of her as I climbed onto the bed, admiring my handiwork. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, her voice soft. \u201cWhat about this Shortcake business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a nickname.\u201d I kissed the space between her breasts. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat much I figured.\u201d</p><p>I placed another kiss along the underside of one breast and then below her rib cage. \u201cI came out with it the first time I met you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe first\u2014oh!\u201d She jerked as I tongued her navel, clenching the covers on her bed. When she spoke again, her voice was husky as I moved down. \u201cThe first time we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I kissed the inside of her left thigh and then the right. \u201cIt was the day you ran into me outside of astronomy class\u2014a class you need to retake.\u201d</p><p>Shortcake groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if she was talking about the class or the running into me part. \u201cWhen I first saw you and your hair . . .\u201d I paused, kissing her between her legs. Her soft gasp brought a smile to my face. \u201cAll I could think was that Strawberry Shortcake . . .\u201d I paused once more, running my tongue the length of her. \u201cThat Strawberry Shortcake had run me off.\u201d</p><p>She laughed as I lifted my head, prowling back up so that we were eye level. \u201cWow. I don\u2019t understand how your brain works.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She slid her foot along my calf. \u201cSo you\u2019ve been calling me Shortcake in your head all this time?\u201d</p><p>I nodded as I settled between her legs. \u201cI might have . . . a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never slipped until now. Wow. That\u2019s kind of amazing.\u201d Her eyes danced with humor. \u201cAnd it\u2019s kind of cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely cute. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d I groaned as she rolled her hips up, joining us together. \u201cWell then . . .\u201d</p><p>She giggled and then neither of us were laughing or talking. I let out a ragged moan at the tight fit. I lost sense of everything except her body and I wanted to be deeper, closer. We moved together, our bodies flushed and straining. It was crazy, but I couldn\u2019t get enough of her. It appeared the same for her. My mouth closed around her breast as I thrust into her. She matched me move for move until she arched her back, crying out.</p> <p>Her release slammed into me. Gathering her close, I sat up, keeping her in my lap. The new position had lust zinging through me. I couldn\u2019t last. Not when her little teeth scraped over my neck.</p><p>Minutes went by where all that could be heard was the sound of our ragged breathing. I was still inside her. There was a peace in this completion. And I held everything in my arms.</p><p>Later, much later, we sat on the bed with the plate of chocolate cookies between us. A tiny smudge of chocolate ended up on her lips and I leaned over the plate, kissing it away.</p><p>And well, I kissed her for real.</p><p>I kissed her, and it was like kissing her for the very first time. The initial zap, the shock of our lips together hadn\u2019t faded. Dumbly I realized that love made it that way, making sure that a simple kiss never dulled, never lost its luster.</p><p>My chest swelled as I pulled back and stared into her warm eyes and my heart did that crazy, stupid jumping thing. Something I also knew would never truly go away.</p><p>Shortcake placed her small hand on my cheek. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>At first I didn\u2019t know what to say. I . . . I had waited for Avery\u2014I had waited for her for months. Hell, I would\u2019ve waited for her for years, but she . . .</p> <p>Turning my cheek, I pressed a kiss to the inside of her palm. \u201cThank you for trusting in me.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
