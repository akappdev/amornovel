I realize that yearning for a priest doesn\u2019t exactly further the cause of meeting my future husband. And in case I might have overlooked those little facts, I have an entire town pointing them out to me.</p><p>The problem is, even when someone is clearly wrong for you, he might seem...well, perfect. And aside from that one hulking detail, Father Tim O\u2019Halloran is everything I\u2019ve ever let myself dream of in a man. Kind, funny, charming, intelligent, hardworking. He likes the same movies I do. He loves my cooking. He compliments me often and laughs at my jokes. He cares about the people of my hometown, listens intently to their problems, offers gentle guidance when asked. And he\u2019s from Ireland, the icing on the cake, because ever since I was sixteen years old and first saw U2 in concert, I\u2019ve had a thing for Irish guys. So even though Father Tim has never said or done anything vaguely improper, I can\u2019t help dreaming about what a great husband he\u2019d make. I\u2019m not really proud of this, but there it is.</p> <p>My romantic problems predated Father Tim, though he\u2019s probably the most colorful chapter in the joke book that makes up my love life. First off, it\u2019s not easy being a single woman in Gideon\u2019s Cove, Maine, population 1,407. Ostensibly there are enough males for females, but statistics can be misleading. Our town is in Washington County, the northernmost coastal county in our great state. We\u2019re too far from Bar Harbor to attract many tourists, although we do live in what is undeniably one of the most beautiful areas of America. Gray-shingled houses hug the harbor, and the air snaps with the smell of pine and salt. We\u2019re a pretty old-fashioned town?most people make their living either by fishing, lobstering or working in the blueberry industry. It\u2019s a lovely place, but it\u2019s remote, a good three hundred miles north of Boston. Five hundred from New York City. Meeting new people is difficult.</p><p>I try. I\u2019ve always tried. There have been a few boyfriends, sure. I cheerfully accept fix-ups and blind dates when they\u2019re thrown my way, I do. I own and operate Joe\u2019s Diner, the only restaurant in town, so I have plenty of chances to meet people. And I volunteer?I volunteer my ass off, to be frank. I deliver meals to the infirm. I cook for the soup kitchen on Tuesday nights and bring whatever leftovers I have on an almost daily basis. I provide dinner at the fire department\u2019s monthly meeting. I organize clothing drives and fund-raisers and offer to cater just about any event for a minimal profit, as long as it\u2019s for a good cause. I am a pillar of society, and truthfully, I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.</p><p>But in the back of my mind, there\u2019s a selfish motive. I can\u2019t help hoping that my good works and cheerful attitude will be noticed by someone...perhaps some rich and handsome grandson of the elderly man whose dinner I delivered, or some new-to-town volunteer fireman who just happens to be, oh I don\u2019t know, a board member of Oxfam and a brain surgeon, too.</p><p>However, the charitable neurosurgeon has proved elusive, and as of one year ago, when I was thirty-one years old, I remained single with no credible prospects on the horizon. That\u2019s when I met Father Tim.</p><p>I had gone for a bike ride out to Quoddy State Park. We were having a warm snap, for March, anyway?the temperature reached forty degrees, the snow had softened, the breeze was quiet. I\u2019d spent most of the day cooped up inside, and a bike ride seemed like just the thing to do. Clad in layers of fleece and microfiber, I rode further than usual in the brisk air and fading sunlight of the afternoon. Then, with classic New England unpredictability, a drenching, icy rainstorm blew in from the west. I was a good ten miles from town when my bike wheel slid on some ice. I went ass over teakettle down an embankment, right into a wet patch of snow that concealed eight inches of mud and ice. Not only was I filthy, freezing and wet, I had also managed to cut my knee and tear my pants.</p> <p>Feeling very sorry for myself, I hauled my bike up the bank at the exact moment a car went by. \u201cHelp! Stop!\u201d I yelled, but whoever it was didn\u2019t hear me. Or heard me and was afraid, as I resembled an escaped lunatic at that moment. I watched the taillights of the blue Honda disappear in the distance, noting that the sky was suddenly much darker.</p><p>Well, I didn\u2019t have a choice. I started walking, gimping along on my cut leg, until a pickup pulled over. Before I could even tell who it was, the driver grabbed my bike and popped it in the bed of the truck. Squinting through the rain, I saw it was Malone, a silent, slightly scary lobsterman who moored next to my brother. He may have spoken?the words \u201cGet in\u201d ring a bell?so I gingerly crawled into the cab of his truck. In my mind, I could hear an imaginary narrator...Maggie Beaumont was last seen riding her bike one dark and stormy afternoon. Her body was never found.</p><p>To allay my nervousness, I talked maniacally until we reached Joe\u2019s Diner, reminding Malone that Jonah was my brother, that I was out for a bike ride (though that was rather obvious), that I should have listened to the forecast, that I fell (again, obvious), that I was sorry to make his truck dirty, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>\u201cThank you very much, Malone, this was so nice of you,\u201d I babbled when he lifted down my bike. \u201cYou should come in and have a piece of pie sometime. It\u2019s good pie. Cup of coffee, too. On the house, okay? I owe you. Thanks again. This was great. Thanks. Bye now.\u201d Malone did not deign to speak, simply lifted his hand and drove away.</p><p>As I watched the taillights blur in the rain, I said a prayer. \u201cGod, I don\u2019t mean to complain, but I think I\u2019ve been pretty patient here. All I want is a decent man who will stand by me and be a good father to our kids. What do You say?\u201d</p><p>I remember all this because the very next day?the very next day?I came out of the kitchen of Joe\u2019s Diner, and there he was, sitting in the farthest booth, the most incredibly appealing man I\u2019d ever seen. Medium height, light brown hair, green eyes, broad shoulders, beautiful hands. He wore a gorgeous Irish fisherman\u2019s sweater and jeans. When he smiled, my knees buckled at the glory of those straight, white teeth. A leaping thrill of attraction and hope shuddered through my entire body.</p> <p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Maggie,\u201d I said, giving myself a quick, mental once-over. New jeans, that was good. Blue sweater, not bad. Hair, clean.</p><p>\u201cTim O\u2019Halloran. A pleasure it is to meet you,\u201d he answered, and I nearly swooned. A brogue! How Liam Neeson! How Colin Farrell! How Bono!</p><p>\u201cWould you like some coffee?\u201d I asked, proud that my voice still worked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a spot. Can\u2019t think of anything nicer.\u201d He smiled right into my eyes. Blushing with pleasure, I looked out into the parking lot and saw the blue Honda. Dear God, it was the man who\u2019d passed me!</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think I saw you last night!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWere you on Route 1A, heading for town around five? I fell off my bike, and I was trying to flag you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d he answered, a concerned frown wrinkling his forehead. \u201cHow could I have missed you? Oh, dear, forgive me!\u201d</p><p>Done. \u201cOh, gosh, don\u2019t worry.\u201d His eyes were beautiful, green and golden, like a bed of moss in the sunshine. Lust engulfed me like a thick fog. \u201cReally. It\u2019s?don\u2019t?it\u2019s fine. So. What, um...what would you like for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you recommend, Maggie?\u201d he asked, and it sounded so damn sexy, that accent combined with what seemed to be a mischievous smile and flirting eyes...</p> <p>\u201cI recommend that you eat here often,\u201d I said. \u201cI made the muffins myself, and they\u2019re just out of the oven. And our pancakes are the best in town.\u201d And the only in town, but hey.</p><p>\u201cThe pancakes it is, then, thanks.\u201d He smiled up at me again, obviously in no hurry for me to leave. \u201cSo you work here, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I own the place,\u201d I said, pleased to be able to impart this nugget. Not just a waitress, but the boss. The owner.</p><p>\u201cDo you, now! Brilliant! A classic, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u2019Tis, I almost said. \u201cYes. Thank you. It\u2019s a family business. My grandfather, the Joe in Joe\u2019s Diner, started it up in 1933.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Tim, what are you doing in Gideon\u2019s Cove?\u201d I asked, then realized he might be hungry. \u201cWait, I\u2019m sorry, let me just get your order in. Sorry. Be right back!\u201d</p><p>I raced to the kitchen and called the order to Octavio, my short-order cook, then practically slid across the diner to Tim\u2019s table, ignoring three customers who were waiting at the counter with varying degrees of impatience.</p><p>\u201cSorry. You might actually want to eat, of course,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell, now, there are some things that are nicer than eating, and talking to you is one of them.\u201d</p><p>Dear God, You\u2019re the best! Thanks for listening! \u201cSo, sorry, I was asking you what you were doing in town. Work related?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might say that, Maggie. I\u2019m?\u201d</p><p>It was at this moment that the fatal event occurred. Georgie Culpepper, my dishwasher, burst into the diner. \u201cHi, Maggie!\u201d he shouted. \u201cHi! How are you, Maggie! It\u2019s nice out today, isn\u2019t it, Maggie? I saw snowdrops this morning! You want me to wash dishes now, Maggie?\u201d He wrapped his arms around me and hugged me.</p><p>Now, Georgie\u2019s hugs are usually very pleasant. I\u2019ve been getting them since kindergarten. Georgie has Down syndrome, is wicked affectionate and endlessly cheerful, one of the nicest, happiest people I\u2019ve ever met. But right at this moment, I didn\u2019t want his burr-like head welded to my breast. As I tried to extricate myself and as Georgie continued to tell me about the wonders of spring, Tim answered my question. I didn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>Finally, I pried Georgie off me and patted his shoulder. \u201cHello, Georgie. Tim, this is Georgie Culpepper, and he works here. Our bubble boy, right, buddy?\u201d Georgie nodded proudly. \u201cGeorgie, this is Tim.\u201d</p><p>Georgie treated Tim to a hug, which was returned warmly. Lucky Georgie. \u201cHi, Tim! Nice to meet you, Tim! How are you, Tim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m excellent, thank you, my friend.\u201d</p><p>I smiled even more...could there be a better character reference than someone who knew just how to treat Georgie Culpepper? I immediately added it to the already impressive mental list I had going on Tim O\u2019Halloran: handsome, employed, charming, Irish, comfortable around disabled people.</p><p>\u201cI bet Octavio will make you scrambled eggs,\u201d I told Georgie.</p><p>\u201cScrambled eggs! All right!\u201d Though Georgie eats scrambled eggs every day of his life, the thrill has yet to fade. He scuttled to the kitchen and I remained, staring down at Tim. \u201cWell. So. That sounds interesting,\u201d I said, hoping he\u2019d reiterate what it was he did for a living. He didn\u2019t. The ding of the kitchen bell went off, and I excused myself, got Tim\u2019s pancakes and brought them over.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything else?\u201d The scowls of my regulars were starting to register.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, thank you ever so much, Maggie. It was a real pleasure meeting you.\u201d</p><p>Fearful that this was the last I\u2019d ever see of him, I blurted, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you again sometime?\u201d Please, please don\u2019t say you\u2019re married.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to Bangor, but on Saturday, I\u2019ll be here for good. Do you happen to belong to St. Mary\u2019s?\u201d he asked, stabbing a huge forkful of golden pancakes.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I yelped. Any connection, no matter how thin...</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you Sunday.\u201d He smiled and took a bite, then closed his eyes in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d My heart thumping, I went back to the counter and apologized to two of my regulars, Rolly and Ben.</p><p>Okay, so it was a little...devout...to mention where he went to church, but that was okay, I quickly assured myself. Perhaps the Irish were just more religious. But I was Catholic, technically anyway, and St. Mary\u2019s was indeed my home parish. The last time I\u2019d been there was two years ago, when my sister Christy got married, but my lapsed state didn\u2019t matter. Tim O\u2019Halloran was going to Mass, and so was I. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I called my sister the moment he left. \u201cI think I\u2019ve met someone,\u201d I whispered, massaging cocoa butter into my hands. As Christy\u2019s squeals of excitement pierced my ear, I told her all about Tim O\u2019Halloran, how sweet he was, what a connection we had, how easily we\u2019d chatted. I detailed every aspect of his physical appearance from his sparkling eyes to his beautiful hands, reiterated every word he spoke. \u201cThere was such chemistry,\u201d I finally sighed.</p><p>\u201cOh, Maggie. This is so exciting,\u201d my sister sighed back. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, don\u2019t say anything to anyone yet, okay? Except Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! No, no. It\u2019s just so wonderful!\u201d</p> <p>But Christy wasn\u2019t the one who blabbed all over town. No, no, I did that myself.</p><p>I didn\u2019t mean to, of course...it\u2019s just that I see a lot of people. Not only the regulars at the diner, not just the people I work with.</p><p>Mrs. Kandinsky, my tiny, frail tenant, whose toenails I trim each week, asked me if anything was new. \u201cWell, not really. But I think I met someone,\u201d I found myself saying.</p><p>\u201cOh, wonderful, dear!\u201d she chirped.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so handsome, Mrs. K. Brown hair, green eyes...and he\u2019s Irish. He has a brogue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved a man with a brogue,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>And then I told my mom\u2019s best friend, Carol.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever meet someone?\u201d she asked in her forthright way when she came in for pie.</p><p>\u201cI may have already,\u201d I said with a mysterious smile. She blinked expectantly, and I was happy to gush.</p><p>And on it went.</p><p>On Saturday night, I went to Dewey\u2019s Pub, the only other restaurant in town, if you can call it that. Paul Dewey and I are pals, and occasionally I\u2019ll bring some food over, which he offers as daily specials and we split the profit. Otherwise, it\u2019s a bag of chips if you\u2019re looking for sustenance. But Dewey\u2019s does a booming business as the only alcohol-serving institution in town, unless you count the firehouse.</p> <p>I was meeting my friend...well, a person I hang out with sometimes. Chantal is close to forty and also single. Unlike me, she\u2019s quite happy to stay single, relishing her role as Gideon\u2019s Cove\u2019s sex symbol, a redheaded siren of lush curves and pouting lips. She enjoys the fact that every man under the age of ninety-seven finds her damn near irresistible, as opposed to me, who\u2019s everyone\u2019s surrogate daughter. Even though Chantal never lacks for male companionship, we occasionally get together to lament the dearth of really good men in town.</p><p>Having met someone so incredibly appropriate as Tim O\u2019Halloran, I was bursting to tell her, and, I admit, to stake my claim. It certainly wouldn\u2019t do to have Chantal making a go for my future husband. \u201cChantal, I met someone,\u201d I announced firmly as we sipped our beers in the corner booth. \u201cHis name is Tim O\u2019Halloran, and he is so...Oh, my God, he\u2019s so yummy! We really hit it off.\u201d</p><p>As I spoke, my eyes scanned the bar. Tim had said he\u2019d be back on Saturday, and here it was Saturday night, eight o\u2019clock. The bar was moderately full. Jonah, my brother, stood at the bar with a couple of his pals?Stevie, Pete and Sam, all around Jonah\u2019s age (which is to say, far too young for me). There was Mickey Tatum, the fire chief, famous for terrifying the schoolchildren with stories of self-immolation (he shows pictures), and Peter Duchamps, the butcher, a married alcoholic thought to be having an affair with the new part-time librarian.</p><p>Also present was Malone, his face as cheerful as an open grave, who glared at me when he walked in as if daring me to mention the ride he\u2019d given me. I dared not. Instead, I lifted my hand weakly, but his back was already turned. No wonder we all called him Maloner the Loner.</p><p>That was it. Gideon\u2019s Cove\u2019s offerings to a single girl. Obviously, I was beyond thrilled at meeting Tim.</p><p>Jonah, who never missed a chance to flirt with Chantal, drifted over. \u201cHey, girls,\u201d he said to Chantal\u2019s br**sts, earning a smile from their owner. \u201cWhat\u2019s cooking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister was just telling me about this hot guy she\u2019s met,\u201d Chantal said, dipping a finger into her beer and sucking on it. My brother, then aged twenty-five, was hypnotized. I sighed with irritation.</p><p>\u201cWhat guy?\u201d he managed to mumble.</p> <p>So I told Jonah, too, my irritation vanishing with the chance to discuss the new man in my life.</p><p>We sat there till closing, but Tim never showed. Still, I was optimistic. He had said he\u2019d see me in church, and see me he would.</p><p>The next morning, I spent an hour and a half getting ready. Because I\u2019d told my parents, sister and brother about This Guy I\u2019d Met, they were all coming to church, an activity our family usually saved for Christmas Eve (if we weren\u2019t too tired) and the occasional Easter weekend. In we went, Mom, Dad, Jonah, Will, Christy, then pregnant, and myself. Looking around, I noticed that the church was pretty full, more so than usual. Was it a holy day? I wasn\u2019t sure, never having cemented those in my mind. Oh, yes, I remembered hearing something at the diner...apparently, Father Morris retired and some new guy was filling in. Whatever.</p><p>I tried to scan casually for Tim, looking over my shoulder, pretending to fix the strap of my pocketbook, getting a tissue, adjusting my mom\u2019s collar. Any chance to glance back. Then the windy old organ started, and I fumbled for the hymnbook. So busy was I studying the pews that I ignored the priest as he walked past. \u201cDo you see him?\u201d I whispered to Christy.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, her face a frozen mask of horror.</p><p>At that moment, the music ended, the church fell silent, and I reluctantly turned to face the priest.</p><p>\u201cBefore we start our celebration today,\u201d said a voice already imprinted on my brain, \u201cI\u2019d like to introduce myself. My name is Father Tim O\u2019Halloran, and I\u2019m very pleased to have been assigned to your lovely parish.\u201d</p><p>Roughly seventy-five faces swung around to look at me. I stared straight ahead, my heart pumping so hard I could hear the blood rushing through my veins. My face burned hot enough to fry an egg. I didn\u2019t look at anyone, just stared at Father Tim O\u2019Halloran\u2019s chest area, and pretended to be fascinated and unsurprised. Tricky combination.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Ireland, as you might be able to tell, the youngest of seven children. I\u2019m looking forward to getting to know you all, and I hope I\u2019ll see you all at coffee hour after Mass. And now we begin today\u2019s celebration as we begin all things, in the name of the Father, and of the Son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>I didn\u2019t hear a word during the next hour. I do know that Christy slipped her hand into mine, and that my father was shushed repeatedly by my mother. Jonah, furthest from me, was laughing that awful, unstoppable church laugh full of wheezes and the occasional squeak, and if he\u2019d been closer to me, maybe I would have laughed, too. Or perhaps disemboweled him with my car keys. As it was, I pretended to listen, mouthed nonsensical words to songs I couldn\u2019t read and stood when everyone else stood. I stayed in the pew during communion.</p><p>And when at last Mass was over, we filed out with the others. Christy, my sister, my best friend, the person I loved more than anyone on earth, whispered in my ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to pretend we\u2019re talking about something really interesting, okay? And this way no one is going to talk to you. So smile and pretend we\u2019re having a conversation, and we\u2019ll get the hell out of here. Sound like a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristy, I\u2019m so...\u201d My voice broke.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine, just keep going. Too bad they\u2019re rebricking the side entrance. Shitty, shitty luck. Okay, we\u2019re getting close...can you smile?\u201d</p><p>I bared my teeth weakly.</p><p>\u201cMaggie!\u201d Father Tim exclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you. I was hoping you\u2019d be here.\u201d He shook my hand warmly, his grip strong and welcoming. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve a twin! Isn\u2019t that marvelous! I\u2019m Father Tim, so nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Father Tim. The sound of it was like acid on an open wound.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Christy,\u201d my sister said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not feeling well. Maggie, would you take me home?\u201d</p><p>We almost escaped until my idiot brother, whom I heretofore loved, asked, \u201cHow could you miss the fact that he was a priest?\u201d</p><p>My mother grabbed his arm. \u201cJonah, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, now?\u201d Father Tim asked, his eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell Maggie you were a priest?\u201d</p><p>Father Tim glanced at me in confusion. \u201cOf course I did. We had that lovely chat at the diner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we chatted,\u201d I blurted. \u201cOf course I knew! Sure! Yes! I knew you were a priest! Absolutely. Yup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you met some hot Irish guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was someone else,\u201d I ground out, ready to smite my little brother. \u201cNot Father Tim! Jeez! He\u2019s a priest, Jonah! He\u2019s not?I didn\u2019t mean?he\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>But the damage was done. Father Tim\u2019s expression fell. \u201cOh, dear,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaggie? I need to go,\u201d Christy said. She grabbed my arm and pulled me away to the safety of her car.</p><p>But it was too late. Father Tim knew. Everyone knew.</p><p>FATHER TIM CAME TO the diner the next day and apologized, and I apologized, and we laughed about it. I found that there was no use in trying to pretend. I just had to admit that I made a mistake. Ha, ha, pretty funny, isn\u2019t it? I can\u2019t believe I missed that little piece of information! Ho, ho! Then he asked if I\u2019d be on one of his committees, and I found myself unable to say no.</p><p>In the year that\u2019s passed, the sting of being the butt of a joke has faded. Truthfully, Father Tim is a great friend to me. Though I can\u2019t quite bring myself to go to Mass and see him in action, I somehow joined just about every committee St. Mary\u2019s has?bereavement, altar decoration, Christmas craft sale, community outreach, building maintenance, fellowship, the works.</p><p>I know it\u2019s wrong to nurse a crush on a priest. I know I shouldn\u2019t be doing all that church stuff just to be near a Catholic priest who looks like Aidan Quinn\u2019s younger brother. I know that my heart shouldn\u2019t squeeze every time I see him, that adrenaline shouldn\u2019t spurt into my veins when I pick up the phone and hear that gentle voice. I just can\u2019t seem to help it. What I really need to do is simply meet someone else, and this foolish longing in my heart will fade. Someday, I\u2019ll meet a really great guy, someone just as nice as Tim O\u2019Halloran, and everything will be just lovely.</p><p>There are definitely days when I believe this.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>\u201cGOOD MORNIN\u2019, MAGGIE,\u201d Father Tim says, sliding into his usual booth. \u201cLovely out, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He smiles pleasantly, and my insides clench.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Father Tim. What can I get for you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll be tryin\u2019 your French toast, shall I? Brilliant idea, the almond glaze.\u201d</p><p>That brogue is just not fair. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll get that right in.\u201d I\u2019ve had sinful thoughts about you. Again. I wrack my brain for something to say. \u201cHow was Mass this morning?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cAh, the celebration of the Eucharist always nurtures the spirit,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to come and see for yourself, Maggie. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on my homily any time.\u201d</p><p>Father Tim often urges me to drop by. Something stops me. Guilt, no doubt. I might be a lapsed Catholic, but I draw the line at having lustful thoughts about priests in church. \u201cWell. Sure. One of these days. You bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMass can give a person a chance for some insight. Sometimes we tend to overlook what\u2019s important in life, Maggie. It\u2019s easy to lose perspective, if you take my meaning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, I do. Losing perspective is something at which I excel. Case in point?still in love with the priest. He looks ridiculously appealing in black, though granted, the white collar takes away some of the zing. Rolling my eyes at my own ridiculous thoughts, I turn away, fill a few coffee cups and slip into the kitchen, where Octavio is deftly flipping pancakes. \u201cFrench toast for Father Tim,\u201d I tell him, grabbing an order of eggs on un buttered toast. Returning to the counter area, I slide the plate in front of Stuart, one of my regulars. \u201cChicks on a raft, high and dry,\u201d I say. He nods appreciatively, a big fan of diner slang.</p><p>\u201cAnything else for you, Mrs. Jensen?\u201d I ask the seventy-year-old woman in the first booth. She frowns and shakes her head, and I leave her check on the table. Mrs. Jensen has come from church. She goes to confession every week. She\u2019s in Bible study and on the altar decoration committee. It seems I\u2019m not the only one smitten with Father Tim.</p><p>Without meaning to, I look once again at the impossible ideal. He\u2019s reading the paper. Profiled against the window, his beauty sends a rolling warmth through me. If only you were a regular guy....</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll catch you looking,\u201d Rolly whispers, another regular fixture at my counter.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d I admit. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a secret. Make sure you fill out a ballot, okay?\u201d I tell Rolly, dragging my gaze off the object of my desire. \u201cYou, too, Stuart. I need all the votes I can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh. Best coffee in the state,\u201d Rolly announces.</p><p>\u201cBest breakfast, Rolly.\u201d I smile and pat his shoulder.</p><p>For the last two years, Joe\u2019s Diner has placed fourth in Maine Living\u2019s Best Breakfast contest, and I\u2019m determined to win the county title this year. The magazine holds a lot of sway with tourists, and we could use a little more of the summer nuisance. Last year, we were creamed by Blackstone Bed &amp; Breakfast in Calais (even though they make their pancakes from a box mix).</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll win, boss,\u201d Octavio calls through the window that links the counter area with the kitchen. \u201cWe do have the best breakfast.\u201d</p> <p>I smile back at him. \u201cTrue enough, but being the best-kept secret on coastal Maine isn\u2019t doing us much good financially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he assures me. Easy for him to say. He makes more than I do, and he doesn\u2019t have to balance the books every month.</p><p>\u201cHey, Maggie, as long as you\u2019re up, can I get a refill?\u201d asks Judy, my waitress. I oblige, then bring Father Tim his breakfast, sneak a glance at his smooth, elegant hands and scurry off to clear a table.</p><p>For the last eight years, I\u2019ve run Joe\u2019s Diner, taking it over from Jonah Gray, my grandfather, after he had a heart attack. The diner is one of the larger employers in our tiny town, having four people on the payroll. Octavio is the most irreplaceable, running the kitchen with tireless efficiency. Judy came with the diner. She\u2019s somewhere between sixty and one hundred and twenty, gifted at not working, though when pressed, she can handle a full diner, not that we get that a lot. Georgie gets some help in the summer, when we hire a high school kid to deal with the light tourist business that makes it this far north.</p><p>And there\u2019s me, of course. I cook the daily specials, do all the baking, wait tables, balance the books, maintain the inventory and keep the place clean. Our final, though unofficial, employee is Colonel. My dog. My buddy. My precious boy. \u201cWho\u2019s your mommy?\u201d I ask him. \u201cHuh, Colonel McKissy? Who loves you, pretty boy?\u201d His tail thumps at my idiot talk, but he knows not to leave his place behind the register. A Golden Retriever takes up a lot of room, but most people don\u2019t even see Colonel, who has nicer manners than the queen of England. At thirteen, he\u2019s mellow, but he\u2019s always been incredibly well-behaved. I give him a piece of bacon and get back to work.</p><p>Father Tim rises to settle his check. \u201cHello, Gwen, love, how are you today? Don\u2019t you look smart in that lovely shade of yellow,\u201d he says to Mrs. Jensen, who simpers in pleasure. He smiles at me, and my knees soften. \u201cI\u2019ll see you both tonight, won\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I answer. I may not be able to bring myself to Mass, but Father Tim has worn me down for Bible study. I stifle the urge to shake my head at myself. Bible study. My social plans for the week. Well, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m turning away dozens of suitors. Sadly, Father Tim is closer to a boyfriend than anything I\u2019ve had in some time.</p><p>\u201cNancy Ringley\u2019s bringing the snack?\u201d Father Tim frowns.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I smile. \u201cI am. Her daughter\u2019s under the weather, so she called me.\u201d</p><p>His face lights up. \u201cAh, wonderful! About the snack, at any rate. Not her dear little daughter. I\u2019ll see you later, then, Maggie.\u201d He pats my shoulder with avuncular affection, causing lust and exhilaration to flow down my arm, and turns for the door. I love you, I mouth. I can\u2019t help myself.</p><p>Did he hear me? My face flushes in mortification as Father Tim glances back at me with a smile and a wink before going out into the cold. He waves as he crosses the street, ever kind where I\u2019m concerned. Mrs. Jensen, who is not so tolerant, glares at me. I narrow my eyes in return. She doesn\u2019t fool me. We suffer from the same disease?I\u2019m just a little more obvious.</p><p>It\u2019s a frigid March day, the wind howling off the water, slicing through the thickest wool hats and microfiber gloves. Only a few brave souls venture out, and the day drags. We don\u2019t get more than a handful of people at lunch. I wait for Judy to finish her crossword puzzle before sending her home, as she\u2019s really only here for show, anyway. Octavio takes off his apron as I scrape the grill.</p><p>\u201cTavy, take the rest of the pie, okay? Your kids will like it,\u201d I tell him. He has five children.</p><p>\u201cThey will if they get to taste it. I already had two pieces.\u201d Octavio grins his engaging gap-tooth smile.</p> <p>I grin back. \u201cDid Judy get any more ballots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she gave out a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I\u2019ve been relentless in asking my patrons to fill them out. Last year we lost by two hundred votes, so I need every one who crosses the threshold to pitch in. \u201cHave a nice afternoon, Octavio,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou, too, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, take these cookies, too.\u201d My cook grins his thanks, then goes out the back door.</p><p>Colonel knows what time it is. He gets up from his spot and comes over to me for a little pat, pushing his big head against my thighs. I stroke his white cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re such a good boy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He wags in agreement, then returns to his spot, knowing I\u2019ll be a while yet.</p><p>I flip the Open sign to Closed and wipe down the last table. This is one of my favorite times of day...three o\u2019clock. We\u2019re done for the day. Joe\u2019s opens at six, though I usually don\u2019t roll in until seven (the joys of ownership), but I make up my time by doing all the baking each afternoon. I\u2019m proud to say that Joe\u2019s desserts are locally famous, especially the pies and coconut macaroons.</p><p>Joe\u2019s is a Jerry Mahoney design. Red-and-cream porcelain with stainless steel siding on the outside, red vinyl seats, cream-colored walls and a black-and-white tile floor on the inside. Ten swivel stools are bolted to the floor at the counter. At one end is the requisite pastry display case where my sweets tempt the patrons. There are seven booths with nice deep backs and seats that are just bouncy enough. At some point, my grandfather had those little jukeboxes installed and, as kids, we loved flipping through to see what the new selections were. The kitchen is through a swinging door with a porthole, and there\u2019s a tiny supply room and unisex bathroom. In the corner window, a neon sign blinks those timeless words, Eat at Joe\u2019s.</p><p>For the next half hour, I add up the receipts, check the inventory, print out more ballots and mop the floor. I play the jukeboxes as I work, singing along with Aretha and the Boss. Finally, I go back into the kitchen and start baking the desserts for tomorrow. And the snack for tonight.</p><p>Since Father Tim\u2019s face brightened when he heard I was on snack duty, I decide to do something special. In the tiny kitchen, I take out the necessary ingredients and set about making apricot squares, one of his favorites. Once those are in the oven, I roll out a few pie crusts and throw together a couple of blueberry pies.</p><p>Colonel\u2019s tail starts thumping, and I hear him scramble to get up off the tile floor. I reduce the heat on the pies and move them to a higher shelf so the bottom crusts won\u2019t burn. Without checking, I know my sister is about to come in.</p><p>I\u2019m right, as I usually am about Christy. She\u2019s just pulling the baby stroller in through the door. We haven\u2019t seen each other for three entire days, which is a long spell when it comes to us. \u201cHey, Christy,\u201d I smile, holding the door for her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mags,\u201d she answers. She glances at me, then does a double take. \u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d She wrestles the carriage the rest of the way in, Violet sleeping undisturbed, and pulls off her hat. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open. \u201cChristy!\u201d We start laughing simultaneously, reaching for each other\u2019s hands at the same moment.</p><p>Christy and I are identical twins. And we are quite identical still, though Christy had a baby eight months ago. We weigh exactly the same, have the same bra size, shoe size, pants size. We each have a mole on our left cheeks. We both have a slightly crooked pinky on our right hands. Though Christy dresses a little better than I do, most people can\u2019t tell us apart. In fact, only Will, Christy\u2019s husband, has never once confused us. Even our parents goof once in a while, and, Jonah, who is younger by eight years, doesn\u2019t try awfully hard to distinguish us.</p><p>We often call each other only to get a busy signal because the other had the same thought at the same moment. Sometimes we get each other the same birthday card or pick out the same sweater from the L.L. Bean catalog. If I buy tulips for my kitchen table, it\u2019s a good bet that Christy has done the same thing.</p><p>But once in a while, in order to create some sense of individuality, one of us will get the urge to try something new. And so, on Monday when the diner was closed, I went to Jonesport and got my hair layered a little, had a few highlights put in. Apparently Christy had the same thought. Once more, we are identical.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get yours done?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYesterday. You?\u201d She smiles as she reaches out to touch my new \u2019do.</p><p>\u201cMonday, so the haircut is really mine.\u201d I grin as I say it. I don\u2019t mind. In fact, I\u2019ve always kind of liked being mistaken for Christy. \u201cI wear mine in a ponytail most of the time, anyway,\u201d I say. \u201cPlus, you have better clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnstained, anyway,\u201d she smiles, sitting at the counter. She takes off her coat and drapes it over the next stool. I go over to the stroller, which is one of those complicated Swedish affairs with everything from a wind guard to a cappuccino maker, and twist my head inside. Stretching my lips, I can just about kiss my sleeping niece. \u201cHello, angel,\u201d I whisper, worshiping her perfect skin and feathery eyelashes. \u201cGod, Christy, she gets more beautiful every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Christy answers smugly. \u201cSo what\u2019s new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not much. Father Tim was in. I think he may have heard me tell him I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Maggie.\u201d Christy chuckles sympathetically. She knows better than to spout the platitudes that everyone else does...Why are you wasting your time on a priest? Can\u2019t you find somebody else? You really should meet someone, Maggie. Have you tried the Internet/volunteering/church/dating services/speed dating/singles clubs/singles nights/singles cruises/prostitution? (This last one was suggested by my brother\u2019s friend Stevie, who has been hitting on me since he was twelve years old.)</p><p>I\u2019ve tried volunteering. And church, of course, contains the root of my problem. But singles nights and those speed dating things...well, first of all, we don\u2019t have much of that in rural Maine. The nearest big city is Bar Harbor, and that\u2019s at least an hour and a half south, if the weather is clear. As for the Internet, those services smack of deceit. A person could say anything, after all. What better way to lie about yourself? How many stories have I heard about a person being sorely disappointed by his or her Internet date? So, while there may be merit in that venue, I\u2019ve never tried it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Christy knows. She\u2019s suffered with me as much as a happily married person can suffer. She had no problem meeting Will, her lovely, nice-looking and yes, doctor husband. They live in a restored Victorian that was built by a sea captain. They have a beautiful view of the water. They go out to dinner in Machias once a week, and I babysit (for free, of course). And while I don\u2019t begrudge Christy all the nice things she\u2019s got, it does seem a little unfair. After all, we are genetically identical. She has hit Lotto in life; I\u2019ve got a crush on the priest.</p><p>\u201cWant to come for dinner tonight, see if we can fool Will?\u201d she says, toying with the ends of her newly cut hair.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say. \u201cThe pies will be out pretty soon. Want me to bring one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll cook for you, hon. Oh, and I picked this up for you when I was in Machias.\u201d She fishes a little bottle from her purse. \u201cGot it at a little shop that sells all sorts of neat stuff, earrings and scarves and little soaps. It\u2019s got beeswax in it.\u201d</p> <p>One of the byproducts of living in northern coastal Maine and owning a diner?and hence, having my hands in water or near hot oil all the time?is that my hands are horribly chapped. Thickened from work, nails cut short, rough cuticles and red patches of eczema, my hands are my worst feature. I wage a constant quest to find a hand cream that will really help them look and feel nicer, sampling every product under the sun with little or no effect.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Christy.\u201d I try some. \u201cIt smells lovely. Is that lavender?\u201d I can already tell that it\u2019s too lightweight for me.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Hope it helps.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, we\u2019re at Christy\u2019s. A roast is in the oven, and I\u2019m entertaining Violet by dangling some measuring spoons in front of her face. She bats at them, cooing and drooling, and I kiss her hair. \u201cCan you say spoons, Violet?\u201d I ask. \u201cSpoons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBwee,\u201d she answers.</p> <p>\u201cVery good!\u201d Christy and I chorus. The baby smiles, flashing her two teeth, and another waterfall of drool pours out of her rosebud mouth onto my lap.</p><p>We hear Will\u2019s car pull into the garage. \u201cOh, he\u2019s home,\u201d Christy says. \u201cQuick, give me the baby. I\u2019ll go in the living room and you stand at the stove. Here, put on my apron.\u201d Giggling, she flings it to me, grabs the baby and scampers off.</p><p>For a brief second, I stand at the stove and let myself imagine that it\u2019s my home, my husband, my baby, my roast. That a man who loves me is hurrying in to kiss me, that the beautiful baby will call me Mommy. That this warm and lovely kitchen is a place I\u2019ve decorated, the place where my family feels closest, laughs the most.</p><p>Will opens the door that joins the kitchen with the garage. My back is to him. \u201cHey, Maggie. Your hair looks pretty, too.\u201d Laughing, he kisses my cheek. \u201cStill trying to fool me?\u201d</p><p>Christy appears, her cheeks bright. \u201cWe had to try,\u201d she says. \u201cHi, babe.\u201d They kiss, and Violet reaches a chubby hand to caress her father\u2019s face. I stir the gravy, smiling. I can envy my sister and rejoice for her, too. The two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.</p><p>\u201cSo how was work, Doctor?\u201d I ask. Will is one of two town doctors and sees just about everyone in Gideon\u2019s Cove. He hired my mother as his part-time secretary, cementing the idea that Will Jones is a saint.</p> <p>\u201cIt was great,\u201d he says, taking his daughter from Christy. \u201cDaddy was just saving lives, healing wounded bodies, soothing broken spirits, the usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean no one barfed on you today?\u201d my sister quips.</p><p>\u201cHow about you, Maggie?\u201d Will asks. \u201cAnything new?\u201d</p><p>How I hate that question, second in loathing only to Seeing anyone? \u201cNo, not really,\u201d I say. \u201cNot that I can think of, anyway. But everything is great. Just fine. Thanks, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hon,\u201d Christy says, \u201cremember you mentioned that guy at the hospital? You said you\u2019d try to fix Maggie up with him?\u201d</p><p>Will opens the fridge and pulls out three beers. \u201cRight. Yeah. Roger Martin. Nice guy, Mags. He\u2019s a nurse. What do you say? Want to be fixed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, taking a long pull on my beer to cover my embarrassment. It still bothers me that I must rely on the kindness of others to get a date. However, I\u2019m thirty-two years old. Time\u2019s a-wastin\u2019. \u201cBut, you know, only if he is interested. And if he\u2019s nice. Is he nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s nice!\u201d Christy exclaims, not that she\u2019s met him. \u201cYou said he was kind of cute, right, Will?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I guess. But you know, I\u2019m straight, so I couldn\u2019t really say, Mrs. Jones.\u201d He breaks into the song they danced to at their wedding two years ago. \u201c\u2018Mrs...Mrs...Mrs...Mrs. Jo-ones. We\u2019ve got a thing going on....\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop, you\u2019re scaring the baby,\u201d Christy says, her cheeks rosy with pleasure.</p><p>I love my sister with all my heart. Violet is the joy of my life, and Will is one of the best people I\u2019ve ever met, one of the few who might deserve my twin. But tonight, it\u2019s hard to be with them, as much as Christy and Will genuinely welcome me into their home. The fact remains that I\u2019m a visitor, and I want what they have. The inside jokes, the unconscious affection, the nicknames.</p><p>Christy senses this. After the dinner dishes are done, she walks me to the door. \u201cYou want a ride?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. That\u2019s?it\u2019s great out. Great night for a walk.\u201d Great in March on the northern coast of Maine is a bit of a stretch, but I could do with a walk. I wrap my scarf around my neck, pull my hat over my ears and call to Colonel, who has been enjoying the bone Will sneaked him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find someone,\u201d my sister whispers, hugging me. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure! I know. Just a matter of time. Or maybe we could clone Will.\u201d I smile and hug her back. \u201cThanks for dinner, Christy. Love you.\u201d I walk down the steps, holding Colonel\u2019s collar so he won\u2019t fall. His h*ps are a little arthritic, and stairs can be tricky for him.</p><p>\u201cLove you, too,\u201d she calls.</p><p>I have just enough time to go home, help Colonel up my own stairs, get him settled, go back to the diner, pick up the apricot squares and walk to the rectory. There are five other people there already, all women, all half in love with Father Tim, though not to the degree or with the public scrutiny that I myself suffer.</p><p>\u201cMaggie!\u201d Father Tim exclaims. He walks over to me, and I can smell the soap he uses. His radiant smile makes my cheeks burn. \u201cThere you are! And what have we here? Ah, now, Maggie, you\u2019d tempt a saint.\u201d Mrs. Plutarski, St. Mary\u2019s gorgon secretary, frowns. Of course, Father Tim is talking about my baking, not my feminine charms. Crooning softly over the dessert, he puts the tray on a sideboard. His ass is a work of art. These sinful thoughts are getting you nowhere, Maggie, I inform myself sternly. But yes, it is a work of art.</p><p>\u201cNow, then, ladies, I believe we were going to discuss this lovely passage from the Book of Wisdom, weren\u2019t we? Mabel, love, why don\u2019t you get us started and read verses five through eleven?\u201d</p><p>For the next hour, I stare at Father Tim, drinking in his expressive eyes, compassionate and perfect smile, his lilting accent. My feelings flit between lust for him and annoyance with myself. If only I could meet someone else. If only I could get over Father Tim. Better yet, if only he were Episcopalian! Then we could get married and live here in this cozy home with our beautiful, green-eyed children. Liam, maybe, and Colleen. A new baby is on the way. We\u2019re considering Conor for a boy, Fiona for a girl.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, what do you think? Do you agree with Louise?\u201d Father Tim asks expectantly.</p><p>\u201cYes! Yes, I do. Mmm-hmm. Good point, Louise.\u201d I have no idea what she just said. I vaguely remember something about light...but no, there\u2019s nothing there. Mrs. Plutarski snorts.</p><p>Father Tim winks at me. He knows. I feel my cheeks grow warm. Again.</p><p>When Bible study is over?not that I\u2019ve become educated, enriched or spiritually moved, mind you?I feel the uncharacteristic desire to leave. The others have already congregated around the sideboard, pouring coffee and falling onto my pretty squares.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go, folks,\u201d I say, waving. \u201cSorry. Enjoy the snack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Maggie,\u201d Father Tim says around a mouthful. \u201cI\u2019ll just drop the tray off at the diner, shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great.\u201d</p><p>He waves as he reaches for another square, and I smile fondly, happy to have pleased him. Then I head home, glad that Colonel, at least, is waiting for me.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON, I leave the diner, all the goodies ready for baking tomorrow, and head for home. There\u2019s a bounce in my step. Will, best brother-in-law in the world, has come through. I have a date.</p><p>It\u2019s been a long time. Quite a while. I wrack my brain, trying to remember the last actual date I had, and come up empty. Before Father Tim came to town, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>Oh, well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I pat Colonel for reassurance and pull my coat a little closer. Tonight I have a date, and I\u2019m going to enjoy it. A nice dinner and some company, the buzz of potential. I turn at my street and make my way to the small house I bought a few years ago. On the first floor lives Mrs. Kandinsky, my tenant. She is ninety-one years old, a lovely, tiny bird of a woman who knits me sweaters and hats with amazing speed, given that her hands curl in on themselves with arthritis.</p><p>I knock on Mrs. K.\u2019s door and wait. It takes her a while to get up sometimes. Finally, the door opens a suspicious crack. Then she sees that it\u2019s just me. \u201cHello, dear!\u201d she chirps.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. K.!\u201d I chirp back, leaning down a foot or so to kiss her silky, wrinkled cheek. \u201cI brought you some meat loaf. All the fixings, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Maggie, how nice! I didn\u2019t know what I was going to cook for dinner! And now I don\u2019t have to! You\u2019re an angel, you are. Come in, come in.\u201d Her emphatic way of talking makes it sound a bit like she\u2019s singing, and I find myself unconsciously imitating her after a few minutes in her company.</p><p>Although I don\u2019t have to leave for a couple of hours, I want to go upstairs and enjoy the rare feeling of date anticipation. But Mrs. K. is so sweet, and many days, I\u2019m the only person she sees. Her aging children live out of state, and most of her friends are long gone. I usually bring her a meal from the diner for both unselfish and selfish reasons?I don\u2019t want her burning my house down, trying to cook. So she gets plenty of blueberry scones and muffins and pot roast, or cheddar mac and cheese or whatever else I\u2019ve made that day.</p><p>We go into her living room, which is crowded with overstuffed furniture, magazines and a small television. She\u2019s tapped into my satellite dish and is currently watching a soccer match between Italy and Russia. The smell of old person, close and medicinal and oddly comforting, tickles my throat.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay, Mrs. K.,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI actually have a date tonight.\u201d There I go again, blurting out my news. At least this time I know the guy isn\u2019t a priest.</p><p>\u201cHow lovely, dear! I remember when Mr. Kandinsky courted me. My father didn\u2019t approve, you know,\u201d she said.</p><p>I do know. I\u2019ve heard this story dozens of times. To remind her of this fact, I say, \u201cRight. He used to show Mr. K. his gun collection, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father used to show Walter his gun collection while he waited for me! Can you imagine!\u201d Her wizened face wrinkles even more as she laughs, a lovely, tinkling sound.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mr. K. must have loved you very much, if he stood for that,\u201d I tell her, smiling.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. He did. Would you like me to warm up some meat loaf for you, too, Maggie dear?\u201d</p><p>I lean down again and kiss her cheek. \u201cNo, I have a date, remember? But I\u2019ll warm it up for you.\u201d I tuck the dish into the microwave and press the buttons. Mrs. K. often forgets how to use the microwave, though I sometimes smell popcorn late at night. I guess she figures it out for important things. On the counter is a bottle of Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Plus Intensive Repair Hand Cr\u00e8me. \u201cMrs. K., is it all right if I try your hand cream?\u201d I ask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course! My mother always said, you can judge a lady by her hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d I mutter, attacking a cracked spot near my thumb.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I go upstairs to my apartment. Colonel seems stiffer than usual, and I have to boost him up the last few steps. \u201cHere you go, big guy,\u201d I tell him, fixing his supper. I press a glucosamine pill and some doggy anti-inflammatories into a spoonful of peanut butter and turn to him. \u201cPeanut butter blob!\u201d I announce. He wags happily as he laps his medicine off the spoon. \u201cGood boy. And here\u2019s your supper, Mr. Handsome.\u201d Given the state of his hips, I don\u2019t make him sit first.</p><p>Responsibilities finished, I take a minute to flop into my chair and relax. My apartment is small?a minute kitchen, living room, tiny bedroom and fairy-sized bathroom that barely has enough room for me to stand. But I love it. A seaman\u2019s chest, filled with afghans from Mrs. Kandinsky, serves as a coffee table. Pictures of Violet decorate the fridge, and some African violets, in honor of my niece, blossom on the windowsill. Little collections of matchstick boxes and animal-shaped salt and pepper shakers line a shelf that my father and I put up a few years ago. Some old tin pie plates hang on the wall, and instead of hooks, I use old porcelain or glass doorknobs to hang my coats. Six or seven decorative birdhouses hang on the wall, gifts from my dad, who makes them almost as fast as Mrs. K. crochets afghans.</p> <p>Well. Time to get ready for my date! I\u2019ve already planned what to wear?black pants, red sweater and a nice pair of suede shoes to slip on at the restaurant. The ice, salt and mud between my apartment and my car would ruin anything other than my faithful L. L. Bean boots in a matter of one step. I shower, dry my hair and take care of my face, then take a look in the mirror, pleased. I don\u2019t often wear my hair down, but it looks pretty and soft, thanks to the new cut and color. My gray eyes look bigger with makeup, and the blush I applied does wonders for my pale skin. I put on a necklace, give my dog a rawhide chew stick and leave.</p><p>Roger Martin, the nurse with whom I am having dinner, called me three days ago at Will\u2019s urging. He sounded pleasant, though we didn\u2019t talk too much. We agreed to meet at The Loon, a nice restaurant in Machias that Christy and Will frequent. Why he needs to be fixed up is a bit of a mystery?but then again, I need to be fixed up, so I try to reserve judgment.</p><p>It takes a while to get to the restaurant from Gideon\u2019s Cove, as the roads are narrow and twisting out of our little peninsula. I don\u2019t mind; I hum along with the one radio station I pick up as I drive. I don\u2019t leave town too often, to tell the truth, and I usually walk around town or ride my bike. My car, a Subaru station wagon, is good for loading up at the Wal-Mart in Calais when I need stuff for the diner?gallons of Windex and bleach, trash bags, flour?but for day-to-day, I prefer human-powered transportation.</p><p>I pass the University of Maine campus and continue through town. The restaurant is a cheerful, timber-beam place with fairy lights strewn on the bushes outside. It\u2019s lovely inside as well, wide-planked floors, candles twinkling, white tablecloths, a piano in one corner. I ask the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 if Roger is here and am led to a table. Sure enough, there he is, studying the menu. The unfamiliar, nervous thrill of meeting someone new washes over me.</p><p>\u201cHi, Maggie, I\u2019m Roger,\u201d he says, standing to shake my hand. He is somewhat average-looking; neither handsome nor homely, medium height, just a little chubby. His eyes are blue, his hair brown and receding.</p> <p>\u201cHi. Hi there. I\u2019m Maggie. How are you? This is a nice place, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s very cute. My sister says they have great food.\u201d I cringe inwardly, blushing. Really should get that babbling tendency looked at.</p><p>Roger smiles. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>I sit and settle my bag at my feet, then fiddle with the silverware. \u201cSo,\u201d I say. \u201cThis is nice. Thank you for coming, too. I mean, for, well...oh, shit, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I laugh nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t go out much.\u201d Stop talking. Stop. Talking. \u201cOn blind dates, I mean. I\u2019m a little nervous, I guess. But you seem nice. And you have a good job, nothing scary, just nursing. So, you know. So far, so good.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, listen to me. I sound like a chimpanzee on speed. Roger looks on. \u201cUh, would you like a drink?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Alcohol exacerbates my tendency to blather, so I should definitely refuse. \u201cI\u2019ll have a glass of chardonnay,\u201d I tell the waiter. Clamping my lips shut, I force myself to wait for Roger to speak.</p><p>\u201cWill is married to your sister, right?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Good job, Maggie!</p><p>\u201cAnd am I correct in thinking that you guys are twins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdentical, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rise slightly. Perhaps now is not the time to shut up, after all. \u201cYes, uh-huh. We\u2019re twins. Identical twins, you\u2019re right. She\u2019s older by two minutes, but I like to say that Mom loves me best because I weighed less. Christy was nine pounds. Came out of Mom like a bullet. Caused some pretty nasty tearing.\u201d</p><p>No wonder I\u2019m still single.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d says Roger. His smile has faded.</p> <p>I turn my burning face to the menu. Relax, I tell myself. This is not a game show. You have nothing to lose. He likes you or he doesn\u2019t. You like him or you don\u2019t. Calm yourself.</p><p>The waiter comes and we order dinner. I\u2019m careful to choose a dish that\u2019s neither the cheapest nor the most expensive. I take another sip of wine. \u201cSo, Roger, do you like being a nurse?\u201d I ask. That\u2019s more like it, Mags.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I sure do.\u201d He tells me a little about his work, the hospital. And here\u2019s the thing. He\u2019s not right for me. He\u2019s a little dull...instead of talking about the patients and doctors and that sort of human interest thing, he\u2019s off on a tangent about overtime and benefits and his 401K. Give him a chance, I can hear my sister saying. I try.</p><p>Our dinners come. Unlike me, Roger has had no compunction about ordering the most expensive item on the menu. The waiter puts down an enormous lobster, red and steaming, and proceeds to tie a bib around Roger\u2019s neck, making him look like a giant toddler. The lobster must weigh four or five pounds, making it a sumo wrestler among its peers. Roger rips off a claw with gladiator-esque machismo and vanquishes it with the provided nutcracker.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a chef, Maggie?\u201d he asks. He twists his fork into the claw and wrestles out a huge piece of meat, dunks it in butter and shoves it in his mouth. Butter and lobster juice run down his chin, but he takes his time wiping. The odds that I will love this man for the rest of my life are rapidly waning.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no. Not a chef. I own Joe\u2019s Diner in Gideon\u2019s Cove. I cook, but I\u2019m not a chef. Big difference.\u201d I can\u2019t take my eyes off his greasy, glistening mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d he asks. Crack. Peel. Another crack. It\u2019s like watching Vlad the Impaler conduct an autopsy.</p><p>\u201cUm...well, a chef is...has more...uh, training, I guess...\u201d Rip. Dunk. Chew. Slobber. \u201cUm, here, you have some butter on your chin.\u201d I smile weakly and gesture with my own napkin.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be more before dinner is through.\u201d He smiles, and I can see the creamy pink lobster meat bulging in his cheek. My own baked scrod sits cooling before me. Unable to look away from my dinner companion, I watch as he rips off a smaller leg and chews it in horrifyingly delicate nibbles, working the lobster meat up with his teeth, sucking, slurping. A sudden vision of sex with Roger deals my appetite the death blow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like your dinner?\u201d he asks, drowning another lobster chunk. \u201cHey, can I have some more butter, please?\u201d he asks a passing busboy.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s good. No, no. Good. Yummy. I like it.\u201d I take a forkful and chew listlessly. Perhaps I\u2019ll become a vegetarian.</p><p>I am at a loss for words?a rarity, I assure you?but Roger, drunk with the hedonistic devouring of the poor crustacean, doesn\u2019t notice. And it\u2019s not just the lobster that is laid waste by this locust horde of a man. He smacks and groans his way through mashed potatoes, stuffing overly long green beans into his mouth, then turns his attention to my plate. \u201cYou gonna eat that?\u201d he asks, and I shake my head, fascinated and horrified, as he devours my rice pilaf and vegetable medley. Finally, he spears up my barely touched fish, which he dips in the last of his drawn butter, and swallows it joyfully, an orca whale finishing off the hapless seal pup.</p><p>Finally, he pushes away the pillaged lobster shell and wipes his mouth, then takes the little wet nap and cleans his hands. \u201cWell, that was fantastic,\u201d he pronounces, leaning back. His girth is noticeably bigger. \u201cDo you want dessert? I could go for some cheesecake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow! Are you kidding?\u201d I ask. He frowns. \u201cOh, I\u2019m...I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just...wow! That was a big lobster! Boy! You can eat!\u201d Okay, enough, Maggie. \u201cSo, Roger, do you have any interesting hobbies?\u201d I ask. It would be really nice to think of something other than food at this point, and it\u2019s a good date question. Not that there\u2019s any chance of us getting together. The thought of kissing that rampaging mouth...I shudder visibly.</p><p>\u201cYou cold?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Tell me about your hobbies,\u201d I order.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cactually, I\u2019m glad you asked. I love being a nurse, of course, but what I find really fascinating, what I think might be my true calling, is animal communication.\u201d He looks at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cOh! That sounds neat,\u201d I say. I\u2019m not really sure what it is, but anything is better than watching him eat. \u201cSo is that like, um, animal training?\u201d Our waiter is glancing our way, and I try to wave him off discreetly. Any more food, and Roger\u2019s belt will slice him in half.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not training at all, Maggie. I\u2019d think a smart girl like yourself would know that.\u201d</p><p>I yearn for Colonel. Was I complaining about being single? Foolish me.</p><p>\u201cAn animal communicator reads the thoughts of animals,\u201d he lectures.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I pause. \u201cDo they speak English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe animals. I mean, if you can read their thoughts, wouldn\u2019t it be in cat language or dog or goat or whatever?\u201d</p><p>Roger frowns, clearly displeased. \u201cNo, Maggie. It\u2019s no joke, either. Don\u2019t you watch Pet Psychic on Animal Planet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve missed that one. But, hmm. Well. Interesting. So you, what, try to read their thoughts and, I don\u2019t know, tell if they\u2019re hurt or if they\u2019ve been abused or something?\u201d</p><p>He smiles condescendingly, and my desire to be home, fasting and watching TV, grows. \u201cSome people do that, yes. But I have a more specialized talent, Maggie. I communicate with animals who have passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s so...gee.\u201d</p><p>He must see the disbelief on my face, because he sits forward suddenly, staring at me intently. \u201cDid you ever have a pet when you were a kid, Maggie?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes, we did,\u201d I answer. \u201cA nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me!\u201d I jump, startled. \u201cSorry,\u201d he amends. \u201cJust think of this pet. Picture him...or her...remember him...or her...and all the good times you had with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr her,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Just picture.\u201d</p><p>A tickle of laughter wriggles in my stomach. I picture him...or her...actually, it\u2019s a him. Dicky, our childhood dog, a lovely chocolate Lab as solid and wide as a barrel. Christy and I used to hold little Jonah on his back and Dicky would walk proudly and slowly around the house, flanked on either side by us girls. Our parents\u2019 photo albums hold many images of this happy pastime.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Roger says. \u201cI\u2019m getting something. Was this pet...a mammal?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Amazing. \u201cBingo,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cGood, Maggie, and please just answer with yes or no.\u201d He closes his eyes and I take the opportunity to drain my wineglass.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, was this animal...a cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Roger frowns slightly but doesn\u2019t open his eyes. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a cat? You\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My voice is tight with the effort of not laughing.</p><p>\u201cA dog?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Roger exclaims. He opens his eyes and frowns at me. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re picturing the animal?\u201d</p><p>Dicky, Dicky, come to me, Dicky... I press my napkin against my mouth to suppress a laugh. \u201cYes, I\u2019m really picturing him,\u201d I manage to say.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to tell me it was a him! Come on, Maggie, do you want this reading or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Roger clamps his eyes shut again. \u201cOkay, okay, he\u2019s back. Right...this is a black and white dog. A Dalmatian. Yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d A little snort escapes through my nose. Roger\u2019s trance is not disturbed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, right, right...is this dog black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn Irish setter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I squeak.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s not a cat?\u201d</p><p>My laughter can\u2019t be contained any longer. \u201cOkay, Roger, thank you. Listen, I really should get going. It was nice meeting you, but I just don\u2019t think we\u2019re right for each other,\u201d I say as kindly as I can.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. I could tell that the minute you walked in.\u201d He whips out his wallet, throws some bills on the table and stalks off. Can\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry to see him go. I wonder if the hospital knows about his special gift.</p> <p>\u201cIs everything all right, miss?\u201d the waiter asks.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. It was fine. Thank you. Can I have the check, please?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not surprised to see that Roger has left only enough to cover his lobster. He didn\u2019t even leave enough for his wine. Oh, well. I make up the difference and leave a huge tip for the waiter.</p><p>When I get home, there\u2019s a message waiting on my machine?Father Tim asking a question about the spaghetti dinner next week. Perfect. It\u2019s too late to call my sister and tell her about the date, and Father Tim has just given me a great excuse to call him. He keeps late hours, something he\u2019s mentioned in the past and which I stored in the Father Tim encyclopedia I keep in my brain. Besides, I just drove past the rectory and couldn\u2019t miss the fact that the lights were still on.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, how are you?\u201d he says warmly.</p><p>\u201cOh, I just had the funniest date,\u201d I say. By the time I\u2019m finished filling him in on Roger Martin, enemy of lobsters and animal communicator, he\u2019s laughing so hard he\u2019s just wheezing.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, you\u2019re a special one,\u201d he says when he\u2019s regained control. \u201cI must say, I was in need of a good laugh, and you came along and answered my prayers.\u201d</p><p>I smile and scratch Colonel\u2019s tummy. \u201cGlad to be of service, Father Tim,\u201d I say. \u201cI have to tell you, though, I\u2019m a little...I don\u2019t know. Disappointed. I don\u2019t meet a lot of new people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I do, Maggie,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you\u2019ll meet that special someone one day soon, mark my words. You\u2019re a jewel, Maggie Beaumont.\u201d As to how the special someone and I will meet is something Father Tim doesn\u2019t address.</p><p>\u201cWell. Thanks. You\u2019re sweet to say so.\u201d I pause.</p><p>He goes on to tell me about the date change for the spaghetti dinner. As usual, my schedule is free.</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cI don\u2019t know what St. Mary\u2019s would do without you. One of these days, you\u2019ll join us properly, not just as a volunteer, mind you, and won\u2019t that be a happy day! God bless you, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>I never know what to say to that. Amen? Thank you? \u201cGod bless you, too,\u201d I say, wincing as he chuckles. \u201cI mean, good night, Father Tim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>I hang up the phone very gently, then lie back against my pillows and indulge in just one quick fantasy. That it was Father Tim with me at dinner tonight, only he wasn\u2019t a Father. That we were just two people in love, on a date, eager to talk and laugh and share the details of our day. That he played with my hands, which are smooth and lovely in this fantasy, and that his eyes crinkled when he laughed. That he insisted that I order dessert, because he knows how I love dessert.</p><p>Colonel groans.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d I say. \u201cWaste of time.\u201d It\u2019s wrong, dreaming about dating the priest. Unfair to the good father and all that. I\u2019m sick of reminding myself that it\u2019s pointless and stupid...and yet...and yet somehow it\u2019s so easy to see. Tim and Maggie. Maggie and Tim. With a sigh, I glance at my copy of The Thornbirds, given to me by my brother the day after I learned what the hot guy I\u2019d met did for a living.</p><p>Colonel\u2019s eyes are full of reproach. \u201cSorry, pooch,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll stop now.\u201d</p><p>I pat his head, hug my pillow and try to go to sleep.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>IT WASN\u2019T ALWAYS SO, my state of solitude. Once, I thought I was going to get married. Once, I was pre-engaged (not that that\u2019s an official title or anything, but I do have a cheap little pearl ring to prove it). Once, I had a steady boyfriend whom I loved and who, I thought, loved me.</p><p>Skip Parkinson was a high school god?handsome, reasonably smart, from a well-off family and, most importantly, gifted at sports. Baseball, in particular. And when I say gifted, I mean fantastic. Because of Skip, our school made states each year. Because of Skip, we won three of those four years. Because of Skip, newspapers and college scouts visited Gideon\u2019s Cove, sniffing around, eating at the diner, coming to games.</p><p>Skip (somehow short for Henry) played shortstop, the sexiest position of all. He batted .345 freshman year, .395 sophomore, .420 junior and an astonishing .463 our senior year. Stanford called and Skip answered, hoping to join the ranks of the university\u2019s famous alumni: David McCarty of Boston fame, or, less impressive to a son of Red Sox Nation, Mike Mussina of the New York Yankees.</p><p>We dated from sophomore year on. I was the chosen one and not a bad match for Skip; I was smart, too, smarter than he was, honestly. It was because he needed to pass trig that we fell in love. I was his tutor, and one day as I attempted to explain the joys of angle conversion capabilities, he suddenly said, \u201cMaggie, I can\u2019t think. You smell too good.\u201d We kissed, and it was magical.</p><p>Skip was my first real boyfriend, though I had held hands with Ricky Conway on the bus in fourth grade, danced twice with Christopher Beggins in eighth grade and kissed Mark Robideaux after a football game freshman year. But with Skip, Mom would have to pry the phone out of my sweaty adolescent hand each night and order me to go to bed; Skip would take me to the movies and we\u2019d kiss during the coming attractions, then watch the show in squirming, wonderful discomfort. I loved him with all the intensity that only adolescents can feel, to the point where Christy actually felt jealous.</p><p>Skip and I lost our virginities to each other on the bunk of his parents\u2019 sailboat on Fourth of July weekend, a grave event unlightened by any laughter or humor. I considered going to college in California to be near him, but I ended up at Colby instead, unable to venture further from home or Christy than that. All through college, Skip and I stayed together, calling each other, writing, e-mailing, reuniting on those happy holidays where we flew into each other\u2019s arms and stayed there till the final call for his plane. His parents, both lawyers, didn\u2019t quite approve of him having a townie girlfriend while the fruits of Stanford were ripe for the picking, but hey. We loved each other.</p><p>When Stanford went to the national finals our senior year, Skip was talking to coaches, scouts and reporters. The Minnesota Twins picked him in the draft, and he went to New Britain, Connecticut, to their farm team. That summer, I made the ten-hour drive down four times, cheering and screaming maniacally when my boyfriend?my boyfriend!?came up to the plate. But it was hard. If we managed a night together, it was rare. He was so busy, you see. Traveling so much. I understood completely.</p><p>When Minnesota called him up, Gideon\u2019s Cove went wild. A Major League Baseball player...from Gideon\u2019s Cove! It was a miracle. People couldn\u2019t stop talking about it. My family subscribed to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, as did about half the people in town, and we pored over it each morning. When Skip\u2019s name was mentioned, the article would be enlarged on the town hall photocopier and hung in the diner, \u201cSkip Parkinson, rookie shortstop\u201d highlighted in yellow so all could see. He would make it, we all said. Our Skip! Little Skip from Overlook Street! He was so good, so talented, so special.</p><p>Except in the world of professional baseball, he wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s a lot easier to hit off a twenty-year-old college kid than a forty-year-old veteran who can throw every kind of strike imaginable at ninety-five miles an hour. Skip\u2019s numbers dwindled from an acceptable .294 in New Britain to a dismal .198 in Minnesota. In the field, balls were hit harder, took more vicious bounces. Runners slid into base with damaging accuracy, knowing just how to intimidate a rookie so he\u2019d miss his throw or bobble the ball.</p><p>I wrote upbeat letters, called him after every game to try to bolster his spirits. I\u2019d talk about the mechanics of the pitcher, the dive that had been this close to being a double play, the unfair call from the second base ump. Relentlessly optimistic, I spent hours that year cajoling Skip into a better mood.</p><p>When his first season was over, and when I was helping out at the diner while Granddad had his heart valves replaced, Skip announced that he was coming back to Maine. He\u2019d \u201creassess\u201d his baseball career, see \u201cwhat other options\u201d were out there. The town fathers decided that we\u2019d show our support for young Skip, local hero. A big welcome-home parade. Why not? We could use a little boost at this time of year, the brief tourism season over, another long winter ahead of us.</p><p>So Skip\u2019s parents picked him up at the airport and drove him into town where the high school band waited, where the cheerleaders stood shivering in their tiny skirts, where dozens of little kids in Little League T-shirts and caps clutched Skip\u2019s rookie card or a baseball they hoped he\u2019d sign. Just about everyone in town gathered to welcome home Gideon\u2019s Cove\u2019s most famous citizen.</p><p>And I waited, too, of course, right in the front of the crowd. Skip had been very busy over the past few weeks, and we\u2019d only talked once or twice. I had called his parents and offered to go to the airport with them to pick Skip up, but they didn\u2019t return my call.</p><p>My heart leaped when his parents\u2019 car pulled up to the town green, and we the worshipful began to cheer. I couldn\u2019t wait to see him, to run into his arms and give him a kiss, blush as the crowd would no doubt whistle and yell for Skip and his high school sweetheart. College was over, I didn\u2019t have a real job yet, was just working in the diner, and now Skip was back. Were we too young to get engaged? I thought not.</p><p>Yes, I knew it was rare for high school sweethearts to marry...but it certainly happened. Some of the happiest couples out there met in high school. As I scraped the grill or mopped the floors with bleach, took abuse from the summer nuisance and treated grease burns on my hands, I thought of the nice house Skip and I would have. Winter Harbor, maybe. Bar Harbor, even. If he did get re-signed, I\u2019d just travel around with him, be the loving arms he came home to each night, whether he felt discouraged or triumphant. I\u2019d make a great baseball wife.</p><p>So Skip got out of the Lexus. And then he turned and gave his hand to someone else. He always was courtly, Skip.</p><p>She was a beautiful, elegant girl?woman, I guess?blood-red knit suit, blond hair in a French twist. The mayor and high school baseball coach and head of the Little League waited up on the little gazebo, and Skip and his parents and the blond girl went up and took their seats. There were four chairs waiting for them, I noted, and that fourth chair was not for me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That was the first time my heart was broken in public.</p><p>There were probably murmurs as I pushed my way through the crowd, away from the gazebo. I didn\u2019t hear them. Probably, I was sobbing. I know I was covering my face, because I stumbled a couple of times, my rubbery knees buckling. My parents saw and followed, and it was the most humiliating, painful moment of my life bar none, even counting Father Tim\u2019s first Mass in Gideon\u2019s Cove.</p><p>People must have said, \u201cOh, no, poor Maggie...Gosh, Skip\u2019s moved on and she didn\u2019t even...poor thing.\u201d And while Skip had done an awful, unkind thing, he was nonetheless a star, and it was understandable, wasn\u2019t it? I mean, why stick with your little townie girlfriend if the daughter of a Texas oil baron will have you?</p><p>He called me, not right away, but later that weekend. \u201cThis thing with Annabelle just happened so fast...I tried to tell you...Things with us were winding down anyway...It\u2019s not like we were exclusive.\u201d</p> <p>Silly me. I thought we were.</p><p>Skip and Annabelle left Gideon\u2019s Cove the next week. That same week my father gave me a two-year-old Golden Retriever and hugged me wordlessly, and Christy had me visit her at grad school. Then my grandfather died suddenly, and I had other things to think about. I was a business owner now. I had a dog to train. A little brother who needed help with homework. Lots to do.</p><p>It was with deep satisfaction that I saw Skip sent back to the AA league after an abysmal start with Minnesota. But it didn\u2019t stop him from marrying Annabelle later that same year, and they moved to Bar Harbor, to a house on the water purchased, no doubt, with her daddy\u2019s money.</p><p>Skip is now a salesman for a high-end car company, and when they come back to Gideon\u2019s Cove, which is rare, it\u2019s always in some much-admired, sexy sports car or an environment-raping SUV. He never comes to Joe\u2019s Diner, thank God. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since he dumped me.</p><p>So if my love life is a source of amusement to the town, it\u2019s understandable. First Skip, now the priest. I try to take it well. For the most part, I\u2019m very happy with my life. I love the diner, and I love my little apartment. I love the old folks I feed and I certainly love my family.</p> <p>But sometimes at night, when I\u2019m folding laundry or watching TV or planning the diner\u2019s menu for the week, I pretend I\u2019m married. \u201cWhat do you think? Will people eat butternut squash bisque in this town?\u201d Or, watching the Fan Cam during a Red Sox game, \u201cLook at that guy. Do you think he could chew with his mouth shut?\u201d Or even, when I just want to test it out, I might say \u201cHow was your day, honey?\u201d</p><p>Colonel wags his beautiful tail when he hears me speaking to my imaginary hubby. Sometimes he comes over and pushes his big white head against me until I smile. That dog licked away a lot of tears during our first few weeks together, and he\u2019s been my emotional barometer ever since. If he could take on human form, I\u2019d marry him instantly. But since that won\u2019t happen, and since Father Tim is not going to leave the priesthood and marry me, I\u2019m a bit helpless when loneliness decides to shove its way so rudely to the front of the line.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>\u201cHELLO, BABY BOY,\u201d I call to my brother. I\u2019m at the diner, which Jonah visits daily. \u201cHow are the traps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d he answers. \u201cGot any French toast today, Maggot?\u201d</p><p>Much to my parents\u2019 dismay, Jonah is a lobsterman. Having lived in Gideon\u2019s Cove their entire lives, our folks know what a hard life it is. Dad\u2019s a retired teacher, and my mom recently left the hospital, where she was head secretary of the OB/GYN unit. In fact, she was the one who introduced Christy and Will.</p> <p>Mom and Dad didn\u2019t really want their kids to go blue collar. They themselves are both college grads, which is rare around here, and my dad\u2019s master\u2019s degree is even more special. But despite my graduating from college, and Jonah having been given the same chance, Mom and Dad ended up with a diner owner and a lobsterman. Only Christy has done what they hoped?she graduated from college and even went on to get her master\u2019s in social work. She loved her career with the Department of Children and Families, then became a stay-at-home mom when Violet was born.</p><p>But last year, Jonah went in on a boat with another guy and has been making ends meet since. It\u2019s backbreaking work and means getting out of bed as early as 3:00 a.m., depending on how many traps you have. Most lobstermen do other kinds of fishing, too?flounder, cod, mackerel, halibut, sea bass, so when the lobstering season finishes, the boats keep running. Occasionally, a tourist will want a charter, and Jonah, who is handsome and good-natured, gets hired quite a bit during the brief Maine summer. But regulations and decreasing sea life and a million other things have turned lobstering into an even more difficult job.</p><p>Jonah lives in a little house with two other guys, a place so filthy and infested with nasty socks, moldy leftovers and dirty underwear that Human Services should shut it down. It\u2019s no wonder that he comes into the diner every day. The fact that I feed him for free is an added allure.</p><p>\u201cHeard you had a crappy date the other night,\u201d Jonah says as I set his plate down in front of him. Judy reads the paper and ignores my brother...he never leaves a tip, so she never waits on him. The morning rush, as it were, has subsided, and only a few lobstermen, back from checking their lines, come in this late.</p><p>\u201cYes, it was kind of bad,\u201d I admit, wiping down the counter. \u201cWant more coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, sissy.\u201d He lets me fill his cup, dumps some cream into it and takes a slurp. \u201cWell, speaking of dates, Christy called me yesterday. Wants me to keep an eye out for you.\u201d</p><p>As if summoned, our sister appears in the doorway, pink-cheeked from the wind. \u201cMmm,\u201d she says, inhaling appreciatively. \u201cIt smells so good in here. Can I have some coffee, too, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuppa joe, coming up,\u201d I tell her. I ring up Bob Castellano while Christy takes off her coat and sits next to Jonah. \u201cThanks for coming in, Bob,\u201d I say, handing him his change. \u201cDid you fill out a ballot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAyuh. And don\u2019t worry, sweetheart. You\u2019ll meet someone. Have a good day, now, hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Bob,\u201d I answer, mortified. I take off my apron, bend down to scratch Colonel, then sit with my siblings. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know, maybe we could not talk about my love life in front of my customers, how would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You want them to think you\u2019re still stuck on Father Tim?\u201d Jonah asks.</p><p>I scowl, then sigh. \u201cI am still stuck on Father Tim, that\u2019s the whole problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s kinda dumb, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jonah asks needlessly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Jonah, it is. Which is why I asked you to be on the lookout,\u201d Christy answers.</p><p>\u201cChristy, Jonah is eight years younger than we are,\u201d I point out. \u201cAnd in addition to being mere children, his friends are also idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Jonah murmurs.</p><p>\u201cWell, he might run into someone new,\u201d Christy says, staring thoughtfully into her cup. \u201cA new fireman or something. A new boat at the dock. Something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Unlikely,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I like your optimism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, yeah, I\u2019ll be looking out for you, Mags. Wanted...boyfriend for my sister. Must be...well, what are you looking for, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone who\u2019s not married to Holy Mother Church,\u201d I say. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the basics. No priests, no married men, no alcoholics, drug addicts or prison inmates.\u201d</p><p>Jonah laughs. \u201cWell, shit, Maggot, that rules out everyone I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Malone, Joe?\u201d Christy asks, suddenly sitting up straight. \u201cThe guy who moors next to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalone?\u201d Jonah says. \u201cYeah, sure. Mags, how about Malone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaloner the Loner?\u201d I say. \u201cCome on! He\u2019s a mute hermit.\u201d I take a sip from my coffee, remembering my agonizing ride last year from Maloner the Loner. \u201cNo hermits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a bad guy,\u201d Jonah says.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s scary, Jonah,\u201d I answer. \u201cBut thanks.\u201d</p><p>LATER THAT NIGHT, Chantal and I meet at Dewey\u2019s Pub. She\u2019s at our usual table, facing the bar, flirting with Paul Dewey by tying a maraschino cherry stem in a knot. With her tongue. Paul sits in front of her, slack-jawed, as Chantal\u2019s ripe mouth works seductively. Then her tongue pops out, and voila! There\u2019s the stem, tied in a near-perfect circle.</p><p>\u201cThee?\u201d she lisps. \u201cTen buckth, pleathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeezum crow,\u201d Dewey mutters, fishing out his wallet. \u201cHey, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Dewey. How did the casserole go over?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSold out already,\u201d he says, dragging his eyes to me. \u201cTwenty bucks for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Hey, Chantal. Up to your usual tricks, I see.\u201d I force a smile.</p><p>I\u2019ll be honest. Chantal is one of those friends of necessity. She has some nice qualities, but it\u2019s probably fair to say that aside from our single status and the fact that we both live and grew up in this town, we don\u2019t have a lot in common. She has the kind of 1940s glamour of Rita Hayworth, the curves of Marilyn Monroe and the ethics of Tony Soprano...at least when it comes to men. Use \u2019em and lose \u2019em is her motto.</p><p>However, she\u2019s also lively and funny, and a pretty good listener to boot. Like me, she is available, single and looking for a good man (so she says, though it seems like she\u2019ll sleep with just about anyone). And because Christy shouldn\u2019t be the only female friend I have, I try to ignore the fact that Chantal is every man\u2019s fantasy come true.</p><p>\u201cHow was your date?\u201d she asks. Small town, nothing to talk about except my embarrassing love life, I guess.</p><p>\u201cWell...it was freakish.\u201d I get a beer and tell her about Roger, the ruination of the lobster, the attempt to contact Dicky in the great beyond. Like Father Tim, she is crying with laughter by the end of it. I sit back and take a pull of my beer, satisfied that, if I can\u2019t find a good man, I can tell a good story.</p><p>\u201cJesus, what a...God, I don\u2019t even know what to call it,\u201d Chantal says, wiping her eyes. She snorts again, then scans the bar. \u201cWe should move,\u201d she muses. \u201cAlaska has a lot of men, doesn\u2019t it? Plenty to screw in Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last frontier,\u201d I murmur. \u201cOf course, we won\u2019t move. Well, I won\u2019t. Would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. You know...too much effort, I guess. Plus, I have a good job and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Chantal works in the town hall as a secretary, one of four employees there. She knows everyone\u2019s business and is free with her gossip.</p><p>\u201cHey, I went to church this morning,\u201d Chantal says with a sly smile. Like a lot of local women under the age of one hundred and four, she\u2019s going to church again. \u201cAnd guess what?\u201d Chantal continued. \u201cI joined the bereavement group.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and sigh. \u201cChantal...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor widows and widowers, you know. There was an announcement in the bulletin.\u201d Chantal adjusts her shirt so that more of her impressive cle**age shows. Conversation at the bar stops briefly as the men admire the show. Another inch and they\u2019d be able to nurse.</p><p>\u201cAnd how long have you been a widow?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOh, gosh...twenty years, I guess. I was eighteen when we got married, nineteen when he died.\u201d</p><p>Chantal mentioned once, when we first starting hanging out, that she was widowed ages ago. It\u2019s strange to think that Chantal was married; she\u2019s only six years older than I am but has been a widow more than half her life. \u201cWhat was his name, your husband?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cChris. Cute guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must have been really hard,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cIt sucked,\u201d she answers. \u201cAt least we didn\u2019t have kids.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit, no. No, Maggie, I\u2019m not the motherly type.\u201d She laughs and takes a swig of her drink, emptying the glass.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re suddenly seeking the solace of a grief group?\u201d I ask, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019d rather sit there and have Father Tim comfort me than sit at home, scratching my ass,\u201d she says cheerfully. \u201cHe gives great hugs. He must lift weights or something.\u201d</p> <p>I am simultaneously jealous and irritated with my own hypocrisy. Chantal has joined a church group in order to be near Father Tim. Sounds familiar. I picture Father Tim patting my hand, looking sorrowfully and deeply into my eyes as I detail the terrible loss. \u201cBereavement group. You\u2019re so lucky,\u201d I say without thinking, then blush. \u201cSorry, Chantal. That didn\u2019t come out right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty lucky,\u201d she says, shrugging. \u201cHey, Paul, can we get another round?\u201d</p><p>Dewey nearly soils himself in his haste to get close to Chantal again. \u201cSorry, what did you say?\u201d he says, staring down her blouse. Chantal smiles and arches her back. I roll my eyes, feeling very flat-chested indeed, my plain little 34-Bs nothing compared to the bounty that Chantal is offering. Dewey licks his lips. My teeth clench.</p><p>\u201cAnother round, honey. Maybe on the house, what do you say? For your favorite girls?\u201d Chantal tucks a finger into her shirt and pulls it just a fraction lower.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Dewey whispers.</p> <p>\u201cChantal! Stop,\u201d I say. I\u2019m blushing, even if she\u2019s not. Paul walks in a trance back to the bar. \u201cI\u2019ll have a Grey Goose martini, Paul,\u201d she says, as if he carries that high-end stuff.</p><p>\u201cBurnett\u2019s okay?\u201d he calls back.</p><p>\u201cSure, baby.\u201d Preening, she turns her attention back to me.</p><p>\u201cNice floor show,\u201d I comment.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re drinking for free, aren\u2019t we?\u201d she says smugly. \u201cWhat were we talking about? Oh, yeah, my husband.\u201d</p><p>Jonah comes in and does a double take when he sees Chantal. She smiles back at him. In order to distract Chantal from undressing my baby brother with her eyes, I ask, \u201cSo, did you love him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho? Oh, Chris? Sure. I guess. I mean, we were teenagers. Screwed our brains out, I\u2019ll say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s so romantic,\u201d I say, unable to suppress a smile. \u201cI think Hallmark has a line of cards like that. \u2018I miss screwing your brains out, my darling departed husband.\u201d</p><p>Chantal laughs her big, rolling laugh. \u201c\u2018Baby, no one did me like you.\u2019 There\u2019s probably a market for that. Should look into it.\u201d She excuses herself to go to the bathroom, and I go up to the bar to say hi to Jonah, despite the fact that it\u2019s been mere hours since we last saw each other.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Mags. Nothing. How about you?\u201d he says amiably.</p><p>\u201cHanging out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it okay if I come over to watch TV tomorrow night?\u201d Jonah asks. \u201cThere\u2019s that crabbing show on Discovery. Looked cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I own one of the few satellite dishes in town. The cable service frequently goes out way up here, and as a single woman, well, let\u2019s face it. I watch a lot of TV.</p> <p>Chantal returns. \u201cJonah! My, how you\u2019ve grown,\u201d she purrs.</p><p>My earlier amusement at her antics evaporates. Even though Jonah is a grown man (officially, anyway), I don\u2019t want him decimated by a man-eater like Chantal. \u201cChantal, stop. Not my brother. Leave Jonah alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no. Chantal, stay. Don\u2019t leave Jonah alone,\u201d Jonah says, grinning. \u201cHey, Chantal, you know anyone Maggie here could date? We\u2019re trawling for men who will go out with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks so much, Joe,\u201d I say, pinching him. \u201cA little louder, please? I don\u2019t think they heard you in Jonesport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Chantal says. \u201cThe pickings are certainly slim. Present company excluded.\u201d She edges closer to Jonah.</p><p>I get up and wedge myself between them. \u201cIf you sleep with my brother, I will be very mad at you, Chantal,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cJonah, Chantal is a diseased woman. Crabs, chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, syphilis...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe her, Jonah. Underneath all this, there\u2019s a heart of gold.\u201d She gestures to her chest.</p><p>\u201cIs there?\u201d Jonah asks. \u201cCan I see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, Joe!\u201d I smack my brother on the back of his head.</p><p>Chantal smiles. \u201cBack to your problem, Maggie. How about Malone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re the second person today who\u2019s said that!\u201d I exclaim, jarred out of my irritation. \u201cFirst Christy, now you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Chantal says. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis from the woman who said Dick Cheney had that \u2018sexy bald thing\u2019 going on.\u201d</p><p>Chantal shrugs. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t help it if it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her. \u201cChantal, please. Maybe, I don\u2019t know, Andre Agassi or Montel Williams. But not Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney will never have a sexy anything going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Malone\u2019s got that Clive Owen thing going on,\u201d she continues, taking a sip of her martini.</p><p>\u201cClive Owen after being beaten and left for dead, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore importantly, he\u2019s single. Right, Jonah?\u201d</p><p>My brother nods sagely at Chantal\u2019s br**sts. \u201cAyuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalone is surly, scary and ugly,\u201d I say. \u201cSo I\u2019m gonna pass on him, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Chantal says. She looks past me. \u201cWhat do you say, Malone? Want to go out with Maggie?\u201d</p><p>Crap. Crappety crap crap. I close my eyes and let the mortification wash over me. Big Mouth strikes again. And Chantal led me right into it.</p><p>I open my eyes and glance past my brother. There he is, surly, scary and ugly. \u201cHi. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>As nothing brings my brother as much joy as his sister\u2019s humiliation, Jonah is slapping the bar in mirth. \u201cYou know Maggie, right, Malone?\u201d he chortles gleefully.</p><p>Malone stares at me, unsmiling, and he is a little scary. But I never noticed, on the rare occasion that I\u2019ve been this close to him, that his eyes are actually quite nice, light blue contrasting with thick black eyelashes. Short, curly black hair, heavy eyebrows, sharp cheekbones. Deep lines run between his eyebrows, out from his eyes, alongside his mouth, and let me assure you, they\u2019re not laugh lines. It occurs to me that I\u2019ve never really looked Malone straight in the face before. Actually, I can kind of see what Chantal means...a little. He\u2019s definitely masculine and?</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think, Malone?\u201d Chantal asks. \u201cYou want to go out with Maggie?\u201d</p><p>By now, the whole bar is listening. Though I should be used to public embarrassment, my cheeks are burning. Malone drops his gaze to my chest, looks for a minute, then looks up at my face again. He shakes his head. The bar erupts in laughter. Chantal and Jonah clutch each other, shrieking, Stevie and Dewey high-five each other at Malone\u2019s insult, and I just sit there and nod my head.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say over the hysteria. \u201cWell, I deserved that. Sorry, Malone. That was a crummy thing to say.\u201d</p><p>He gives a slight nod, then turns to the beer that Dewey presents him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve embarrassed myself enough tonight,\u201d I say to my brother and Chantal. \u201cI\u2019m going home. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Maggot! Thanks for the laughs,\u201d Jonah says, sliding his arm around Chantal\u2019s shoulders. She blows me a kiss, then turns to say something to Jonah. My jaw clenches momentarily.</p><p>I get my coat from the table and head out. At Malone\u2019s stool, I pause. \u201cSorry again,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>He nods without looking at me.</p><p>\u201cI still owe you that pie,\u201d I remind him. He doesn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Although I catch a glimpse of Malone once in a while at Dewey\u2019s or at the dock, I haven\u2019t spoken with him since he drove me to Joe\u2019s in the rain. He did a kind thing for me last spring, and tonight I insulted him.</p><p>As I walk home through the quiet town, an unpleasant sense of shame keeps good pace beside me.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>A FEW DAYS LATER, whatever shame I felt has faded to a distant prickle. Once again, the presence of Father Tim melts away all bad feelings, his beautiful smile simultaneously reassuring and thrilling.</p><p>Last night, my parents had summoned their off-spring to a family dinner, something they insist on about once a month or so, and much to my delight, Father Tim was invited, as well. As I showed Colonel to his doggie bed in my old bedroom, I could hear Father Tim laughing downstairs, the rumbling voice of my dad, Violet\u2019s happy, ear-splitting shrieks. It seemed so natural.</p><p>We had a very nice dinner and a lemon cake that I\u2019d baked in honor of the occasion. Father Tim had two pieces. \u201cMaggie, you\u2019re a genius, you are, my girl,\u201d he said, finally pushing back from the table. I smiled sappily, heart fluttering.</p><p>Talk turned to the inevitable?my failure at finding a boyfriend. \u201cWill, dear, can\u2019t you find anyone for Maggie?\u201d Mom asked.</p><p>\u201cApparently not,\u201d Christy intoned, nudging her husband, who looked rightfully chagrined.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny, Christy,\u201d Mom said sharply. \u201cShe\u2019s never going to meet anyone behind that counter. Think of how you\u2019re going to end up, Maggie! A spinster waitress like Judy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Judy,\u201d I answered weakly. Mom likes to go right for the kill.</p><p>\u201cNow, Lena,\u201d Dad said meekly. I knew it was no use. There was no stopping my mother on this subject. No daughter of hers was going to be unmarried. Not if she had a breath left in her body!</p><p>\u201cWell, I just don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so difficult,\u201d Mom said to Father Tim. \u201cShe\u2019s perfectly nice! Look at Christy! Did Christy have trouble finding a nice husband? No! So why can\u2019t Maggie do the same thing? Maggie, if only you\u2019d get a real job, some place where you could meet some eligible men. Like Christy?\u201d</p><p>This comparison theme song, which I have mentally entitled \u201cChristy is Better,\u201d is one Mom\u2019s sung many times. \u201cDo you have to be so perfect?\u201d I asked my sister.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she sang, wiping mashed-up carrots from Violet\u2019s eyelid. \u201cI really can\u2019t help it. It just happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201c?in my day, people wanted to get married,\u201d my mother was saying. \u201cNow, of course, everyone\u2019s out there, doing all sorts of things. Why buy the milk when you can just rent the cow for free?\u201d</p><p>Jonah shot me a quizzical look?Mom\u2019s never been good with clich\u00e9s?then mooed softly at Violet, who banged her spoon on the highchair tray in approval. Jonah mooed again, this time in my direction.</p><p>\u201cI have a great idea,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s pick on Jonah! Jonah, why haven\u2019t you given Mom any grandchildren yet? What\u2019s the matter with you? Don\u2019t you have unprotected sex anymore? Don\u2019t you care about your own mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie!\u201d Mom admonished. \u201cThere\u2019s a priest in the room! Father Tim, I don\u2019t know where she gets this trashy talk.\u201d</p><p>But Father Tim was laughing, as I knew he would be. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt that Jonah conducts himself like a gentleman,\u201d he said. \u201cFurthermore, Jonah, my man, I trust that you\u2019ve given thought to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Maggot, thanks for reminding me,\u201d Jonah interrupted blithely. \u201cI\u2019ve got a date. Thanks for dinner, Ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, honey, I have some leftovers for you,\u201d Mom said, pressing a huge plate into his hands.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, you spoiled little prince,\u201d I said, allowing him to kiss my cheek.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, you dried-up old hag,\u201d he returned fondly. He turned to Christy. \u201cGoodbye, beautiful, nice sister. Goodbye, filthy little baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou put me in mind of my own family,\u201d Father Tim said. He looked a little sad, and I took the opportunity to pat his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou must miss them so much,\u201d I commented.</p><p>\u201cI do, Maggie. I do.\u201d He patted back, and a shameful heat flowed up my arm to my heart.</p><p>After Violet was tucked into her portable crib, my parents broke out the Trivial Pursuit. \u201cThree teams,\u201d Dad announced. \u201cThe Mrs. and I are undefeated, Father Tim, so we don\u2019t want to break our streak. Will, you can be with your lovely bride there, and Maggie, you won\u2019t mind showing Father Tim the ropes, will you, sweetheart?\u201d</p> <p>Christy grinned wickedly. \u201cI think we all know the answer to that,\u201d she murmured so that only I could hear.</p><p>\u201cHave you gained a few pounds?\u201d I asked. \u201cThey look good on you.\u201d</p><p>And so the rest of the night was spent quipping and insulting and laughing. Really, how could I not imagine Father Tim and me together? Maggie O\u2019Halloran. What a great-sounding name!</p><p>The next day, I\u2019m sitting in the rectory living room, having dodged the Gorgon Plutarski, who guards Father Tim like a pit bull protecting a steak. I stare at Father Tim\u2019s beautifully shaped mouth and idly rub a patch of eczema on my knuckle. Tonight is the big spaghetti supper to raise money for a new roof on the western side of the church, which started leaking after a nor\u2019easter last winter.</p><p>\u201cThe final count is closer to sixty people,\u201d Father Tim says. He leans forward, clasping his hands together loosely. The scent of his soap drifts to me, and I try not to swoon. For God\u2019s sake, Maggie. Literally. For God\u2019s sake. He\u2019s a man of the cloth? \u201cDo you have enough? I hate to be putting this on you on such short notice, but apparently we had a few last-minute reservations.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no problem,\u201d I say. It\u2019s so cozy in this small living room, Father Tim sitting just across from me. I swear, I could look into those eyes for the rest of my life....</p><p>\u201cCan you do the bread, as well, Maggie? I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s so late, my asking, but it completely slipped my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm? Oh, the bread? Sure. No problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, thank heaven for you, dear girl,\u201d he says, though he is only a year older. \u201cYou\u2019re a treasure.\u201d</p><p>A jewel, a treasure, darlin\u2019... I know he calls everyone by those pet names, but still. We were so natural together last night, playing couples\u2019 Trivial Pursuit, sharing huddled discussions over whether the answer was Eisenhower or Nixon, David Bowie or Iggy Pop...</p><p>I stand up, trying to shake myself mentally. Get over him, Maggie, I instruct myself. I need to stop. I really do. I want to. I\u2019m going to. I sound like a drug addict. Perhaps there\u2019s a twelve-step program for me. Priest Lovers Anonymous.</p> <p>In the rectory office, Mrs. Plutarski pauses in her phone conversation to shoot me a suspicious glare. I ignore her and walk out into the frigid rain.</p><p>Sighing, I glance down the street. The familiar weight of loneliness presses down on me. The spaghetti dinner is hours away, the diner is closed. If only I had that nice guy I\u2019ve imagined...the sweet, hardworking one with the easy laugh and dancing eyes. It\u2019s a great day for cuddling, and while Colonel is excellent at cuddling, he\u2019s not exactly the same thing as a hubby. No, Colonel could lie in front of a warm, snapping fire as my husband and I sat cuddled up on the couch, reading, drinking coffee...</p><p>My thoughts are cut off as a Hummer growls down the street, plowing through an enormous puddle. A sheet of muddy, icy water slaps down on me, drenching and punishing. \u201cHey!\u201d I yelp. The vehicle slows at the library, pulling into a parking space near the front door.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d I mutter. Fully intending to march down the street and tell them they\u2019re idiots, I find myself slowing down. A woman, dressed in a cheerful red raincoat and matching hat, gets out of the passenger\u2019s side. She opens the back door and out pop three blond children wearing colorful raincoats and brightly colored boots. The mother extends both hands, and the smaller children each take one, the oldest kid running ahead to hold the door for his mother and sisters. Even from a half a block away, I can hear their laughter.</p><p>I guess I won\u2019t tell them off. They\u2019re not idiots, after all. As a matter of fact, they look like an ad for clean American living, aside from the earth-defiling vehicle they drive. They look like the kind of family I\u2019d like to have someday. The woman seems like the kind of mother I\u2019d want to be, laughing, well-dressed, unconsciously affectionate, automatically protective.</p><p>Then the driver\u2019s door opens and out gets Skip Parkinson.</p><p>His presence is like a punch to the stomach, so silent and stunning that I actually bend over. I haven\u2019t seen him since the day he dumped me, that awful day when he brought his fianc\u00e9e back home.</p><p>Skip glances down the block, and though I knew him immediately, it\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t have that same instinct for me, despite having just soaked me through to the skin. My teeth begin to chatter, but I don\u2019t move, just watch as Skip casually jogs into the library, still full of easy, athletic grace.</p> <p>Skip must be visiting his parents. No doubt the lovely, adorably dressed children got antsy being stuck inside, so Skip and Mrs. Skip took them to the library to get a book or a movie that would occupy them for the rest of the day. No doubt Skip and Mrs. Skip will return to the Parkinsons\u2019 lovely home on Overlook Street and cuddle and read on the couch, the fire crackling, their legs entangled.</p><p>That could have been me in the bright red raincoat, being driven through the cold rainy afternoon by Skip, my husband. Those cheerful, hand-holding kids might have been mine.</p><p>Turning around, the cold rain slicing my face, I race home. It\u2019s only three blocks, but I run as fast as I can, and by the time I get there, I\u2019m gasping. I pound up the stairs, hoping that Mrs. K. doesn\u2019t decide she wants a chat or a pedicure, and burst inside. The only sound is of my rasping breath and the rain drumming on the roof.</p><p>Colonel hauls himself out of his dog bed and woofs softly. I kneel down and hug him, burying my face in his beautiful fur. \u201cOh, buddy, I\u2019m so glad to see you,\u201d I say. \u201cI love you, Colonel.\u201d</p><p>When an eighty-five pound mammal licks your tears away, then tries to sit on your lap, it\u2019s hard to feel sad. I give my dog some chicken breast to reward him for his love, then go to the bathroom and stare at myself in the mirror. Bad idea. Bedraggled, wet hair sticks to my face, which is blotchy with cold. My mouth is grim.</p><p>I slam my way out of the bathroom and go to the cupboard above the fridge?the rarely-used liquor cupboard?and take out the unopened Irish whiskey given to me by a nice old man who died about five years ago. I used to bring him dinner on Wednesday nights. Mr. Williams. Nice guy. I slosh about six ounces into a glass and raise it. \u201cHere\u2019s to you, Mr. Williams,\u201d I say, drinking. Yuck. I grimace hugely, shudder, then take another swallow.</p><p>Grabbing the phone, I call the bakery in Machias and order eighteen loaves of Italian bread, then call Will, who is at the hospital up there today, on his cell.</p><p>\u201cWill, can you do me a favor?\u201d I ask abruptly.</p><p>\u201cSure, Maggie, sure. You okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I tell him about the bakery order, remind him to come to the spaghetti supper. He is happy to pick up the bread. Great guy, that Will. I drink to him, too. \u201cAnd here\u2019s to you, Colonel Love Pup,\u201d I say, raising my glass to my dog. He wags his tail and rests his head on my foot.</p><p>I look at the clock. 3:09. Octavio closed today, and is probably already home with his wife and five kids. I hope he remembers to bring the two huge pots of homemade sauce and twelve dozen meatballs I left on the diner\u2019s stove. That\u2019s how I spent my morning, from 4:00 a.m. until seven. Cooking for a church event, even though I don\u2019t go to church. That\u2019s our Maggie, anything for Father Tim. Nothing else to do, right? It\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s home waiting for her.</p><p>By the time I leave my apartment, I\u2019m feeling a bit more cheerful. I trip off the curb and step into a frigid puddle up to my ankle, but it\u2019s okay. Weaving over to the church, I flip on the lights in the echoing basement and get out the big pasta pots. \u201cYou are the sunshine of my life,\u201d I sing, glad that Stevie Wonder can\u2019t hear me. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll always stay around, oooh, oooh, yeah, yeah...\u201d</p><p>Over the past year, I\u2019ve become well-acquainted with this kitchen. I\u2019ve cooked corned beef on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, mulled cider for the carol sing, boiled eggs for the Easter egg hunt. Here I make huge pans of lasagna for after-funeral gatherings, throw together blueberry cakes and cookies for bake sales. Coffee hour? No problem...I donate the scones, set up the beverages, fill the creamers. My home away from home, this kitchen. \u201cYou\u2019re such a loser,\u201d I tell myself. My voice echoes through the basement.</p><p>I fill the huge pots with hot water, throw in some salt and turn on the gas. Then, feeling a little bit dizzy, I decide to lie on the floor and wait for the water to boil. It\u2019s nice on the floor. Cool and smooth. My back aches a little, and I stretch, then close my eyes. A brief nap, perhaps, before everyone comes.</p><p>\u201cHey, boss.\u201d The voice floats to me over the counter. Octavio and his wife come in, each carrying a giant vat of sauce, followed by their many children.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi!\u201d I say. \u201cHello! How are you? It\u2019s nice to see you, Patty. Hello, Mookie. Hello, Lucia. Hi, other kids! Hi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay, boss?\u201d Octavio asks, giving me a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, I am. I am A-okay. Thank you,\u201d I answer. Perhaps I should get up? I do, groping for a handhold on the counter and hauling myself unsteadily to my feet. \u201cAnd you? How are you lovely people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d He and his wife exchange a look, then set the sauce down and go back to the van for the meatballs. The kids start running around, playing hide and seek. I turn the sauce on low and notice the bottles of wine under the counter. That\u2019s right?this is a wine event. How nice! Not just another boring spaghetti supper?a nice wine dinner. That\u2019s nice. It\u2019s nice to have wine. \u201cYou kids are nice,\u201d I announce to the Santos children as I uncap a bottle.</p><p>The oldest girl, Marie, who is seven, stops running. \u201cThanks, Maggie,\u201d she says, smiling shyly. \u201cYou\u2019re nice, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say. I wrinkle my nose and smile at her. What a nice girl.</p><p>An hour later, the place is full and conversation bounces around the basement like a hundred ping-pong balls. I must not think about that, or it will make me woozy. And I\u2019m already very busy trying to conceal the fact that I might be a little tipsy. Every movement must be carefully planned, every phrase prethought. My parents come over, looking the nice part of the nice parents they are.</p><p>\u201cHello, Maggie. This looks very pretty,\u201d Mom says. She glances at the tables we set up, the little fake flower centerpieces. In order to avoid that prison-cafeteria feel that so many church events have, we\u2019ve turned on only the recessed lighting, not the fluorescents.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mom. You are so nice to say so,\u201d I say. \u201cHi, Dad. It does look nice. Not like prison. Like a nice place. Like a church.\u201d</p><p>Luckily, Mom is scanning the room for someone for me to marry. \u201cMaggie, are you...have you been drinking?\u201d Dad asks quietly.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d I admit. It\u2019s hard to keep both eyes focused right now...the left eye seems to be wandering. I squint it shut so it will stop bothering me.</p><p>\u201cHave you had anything to eat today?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Yes. I had a sour cream cranberry muffin this morning, and let me tell you, Daddy, it was freaking fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, baby, let\u2019s get you fed.\u201d Dad, good old Dad, steers me to a table and pushes me into a seat.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I sit with Octavio?\u201d I ask. \u201cI love that guy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Dad says. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s nice, staying here.

I grab the flowers and place them on the splotch, then turn to face Christy. \u201cHi.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t seem prudent to mention the whiskey I drank earlier. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know...I think I had a glass of wine on an empty stomach. Thash all. Jushta li\u2019l wine.\u201d I smile to cover the fact that I\u2019m slurring.</p><p>Dad returns with some salad, bread, a glass of water and a bowl of pasta that could feed a family of four. \u201cEat, sweetie,\u201d he instructs. \u201cAnd Christy, can you run interference with your mother? She\u2019s over there talking to Carol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she answers. She stands up and pats me on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI love you!\u201d I call, waving to her. \u201cYou are so sweet, Christy.\u201d</p> <p>I eat the food?it\u2019s delicious, I have to say?and begin to feel drowsy. Christy, Violet and Will come over with plates, and after a little while, Mom, too. Another family dinner. My eyelids droop, but Dad has me on the far end, away from Mom so she won\u2019t know her spinster daughter is now also the town lush. Maybe I can go lie down on the coat pile, I think. It looks so cozy. People mill around, going up for seconds. \u201cGreat food, Maggie,\u201d several people call, and I wave sloppily in response.</p><p>Then I see Father Tim. He\u2019s chatting up Mr. and Mrs. Rubricht, laughing, clapping Mr. on the back. Mrs. Plutarski, his self-appointed bodyguard, preens in her proximity to the priest. Preening proximity to the priest. I chuckle. \u201cPreening,\u201d I say out loud. Dad turns to me, concerned, but I can\u2019t take my eyes off Father Tim.</p><p>He\u2019s so nice, Father Tim. We had so much fun the other night, didn\u2019t we? That man is a great guy. He\u2019s no ass**le, not like Skip. Nope, Father Tim is my best friend. I love him.</p><p>When everyone is just about finished and eying the dessert table with unabashed greed, Father Tim takes the microphone and clicks it on. His beautiful Irish lilt fills my ears.</p><p>\u201cIt warms my heart to see so many people here tonight, in spite of the nasty weather,\u201d he says, smiling at his flock. \u201cAnd what a lovely dinner we\u2019ve all been enjoying! Thank you, Maggie and Octavio, for putting together such a fine feast, as always.\u201d</p><p>People clap and turn toward me. I stand up, stagger back a little, but decide that no one really noticed. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d I call out.</p> <p>\u201cAnd thanks in advance to the hospitality committee, too, who\u2019ll be doing all the hard work of cleaning up afterwards,\u201d Father Tim continues. \u201cI\u2019m happy to say that we\u2019ve raised more than?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I just say something?\u201d I call out, waving to dear, kind Father Tim.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop her, Daddy,\u201d Christy murmurs, her voice urgent.</p><p>No! They will not stop me! I scoot with surprising agility around our table, only bumping into six or ten chairs as I make my way to the front of the room, where Father Tim stands smiling with a little uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cCan I have the mike?\u201d I ask him. I am not so drunk that I miss Mrs. Plutarski\u2019s mouth purse in jealousy. Yeah. That\u2019s right. Because I\u2019m Father Tim\u2019s friend. She\u2019s not the only one who adores him.</p><p>\u201cAh...sure, Maggie,\u201d he says, handing it over to me.</p><p>I\u2019ve never spoken into a microphone before. It\u2019s kind of neat, holding it. I feel a little like Ellen DeGeneres, like I have my own show. I wriggle onto the edge of the stage where last year\u2019s confirmation class butchered Godspell and blow into the mike. The rushing sound reassures me that it\u2019s on.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much, Father Tim,\u201d I say, proud not to slur. \u201cOh, that\u2019s funny! I sound like Christy!\u201d</p> <p>Everyone laughs. I\u2019m a hit!</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess I just wanted to say how grateful we all are to be here, on this beautiful planet, in this great little town. It\u2019s so nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>My mother is staring at me, her face a mixture of disapproval and horror. I think she might be mad at me. \u201cHi, Mom!\u201d I say, waving. \u201cAnyway, I also want to say thanks to Father Tim. We are so lucky to have him in our parish, aren\u2019t we? I mean, remember Father What\u2019s-His-Name, that weird little fat guy? The guy at Christy\u2019s wedding? He was no fun, no fun. Uh-uh. Not funny, that guy. And now we have Father Tim! He\u2019s so good, right? I mean, he\u2019s like a holy man, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Maggie. I\u2019ll just be taking that microphone back, shall I?\u201d Father Tim says, making a move toward me.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, no. No.\u201d I scoot back further, then stand, so that if Father Tim wants to get me, he has to come and get me. Ha! I point to him as he stands frozen, and waggle my index finger. \u201cThis is good. You should hear this, holy man. Because we all love you. Really. Don\u2019t we?\u201d I ask the assembled guests. They are certainly paying excellent attention. \u201cEveryone here loves you, Father Tim. Me, too. I just...you\u2019re such a...and we all just...I love you, Father Tim.\u201d</p><p>I keep talking, but now I can hardly hear myself, the place has gotten so loud. Will is suddenly standing next to me, clever lad, and he takes the mike from me.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t done,\u201d I protest.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re done, honey,\u201d he says. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>FRAGMENTS OF LAST NIGHT WHIZ around in my brain like ice being crushed in a blender. Snatches of conversation, images, a deep concern that yes, I really did say that.</p><p>It\u2019s three-twenty in the morning. I\u2019m not really sure what time Will and my father tucked me in. My brain grinds against my skull, and my right eye apparently has an ice pick in it. My teeth have sprouted fur, and my mouth feels like something reptilian and evil died in there.</p><p>I stagger into the bathroom and swallow two Motrin and two Tylenol at the sink. I know this isn\u2019t good to take these on an empty stomach, but I don\u2019t care. The thought of drinking milk causes ugly things to happen in my digestive tract. I take a shower and feel that I\u2019ve advanced an inch toward normal humanity.</p><p>My apartment feels stuffy and close, and I certainly don\u2019t want to be around food right now, so the diner is out. I pull on my coat, my wool hat, mittens, and grab a flashlight.</p><p>\u201cColonel,\u201d I say, and my brain recoils from the awful noise. \u201cCome, boy,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Colonel has never needed a leash; he just follows me everywhere with breathtaking devotion. We head out into the pitch-black morning.</p><p>The town is quiet; there is only the gentle sound of water shushing against the rocky shore. The wind is still at this hour, and the moon long gone, making the stars glitter in the inky black sky. I walk down dark streets, past sleeping houses, until I get to a little path that will take me up to Douglas Point. It\u2019s not a nature preserve precisely, but it\u2019s close. There\u2019s just one house up there, owned by a wealthy Microsoft executive, and he only visits it once or twice a year. He\u2019s quite nice about letting us locals use the grounds for hiking and fishing.</p><p>The smell of pine and sea makes my roiling stomach feel better, and the breeze seems to blow all thought from my head. I know what I did last night, but at this moment, my mind is empty. It\u2019s just Colonel and me right now.</p><p>I go along the sea to a large outcropping of rock that sits directly over the water. In fact, it\u2019s called Bowsprit Rock, as it resembles that particular part of a boat. Rising behind me like a specter is the granite memorial to fishermen who died at sea. Carved on it are the names of eighteen men Gideon\u2019s Cove has lost to the ravenous ocean. Eighteen men so far, that is.</p><p>The wind is a little stronger here, and still quite cold, though it is almost April. The rock is like ice under my bottom, but it feels good, cleansing and solid. I switch off the flashlight and let my eyes adjust. Colonel lies down next to me, contentedly chewing a stick, and I put my arm around his neck and look east. Dawn is far away, but the stars are brilliant enough tonight that I can see whitecaps here and there. The water slaps against the rocky shore, shushing and whispering.</p><p>With a sigh, I lie back and look into the Milky Way. It\u2019s so beautiful, so cold and pure and distant, hypnotic. Colonel snuggles against my side, and I idly stroke his thick fur, just looking into the heavens. How long I stay like this, I don\u2019t know, as I\u2019ve forgotten my watch, but the sound of a motor causes me to sit up. There goes a lobster boat, out to check the pots. The lights of the boat seem warm and welcoming compared with the distant ice of the stars. It might be Jonah, though he\u2019s on the lazy side of lobstermen. I squint, but I can\u2019t make out who it is. Malone, maybe. Jonah\u2019s mentioned that he\u2019s usually the first one out, the last one back.</p><p>Last year, the story goes, Malone and his cousin, Trevor, a man as sunny as Malone is dark, went in on a new boat. Real pretty, the local gossip sources said. Eighty-five thou, maybe more. They were going to do some more commercial work, perhaps even start a few scallop beds. But Trevor, who often came into Joe\u2019s Diner and flirted equally with Judy and me, disappeared one day. Apparently, he sold the boat out from under Malone and took off with the money, leaving Malone with the payments. Trevor was never seen again. Rumors flew?Mafia, drugs, homosexuality, murder?but Malone remained, silently working his traps himself, using the boat he\u2019d had for the past ten years.</p><p>Well. I\u2019d heard about it?you don\u2019t own the only restaurant in town and not hear these things?but I don\u2019t really know Malone. He was five or six years ahead of me in school. As he\u2019s barely spoken to me, ever, I don\u2019t really know what his situation is, a rare event in Gideon\u2019s Cove.</p><p>The grinding in my head has subsided to the pulsating of a wounded jellyfish. My ass is numb, my cheeks stiff with cold. With a sigh, I stand up. \u201cLet\u2019s go, big boy,\u201d I say to the dog. We turn and head for the diner as the sky lightens almost imperceptibly on the eastern horizon.</p><p>I put on coffee and start pulling together some muffins. Cranberry lemon today, and raisin bran for Bob Castellano, who needs his fiber. Mrs. K. likes them, too.</p><p>Soon the diner will start to fill up with people who will want to hear about my little speech last night. Or people who witnessed it and want to relive it. Once again, I\u2019ve embarrassed myself. At least no one can say I\u2019m not entertaining.</p><p>By the time the second batch of muffins comes out, I\u2019ve started the potatoes for Octavio\u2019s rightfully famous hash browns. As if summoned, he clatters through the back door, and I wince at the noise. \u201cHi, boss,\u201d he says cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I wait for the questions, but none comes.</p><p>Instead, Octavio busies himself at the stove, checks the muffins. \u201cHow about some coffee, boss?\u201d He doesn\u2019t wait for the answer, just pours me a cup and hands it to me, then starts cracking eggs into a large bowl. His big hands can handle two eggs at a time, and he\u2019s ambidextrous, at least when it comes to egg cracking. Smack! Four eggs. Smack! Eight. Smack! A dozen eggs lay waiting innocently in their bowl, not realizing they\u2019re about to be whisked without mercy. He glances at me, his face open and friendly.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a raise?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe in the summer, then.\u201d He smiles. There\u2019s a space between his two front teeth that I find very appealing.</p><p>\u201cSo I really told Father Tim I love him, didn\u2019t I?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYeah, boss. Sorry.\u201d He winks at me and continues frying the hash browns. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAny questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting a raise this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, boss,\u201d he agrees.</p> <p>Octavio is excellent at getting raises. Last year he got a whopper by not talking about that guy I\u2019d met, and now he\u2019ll get one for just being kind. \u201cI wish I were as cool as you, Octavio,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cKeep trying,\u201d he answers encouragingly.</p><p>At eight-thirty, Father Tim comes in and slides into his usual booth. I take a deep breath and close my eyes. \u201cGood morning, Maggie,\u201d he says gently. Rolly and Ben halt their conversation shamelessly, and the board of education members in the corner drop their discussion on cutting the art program. It\u2019s to be expected?I\u2019m the best show in town.</p><p>\u201cOh, Father Tim,\u201d I sigh. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t know what to say. I hope I didn\u2019t embarrass you, though I certainly embarrassed myself.\u201d</p><p>He smiles ruefully. \u201cNot to worry, Maggie, not to worry.\u201d He allows me to pour him a cup of coffee. \u201cMaggie, sit with me a moment, won\u2019t you, dear?\u201d</p> <p>I obey. He smells like damp wool and grass, the smell of Ireland, though he\u2019s been in America for six years now. His hands are elegant and smooth, and I hide my own hands in my lap, conscious as always that they\u2019re rough and red, the hands of a much older woman.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, I\u2019ve been thinking about our little problem here,\u201d he says in a low voice. His eyes are kind, and my heart squeezes with painful, hopeless love. \u201cThis...this crush on me, it\u2019s getting in the way of things, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I nod, feeling the blush creep down my neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given it some thought, Maggie, dear, and I wondered if I might help you in some way.\u201d He takes a sip of coffee, then cocks his head. \u201cWhat would you think if I set you up with some proper men?\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open. \u201cUh...well...um...Excuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Maggie, I think it might help you, ah, move on, shall we say, if you\u2019d a nice man in your life, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>Humiliation sloshes through my limbs. The priest is trying to fix me up. Oh, God. \u201cUm...I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cProper men, as I said. Believe or not, I know a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, um, well, what exactly do you mean by proper men?\u201d</p><p>Tim leans back in the booth, takes a sip of coffee. \u201cWell, Catholic would be the best place to start, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow optimistic you are,\u201d I say. \u201cSingle Catholic men in Gideon\u2019s Cove. I can think of one, Father Tim, and he\u2019s eighty years old and a double amputee. Plus, he\u2019s already proposed, and I turned him down.\u201d</p><p>Father Tim chuckles. \u201cAh, Maggie, ye of little faith.\u201d He pauses and glances toward the counter. \u201cWould you mind if I grabbed one of those muffins? I haven\u2019t had breakfast yet.\u201d</p><p>A pang of guilt makes a direct hit. Here he is, hungry and unfed, trying to solve my problems. \u201cSure, Father Tim! Of course! Whatever you want. Would you rather have pancakes? Or an omelet? I can have Octavio make you something more substantial than a muffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, that would be lovely. If it\u2019s no trouble, that is.\u201d He tells me what he wants and I call the order to Octavio.</p> <p>\u201cJudy,\u201d I ask. \u201cWould you bring this out to Father Tim when it\u2019s ready?\u201d</p><p>Judy sighs hugely, then nods, undeterred from reading the paper. \u201cCan I have some more coffee?\u201d Rolly asks.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just help yourself?\u201d she answers, gesturing in the direction of the coffeepot. I hop up and refill his cup, then return to Father Tim.</p><p>\u201cAll right then,\u201d Father Tim says. \u201cNow, bear with me, Maggie, because I know that when it comes to dating, you haven\u2019t had much luck. But you\u2019re also a bit on the fussy side, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really think so,\u201d I answer. Am I? Granted, I\u2019m not Chantal, whose male friends require only a beating heart, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m really fussy, either....</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s better if you keep an open mind. I\u2019ll have the gentlemen give you a call, and you can arrange a meeting and have a chat. How\u2019s that, dear?\u201d</p><p>After Gifted Roger, I think I\u2019d rather feed myself to sharks than go on another blind date. \u201cYeah...no,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cMaggie,\u201d Father Tim says, frowning slightly. \u201cLet me be blunt.\u201d I wince, but he continues. \u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl, but I think you need a little help when it comes to dating.\u201d</p><p>From a priest? I yelp in my head.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have you embarrassing yourself every time we run into each other, now, can we?\u201d Father Tim whispers, smiling sweetly.</p><p>I slide lower in the booth. My fists are clenched so hard in mortification that the skin over my knuckle cracks. My knee bumps Father Tim\u2019s, and I jolt upright in my seat.</p><p>\u201cThink of it as your penance, Maggie,\u201d he says, eyes twinkling. \u201cFor overindulging last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about forgive and forget?\u201d I mutter. \u201cTurn the other cheek? Go and sin no more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it, lass, you\u2019re with a professional. I won\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. Rolly spins on his stool toward me. \u201cI think you should try it, sweetheart,\u201d he offers.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rolly.\u201d I close my eyes. \u201cOkay, Father Tim. But you have to promise that they\u2019ll be good, okay? Real possibilities.\u201d I think for a minute. \u201cHey, what about Martin Broulier? He\u2019s single, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Martin works out of town, a seemingly nice guy in his forties, maybe, not bad-looking. His wife and he divorced about a year ago.</p><p>Father Tim\u2019s face brightens as Judy trudges over with his plate. \u201cThank you, Judy, darlin\u2019, thank you. That\u2019s lovely.\u201d He takes a bite and closes his eyes in pleasure. \u201cAbout Martin, no. He\u2019s divorced.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cCan\u2019t we be Vatican II about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Maggie, you couldn\u2019t get married in the church, and we wouldn\u2019t want that, would we? It wouldn\u2019t be a true marriage. Unless he can get an annulment, that is.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll check Martin out on my own, outside the auspices of the papal police here. Father Tim continues. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve a few ideas. I spoke with Father Bruce at St. Pius, and we\u2019re sure we\u2019ll come up with something.\u201d</p><p>Great. Two priests plotting my love life. Sadly, they\u2019ll probably be better at it than I am. I have nothing to lose, I suppose, having tossed away my dignity many times before. In fact, maybe this will work better. Having your friends pick out someone for you isn\u2019t a bad way to meet a man. Father Tim knows me, he likes me?surely he\u2019ll pick someone decent.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Okay,\u201d I say, my enthusiasm rising. \u201cThank you, Father Tim. I mean, after last night, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even talking to me, let alone fixing me up on a date. God, I was such a jerk! I\u2019m so sorry. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater under the bridge, Maggie,\u201d he says around a mouthful. \u201cGeorgie! How are you, lad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi! Hi, Maggie! Hi, Tim! It\u2019s a beautiful day, isn\u2019t it, Maggie? It smells so nice in here! I love the smell in here, don\u2019t you, Tim?\u201d Georgie slides in next to me and buries his face against my breast. \u201cHi, Maggie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Georgie,\u201d I say. \u201cHow\u2019s my best buddy?\u201d</p><p>Father Tim and I exchange fond smiles over his breakfast, and for the first time in a while, I feel some real hope.</p><p>THE FIRST DATE is less than pleasing for both parties involved.</p><p>I\u2019ve agreed to meet Oliver Wachterski at a bowling alley outside Jonesport. This way, I think, we\u2019ll have something to do in case we hate each other.</p><p>I get to the ratty little building, which is packed. Once inside, I realize that I\u2019ve neglected to ask Oliver what he looks like or tell him what I look like. Instead, we\u2019ve just agreed to meet somewhere at Snicker\u2019s Alley. The pleasing crash of bowling pins thunders around me, and I wander around a little, being a few minutes early. I walk past the game room, music and gunfire twisting together in a rather interesting cacophony. I don\u2019t see any men by themselves; instead, there are fathers and team members and buddies.</p><p>I stroll the length of the alley again, pretending to look simultaneously amused and nonchalant. Ah, the bathrooms. Fascinating. I stop at the end of the alley, where a cute little family is ensconced. The older kids, both girls, watch as their little brother heaves the ball onto the lane with both hands. He must be only four or five, a small kid, and the ball rolls with hypnotic slowness toward the pins. It hits the left bumper, then drifts back to the center.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t be long now, pal,\u201d calls the dad. \u201cGetting closer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you might get a strike, Jamie,\u201d says the younger sister.</p><p>The parents are sitting at the scoring table, holding hands. The woman looks at her husband, smiling, and he gives her a quick kiss.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d the little boy cries out. His ball has stopped in the center of the lane. \u201cNo!\u201d He bursts into tears.</p><p>Immediately, the older girl picks him up. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, buddy! That\u2019s really special when that happens! Hardly anyone can do that, right, Melody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Jamie. You get extra points for that!\u201d The girls exchange a conspiratorial big-girl smile over Jamie\u2019s head.</p><p>The alley attendant comes over and ventures out to retrieve the ball. He has a sticker for the boy, which cheers him up immensely. \u201cI won a sticker, Mommy!\u201d he shouts.</p><p>I smile. What a wonderful family, I think, studying the parents. They seem to be perfectly ordinary people, neither handsome nor ugly, fat nor thin. And yet they obviously love each other and have tenderhearted kids. How is something so simple so hard to get?</p><p>Someone taps my shoulder. \u201cMaggie?\u201d</p><p>I turn. \u201cOh! Oliver?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d He\u2019s nice-looking, even features, lovely brown eyes that hint at smiling. My heart rises with hope.</p><p>\u201cHi. Yes, I\u2019m Maggie Beaumont. It\u2019s really nice to meet you, too. I was just watching this cute family. The boy\u2019s ball didn\u2019t make it to the pins, and the sisters picked him up and they were all...\u201d I realize I\u2019m in danger of entering the city of Babble-On. \u201cWell. They were very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to get some shoes?\u201d Oliver asks. He\u2019s smiling.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>We rent our shoes and find our lane, number thirteen. I forget if thirteen is lucky or unlucky, so I decide that it is indeed lucky. We\u2019re between a group of serious league bowlers and another family with young kids.</p><p>\u201cSo you own a diner?\u201d Oliver asks.</p><p>\u201cYes, I own Joe\u2019s in Gideon\u2019s Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been there,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now I have a reason to come.\u201d He has dimples when he smiles, and I blush in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go first?\u201d he asks.</p><p>The first few rounds are fine. We cheer for each other and chat easily. It\u2019s when I mention Christy that the first warning shot across the bow is fired.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an identical twin?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d My smile fades at the speculative look on his face...slightly lecherous, eyebrows raised, smirk on his lips. The boys in high school used to make the same face.</p><p>But he says nothing, and when we sit together for a moment, he casually puts his arm around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThis is fun,\u201d he says. His hand brushes my neck, and my skin breaks out in gooseflesh. Not the good kind. He leans in for a kiss. I don\u2019t stop him, but I don\u2019t really want...ew. Very wet. Very spitty. Tongue already? Okay, enough. I jerk back.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s fun. Bowling...well, I\u2019ve always liked bowling. Okay! Your turn! Tie-breaker, so put on your game face! You\u2019re the Red Sox, I\u2019m the Yankees. Actually, I want to be the Red Sox. Okay? So watch out! Give it your best shot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, I manage to wrestle my mouth into submission. I stare at my hands and wish I hadn\u2019t bothered using my ultra-expensive rose oil/lanolin/honey cream this evening.</p><p>Oliver gives me an odd look and gets up, and I take a quick swipe at my mouth. He picks up his ball from the little conveyor belt and goes into his windup. Just as the ball flies from his hands, he falls to the floor, writhing.</p><p>\u201cOw! Shit! Ow!\u201d</p><p>I rush to his side, and the people from lanes twelve and fourteen stop what they\u2019re doing.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy groin! I popped my hernia. Damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d I wince. His face is bright red, and he\u2019s clutching himself rather graphically with both hands. Several people gather around us.</p><p>\u201cI popped a hernia, okay? Just push on it, and I should be able to stand.\u201d Though his face is red, his eyes are...calm. Hmm.</p><p>\u201cDo you need any help?\u201d the mother from lane fourteen asks.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Oliver snaps. \u201cJust push on it, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>My hands instinctively grasp each other. \u201cWell...why don\u2019t you push on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t! You need leverage! Just do it, Maggie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPush on where, exactly?\u201d I ask. A prickle of mistrust crawls up my neck.</p><p>\u201cMy groin. Right there. Jesus, Maggie, I\u2019m in pain here!\u201d</p><p>Is he? Or is he faking? Would he do this just for some weird sexual thrill? I barely know this guy. I don\u2019t want to push on his groin! Blech!</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Maggie!\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cRight. Right, okay...it\u2019s just that I never...you know...hernias? I don\u2019t know anything about hernias. Maybe we should wait for a medic. I\u2019ll call 911.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! This happens all the time. For God\u2019s sake, Maggie, just push.\u201d His teeth are gritted now, and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s from pain or frustration that I\u2019m not feeling him up. He certainly looks pissed off.</p><p>\u201cUm, okay, so where exactly?\u201d I say, biting my lip.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He grabs my hand and shoves it on his...well, you know. His male place. The family next to us hustles their kids away.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, honey,\u201d one of the male league players says. \u201cPush.\u201d</p><p>Grimacing, I look away and give a tentative push against his, um, flesh.</p><p>\u201cHarder, Maggie! Harder!\u201d Is that pain or sexual frenzy? I just can\u2019t tell. \u201cPush harder!\u201d</p> <p>Oh, crap, is this for real? He certainly isn\u2019t good with pain, and that doesn\u2019t make me like him any better. I push a little harder.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop f**king around and do it?\u201d Oliver snarls.</p><p>Years of lifting giant bags of potatoes and onions, wrestling economy-size sacks of rice and flour, endless bike riding and walking, have made me quite strong. It\u2019s something I\u2019m rather proud of, my strength. I look down at Oliver\u2019s speculative eyes, and push with all my might.</p><p>His scream rips through the air, soaring over the clatter and smash of pins. Every single person in the place turns to look, reducing the racket of the bowling alley to the silence of an empty church, except for Ollie\u2019s shriek. Then his voice breaks out of the range of human hearing, and all is perfectly quiet.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Oliver is carried out by the ambulance people. \u201cGood luck,\u201d I call as he is trundled past.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d he chokes. His face has returned to bright red from the purple my great strength induced. I feel no guilt whatsoever. Harder he said, and harder he got.</p><p>\u201cWell, if he didn\u2019t have a hernia, I hope you gave him one, sweetie,\u201d says a woman leaguer kindly. \u201cI thought he was kind of a prick.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>I make a mental note on the drive home: thirteen is definitely bad luck.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>ANOTHER GREAT STORY of the horrors of dating. I entertain half the town with Oliver\u2019s Groin, the latest in a series of laugh-out-loud jokes that comprises my love life. Soon I\u2019ll have enough for a daily calendar.</p><p>My second date from Father Tim\u2019s list of eligible bachelors is Albert Mikrete. We meet at a steakhouse on Route 1, Al and I. And while he is a good-looking man, financially secure, considerate and pleasant, and while we agree that Maggie Mikrete would be an excellent name, and while he was apparently quite brave during his colonoscopy last month and his cataract surgery in January, we decide at the end of our meal that perhaps we aren\u2019t quite right for each other.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl,\u201d Al says as he pays the check (at least there\u2019s that). He puts away the pictures of his grandchildren and smiles. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been so kind to an old man like myself, sitting here all night, listening to me go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably kick myself for letting you go,\u201d I say, horrified to realize that Al\u2019s been my best date in years.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t wait to tell my bridge club that I went on a date with a sweet young thing. Imagine! Me, dating a woman forty-six years younger!\u201d</p><p>We laugh and hug and part as friends, and he drives with painstaking care out of the parking lot, another senior citizen fallen to my charms. When I get home, there\u2019s a wheezing, laughing message on my machine from Father Tim. \u201cOh, shite, Maggie,\u201d he says, and I smile at the rare curse. \u201cYou\u2019ve already gone, then. Well, by the time you get home tonight, you\u2019ll find that wires got a wee bit crossed...\u201d He dissolves into more gales of laughter. \u201cRing me when you get in.\u201d</p><p>I pick up the phone and hit number three on speed dial. \u201cYou\u2019re speaking to the future Mrs. Albert Mikrete,\u201d I say when he answers.</p><p>\u201cOh, Maggie!\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It seems that Father Bruce was thinking of the wrong person...tell me it wasn\u2019t awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t, actually. He has beautiful grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>This causes another shower of laughter, and I lie back on my bed and listen happily.</p><p>That Sunday as I field the after-church brunch crowd, I\u2019m surprised to see Al come in. He waves vigorously as I serve the Tabors their pancakes.</p><p>\u201cThought I\u2019d stop by and see you, sweetheart,\u201d he announces loudly, adjusting his hearing aid. The diner becomes quiet. \u201cI wanted to tell you again what a wonderful time I had on our date.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cMe, too, Al.\u201d At least this time, I\u2019m not embarrassed. Or drunk.</p><p>\u201cWHAT ABOUT KEVIN MICHALSKI?\u201d Father Tim asks the next week, taking his usual seat at the diner.</p><p>\u201cI used to babysit him,\u201d I answer, gazing out at April. Sadly, it doesn\u2019t look different from muddy March, though the air is a bit gentler. There may be a slight fuzz of red on the distant oaks, but I can\u2019t really tell.</p><p>\u201cAh. And that puts him out of the running, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be twelve or thirteen years younger than I am, Father Tim. He\u2019s nineteen years old. I\u2019d like someone who can buy a six-pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d says Father Tim. He seems to have really gotten a tickle out of arranging my dates and consults his list with a serious expression. \u201cI\u2019ve one last man to try, and if that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m giving up on the world of dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize how that sounds, don\u2019t you?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s a winner, mind you,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been saving the best for last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrafty of you,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>He grins. \u201cYou\u2019ll thank me for this one, Maggie. You will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause this is your last chance. If he doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019m putting myself on eBay.\u201d</p><p>The breakfast crowd is now finished. Octavio is singing in the kitchen, Georgie is packing up leftovers for me to take to the soup kitchen, and Judy is painting her nails in the corner booth. I\u2019ve already baked five dozen chocolate chip cookies for the fire department tonight, and later this afternoon, I\u2019ll do my Meals on Wheels route. Mrs. K. and I have plans to watch a movie together...The Cave, I think she said. She likes a good scare. It\u2019s a typical day, busy, full, tiring. Not a bad day at all.</p><p>But loneliness gnaws at me, and filling my time with pleasant tasks ain\u2019t cutting it. While watching a gory movie with Mrs. K. holds its charms, it\u2019s not what I really want. I want to watch a movie with my husband while our kids sleep upstairs. He\u2019ll ask me if I want some ice cream as I go upstairs to check that the covers haven\u2019t slipped off the baby. Then he\u2019ll say, \u201cHey, move over,\u201d so he can sit next to me and play with my hair. \u201cI love you,\u201d I\u2019ll say, and he\u2019ll answer, \u201cThank God for that.\u201d</p><p>AFTER MRS. K. HAS fallen asleep on our movie, I creep up to the apartment, satisfied that Colonel, even if he isn\u2019t young, would at least alert me to the presence of evil. Then, I supposed, he would watch me be slaughtered by the creature that he barked at, and eventually he\u2019d probably curl up and gnaw one of my bones for the rest of the night.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t eat me, would you, boy?\u201d I ask, getting him a chew stick just in case. He takes the treat delicately from me and lies down gingerly. His h*ps must hurt. \u201cYou\u2019re the best, Colonel.\u201d He glances at me and thumps his tail in agreement.</p><p>I go to my little desk in the corner and glance out the window. From here I can see the harbor and the few lights that twinkle sweetly there. I turn on my computer and go on the Internet. I usually don\u2019t surf unless I have a reason, but tonight, that loneliness is waiting to pounce. I\u2019ll just look. No one will ever know.</p><p>Last night I babysat for Violet. I love my niece so much, marvel at her perfect dimpled hands, her sweet breath, silky dark hair, her fascinating, pulsating soft spot. After Christy and Will left, I did what I usually do?pretended she was mine. Do I covet her? Absolutely. I cooked her some carrots and oatmeal, ground up some chicken and gave her a mashed banana for dessert. Then I bathed her and let her dump water out of a cup for a half hour, nearly becoming drunk on the smell of Johnson\u2019s baby shampoo.</p><p>Holding her on my lap, I read The Big Red Barn seven or eight times. Violet never failed to be charmed at my animal imitations, and every time I said, \u201cCockadoodle doo! Moo, Moo!\u201d she would turn to me, eyes dancing, her little pearl teeth gleaming with saliva.</p><p>When I could keep her awake no longer, I sat in the rocking chair in her room and settled her against my chest, humming tunelessly until she fell asleep, holding her until my arms trembled from not moving. Laying her in the crib, I pulled up her tiny down comforter just so, arranged her bunny and her moose to be close to her head but not too close, and watched her sleep, pink as a new rosebud, her eyelashes a sooty smudge on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d I whispered. I rather hoped she would wake up and fuss so I could comfort her, but she slept deeply, not moving as I stroked her cheek with my pinky, the least rough of all my fingers.</p><p>Right. So. Can\u2019t have a baby if I don\u2019t have a mate.</p><p>I type in a few terms for Google, then click on the first Web site that comes up without giving myself time to chicken out. Before I am allowed to see who is ripe for the picking in northern Maine, I must first answer some questions. Are you a woman seeking a man? I most certainly am. Then I enter in my approximate date of birth and zip code. Pick a user name, I am ordered. Okay, I think. Something nauseating and memorable. \u201cBooboobear.\u201d Sorry, that name is already taken. Please choose again. \u201cReallyniceperson.\u201d Sorry, that name is already taken. Please choose again. I glance at my dog. \u201cColonel McKissy.\u201d Sorry, that name?</p><p>\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d I mutter. I type in some gibberish and finally get through. The next few questions are easy...my body type, hair color, eye color. For these, I\u2019m truthful. Body type, average. Eyes gray, hair...hmm. Am I light brown or dark blond? Dark blond sounds more alluring, so dark blond I am. Then we get to the interesting stuff. Body Art. Does double piercing my ears count? Apparently not. The choices include things like inked all over, fanged and branded. Branded? Do people get branded these days? Should I invest in a brand, perhaps? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee?\u201d I tell Colonel. \u201cThis is why I don\u2019t do Internet dating.\u201d</p><p>Still, it\u2019s interesting. I skip the body art section and move onto best feature. Hmm. I guess everyone would say their eyes...so I\u2019ll say smile. I have a nice smile, a ready smile. My teeth are straight and even...Smile it is. But smile is not on the list. Calves are on the list, and forearms, ni**les and navel, but not smile.</p><p>Tell us about yourself, the computer form urges. Will do.</p><p>\u201cHometown girl, love my family, love my dog. Want to make a nice life with someone loyal, funny and kindhearted. I love to bake, feed people and ride my bike. Nice-looking and once or twice a year, I can even pull off beautiful.\u201d Yes, if I spend a few hours fussing with my hair, using a pore-minimizing mud mask, soaking my hands and spending a half hour on makeup, that is. Not that I do, mind you, but I can.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good-natured and don\u2019t mind laughing at myself, either.\u201d As I\u2019ve demonstrated far too often, I think. \u201cEnjoy reading, scary movies and baseball. Want to settle down and have kids.\u201d Why be coy, right?</p><p>After numerous other sections, such as religious preferences, turn-ons (fangs are among the choices listed) and my idea of the perfect first date, I am finally allowed to see the eligible men within 75 miles of my zip code. There are two.</p><p>Looking for goddess to rain with me as we conquer the universe and all it\u2019s mysteries, explore the depths of our sensual natures and experament on the laws of love. You are big-breasted, young, stunning, adventurous, sexually daring and don\u2019t mind being submissive when your god commands it. So much can be learned from exploring each other physically...why wait is what I say. Come with me and bend to my desires, o goddess, and you will not be sorry.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry already, actually. The misspellings are enough to put me off, let alone the gist of the message. I click on the second.</p><p>Single father of two, abandoned by whore of a wife and left to deal with everything alone. She cleaned out the bank accounts, took the good car and left me with nothing, and this after fifteen years of sucking my soul dry in the first place. Let alone talk about what it\u2019s doing to the kids. Your mother\u2019s a bitch, I tell them. Sorry kids, but that\u2019s the way it is. So anyways, I\u2019m looking for someone who loves kids and doesn\u2019t mind watching mine. Preferably someone who doesn\u2019t have kids of their own, because you know how f**ked up that can be. I work long hours and won\u2019t be home much, so you should love taking care of the house, too. I\u2019m extremely good-looking and have a great sense of humor.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Jude Law,\u201d I say. \u201cYou need some serious counseling.\u201d Colonel shares my disbelief and rises to put his head on my lap. I stroke his ears, and he burps softly in response, tail wagging. The phone rings.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, I\u2019ve got you set up for a phone date,\u201d Father Tim announces.</p><p>\u201cBless you, Father,\u201d I answer. \u201cI think you\u2019re my last hope. Not that I\u2019ve forgotten Oliver and his groin, mind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking for your forgiveness on that one, Maggie,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a fluke. This time I\u2019ve a fine fellow by the name of Doug Andrews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he do?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI believe he\u2019s a fisherman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Plenty of men around here are. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell now, I\u2019ve not met him myself, nor has Father Bruce. He\u2019s from Ellsworth, a member of the church down there, and Father Bruce was kind enough to speak to his pastor. But from the account I\u2019ve heard, our Mr. Andrews is a good-looking man in his thirties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. And why does he need to be fixed up by a priest?\u201d I ask. Even though I myself require this service, I\u2019m suspicious of others who also need it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a widower,\u201d Father Tim answers. \u201cLost his wife a couple of years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I answer, then immediately correct myself. \u201cI mean, of course, not great. That\u2019s awful. So sad.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cWhat I mean is, at least he was normal enough to meet someone once. It\u2019s better than just being a weirdo who never was able to get married in the first place.\u201d I pause. \u201cLike me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie, you\u2019re not a weirdo. Granted, you talk a bit too much, and you\u2019ve a way of sticking your foot in your mouth, but you\u2019re a jewel. And if a girl as wonderful as you needs a bit of help in finding someone, doesn\u2019t it stand to reason that there\u2019s a wonderful man out there who does, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...I guess so.\u201d Did Father Tim just insult me or compliment me? A little of both, it seems. \u201cWell, is he going to call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is, yes. Tomorrow night. Nine o\u2019clock. I assume you\u2019ll be in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYup.\u201d I hop up and make the note on my blackboard. \u201cFather Tim, I really hope something turns out with this guy,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m so tired of first dates. I just don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard to meet someone.\u201d</p><p>He sighs in my ear. \u201cNor do I, Maggie. As I said, you\u2019re a fine person. And you will find someone. The Lord works in mysterious ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA priest finding me a boyfriend is on the mysterious side, Father Tim.\u201d His laughter warms my heart.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>DOUG ANDREWS DOES INDEED sound very nice. We spoke for almost an hour and agreed to meet at a restaurant between Ellsport and Gideon\u2019s Cove. There aren\u2019t that many restaurants open year round up here, but Jason\u2019s Taverne is, which makes it a fairly popular place. It\u2019s a squat, unremarkable structure sitting at the edge of Route 187, easy to get to, clearly visible from both directions. Half of the place is the bar area, which has a big-screen TV permanently set to the New England Sports Channel. Because of this, and because it\u2019s open twelve months a year, the bar is always busy. The restaurant section is quieter, and the food is simple and good.</p><p>This afternoon, Christy came over and helped me pick out what to wear, even lent me a beaded necklace and hair clip to \u201cbling\u201d me up a little. It was fun, like high school, almost, when Christy, who didn\u2019t have a boyfriend until senior year, would help me get ready for a Saturday night with Skip. The end result is that I look pretty nice, in my own opinion. My hair style is elegant but casual, the streaks that I got a few weeks ago going a long way to turn me from light brown to dark blond. I\u2019m wearing a black shirt with a pretty, curving neckline and velvety black pants. I even put on makeup.</p><p>Although I caution myself not to get excited, I can\u2019t help it. Doug and I talked easily. He sounded so reassuringly normal, talking about work (he\u2019s a manager at a fisheries plant), sailing, even a little about his wife, who died in a small plane accident. There were no warning bells, no awkward pauses. He seemed interested in me, wanted to hear about Joe\u2019s Diner, asked nice questions about Christy and Colonel, my two favorite people.</p><p>I get to the restaurant early, go inside and ask the hostess if Doug has arrived. At the bar are a couple of men engrossed in the Red Sox pregame show, and although I can only see their backs, I know Doug isn\u2019t among them. He told me he is prematurely gray, and the guys there are dark-haired.</p><p>The hostess shows me to a table near the gas-fueled fireplace. I sit facing the door, my back to the bar and the giant TV, so that I can see Doug when he comes in.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d the hostess asks.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe I should wait for my friend. Actually, no. I\u2019ll have a, um...I don\u2019t know. Glass of wine? How about a pinot grigio? Do you have that by the glass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSanta Margarita?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cSounds great,\u201d I say.</p><p>Trying to look comfortable when you\u2019re waiting for someone in a restaurant is difficult. I study the few other diners. An older couple eats in silence two tables away, and a young woman and a much older woman chat animatedly in the corner. Grandmother and granddaughter, I\u2019d guess. Aside from them and the guys at the bar, the restaurant is fairly deserted.</p><p>I glance over at the door. The hostess is reading a book. I should have brought one, too. I hate waiting. I turn in my seat and glance at the game. The Sox are trying out a rookie pitcher. If I were home tonight, I\u2019d be watching. It\u2019s nice to have somewhere else to be.</p><p>A waitress comes over with my wine. \u201cWould you like to see a menu?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m sure my friend will be along soon. But thanks,\u201d I say. I glance at my watch. It\u2019s ten after seven, and we agreed to meet at seven. I take a sip of wine to take the edge off my nervousness. He\u2019ll come, I tell myself. He sounded so promising. And eager to meet me. He\u2019d even said how nice I sounded.</p><p>Please, God, I pray silently, straightening out the salt and pepper shakers. Don\u2019t let this turn out to be a disaster, because I don\u2019t think I can take another one. I hate to bother you when I\u2019m not dying or lost at sea or a soldier or whatever, but if you have just a sec, can you please, please send me a good guy this time? I don\u2019t need much...just a decent, goodhearted man. Please. Sorry to bug you. Over and out.</p><p>The table now looks quite tidy. Nothing left to straighten. I take another sip of wine, then check my cell phone. No missed messages. I sneak another look at the door. We did say we\u2019d meet in the restaurant, didn\u2019t we? Yes, I\u2019m sure we did. Let\u2019s meet in the restaurant so we can talk, Doug had said. The bar is pretty noisy. That\u2019s right. He\u2019s been here before. So he\u2019s not lost. Just a little late. Well, not so little any more. Sixteen minutes.</p><p>The waitress brings the older couple their food, then glides over to me. \u201cWould you like to order an appetizer?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, no! I\u2019m fine. My friend is just a little late,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she says. Is that pity in her gaze? \u201cJust flag me down if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Just then the door opens. This has got to be him, I think, willing it to be Doug.</p><p>It\u2019s not. Feeling like I\u2019ve just been slapped, I drop my gaze to my lap, away from the people who just came in. Please, no. It seems my bones have just evaporated, and my heart begins to pound. Don\u2019t let them see me. Shit, shit, shit. Don\u2019t let them see me.</p><p>\u201cMaggie? Oh, my God! It is you!\u201d</p><p>I look up with a firm smile. \u201cSkip. Hello.\u201d</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Skip Parkinson stand at my table. I stand up, too, trying to wrap my brain around the fact that I\u2019ve seen Skip twice in one month after a decade of reprieve.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Skip announces. \u201cYou look just the same! It\u2019s so great to see you! You remember Annabelle, don\u2019t you? Annie, this is Maggie, a girl I went to school with.\u201d</p><p>A girl you slept with, too. The first one. The one whose heart you broke in public. \u201cHello. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t get a look at her face in the rain a few weeks ago, but now I see that her features are small and delicate and girlish. Her makeup is perfect, subtle, invisible except for her deep red lipstick, which looks daring and provocative on her. We shake hands, and I can\u2019t help wince as my peasantlike paw envelops her satiny, manicured hand.</p><p>\u201cHello, Maggie,\u201d she says, and she has a soft drawl. \u201cIt\u2019s so lovely to meet any old friend of Skip\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, thank you.\u201d I can\u2019t bring myself to look Skip directly in the face, and the three of us stand there awkwardly. Finally I say, \u201cWell, um, would you like to sit down?\u201d and instantly regret my foolish offer.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, now, we don\u2019t want to intrude,\u201d Annabelle says politely.</p><p>\u201cMeeting someone, Maggie?\u201d Skip asks, glancing at the empty place across from me.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. I\u2019m meeting a friend, and I got here a little early, and, um, well, please join me.\u201d I sit down heavily and swallow. They sit on either side of me, flanking me. I can\u2019t help it anymore?I look at Skip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He is still wonderfully handsome. His boyish face has improved with age, crinkles and lines giving him character that was lacking before. A neatly trimmed goatee hides his soft chin?he used to hate those profile shots when he was at bat. His suit looks expensive, a soft, dove gray with a dark blue tie.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019ve you been, Maggie?\u201d he asks, and instead of awkwardness or shame in his voice, there\u2019s a touch of arrogance.</p><p>\u201cFine, fine, great,\u201d I babble. \u201cAnd you? How are things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t be better,\u201d Skip answers. \u201cRight, Annie?\u201d</p> <p>She gives a cute little smile and rolls her eyes, as if to say, \u201cIsn\u2019t he a nut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill working at the diner, Maggie?\u201d Skip wants to know.</p><p>I take a long pull of my wine and glance hopefully at the door. If you came in now, Doug, I\u2019d kiss you. Hell, I\u2019d have sex with you right on this table. \u201cYes. Um, I own it now.\u201d What is usually a source of pride to me now sounds slightly embarrassing. A diner owner. Never left Gideon\u2019s Cove after you dumped me. Couldn\u2019t even find a different job.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very interesting,\u201d Annabelle says. I wonder if he\u2019s ever told her about me. If so, she must have ice water in her veins, because she looks calm and relaxed. She smiles pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cDo you work, Annabelle?\u201d I ask. It\u2019s easier to look at her than at Skip.</p> <p>\u201cWell, not any more,\u201d she admits. \u201cNot since Henry was born. Our oldest. I do a little pro bono work on the side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lawyer,\u201d Skip announces loudly.</p><p>\u201cWell, now, honey, that\u2019s sweet,\u201d she says affectionately. \u201cMaggie, I was a lawyer before having the children, but now, between them and trying to take care of the house and all, I just don\u2019t have the time.\u201d</p><p>Lawyer, wife, mother. \u201cSo are you visiting your parents, Skip?\u201d I manage to ask. My heart is thudding in my temples, and I try to keep my hands on my lap so they won\u2019t see that they\u2019re shaking.</p><p>\u201cExactly. We left the kids with them, thought we\u2019d go out and grab a bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our anniversary,\u201d Annabelle says with another doe-like look at Skip.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d I say. Much to my disgust, I feel tears prick at my eyes. I clear my throat and say, \u201cWell, don\u2019t let me keep you from your romantic dinner. It was nice seeing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not at all,\u201d Annabelle interrupts. \u201cThis is wonderful, two old friends getting the chance to catch up. We can surely spare a few moments.\u201d</p><p>Southern hospitality at its finest. I keep my eyes on the tablecloth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not married, are you, Maggie?\u201d Skip asks. His voice is like a knife. He must know that I\u2019m not. His parents still live in town. They even come to the diner once in a great while.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cAny kids?\u201d he asks, his eyes boring into me. I wonder why he\u2019s being so cruel.</p><p>\u201cNope. No kids.\u201d I force a smile as I say it.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re meeting friends tonight?\u201d Annabelle says.</p> <p>\u201cYup! Just one, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone I know?\u201d Skip asks.</p><p>\u201cSo you have a couple kids?\u201d I ask Annabelle. I can\u2019t think of anything else to say.</p><p>\u201cYes, we do. Three, actually.\u201d She shoots Skip a mysterious little smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd another on the way,\u201d Skip announces. See what a colossal stud I am?</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s nice,\u201d I say. \u201cWow. Four kids. That\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>Skip always wanted four children. He said so once, when we were enjoying a post-coital cuddle. \u201cLet\u2019s have four,\u201d he said, and the memory is so vivid I can practically smell his sweat. \u201cTwo boys for me, two girls for you.\u201d I thought it sounded wonderful.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see a picture?\u201d Skip doesn\u2019t wait, just fishes out his wallet and shoves it across the table to me. There they are, the Skip Parkinsons and their progeny.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Henry, Henry the fourth, actually,\u201d Annabelle says, pointing with her lovely fingernail. \u201cHere\u2019s Savannah, and here\u2019s Jocelyn.\u201d The girls\u2019 blond hair is neatly braided, their plaid dresses matching. The little boy is the image of Skip.</p><p>No doubt the new baby will be also be a boy. Skip always got what he wanted. I nod and blink, hoping the candlelight will hide the tears in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Someone thumps into the chair across from me. I look up. It\u2019s Malone. Maloner the Loner, surly, scary Malone. My mouth drops open.</p><p>\u201cI was at the bar. Didn\u2019t see you,\u201d he says, and his blue eyes stare into mine.</p><p>\u201cI?um?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry you had to wait,\u201d he says. His voice is like a growl, rough from lack of use, no doubt, and it takes me a minute to realize what he\u2019s doing. My eyes pop open a little, and the lines around his mouth move slightly. It might be a grin.</p><p>\u201cUm, well. Hi. Hi, Malone. Uh, this is Skip Parkinson. Do you know each other?\u201d Skip extends his hand, but Malone keeps staring at me. Then, as if reluctant to do so, he slides his gaze from me to Skip and gives a brief nod. He doesn\u2019t shake Skip\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is Annabelle, Skip\u2019s wife,\u201d I say. Malone takes her hand briefly and nods again. Then he looks back at me. I smile tentatively.</p><p>\u201cWell, Skip, why don\u2019t we leave these two to their dinner?\u201d Annabelle suggests. \u201cIt was wonderful meeting you, Maggie. Hope to see you all again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d I tell her, then look at Skip. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you, Maggie,\u201d he says. As they walk away, Skip glances at Malone, then leans down to whisper loudly into Annabelle\u2019s ear. I catch the words \u201cpoor white trash.\u201d The shithead.</p><p>I look back at Malone. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever been so glad to see someone in my life,\u201d I tell him honestly.</p><p>He raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my old boyfriend,\u201d I confide. \u201cHe dumped me for her. I\u2019m supposed to be on a blind date, but apparently, I\u2019m being stood up, and they came in and whipped out pictures of their perfect kids and I was just about to lose it.\u201d</p><p>Malone keeps looking at me, and I realize he knows all this. He came to my rescue.</p><p>\u201cThanks for pretending to be my date,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWant some more wine?\u201d he asks after a minute.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes,\u201d I answer.</p><p>From over at their table, I hear Mr. and Mrs. Parkinson laughing merrily. I try not to look.</p><p>\u201cMalone, how did you know I was...you know...being stood up, trapped, whatever? And what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>The waitress comes over. \u201cHere you are!\u201d she cries merrily to Malone. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d Malone orders a beer and another wine for me, and the waitress bustles off.</p><p>Malone looks at me for another minute before answering my question. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty obvious,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI am? How? I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kept looking at the door, then your watch. Then that arrogant ass**le came in and you looked like you wanted to crawl under the table. Good enough?\u201d</p><p>Jeez. Surly guy. \u201cSo you just dropped by for a beer?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t bother to answer, just looks over at Skip. Over in the bar, there\u2019s a cheer as the Red Sox do something great. Skip doesn\u2019t look. Too many painful memories, no doubt.</p><p>The waitress brings our drinks, and I clink my glass against Malone\u2019s. \u201cTo you, Malone. Thanks. Another piece of pie awaits you, courtesy of Joe\u2019s Diner.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. I gather we won\u2019t be talking much. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have to stay or anything, Malone. Maybe I\u2019ll just head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d he asks. It\u2019s like talking to a bear, just a series of low growls and grunts that I must translate into words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat, then.\u201d</p><p>And so begins one of the strangest dinners I\u2019ve ever had. My emotions roll and collide...distress at seeing Skip, gratitude toward Malone?who knew he\u2019d do something so nice??irritation with Malone, because he\u2019s about as friendly as a hungover troll. Still, I try to make conversation.</p><p>\u201cSo, Malone, you have a kid, don\u2019t you?\u201d Attempt number one.</p><p>He nods once in response.</p><p>\u201cBoy or girl?\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes, which would be beautiful on someone else?someone who smiled, say?just stare back at me. \u201cGirl,\u201d he says after a minute.</p><p>\u201cDoes she live around here?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stares at me as if daring me to go on, but I lose my nerve. Belatedly, I remember the story of his wife and child moving across country.</p><p>I make attempt number two a little lighter. \u201cSo, Malone is your last name, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He nods. \u201cWhat\u2019s your first name?\u201d</p><p>I get the death stare and silence, then, \u201cI don\u2019t use it.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and drink some more wine. We order dinner?hamburgers for both of us?and the silence stretches on.</p><p>Skip and Annabelle seem to have no such problems. Lots of laughs from over there. Twinkling giggles from her, low chuckles from him. At one point during our meal, one of the guys at the bar goes over to Skip and asks, \u201cDidn\u2019t you used to play baseball?\u201d and Skip says with false lightness, \u201cOh, hell, a long time ago when I was a kid,\u201d as if he gave it up for something more meaningful...like selling cars.</p><p>\u201cI really think I hate him,\u201d I whisper to Malone. He nods.</p><p>The Parkinsons are not finished. Apparently (I have forbidden myself to look at them), a gift is given, because Annabelle cries, \u201cOh, Skip! Oh, sugar, you shouldn\u2019t have!\u201d</p><p>Malone doesn\u2019t look over. Neither do I. We look at each other instead, united in this odd, uncomfortable way. I\u2019ve now had enough wine that it\u2019s starting not to bother me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t talk much, do you, Malone?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cWant to have a staring contest?\u201d I ask. Bingo! The lines around his eyes deepen and the corners of his mouth move upward a fraction. \u201cI think you may have just smiled,\u201d I inform him. \u201cHow did it feel? You okay?\u201d</p><p>As usual, he doesn\u2019t answer, but there\u2019s something a little different. It takes me a minute to realize it, but Malone is kind of...appealing. Those lashes are so long they\u2019re actually tangled in the corners. His hair is thick, curling a little around his ears and neck. And while his face is slashed with harsh lines, and while I have yet to see a real smile, his mouth is full and slightly pouting and rather sexy, actually. Life has left its mark on Malone\u2019s face with a heavy hand, but it\u2019s an interesting face, scruffy and rugged and gloomy. His cheekbones are sharp and angular, carved by the wind, almost, and it\u2019s this phrase that makes me realize I shouldn\u2019t have ordered that second glass of wine.</p><p>I clear my throat and look away. The waitress brings our check, and I fish around in my purse for my wallet. Malone takes out his first and withdraws a few bills.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, let me,\u201d I say, taking his money and holding it out to him. \u201cThis is definitely on me.\u201d</p><p>He scowls, making his face a little scary again. He doesn\u2019t take the money. I put it back down and stand up.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thank you for a lovely dinner and everything else,\u201d I say. He follows me across the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cBye, now. So nice meeting you,\u201d Annabelle calls out.</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d I say. Malone offers nothing, and neither does Skip.</p><p>In the parking lot, I pause. \u201cThanks again, Malone,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAyuh.\u201d He walks to his truck, pleasantries complete.</p><p>I get into my car and turn the key. The engine doesn\u2019t start. This is not an uncommon problem for me, and I sigh, pop the hood and get out. Malone is still there, sitting in his truck, watching me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I call. \u201cHappens all the time.\u201d</p><p>But it\u2019s dark, and I have to fumble in my purse for the screwdriver I carry at all times. If I can just find it, I\u2019ll open the hood, stick the screwdriver in the air filter, and the car should start. But I can\u2019t find it, because I failed to transfer it from my everyday pocketbook to the smaller one I\u2019m carrying now. Nor can I find anything else that would work, like a pen.</p><p>Sighing, I walk over to Malone\u2019s truck. \u201cDo you have a screwdriver?\u201d Surely he must. He\u2019s a man, isn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>I close my eyes. The restaurant door opens, and Skip and Mrs. Skip walk over to their expensive, shining car.</p><p>\u201cGood night, now!\u201d Annabelle calls. Skip holds the door for her, then goes to the driver\u2019s side. He looks over to me and pauses.</p><p>\u201cMalone, how about a ride home?\u201d I ask before Skip can do anything.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Malone says. He leans across the seat and opens the passenger door for me, which is unexpectedly polite from a man who has uttered only a handful of words this evening. I climb in. Tomorrow, Jonah or my father will have to drive me back here, but at least I\u2019m safe from Skip\u2019s eyes for now. Malone starts the truck and pulls out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cI really appreciate this,\u201d I tell him. He glances at me but doesn\u2019t say anything.</p> <p>We don\u2019t talk on the way home?I\u2019m too engrossed in thought to try to lure Malone out of his cave. When we get into town, I break the silence and direct him to my house. He throws the truck into park and hops out. I get out before he can open my door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you in,\u201d he growls.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t?\u201d But he\u2019s already waiting by the porch. I sigh. \u201cI live upstairs,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s Mrs. K.\u2019s apartment. Mine\u2019s up there.\u201d Malone waits for me to go first. The stairway is a straight shot to my door, and there\u2019s barely enough room for both of us to stand on the tiny landing. I fish out my key and unlock the door, then turn around to thank him.</p><p>\u201cThanks again, Malone. That was really?\u201d My words are cut off, because Malone leans in and kisses me.</p><p>At first, I\u2019m too shocked to think a damn thing. Malone! Kissing me! Of all the?but then it occurs to me that I\u2019m kissing him right back, and it also occurs to me that Malone knows what he\u2019s doing. His mouth is surprisingly soft and warm, and his razor stubble rasps gently against my skin. His hands cup my head, holding me steady, and I realize that my own hands are pressed against his chest. He feels deliciously solid, his heart thudding under my palm. His mouth moves to my jaw, and I breathe in the smell of soap and salt. Then he kisses my mouth again. My knees tingle and grow weak, and I grip his shirt, giving a little sigh. Then Malone pulls back, smooths his thumb across my mouth and looks down at the floor of my porch.</p><p>For a moment, I think he\u2019s going to say something, but he doesn\u2019t. He just gives a terse nod and heads down the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cUm...good night,\u201d I call. He lifts his hand and gets into his still-running truck, then drives off in a most ordinary manner, leaving me dazed and stunned on my little porch. \u201cRight,\u201d I say. Perhaps I will wake up in the morning and find that this whole night has been just a bizarre dream. Those wiggly knees of mine are telling me different.</p><p>I go inside and kneel down to pet Colonel, who is waiting patiently by the door. \u201cHey, buddy,\u201d I say. \u201cHow\u2019s my pooch?\u201d He licks my chin, then, satisfied that I am indeed home again, goes back to his doggy bed in the corner and lies down with a groan.</p><p>\u201cMalone kissed me tonight,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Colonel doesn\u2019t understand it, either.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>I GET A CALL on my cell phone the next day while I\u2019m at the diner, and for a brief second, I think it might be Malone. It\u2019s not. Of course not, as he doesn\u2019t have the number.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, hi, it\u2019s Doug,\u201d says the caller.</p><p>Doug? Oh, Doug. \u201cHi,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m so, so sorry about last night,\u201d he says. There\u2019s a pause. I wait to feel bad, but nothing comes. \u201cI just panicked at the last minute,\u201d Doug says. His voice is heavy with misery. \u201cMaggie, I guess I\u2019m not really ready to see someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d I tell him. I ring up Stuart and move the phone away from my cheek. \u201cEverything okay today, Stuart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful, Maggie.\u201d He hands me his filled-out ballot, and I wink at him and resume my conversation. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Doug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not okay. I completely chickened out and didn\u2019t even call. I feel awful,\u201d he says. I think he\u2019s crying.</p><p>Some high school girls open the door in a cloud of giggles. \u201cSit wherever you\u2019d like, girls,\u201d I tell them. \u201cDoug, hang on a sec.\u201d I take the phone into the closet that serves as my office and wedge myself inside. \u201cHi. Sorry, I\u2019m at the diner. But I can talk now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was all set to meet you,\u201d Doug chokes. \u201cI was actually in the car, but I just couldn\u2019t do it. You sound like the nicest person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Doug,\u201d I interrupt gently. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. To tell you the truth, I ran into an old friend and we had a really nice time.\u201d A bit of a stretch, but the truth is rather complicated at this moment.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Doug asks hopefully.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. I can hear Georgie making his exuberant entrance, Octavio singing quietly. \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re just not ready yet to meet somebody, and that\u2019s perfectly fine. When the time is right, you\u2019ll know it.\u201d</p><p>Doug doesn\u2019t answer for a minute, and I realize he\u2019s crying in earnest. \u201cDo you think so?\u201d he asks thickly, confirming my guess.</p><p>\u201cI sure do, Doug.\u201d I pause. \u201cFrom what you said, your wife sounded like a really great person. It\u2019ll take some time for you to want to be with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re one of the nicest people I\u2019ve never met,\u201d Doug says with a choked laugh.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever want to get together as friends, I\u2019d like that,\u201d I tell him. I wonder if I\u2019d be so generous if Malone hadn\u2019t given me something else to think about last night.</p><p>Last night, I lay awake in bed for nearly an hour, wondering at the strangeness of humanity. Usually when someone is attracted to someone else, there are signs. Not so with Malone. In fact, I\u2019d have bet my last dollar that he suffered through every minute of our bizarre dinner together. That he didn\u2019t like me a bit, especially after I was so catty in the bar with Chantal that night.</p><p>Father Tim comes in at 8:30, right after Mass. \u201cMaggie, I want to hear every detail,\u201d he says, rubbing his hands together eagerly. \u201cOh, and I\u2019ll have the eggs benedict today, I think. With regular bacon instead of Canadian, if that\u2019s all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. One Father Tim special coming up.\u201d I smile and pour him some coffee, then go into the kitchen to put his order in. When I come out, Chantal is sliding into the seat across from the priest. Any male, no matter his profession, is open season for Chantal.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chantal,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHi, Maggie. What\u2019s new?\u201d she purrs.</p><p>I feel my cheeks grow warm at her question. Chantal hears everything. Did someone see Malone and me together last night? Were there any Gideon\u2019s Cove residents at Jason\u2019s Taverne? Did someone perhaps see us kissing? I wonder if he\u2019ll call me and ask me out. I mean, why would he kiss me?the mere memory of it causes a flutter?if he didn\u2019t want to see me again?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s blushing,\u201d Father Tim observes. \u201cMust have been some date last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDate? What date?\u201d Chantal asks. No, thank God, she doesn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, I\u2019m sorry to say that Doug isn\u2019t quite ready for a relationship,\u201d I say. I busy myself by refilling the creamers behind the counter. \u201cStill kind of in mourning for his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can relate to that,\u201d Chantal murmurs. I roll my eyes, but Father Tim is tricked and pats her hand.</p><p>\u201cPoor dear,\u201d he says, and Chantal sighs hugely, her br**sts rising dramatically in her low-cut shirt. Father Tim\u2019s compassionate expression doesn\u2019t flicker, nor does his gaze drop a millimeter. The man is a saint.</p><p>At lunchtime, the bell over the door tinkles and I look up to see my sister, Violet and my parents. \u201cGood morning!\u201d Christy says.</p><p>\u201cFashoo,\u201d says Violet, reaching out a plump hand for me to smooch.</p><p>\u201cThat means \u2018I love you, Auntie Mags,\u2019\u201d Christy translates, pulling off Violet\u2019s pink coat. My parents likewise take off their coats and line up like penguins at the counter. For some reason, no member of the Beaumont family ever sits at a booth.</p><p>\u201cHow was your date last night?\u201d my mother asks without preamble. \u201cDid you finally meet someone with potential?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it was fine,\u201d I answer, feeling that heat creep up my neck again. \u201cDoug is very nice, but he\u2019s not ready for a relationship. His wife died about two years ago.\u201d There. Nothing I said was untrue. An image of Malone\u2019s slight smile causes a sudden cramp in my abdomen.</p><p>\u201cWell, he should get out there anyway,\u201d Mom says, irritated that a daughter remains single. \u201cA rolling stone gathers no dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell said, Mom,\u201d Christy says. Our dad smiles into his coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh. Maggie\u2019s not getting any younger. Before long, Maggie, you\u2019ll have problems getting pregnant, and then where will you be?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, stunned that the woman whose womb I began my life in could be so cruel.</p><p>\u201cJeezum, Mom,\u201d Christy says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d our mother states.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll meet someone when the time is right. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d my father says in a rare show of defiance to Mom. He pats my hand. My mother snorts.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad, you know who I ran into last night?\u201d I say, grateful for the chance to change the subject. \u201cYou know Malone? The lobsterman?\u201d</p><p>Dad looks blank until Christy says, \u201cYou know, Dad. His boat is next to Jonah\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Dark-haired fellow? Quiet?\u201d</p><p>Pathologically so, yes. \u201cYeah. Did you have him in school?\u201d Dad taught biology for thirty years and knows just about every person who ever went to school in Gideon\u2019s Cove.</p><p>\u201cSure. I think he transferred in midyear. Why, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I just was wondering what his first name was. He wouldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d I realize I have erred as Christy\u2019s left eyebrow lifts. No one else notices.</p><p>\u201cHm. Let\u2019s see. Malone. Skinny kid, tall...not a bad student toward the end, but way behind at first. I think there was trouble at home, to tell you the truth. Was it Michael? No, no, not Michael, I\u2019m thinking of the Barone kid. I think it was an Irish name. Liam? No, no, that\u2019s not right. Brendan. It was Brendan. Brendan Malone. Or no, that was Brendan Riley. Hmm.\u201d Dad thinks for a minute, then shrugs. \u201cSorry, honey. As I recall, everyone just called him Malone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well. Not important. I was just curious.\u201d</p><p>Christy looks quite speculative, and I turn away to wait on Ben at the counter, since Judy is doing a crossword puzzle.</p><p>Our mother offers to take Violet for the afternoon, claiming that she never gets to see her only grandchild (here with a significant look at me, the daughter who has failed to reproduce). She ignores the fact that she sees Violet almost every day. Once we\u2019re alone, Christy pounces.</p><p>\u201cSo, why the sudden interest in Malone?\u201d she asks, pretending to help me as I pack my car for meal deliveries.</p><p>\u201cOh, I just ran into him last night,\u201d I say, feigning nonchalance.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. And?\u201d she prods. Damn this twin thing. She knows far too much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll tell you, but you can\u2019t tell anyone else.\u201d Knowing she won\u2019t, I give her the story from last night?Skip, Annabelle, Malone?but for some reason, I don\u2019t tell her the ending.</p><p>\u201cSo he drove me home. Jonah brought me out to get my car this morning and, unlike some siblings, he didn\u2019t ask prying questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Christy says. \u201cThat was awfully nice, pretending to be your date. Wicked nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I murmur. \u201cListen, I have to go. Do you want to come? It\u2019ll be fun. They\u2019ll have Colonel and you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDouble the pleasure, double the fun,\u201d my sister says. \u201cSure, I\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>And it is fun. The fourteen people on my route are always overjoyed to see Colonel and me, and when encountered with my mirror image, they nearly wet themselves in delight. We bring in the meals, tidy up at one house, check a prescription at another, chat with the clients, let them pet my gentle dog. I urge Christy to show pictures of Violet, and a lot of old faces break into tender smiles at the sight of my beautiful niece.</p><p>\u201cShe could be yours,\u201d Mrs. Banack says, handing the picture to me.</p><p>\u201cTrue enough,\u201d I answer. \u201cI couldn\u2019t love her more if she was.\u201d</p><p>We finish up our route and head for home.</p> <p>\u201cSo still no boyfriend,\u201d Christy says as we drive home. I don\u2019t comment. \u201cAny ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say, glancing in my rearview mirror. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just give it a rest for a while. I\u2019ve been on four dates in the last month, and none of them worked out very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Idle hands are the devil\u2019s workhorse, as Mom would say,\u201d Christy advises somberly. I laugh, but at the back of my mind is Malone and his gently scraping kiss.</p><p>When I get home from dropping Christy off, I zip over to the answering machine, hoping to see the blinking light. No blinking. Malone has not called me.</p><p>Nor does he call me that evening. The next day is Sunday, and as I flit between tables, clearing and serving, Malone is on my mind. Why hasn\u2019t he called me? Why would he kiss me and then not call me? Should I call him? I shudder at the thought?I wouldn\u2019t be able to see him either nod or stare from my apartment, would I? And since that seems to be his main form of communication, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a conversation.</p><p>It\u2019s not that I really like him, I tell myself. Because really, he\u2019s a complete stranger. Almost. I liked kissing him, yes. At the thought, my stomach knots and my knees tingle. The after-church crowd takes their time finishing, and when they\u2019re done with breakfast, the Sunday lunch crowd comes in. Finally, by about two, all my customers are gone. I wipe down with unusual speed, opting to skip the floor-washing. I\u2019ll just wander down to the dock, I think. See how Jonah\u2019s doing. Check on the little brother.</p> <p>Jonah\u2019s boat is right against the dock, not moored at its usual spot, which is convenient for me. Inconveniently, Malone\u2019s boat is out, so I\u2019ll just have to hang out with my little bro for a while. \u201cHey, Jonah!\u201d I call down. It\u2019s low tide, so the dock is a good twenty feet lower than it will be six hours from now. Tides in this part of Maine are dramatic, and the gangplank is pitched quite steeply. The smell of fish and salt and tide greet me as I totter down carefully and walk over to Jonah\u2019s boat, which is named Twin Menace after his beloved big sisters. My brother is not in sight.</p><p>\u201cHey, Joe!\u201d I yell.</p><p>\u201cMaggie,\u201d he calls back, climbing out of the hold and shutting the door firmly behind him. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing. Permission to come aboard, captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no. Actually, I\u2019m just leaving. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Drat. \u201cSo, do most people go out on a Sunday?\u201d I ask. I\u2019ve never really taken note of the patterns of the lobster boats; it\u2019s something that\u2019s so familiar and constant here that it\u2019s like background noise. During the summer, it\u2019s against the law to haul traps on a Sunday, that I know, but as for the practices of the off-season, I\u2019m clueless.</p><p>\u201cNah. Most of us stay in, even now, I guess.\u201d He glances back at the stern of his boat.</p><p>\u201cBut some go out?\u201d I prod.</p> <p>\u201cAyuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do they come back?\u201d I glance casually over the railing at a small school of baby stripers.</p><p>\u201cDunno.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. Malone is rubbing off on Jonah, apparently. Usually, my brother won\u2019t stop talking...rather like me, I guess. I give it another try. \u201cSo they just come back whenever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie, I just said I don\u2019t know. What\u2019s it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just making conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have to tie up, and then I\u2019m going,\u201d he says. \u201cSee you.\u201d When I don\u2019t move, he frowns. \u201cDid you want something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI?No. Sorry. Have a nice day.\u201d</p><p>He nods and starts the engine, pulling the Twin Menace away from the dock out to his mooring, then disappears back into the hold, busy with whatever keeps him there.</p><p>Clearly, I have to go. I can\u2019t be here when Malone comes in, because that would be too obvious and desperate. Hi, Malone, I\u2019m just hanging around waiting for you. How was your day? Want to kiss me again? I wince and wisely decide to go home.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>MONDAY IS MY DAY OFF, and I use it to clean my apartment and Mrs. K.\u2019s. As I vacuum up her popcorn crumbs, she follows me around carefully, pointing with her cane at parts I\u2019ve missed.</p><p>\u201cRight there, Maggie, dear. And gracious! There, too! I can\u2019t get over how sloppy I am!\u201d I smile?she says this every week. When I\u2019m done, I check her fridge and make sure she\u2019s got enough of the barley soup I brought over yesterday.</p><p>\u201cNeed anything, Mrs. K.?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cDear, I\u2019m fine. But tell me, did you have a friend over the other night?\u201d</p><p>I freeze momentarily. \u201cNo, no. Just, you know, someone, um, gave me a ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was a man,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, actually, it was a man. Malone. My brother\u2019s friend.\u201d I hope she doesn\u2019t pick up on my blush.</p><p>\u201cMalone? I don\u2019t know anyone by the name of Malone. Is he good people? Should you be driving around late at night with strangers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s not really a stranger, Mrs. K., because my brother knows him.\u201d</p><p>But of course he is a stranger. And he still hasn\u2019t called me. I looked up his phone number to make sure he has a phone, and he does. Whether he uses it is another question. Again, I can\u2019t imagine why he\u2019d kiss me like that and then just...</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s certainly a manly man, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Mrs. K. offers. God, did she have binoculars trained on him?</p><p>\u201cMalone? Sure, I guess so.\u201d I pause in mopping the floor of the tiny kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always liked the manly ones, you know. Mr. Kandinsky wasn\u2019t like that, but he was a dear. He never understood why I just loved Charles Bronson, but I did! I think I\u2019ve seen every Death Wish ever made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to rent them, won\u2019t we?\u201d I say, giving her a kiss on her soft, wrinkled cheek.</p><p>Upstairs in my neat little apartment, I still have no messages. My mail contains only credit card offers and my phone bill. Nothing from Malone to indicate he\u2019s interested in me.</p><p>By five o\u2019clock, I\u2019m climbing the walls. I\u2019ve cleaned, baked, dropped in on Chantal at town hall and gone grocery shopping. I\u2019ve read a little, took Colonel to the beach and then brushed his fur afterward. I decide it\u2019s time for a walk.</p><p>Colonel pads after me as we leave the center of our little town. Gideon\u2019s Cove hugs the rocky shore, as the town was founded for shipbuilding purposes. I can see the turret of Christy and Will\u2019s house, the gold-painted cross of St. Mary\u2019s. I head in the opposite direction.</p><p>The air is soft and damp, and while it will probably drop into the low forties tonight, it\u2019s still pretty mild. House lights are on, giving a cozy feel to the neighborhood, and I can smell various meals cooking...the Mastersons are having chicken...something garlicky and delicious at the Ferrises\u2019 house...Stokowskis are having cabbage...Colonel licks his chops and lingers at that driveway.</p><p>We walk uphill, away from the water. Rolly and his wife are sitting on their porch. \u201cHello, Christy, dear,\u201d calls out Mrs. Rolly.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I call back. \u201cIt\u2019s Maggie, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, of course. Christy\u2019s the one with the baby. What was I thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d I answer. \u201cNice night, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Rolly answers. \u201cEnjoy it before the black flies hatch out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou betcha.\u201d</p><p>I turn onto Harbor Street, a neighborhood of cottages and bungalows owned mostly by summer people. The street looks down onto the water, and I can see the boats bobbing there on the tide, the white of the hulls almost glowing in the deepening dusk.</p><p>Feeling like Harriet the Spy (a book I must have read ten times as a kid), I slip into the yard of one such cottage. I know the owners, the Carrolls, since they\u2019re summertime regulars at the diner, and I know they live in Boston. Their house is dark, the curtains drawn. I follow the little walk that goes along the side of the house to the backyard. Shielded by dusk and their row of hedges, I peek at the property that backs up to the Carrolls\u2019. If the listing in the phone book is correct, Malone lives here.</p><p>It\u2019s an ordinary little yard with an oak tree that\u2019s just beginning to bud out. There\u2019s a small back entryway with a couple of garbage cans lined up neatly against the outside wall. A light shines in a window. Suddenly, the door opens, and Malone appears with a bag of trash. He takes the top off the garbage can and drops the bag in, replaces the lid and then goes back into the house. It takes about three seconds.</p><p>Though it\u2019s dusk now, I feel a rush of guilt and embarrassment. Imagine if he caught me, lurking in his neighbors\u2019 yard, stalking him...it\u2019s so high school. Still, I wait a few minutes, hoping to see him again, in the window, maybe, or back out with his recycling. Nothing. No one. A crow caws in a tree. The wind blows, and I shiver. Colonel grows bored and flops down under a tree.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m coming,\u201d I tell him. One last peek. Nothing. I turn around to leave.</p><p>A man is standing an inch from my face. I scream and leap back, my hands fluttering around like a pair of frightened birds. \u201cJesus, Malone! You scared me! God, I didn\u2019t even hear you! Sneaking up on a person like that. Jeez.\u201d I press my hand against my heart, which is thundering like a racehorse on speed. Malone looks at me, and the deepening creases of his face may indicate amusement. Or irritation. Hard to tell. \u201cYou are one quiet guy, Malone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna come in?\u201d he asks, a trace of humor in his gruff voice.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d Now that I no longer fear for my life, it occurs to me that I\u2019ve been busted. \u201cRight. Well. I was, you know, walking. Going for a walk. With Colonel here. And, um, well...here we are. Spying on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry knocking next time,\u201d he says, heading into his yard. After a pause, I follow.</p><p>He holds the door open for me, reaching down to pat Colonel\u2019s head. My dog apparently has a good vibe, because he walks in without pause and begins sniffing. I come in a bit less bravely, and Malone closes the door behind me. I am trapped in his lair.</p><p>We\u2019re in a small kitchen with a little counter along one side. The floor is green linoleum, the counter green Formica, the worst of the 1970s. I try to see everything without being obvious, but I miss the boat, ignoring Malone\u2019s outstretched hand for a second or two too long. I look at it. Does he want to shake hands? Take me somewhere?</p><p>\u201cYour coat?\u201d he says. It takes me a minute to decipher his rumble as human words. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight!

And how long have you lived here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a year.\u201d</p><p>A year. \u201cSo you\u2019ve lived here since?\u201d Damn it. I probably shouldn\u2019t finish that thought?since your cousin screwed you?but I can\u2019t think of anything else to fill the space. \u201cSince a year ago?\u201d</p> <p>Malone just stares eerily back at me, and I look around for Colonel, wanting to know that a friendly face is nearby. Malone finally breaks his vow of silence (and I have to admit, I\u2019m grateful).</p><p>\u201cWant a beer?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cOh, no thanks.\u201d What am I thinking? \u201cActually, yes, please. That would be nice.\u201d My palms are sweating with nerves, and I really hate the fact that I can\u2019t seem to say anything even moderately intelligent. Malone opens the fridge and hands me a Sam Adams.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of refrigerator action, Colonel comes in, wagging hopefully. Malone squats down and pets him. At last, a character reference?he likes my dog.</p><p>\u201cHey, pal,\u201d he says, scratching Colonel\u2019s head. Wow. A two-word sentence. Colonel moans in pleasure, then licks Malone\u2019s hand and walks into the living room. Malone stands up and fixes me with that unwavering blue gaze. Apparently, I am quite fascinating.</p> <p>\u201cIs that your daughter?\u201d I ask, pointing to the fridge. There are a couple of photos there, one of a chubbycheeked toddler eating an apple, another more recent shot of a girl around ten or twelve sitting on a boat, shading her eyes from the sun.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>Back to the one-worders. My frustration and nervousness get the better of me, and I finally blurt, \u201cMalone, let me ask you a question, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nods, a brief jerk of his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you kiss me the other night?\u201d There. Said it. And if my cheeks are now flaming, so what? At least he has to answer.</p><p>\u201cThe usual reasons,\u201d he says, but the lines around his eyes are deeper. He takes a sip of beer, still looking at me.</p><p>\u201cThe usual reasons. Well, that\u2019s funny. Because most times you can tell if someone, you know, likes you. Or is attracted to you. And I never really picked up on that before. With you, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer. A clock on the wall announces the inevitable passage of time...tick...tick...tick. Finally, I\u2019m about ready to jump out of my skin. \u201cCan I look around?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>The living room holds a battered old upright piano with what looks like a pretty hard song. Sonata in A major, it says. Beethoven. Huh. \u201cWho plays the piano?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he grunts.</p><p>\u201cReally? You can play this?\u201d I ask, impressed.</p><p>He comes in and glides a finger over the keys, too softly to make a sound. \u201cNot that well,\u201d he answers.</p><p>He\u2019s standing pretty close to me. Very close. He smells warm, a little like wood smoke. I can see that he must have shaved at some point in the last day or so, because his face doesn\u2019t look as scratchy as the night he kissed me. My eyes fall to his mouth, his full lower lip. So soft. I look away abruptly and take a step back. There\u2019s not much else to see. A TV in the corner, a woodstove in the fireplace. A couch. Coffee table. I could tap dance, I have so much nervous energy flowing through me.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d Malone asks.</p><p>\u201cNo. I had a late lunch. Are you? Am I interrupting dinner? I should probably go.\u201d My heart is thudding away, my eyes feel hot and tight.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>Malone takes my hand. His is warm and smooth and thickly callused. He rubs his thumb gently across the back of my hand and doesn\u2019t say anything more. It seems the nerves in my hand are directly linked to my groin, because things are definitely tingling down there. I swallow and look around. My dog is sleeping in front of the couch.</p><p>Then Malone frowns a little and lifts my hand for a closer look. He makes a little tsking sound, and my jaw tightens.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, my hands are in the water all day long, and then with being near the grill and all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he says, pulling me back into the kitchen. He lets go of my chapped, disgusting claw, opens a cupboard and rummages around. I lean against the counter, miffed. So what? So I have chapped hands. Big deal. A little eczema and everyone gets distraught. Malone takes out a small tin and opens it. Then he scoops out a little bit and rubs it between his palms. I guess my nasty skin has reminded him of the importance of moisturizing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried everything,\u201d I say, looking over his shoulder. \u201cBeeswax, lanolin, Vaseline, Burt\u2019s Bees, Bag Balm...nothing works. I have ugly hands. My cross to bear. Big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have ugly hands,\u201d he chides. It may be the longest sentence I\u2019ve heard him say yet. He takes my hand in his and starts working in the cream. It\u2019s waxy and cool at first, then, after a few seconds, gets pleasantly warm.</p><p>He\u2019s not gentle. Malone rubs my hands hard, pressing deep into the soft parts around my thumb, my palm, the heel. He works every finger, giving attention to each rough cuticle, each reddened knuckle. His eyes are intent on my hands as he works, and his face loses some of its harshness. Those sooty lashes go a long way toward softening his expression.</p><p>\u201cThat feels really nice,\u201d I say, and my voice is husky. His mouth pulls up at one corner as he glances at me. He gently returns my hand to my side and starts on the other one, and I close my eyes against the lovely pressure. My hand feels boneless and small in his, smooth and warm and cherished. When he\u2019s done with the left, he takes both my hands in his, sliding his fingers between mine with a slowness that makes it feel like the most intimate gesture in the world. He gently folds my arms behind my back, making me arch out toward him a little. He waits until I open my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say, and he kisses me then, not letting go of my hands. He kisses gently at first, but with such intensity, like it\u2019s the most important thing in the world that he kiss me just exactly right. And he does. God! His lips are firm and smooth and warm, and he takes his time, kissing and kissing me until I pull my hands free and grip his thick, wavy hair. Then without his lips leaving mine, he lifts me onto the counter and moves closer. His tongue brushes mine, and electricity jolts through me, weakening my limbs. His arms are around me so tightly I can hardly breathe. It\u2019s like being pulled against a granite wall, safe and solid.</p><p>When he pulls back a little, I\u2019m literally panting and it\u2019s hard to focus. His eyes are heavy-lidded, too, his mouth parted.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he rasps.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>Then he kisses me again, lifts me off the counter and carries me into his bedroom.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>I WAKE UP ALONE, roughly twelve hours after I arrived. It\u2019s just starting to get light outside.</p><p>\u201cMalone?\u201d I call out softly. There\u2019s no answer, but Colonel\u2019s head pops up at the side of the bed. \u201cHey, Colonel,\u201d I say, patting him. I get out of bed, pull on my shirt and pants and pad into the kitchen. There\u2019s a note on the table, anchored by the little tin of hand cream.</p><p>Maggie?Coffee\u2019s there if you want it. Take this.</p><p>And that\u2019s it.</p><p>I sigh and flop in the chair. I gather the \u201cthis\u201d in his note is the hand cream, and I take a minute to study my hands. They do feel better than usual, and the redness is a little less, but I still feel mildly disappointed. After changing-your-perspective-on-the-world, mind-altering, life-transforming, earth-moving, sky-shattering sex, it would have been nice to see the other party responsible.</p><p>I realize I\u2019m smiling. Possibly purring. Then, acknowledging that I have to get home for a shower and change of clothes before I go to the diner, I get up to find my socks.</p><p>All that morning, I\u2019m in a great mood. Every now and then, a bit of last night will flash through my head, and I feel quite steamy. A little smile stays on my lips as I flip home fries and pancakes, crack eggs and pour coffee. Malone, I assume, is out checking his traps. Soon he\u2019ll come back. Maybe, for the first time, he\u2019ll come into the diner. Maybe he\u2019ll finally cash in on that piece of pie. Maybe he\u2019ll stare at me as I try to act normal. He might even smile as he drinks his coffee.</p><p>I didn\u2019t see him smile last night, not really. It was dark. But boy, it was?</p><p>\u201cMaggie, love, could I get a spot of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Father Tim,\u201d I call. Now the blush on my cheeks is from guilt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you look rosy this morning! I rang you last night but got your machine.\u201d Tim holds up his cup for me to pour, the move of a regular.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, you know, I think I just felt like going to bed early,\u201d I stammer. It\u2019s not a lie. \u201cYou know, sometimes you just get...and you just...have to go to...bed.\u201d Or get carried to bed, as the case may be, by the incredibly sexy guy who lifts you like you\u2019re a bit of milkweed seed and kisses you like it\u2019s his last act on earth...which, I\u2019m happy to say, it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Father Tim notices my daze. \u201cAre you all together, Maggie? You seem distracted.\u201d</p><p>I glance around the diner. The morning rush is past, Judy is checking lottery numbers and Georgie is whistling in back. I decide that I owe my pal here a little time and sit down. \u201cSorry, Father Tim. How are you?\u201d</p><p>He leans back in his seat. \u201cWell, now, I\u2019m just fine, Maggie,\u201d Father Tim says, and proceeds to tell me about the choir\u2019s latest endeavor. \u201cIt would\u2019ve required divine intervention for them to pull off that Beethoven piece, and it seems that our Lord was busy with other things,\u201d he chuckles.</p><p>Beethoven. Malone plays Beethoven. My cheeks warm, but I force my thoughts back to Father Tim.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m not a proper parishioner, maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re roughly the same age, but I know Father Tim and I have a different relationship. A true friendship. He\u2019s told me all about his family, his childhood, and I\u2019ve reciprocated. I like to think he\u2019s not just a priest with me, but a regular guy, if priests are allowed to be regular guys. Of course, that\u2019s the kind of thinking that leads me into trouble, but even a priest must need to relax around someone once in a while.</p><p>Half an hour later, he leaves the diner. And while I\u2019m always happy for his friendship, it\u2019s something of a revelation that I suddenly have someone else to think of. Even if it\u2019s Malone who barely speaks...at least it\u2019s something. In the space of a night, Father Tim isn\u2019t the only man in town. About time you left My boy alone, I imagine God saying. \u201cSorry,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>I glance at my watch. Jonah usually takes only a couple of hours to check his traps, but I know that Malone is more serious than my brother. He has a lot more traps, too, and further offshore, as well. Still, I hope Malone will make it in today. If he doesn\u2019t, maybe he\u2019ll call.</p><p>By three o\u2019clock, I\u2019m irritated with myself. By five, disgusted. By eight-thirty, I\u2019m mad at Malone, and by ten, I hate him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t drop by the diner. Or my apartment. And he hasn\u2019t called me. I throw myself onto my couch with punishing force.</p><p>It seems I\u2019ve made the mistake of far too many women...assuming that last night meant something. Something more than a physical sensation, that is. Colonel comes over and nudges my feet until I move them, then climbs carefully onto the couch. \u201cNaughty boy,\u201d I tell him automatically, sitting up a little to give him more room.</p><p>What do I really know about Malone? I search my memory, sifting through the reams of gossip that I\u2019ve heard in ten years of diner work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Malone was a few years ahead of me in school...four or five, maybe. I can\u2019t remember us being in high school at the same time, and as my father pointed out, he moved to town at some point during his teenage years. Maybe from Jonesport or Lubec, somewhere north of here. I know he married young, maybe just out of high school. I can\u2019t remember his wife\u2019s name, but I do remember the buzz when she left him.</p><p>I had just taken over the diner, was struggling through a crash course in restaurant management, dealing with things like inventory and ordering and how not to burn people\u2019s food, so I don\u2019t have a clear memory of it. But it was quite a little scandal in our town, and people gossiped about it fiercely. She left while he was away, as I recall. He came home to an empty house, found out that his wife had taken their daughter to Oregon or Washington with another man. There were rumors that Malone had knocked her around, that he couldn\u2019t get joint custody because of it, rumors that she was a lesbian, rumors that she joined a cult. The usual nonsense from a small town.</p><p>Aside from that, I haven\u2019t heard much about dark, silent Malone. He works hard, that\u2019s widely known; first one out, last one back. His haul is usually the largest of the year, despite the fact that he only hires a sternman to help him during the summer and does the rest of the season alone. He is or has been president of the lobstermen\u2019s association around here. Once in a while, the local paper will mention him speaking out against over-regulation and fishing rights, but again, I haven\u2019t paid too much attention. Malone never meant anything to me, other than being the slightly scary guy who gave me a ride last year.</p><p>\u201cWe know he\u2019s great in the sack,\u201d I tell Colonel. \u201cAnd that he doesn\u2019t know how to use a telephone.\u201d</p> <p>As irritated with myself as I am with Malone, I pace around the apartment. I put the TV on, then turn it off. Maybe I\u2019ll paint my toenails, I think, then immediately dismiss the idea, as it takes patience and I have none. Time for Christy. I snatch up the phone and hit speed dial. \u201cHi, it\u2019s me,\u201d I say. \u201cHey, I was just, you know, reading this book about a woman who\u2019s sleeping with this guy, and the sex is really good and she thinks it means something, but he never calls her. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...do you mean about the plot or...\u201d</p><p>I choke. \u201cShit! Father Tim! I\u2019m sorry! I thought I hit the button for my sister...\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cNot to worry, Maggie, not to worry.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIt sounds like your book makes another strong case for marriage first, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I flush with guilt. \u201cOh, I guess. It\u2019s just that that hardly happens anymore. Waiting for marriage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd no doubt that explains why the divorce rate is so terribly high. More people should be like you, Maggie. Willing to wait to get to know someone before rushing into a purely physical relationship.\u201d</p><p>I grimace, so very, very glad that Father Tim can\u2019t see my face. \u201cSometimes,\u201d I say, trying to get it through my thick head, \u201cyou feel such a strong attraction to someone that you think it must be a sign.\u201d</p><p>He pauses. \u201cI...I really wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d His voice is gentle.</p><p>\u201cOf course not! I\u2019m sorry...It\u2019s just that sometimes...you know what? Forget it. I was just thinking of someone?well, this person in the book.\u201d I stop talking, picturing Father Tim at home, maybe in his bedroom (not that I\u2019ve ever seen it), his kind and laughing eyes, his ready smile. \u201cFather Tim,\u201d I ask tentatively, \u201cdo you ever wonder if you made the right choice? You must get so lonely sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Father Tim is quiet for a moment. \u201cWell, sure, of course. Don\u2019t we all? Of course I sometimes think about what life would have held had I not been called to the priesthood.\u201d</p><p>I sit up straighter. \u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, now.\u201d His voice is wistful. \u201cIt\u2019s a common enough complaint in my vocation, loneliness is. Every once in a while, I find myself picturing what it would be like to have a wife, a few children...\u201d His voice trails off.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I breathe, afraid that saying more will break the intimacy of the moment, simultaneously thrilled and horrified to get this glimpse behind the curtain, as it were. To see the great Oz revealed.</p><p>\u201cBut those thoughts are fleeting,\u201d he says, his voice stronger. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s like dreaming you\u2019re the president or an astronaut. I love the life I have as a priest, and those daydreams are just that...bits of fluff that pass right out of my head.\u201d</p><p>Moment over. \u201cI guess it\u2019s only human to wonder,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd you know, Father Tim, even if you don\u2019t have, you know, a family...well, we all love you here in Gideon\u2019s Cove. You\u2019re a wonderful priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Maggie,\u201d he says gently. \u201cYou have a gift of making people feel very special. You know that, I hope.\u201d</p><p>I smile, feel a warm squeeze in my chest. \u201cThanks, Father Tim,\u201d I half whisper.</p><p>After we hang up, I go into the bathroom and look at myself in the mirror. I like my face. It\u2019s not beautiful, not really, but it\u2019s nice enough. Pretty. A pleasing, friendly face. And to hear Father Tim confide in me, tell me I have a gift...well. I like my face even more. Of course, Christy\u2019s face is exactly like mine, but that\u2019s a minor detail.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at the door, and I jump.</p> <p>It\u2019s Malone, his face as cheerful as the angel of death. Irritation, nervousness and attraction flutter around in my chest as I open the door. \u201cHi,\u201d I say. \u201cHey. How are you, Malone? Oh, what a nice night, isn\u2019t it? I thought maybe it was raining.\u201d</p><p>He stands there, looking at me as if assessing my babble, then deigns to speak. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I echo in full idiot mode. \u201cSo. Want to come in?\u201d</p><p>He steps inside, immediately making my apartment seem even smaller than it is. Colonel slips off the couch and comes over to greet my guest, wagging gently. \u201cHey, boy,\u201d Malone says, bending down to pet Colonel\u2019s head. Colonel licks his hand and goes to his doggy bed in the corner and begins his nightly ritual?five turns in a tight circle, followed by intensive sniffing, followed by the actual lying down. I watch him intently so as not to have to look at Malone, who is staring at me. Don\u2019t say anything, Maggie. Let him go first. Keep your mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you a beer or some coffee or something, Malone?\u201d I ask. My inner self rolls her eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Malone says.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, um, do you want to take off your coat?\u201d</p><p>He takes it off and hangs it on a hook. The silence stretches on.</p><p>\u201cSo, Malone, what are you doing here?\u201d I ask. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a little late. Almost eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see you,\u201d he says, and there\u2019s a softening around his mouth. My stomach squeezes gently in response. God, I\u2019m such a slut.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know, Malone, I do have a phone. And I am in the book. Maybe you could call next time.\u201d My prissy tone doesn\u2019t fool me; even now, I\u2019m kind of hoping he\u2019ll take me on the kitchen table. He steps closer, and my heart rate kicks up. Oh, yes, the table...</p><p>\u201cLine was busy,\u201d he murmurs, his scraping voice sending tremors to my joints.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh. Yes. Yes. That\u2019s right. I was...on the...you know...the phone.\u201d</p><p>He takes my hands in his and pulls me closer, studying my mouth. I can feel the heat from his body, smell his soap and laundry detergent and a faint, salty smell. Resisting a strong urge to lick his neck, I swallow. \u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d he asks, just when I want him to kiss me the way he did last night. He raises an eyebrow, waiting.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Excuse me, I mean?\u201d My voice is tight.</p><p>\u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...I?well, I think it was Father Tim.\u201d</p><p>Malone\u2019s eyes meet mine.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know, I\u2019m on all these committees and stuff. At church. Church committees.\u201d</p><p>His eyes return to my mouth, his tangled lashes lowering. Lashes like that are just not fair. \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>\u201cMalone,\u201d I whisper hoarsely, then clear my throat. \u201cYou think you could drop the chitchat and kiss me?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>SO WHEN I wake up in the morning, alone again, I really have no one to blame but myself. I\u2019m as clueless as I was yesterday. Perhaps I should make a list and mail it to him, because that man does something to my brain. Things to Ask Malone. 1. Are we seeing each other or just sleeping together? 2. Do you like me at all, or is this just a physical thing? (Unfortunately, I suspect the latter...at least on my part.)3. Can you tell me about yourself so I don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re a total stranger? 4. Why don\u2019t you ever come into the diner?</p><p>Oddly enough, it\u2019s the last thing that bothers me the most. The diner is a surprising little treasure in Gideon\u2019s Cove. For the first few years that I ran it, I worked a second job over at the hospital, filing medical records from four until ten each night so that I could sink some money into the diner. It took me almost four years to completely restore it. I pulled up the linoleum that Granddad put down over the tile floors, painstakingly retiling the areas that needed it, scouring the grout with bleach until my hands were raw. Reupholstering the seats in their original red vinyl took some money, and I had to buy the bigger oven so that I could bake all the homemade goodies that we\u2019re now known for. I\u2019d like Malone to see it, to have that pie that I promised him.</p><p>Chantal comes in for lunch, something she does every Thursday, and because Judy is in a rare mood and actually working, I sit down and have lunch with the resident expert on the men of Gideon\u2019s Cove.</p><p>\u201cThese fries are the best in town,\u201d she says, popping another curly, spiced delicacy into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThe only fries in town,\u201d I correct her with a smile. When Chantal\u2019s not busy seducing some man (or any man), she can be quite pleasant.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go to Dewey\u2019s tonight?\u201d she asks. \u201cI could use a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...well, no, I\u2019d better not. I have stuff to do.\u201d It\u2019s true. Laundry. Bills. Possibly Malone. And speaking of tall, dark and not exactly handsome, I risk a question.</p><p>\u201cChantal, remember how you were telling me I should check out Malone?\u201d I blush and take a bite of my cheeseburger to cover.</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ, I wasn\u2019t serious,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s all wrong for you. Not husband material at all, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I know that.\u201d I don\u2019t, actually, but for some reason, I don\u2019t want to admit to my...whatever it is that Malone and I are doing together. \u201cNo, I was just wondering if you ever...you know. Hooked up with him,\u201d I ask, dreading the answer.</p><p>Chantal sucks up some milkshake through her straw, managing to look quite p**n ographic as she does, something I\u2019m sure she practices. \u201cNope. I haven\u2019t. Not yet, I should say, and not for lack of trying, mind you,\u201d she says easily.</p><p>My shoulders drop in relief and, I admit, pleasure. \u201cHe turned you down?\u201d I ask, surprised?Chantal could fill the bleacher seats at Fenway with the men she\u2019s entertained.</p><p>\u201cWell, sort of. I mean, I flirt with him, because he really is pretty hot in that ugly guy way, but he just kind of smiles and drinks his beer. I think he\u2019s g*y.\u201d</p><p>Doubt that. \u201cHe smiles?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe not. But there was this thing once, long time ago now, back when we were still in school...\u201d She stops and drops her eyes, her thickly mascaraed lashes shielding her expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was nothing. I gave him a ride. Someone had roughed him up...this must\u2019ve been when I was a senior, because I was driving my dad\u2019s Camaro, I remember, and Malone was out walking by the blueberry plant, and I pulled over and drove him home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d This little nugget of history fascinates me, picturing Malone as a youth. \u201cDid he say what happened or anything? Did you guys talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I remember,\u201d Chantal answers, chewing thoughtfully on a fry. \u201cI just gave him some tissues for his lip, because it was bleeding. For a while, I thought he might have had a crush on me...you know, we had this little secret between us, and he was a year or so behind me in school, but nothing ever came of it.\u201d She drains the last of her milkshake. \u201cStill, that brooding thing he\u2019s got going on is pretty steamy. Don\u2019t you think? Or, no, I forgot. You like them all sunshine and light and goodness. And speaking of, there goes Father What-a-Waste.\u201d Chantal\u2019s voice drops to an unmistakable purr as Father Tim walks past, throwing us a wave and a smile as he goes about his business. \u201cGod, he\u2019s delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now. You know he doesn\u2019t like us to talk like that,\u201d I say primly.</p><p>\u201cMmm. But he is, isn\u2019t he?\u201d she purrs, smiling widely.</p> <p>I laugh, unable to resist. \u201cYes. He is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI SLEPT WITH Malone,\u201d I tell my sister later that day.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she shrieks, dropping the baby\u2019s plastic bottle. \u201cJesus, Maggie! Give a person a little warning here!\u201d</p><p>Being the one with the news packs a certain wallop. It\u2019s definitely been Christy\u2019s life that has grabbed the most headlines, aside from my own embarrassing forays into the Catholic church. And so dropping this choice little nugget is, I admit, incredibly satisfying.</p><p>It\u2019s showering outside, a gentle, nourishing rain that patters in the gutters and against the lead-paned windows of Christy\u2019s house, deepening the three inches of mud that already blankets the great outdoors. Violet is sleeping, Christy is tidying, I\u2019m lounging.</p> <p>Christy sits down across from me and takes a sip of her now-cold tea. \u201cLet me warm this up,\u201d she says, sticking her mug in the microwave and pressing some buttons. \u201cI want to hear every detail. And Violet better not wake up, because she\u2019s going to have to wait.\u201d</p><p>I tell her, starting with the kiss when he drove me home and ending with waking up alone this morning.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she sighs. \u201cThis is...wow. And I have to say, I told you so. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. Well done.\u201d I salute her with my mug.</p><p>\u201cSo...Malone. He\u2019s really...well, what\u2019s he like? What do you guys talk about?\u201d</p><p>I blush. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. Of course, it\u2019s only been a couple of days. We haven\u2019t talked much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Christy purrs. \u201cSo. Okay. He\u2019s sexy, we knew that. I love the scruffy ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d I ask. Will is quite tidy and clean-shaven.</p><p>\u201cYou always want what you don\u2019t have,\u201d she tells me with a wink. \u201cMore about Malone, please. What else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, we covered the great in bed part. Incredible kisser. Doesn\u2019t talk much. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d I sigh. \u201cHe really hardly talks at all, Christy.\u201d I frown and trace the rim of my cup. \u201cTo tell you the truth. I\u2019m sleeping with a guy I really don\u2019t know very well. It\u2019s a little slutty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how he makes you feel?\u201d Christy asks, mirroring my frown with one of her own.</p><p>I think about that. \u201cNo. He makes me feel...beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Christy\u2019s frown morphs into a smile. \u201cOh...that\u2019s nice,\u201d she sighs. \u201cBeautiful is good.\u201d</p><p>I smile, too. \u201cYes, it is. I just wish...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I just wish he was more...talkative. More like...\u201d I wince but tell my sister the truth. \u201cMore like Father Tim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I for one am glad he\u2019s not,\u201d Christy chides. \u201cFather Tim is a?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. Save it. What I meant was, I wish Malone would just...open up a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will, Mags, he will,\u201d Christy assures me, not that she has any authority over Malone. \u201cYou know how they grew up, the Malone kids,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t,\u201d I say. First Chantal had something on him, now my own sister. Does everyone know more about Malone than I do?</p><p>\u201cOh, no? Well, it?\u201d she pauses, considering. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHis sister was in our class, dummy,\u201d Christy informs me. \u201cAllie Malone. Don\u2019t you remember? She was shy, black hair like Malone\u2019s...pretty quiet.\u201d</p><p>I wrack my brain for some recall. \u201cOh, okay, okay. God, I hardly remember her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo wrapped up in Skip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. True. So tell me what you know,\u201d I prod.</p><p>Christy takes another sip of her tea. \u201cWell, I never went over there or anything,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t exactly remember how much she told me and how much was just what the kids said. But we were lab partners junior year, and we were kind of friendly.\u201d</p><p>She stiffens as Violet rolls over, the rustling clearly audible over the monitor, but when no coo or cry follows, she goes on. \u201cI guess the father was abusive. I don\u2019t think sexually, thank God. But there was definitely some bad stuff. The police came once, I remember Allie talking about that. She was crying in the bathroom one day and told me that her brother and father both spent the night in jail...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYikes,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cSo, anyway, I really don\u2019t know more than that. She went away to Boston and we never really kept in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever hear that Malone hit his wife?\u201d</p><p>Christy frowns. \u201cNo. I never did. He\u2019s not?you know, rough or anything, is he, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. No, no.\u201d My cheeks grow hot. \u201cNot rough at all...just...intense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you could see your face right now,\u201d my sister says, laughing.</p><p>\u201cListen, don\u2019t tell anyone about this, okay? About Malone and me. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re actually seeing each other...we\u2019re just...I don\u2019t know....\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck buddies?\u201d Christy laughs.</p><p>\u201cChristy! No! Oh, hell, maybe.\u201d I can\u2019t help laughing, too.</p><p>\u201cCan you imagine what Mom would say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to think about that,\u201d I answer truthfully. Mother is not one to be sympathetic to hormonal urges. Young people today are so trashy, she\u2019s fond of saying. Don\u2019t they have any self-respect? Even if Malone and I had a real relationship, he\u2019s not exactly what Mom has in mind for me. Why can\u2019t you meet a doctor, Maggie? Or a lawyer? Or maybe that Microsoft executive on Douglas Point? If you\u2019d just clean yourself up a little, you\u2019d be quite presentable, you know. You need to stop lighting your fire under a bushel.</p><p>At this moment, my niece lets out a coo over the monitor, signaling the end of her nap. Christy gets up and goes upstairs, and I sit at the table, mulling over what she\u2019s told me.</p><p>I stay to play with Violet, rolling on the floor with her, encouraging her to grab the little moose puppet Jonah gave her at birth. She finally does, and Christy and I cheer as the genius baby stuffs an antler into her drooling mouth and chews on it. Christy convinces me to stay for supper, and I do, drinking in their domesticity and happiness.</p><p>On my way home, I try to imagine Malone acting like Will, laughing, pulling me onto his lap the way Will does to Christy, kissing his baby and practically leaping at the chance to change her diaper. I can\u2019t. Malone doesn\u2019t inspire thoughts of husband and father.</p><p>So what are you doing with him, Maggie? Mom\u2019s voice asks in my head. Killing time until the real thing comes along? Or just scratching an itch?</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t want to answer those questions, but I have a long time to think about them. Malone doesn\u2019t come over that night. He doesn\u2019t call, either. And I don\u2019t call him.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>\u201cSO, MAGGIE, how\u2019s the quest going?\u201d Father Tim asks me as I pour him some coffee.</p><p>\u201cThe man quest?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cAre you on any other kind?\u201d he quips, raising his eyebrows with mock sincerity.</p><p>\u201cOh, how cutting! And you a priest. Tsk, tsk.\u201d I glance around the diner?pretty full, since it\u2019s raining hard outside, and people love to go out for breakfast when it\u2019s raining. \u201cThe quest is on hold at the moment, Father Tim,\u201d I answer. \u201cWhen the time is right, yadda yadda. What can I get you this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have the special, Maggie. Sounds lovely.\u201d</p><p>The special is French toast made with homemade sweet almond bread and soaked in a peach glaze. It is lovely, and an original recipe, and if I could get a restaurant critic out here, I\u2019m sure he or she would love it. \u201cYou got it,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBacon with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me well,\u201d he smiles.</p><p>\u201cMmm, yes, and I know you\u2019d better get your cholesterol checked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful friend,\u201d he says, and unexpectedly, he takes my hand and pats it, looking up at me. And though I have a coffeepot in my other hand and he\u2019s wearing his priest clothes, there\u2019s something very...marriage proposal about our little tableau. For one second, that sense of longing and rightness I always get around Father Tim hits home, and I feel my face grow hot.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say. \u201cRight back at you.\u201d To hide my discomfort, I glance out the window and freeze. Malone is standing in front of the diner, and with him is a woman. A beautiful woman. A young, gorgeous, wow kind of woman. She\u2019s laughing, and he\u2019s smiling. He\u2019s smiling! A baseball cap shields his face against the rain so his expression isn\u2019t completely clear, but yes, that is a smile, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>Father Tim releases my hand, and I smile automatically at him. When I glance up, Malone\u2019s smile is gone, and he\u2019s looking at me. The lines that slash down his face are emphasized from the lights in the diner. Is he angry? He says something to Miss Universe, and without so much as a wave, they continue on their way, away from Joe\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is his problem?\u201d I mutter. My face is burning. Suddenly I feel quite grimy in my worn jeans and the sweater with the coffee stain on the left wrist. Who cares? I ask myself, but my heart feels tight.</p><p>\u201cAh, Louise, love,\u201d Father Tim calls, \u201ccome and keep a lonely priest company.\u201d Louise, a middle-aged widow, wrestles her umbrella inside the door.</p><p>\u201cBack in a flash, Father Tim,\u201d I say as the kitchen bell dings. I get to work, bringing Father Tim and Louise breakfast, chatting up Georgie, exchanging diner slang with Stuart, bussing tables and wiping up spills. But my thoughts stay with Malone. Who was that woman? I\u2019ve never seen her before...and truthfully, I never want to again.</p><p>I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever seen Malone with a woman, though surely he hasn\u2019t been without female company since his wife left him all those years ago. But still. Smiling with that young, beautiful creature...It stings. It\u2019s been three days since I last saw him. During that time, he hasn\u2019t called me or stopped by once. Not once. So I\u2019m forced to think that yes, indeed, any connection we have is purely physical.</p><p>I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019ve been feeling a bit conflicted. It seems wrong, somehow, to have these intense physical reactions to Malone when I don\u2019t even know his first name. My mother\u2019s voice keeps floating through my head?When are you going to find someone decent to marry? Why can\u2019t you settle down with someone like Will?</p><p>My protestations to my mother that I\u2019m trying fall on deaf ears. I\u2019m not succeeding, and as she so ruthlessly points out, the years are passing. Of course I\u2019d love to settle down with someone like Will. Someone who found me delightful and couldn\u2019t wait to come home to me, someone who loved children and wanted a couple. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Malone is not that guy. After all, there he is out with Maine\u2019s answer to Catherine Zeta-Jones. If he finds me delightful, it\u2019s only in the sack. The only time we\u2019ve spent when we weren\u2019t all over each other like black flies on tourists was the evening he rescued me from the Skipmonster. There was no joy in Mudville that day, that\u2019s for sure. No happy exchange of information took place there, no laughter, nothing other than some primal attraction. It\u2019s not enough. Especially if he\u2019s primally attracted to more than one woman at a time, damn it.</p><p>Father Tim is right?people shouldn\u2019t jump into bed with people they don\u2019t know well. Because this is what happens. You make a fool of yourself with someone who doesn\u2019t even care about you, and then you still have to live in the same town.</p><p>It\u2019s not enough, I repeat to myself as I refill coffee mugs and bring out breakfasts. I want more.</p><p>CHANTAL CALLS ME a day or so later. We\u2019re both suffering from varying degrees of cabin fever induced by three days of rain. Malone hasn\u2019t called me. Bastard. I remind myself that I don\u2019t want him to call. \u201cSure, I\u2019d love to go out,\u201d I tell her. We agree to meet at Dewey\u2019s for a few drinks. Knowing my low alcohol tolerance, I opt to walk, even though it\u2019s still raining steadily.</p> <p>I\u2019ve decided that Malone is an indiscretion created by too many months unrelieved by human contact from a nonfamily member. Aside from Georgie and Colonel, Malone is the only male who\u2019s touched me outside of Dad, Jonah and Will. I probably would have humped the eighty-year-old double amputee if I\u2019d gone much longer.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dewey,\u201d I call as I hang up my slicker.</p><p>\u201cHi, Maggie,\u201d he calls. Without my asking, he pours me a glass of wine and brings it over to the booth where Chantal and I usually sit. \u201cThat nice Chantal joining you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not nice, Dewey,\u201d I say, taking the glass. \u201cShe\u2019s a wicked, wicked woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it,\u201d he sighs. My laugh lands somewhere between irritation and amusement. Does every man in town under the age of one hundred and two have to be so damn smitten with Chantal? Do I have to be everyone\u2019s surrogate daughter?</p> <p>The red-haired temptress comes in, h*ps swaying, blouse revealing, lest anyone forget just how stacked she is. \u201cHi, Paul,\u201d she sighs, rubbing past him as if we were trapped on a crowded subway car instead of in a nearly empty bar. \u201cPaul, sweetie, could you bring me a martini, hon? Make it a cosmo, okay? My friend and I haven\u2019t seen each other in ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure have a gift with men,\u201d I observe dryly as Paul hurtles to the bar to do her bidding.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d she says, batting her eyelashes. \u201cMan, this rain! I\u2019m climbing the walls! Tell me what\u2019s new with you.\u201d</p><p>I wrack my brain for something I wish to tell her and come up empty. \u201cNot much. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I had the most incredible sex the other night,\u201d she purrs.</p><p>Me too, I almost say, then chide myself. That was just a fling, Maggie! Stop thinking about him. \u201cOh. Well. That\u2019s very nice. Good for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGuess with who?\u201d She leans forward, her beautiful dark eyes mischievous.</p><p>There\u2019s a strange sinking feeling in my chest, like I swallowed a rock. \u201cI?I don\u2019t know, Chantal. Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalone?\u201d I say, my throat tight.</p><p>She leans back in the booth. \u201cMalone? No. Not Malone.\u201d</p><p>Oh, thank God. I let out a deep breath. \u201cUm...Dewey?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cNo, not Dewey. That was just once, a couple of years ago, before he put on all that weight.\u201d She drums her fingers on the table. \u201cAny more guesses?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cIt better not be Jonah,\u201d I warn.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, not your precious baby brother,\u201d she answers. \u201cYou suck at guessing, so I\u2019ll just have to tell you. Mickey Tatum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fire chief?\u201d I blurt.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. You know what they say about firemen,\u201d she smiles. \u201cAnd it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>I look away. \u201cActually, Chantal, I don\u2019t know what they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we not do this twenty questions thing? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d she implores. \u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>Paul brings Chantal her drink, peeks down her lowcut, lacy blouse, squeezes her shoulder and leaves. She looks at me expectantly, smiling.</p><p>\u201cFiremen do it hotter?\u201d I guess resignedly.</p><p>\u201cNo, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...firemen have longer hoses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But that does seem to be the case.\u201d She takes a sip of her pink drink. \u201cGuess again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know, Chantal. Please stop making me guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey still know how to use a split lay.\u201d Chantal laughs merrily.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d I say, laughing in spite of myself. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, okay. But I joined the fire department, so say hello to the newest member of Gideon\u2019s Cove\u2019s bravest.\u201d</p><p>Chantal launches into far too much detail about Mickey Tatum, who must be sixty if he\u2019s a day. As he was my CCD teacher the year I made my confirmation, I\u2019m not really comfortable hearing this. But Chantal is entertaining, that\u2019s for sure. The bar grows fuller. Jonah comes in and waves, but he\u2019s with a pretty young woman and can\u2019t be bothered with his sister tonight. Some of his pals are there, Stevie, and Ray, who coowns the boat with Jonah. The regulars.</p><p>Chantal and I are discussing a movie we both want to see when Malone walks in, alone. No Zeta-Jones tonight. Good. He hangs up his coat, then glances around, sees me, and gives a little jerk of his chin. My smile turns to stone. That\u2019s it? A chin jerk?</p><p>\u201cOh, Malone just came in,\u201d Chantal says. She\u2019s been documenting the arrival of every man here. \u201cLet\u2019s make him sit with us.\u201d She slides out of her seat.</p><p>\u201cNo, no! You know what? Let\u2019s not. Let\u2019s just have, you know, girls night. Okay? No guys. Chantal?\u201d But she\u2019s already gone up to the bar. She slides her hand across Malone\u2019s back and says something. I pretend to fumble in my purse for something, hoping he doesn\u2019t think I sent her over. Damn. Malone smiles at her, a little, anyway, and I\u2019m embarrassed at a sudden longing to have him smile at me, then immediately disgusted with myself for feeling that way. This is the guy who slept with you and ignored you, Maggie. The guy who may also be sleeping with someone prettier and younger than you. Ignore him back. Say nothing. I mean it.</p><p>\u201cOkay if Malone joins us?\u201d Chantal asks, slipping back into the booth, graceful and lithe as a snake. Malone sits down next to her, his face grim and lined?normal, in other words.</p><p>\u201cSure. I don\u2019t care,\u201d I say. \u201cSit wherever you like. You can sit anywhere, right? Free country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalone,\u201d Chantal says in her man-seduction voice, a lower, sexier tone that she saves for the X-Y chromosomers. \u201cMaggie and I were just talking about you the other day.\u201d Damn her. She turns to him to offer him a view of her br**sts, but he\u2019s staring at me. My jaw grows tight and I take a slug of wine. Malone tips his head to the side slightly, and there might be a little upward movement to one corner of his mouth. His knee brushes mine under the table, and a prickle of lust creeps up my thigh.</p><p>Chantal puts her hand on Malone\u2019s bicep, and I can just about feel it, too, that solid, bulging, rock-hard?\u201cMaggie was wondering if you\u2019re g*y,\u201d she purrs.</p><p>\u201cJesus! Chantal! I was not!\u201d I look at Malone. The hint of smile is gone. \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you, Malone? You don\u2019t seem to like girls. I mean, if you\u2019ve passed over me and Maggie...\u201d</p><p>I try to come up with an expression that will hide my embarrassment and advertise my indignation. I fail miserably.</p><p>\u201cSo, Malone, are you?\u201d</p><p>Malone finally decides to speak, a decision not reached lightly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t like women?\u201d Chantal persists. I psychically?and ineffectually?order her to shut the hell up. \u201cAre you just sort of asexual, Malone?\u201d</p><p>An image of Malone on top of me flashes through my head. I believe the fading hickey just below my collarbone can prove he\u2019s not exactly asexual. At the thought, my knees start with that watery, wiggly feeling. I gulp down some wine.</p><p>\u201cI like some women,\u201d he says, still looking at me. I believe my name has just been removed from his list, judging from the ice in his eyes. My cheeks are on fire, much to my disgust. Chantal, at least, is too busy thrusting her prowlike bosom into Malone\u2019s arm to notice my discomfort.</p><p>\u201cWell, too bad Maggie and I aren\u2019t your type,\u201d she pouts.</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d he agrees, then turns to look at her, dropping his gaze to her obvious charms.</p><p>You know, I kind of hate him at that moment. Make that both of them. Actually, there\u2019s no \u201ckind of\u201d about it. I drain my wine and look away. If he wants to make me feel inadequate, he\u2019s doing a great job.</p><p>At that moment, a cry goes up from the bar, and a most welcome cry at that. \u201cFather Tim!\u201d</p><p>The cavalry has arrived. He shakes hands, claps a few backs, then sees me, and bless his dear Irish heart, his face lights up. As he makes his way across the now-packed bar, I can\u2019t help the wave of pride I feel. Out of everyone here, he picks me as a seat mate.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, how are you, love?\u201d he asks happily. \u201cAnd Chantal, too, what a treat.\u201d He\u2019s wearing civvies?a beautiful knit sweater, made by his sainted mother, no doubt, and jeans. Yes, jeans. The look is Catholic Rugged, and nicely done. I smile widely and scooch over to make just enough room for him to sit down. I hope Malone notices. I shoot him a glance. Yup. He does, giving the words thunderous expression new clarity. My smile grows even more.</p><p>\u201cHello, there,\u201d Father Tim says to Malone. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had the pleasure. Tim O\u2019Halloran. Father Tim, in case you missed that.\u201d He winks at me and extends his hand.</p><p>\u201cMalone.\u201d Tall, Dark and Scowling shakes Father Sunshine\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cAh, a fine Irish name! Is that your first name or your last?\u201d Father Tim asks. See, Malone? I think. This is how people talk.</p><p>\u201cLast,\u201d Malone grunts.</p><p>\u201cAnd your first name? Sorry, I didn\u2019t catch it.\u201d</p><p>Chantal intervenes. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t use it, Father Tim. It\u2019s a local legend. He\u2019s just listed on the tax registers as plain old M. Malone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s all right. Are you Irish, Malone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>For heaven\u2019s sake! To break the awkward pause, I jump in. \u201cHow are you, Father Tim?\u201d I ask. \u201cWould you like a beer?\u201d Paul Dewey appears at our side.</p><p>\u201cI think the weather calls for something a bit stiffer,\u201d Father Tim says. Chantal raises her eyebrows at me. Stiffer, she mouths. My jaw clenches. Luckily, Father Tim doesn\u2019t see her. \u201cHow about an Irish whiskey, Dewey, my fine man?\u201d</p><p>Malone is staring at the table, which somehow avoids turning into a puddle of black tar. He lifts his gaze suddenly to mine, and I turn instantly to Father Tim.</p><p>\u201cSo how did the funeral go in Milbridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a sad affair, Maggie, quite sad. Thanks for asking. You\u2019re very kind.\u201d</p><p>I nod compassionately and give Malone a satisfied glance.</p><p>\u201cYou were such a comfort to me the other night, Father Tim,\u201d Chantal says, widening her doelike eyes. \u201cAt bereavement group,\u201d she explains to me. Malone shoots her a look. \u201cI lost my husband some time ago,\u201d she reminds him. \u201cAnd dear Father Tim has been very helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to hear it, Chantal,\u201d Father Tim murmurs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I bite my lip. Helpful, my ass. I know?and Chantal knows I know?that she\u2019s there for voyeuristic purposes only. She gives me a look and smirks. Meanwhile, Dewey brings the whiskey, and Father Tim takes a deep sip.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing for a night like tonight,\u201d he says appreciatively, taking another. \u201cSo, Malone, is it? Malone, what do you do for a living?\u201d Father Tim grins his beautiful smile, and I find myself smiling sappily back at him.</p><p>\u201cLobsterman,\u201d Malone says tersely.</p><p>\u201cAh, a fine profession indeed. And have you got a wife and children?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you married, then?\u201d Father Tim asks, looking around the room.</p><p>\u201cDivorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a shame, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Father Tim leans back in the booth, his arm pressed against mine. \u201cA terrible shame for the children. It ruins their world, doesn\u2019t it now?\u201d</p><p>Malone\u2019s mouth is rapidly disappearing in a tight line, and his jaw looks ready to pop. He doesn\u2019t answer.</p> <p>\u201cMaggie, tell me, how did that seafood lasagna go over yesterday?\u201d Father Tim asks, and again, I glance at Malone, hoping to impress upon him that there are people out there interested in more than my girl parts.</p><p>\u201cIt was really good, Father Tim. Thank you so much for asking. I had some left over, but I brought it to Mrs. Kandinsky. I\u2019ll be sure to save you some next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re a generous girl.\u201d He smiles at me, that irascible lock of hair dropping over his forehead. It\u2019s all I can do not to smooth it back. \u201cSo how do you know Malone here, Maggie?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I look at Malone a long minute. I know him biblically, Father, I answer silently. \u201cHe moors next to Jonah,\u201d I say out loud. Malone stares back.</p><p>\u201cAnd does he know about your little situation?\u201d the priest murmurs.</p><p>\u201cWhich situation?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cHow you\u2019re looking for a nice man to marry?\u201d</p><p>Shit! Hopefully, Malone didn\u2019t catch that. His scowl tells me otherwise. Ears like a bat, that Malone. Chantal speaks up. \u201cFather Tim, honey, I was wondering how a poor widow like myself, or a nice girl like Maggie, should meet some new people. Because just between the two of us?well, the four of us,\u201d she amends, leaning forward, her cle**age clamoring for release, \u201cwe women have certain needs. Desires. And it\u2019s so hard to meet anyone really decent. I mean, a roll in the hay is one thing, but finding a husband is another. Right, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll go say hello to Jonah,\u201d I blurt, ignoring the terror in Father Tim\u2019s eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t see him today. I\u2019ll just go check in with him. See how he\u2019s doing. If he needs anything.\u201d</p><p>I practically fly across the room to my brother, but it\u2019s no use. Malone is right behind me.</p><p>\u201cMaggie,\u201d he says. \u201cListen.\u201d His voice is very quiet, just a bare rumble of distant thunder, and I can barely hear him. He pauses. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s been visiting,\u201d he finally says.</p><p>\u201cHey, no problem,\u201d I answer. \u201cYou can do whatever you want. See whoever you?what did you say?\u201d</p><p>He frowns. \u201cMy daughter. Emory. She was visiting for April break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat?that was your daughter?\u201d The woman I saw him with had to be twenty-three, twenty-four at least. Didn\u2019t she?</p> <p>\u201cAyuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is she?\u201d I demand. Bob Castellano pushes past me with an apologetic pat on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSeventeen,\u201d Malone answers, a black eyebrow rising.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s seventeen? Your daughter is seventeen?\u201d</p><p>He scowl deepens. \u201cWhy, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how old are you, Malone?\u201d My face burns painfully.</p><p>\u201cThirty-six.\u201d</p><p>I do the math...so he was nineteen when his kid was born. Huh. Okay. I guess that fits, given the little I know about Malone.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d you think she was?\u201d</p><p>It takes me a second to realize I\u2019ve been busted. I risk a look at Malone\u2019s face and wish I hadn\u2019t. \u201cYou know what?\u201d I babble. \u201cThere\u2019s Jonah! I think I\u2019ll go say hi to Jonah.\u201d I gesture to my brother, who is making out with the pretty woman from before. \u201cActually, I guess I\u2019ll hit the loo.\u201d And I flee.</p><p>In the safety of the bathroom, I lean against the sink and take a few cleansing breaths. God, what a stew of emotions out there! No wonder my hands are shaking. I\u2019m mad, frustrated, horny (let\u2019s be honest), guilt-ridden and irritated. I look at my reflection in the mirror. My face is flushed, my hair lank from the humidity. Why does Chantal look like a dew-kissed apricot when I look like a drowned rat? I wet some paper towels and press them against my cheeks.</p><p>Malone could have saved me a little trouble with a phone call, couldn\u2019t he? I ask myself. Hey, my daughter\u2019s in town, and I\u2019ll be a little busy. But no. We don\u2019t have that kind of relationship. We don\u2019t have any relationship. He can\u2019t even pick up the phone to tell me something simple like Catherine Zeta-Jones is his child. For heaven\u2019s sake.</p><p>A little voice in my head wonders if he\u2019s telling the truth. During the brief time I was at his house, I didn\u2019t see any pictures of a beautiful young woman, did I? No, there were just pictures of a little girl. No seventeen-year-olds. And frankly, the woman I saw last week looked older than that to me.</p><p>Well. If he says she\u2019s his daughter, she probably is...after all, in a small town like Gideon\u2019s Cove, that would be a pretty big lie to pull off. The thing is, it doesn\u2019t matter, does it? Emory?cool name, if I cared to think about it?doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the lack of communication between her dear old dad and me. I\u2019m a roll in the hay as far as Malone is concerned.</p><p>I wish I could meld Father Tim and Malone into one. Malone\u2019s sex appeal and single status, Father Tim\u2019s everything else. Well, maybe a few more things from Malone. He\u2019s hardworking, not that Father Tim isn\u2019t, but Malone is the kind of guy who can get things done. Fix-your-car-type things. Father Tim\u2019s helpless at that. And Malone is...well, shoot, I don\u2019t really know what he is, do I? I know he has a certain effect on me. That\u2019s it.</p><p>When I come out, our little party appears to be breaking up. Chantal wriggles from her seat, making sure everyone sees her lush behind as she smooths her tight jeans. Malone hands Chantal her coat.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Malone, sweetie. Maggie, Father Tim\u2019s giving me a ride home,\u201d Chantal says. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had too much to drink,\u201d she pretends to confide.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I sigh. She could drink a roomful of firemen under the table.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a ride, as well, Maggie? The rain\u2019s punishing out there. I\u2019d be happy to drop you off.\u201d Father Tim pleads. His eyes are begging...I\u2019m sure there are rules against priests driving loose women home, and even a castrati would need a chaperone when alone with Chantal.</p><p>I glance out the window, which is too steamy to give me an actual view. Will Malone offer me the olive branch of a ride? To apologize for not calling, for not telling me his daughter was occupying his time for the past week?</p><p>He doesn\u2019t, just stands there looking at me, and who the hell knows what he\u2019s thinking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love one, Father Tim. You\u2019re so nice. That\u2019s very thoughtful. Thank you.\u201d In case Malone doesn\u2019t get the point, I turn to him. \u201cAlways lovely to see you, Malone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie,\u201d he says, giving me the nod. Then he goes back to the bar from whence he came.</p><p>Four minutes later, I\u2019m home, watching Father Tim pull away from the curb toward Chantal\u2019s house. Lucky Chantal. She lives twenty minutes outside of town. Twenty extra minutes with Father Tim, chatting, laughing, driving through the pouring rain. Poor Father Tim...well. I\u2019m sure they teach priests how to handle this kind of thing in the seminary.</p><p>Loneliness twangs its familiar discordant note. Though it\u2019s a reasonable hour to go to bed, it feels that the night stretches in front of me, endless. I feel it so sharply I even wish?briefly?that Malone would call me.</p><p>\u201cScrew it,\u201d I say, filling Colonel\u2019s water bowl. \u201cYou just can\u2019t win sometimes, can you, boy?\u201d My dog doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>I MAKE THE MISTAKE of going to see my parents a few days later.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d I say. She\u2019s still in her little uniform from Will\u2019s office?she wears scrubs with bright patterns on them, dogs and cats, flowers, happy faces?although why, we don\u2019t know. She hates sick people and never gets near them if possible, preferring to spend her day fighting with insurance companies instead, usually emerging from her headset in grim victory.</p><p>\u201cOh, Maggie,\u201d she says, slamming a cupboard. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter now?\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open. \u201cUm, nothing. Just thought I\u2019d come by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to bring that dog with you everywhere you go? Honestly, he\u2019s like the security blanket you had when you were three.\u201d</p><p>I stare at my mother and stroke Colonel\u2019s head. \u201cRight. Is Dad around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Do you need something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s just my father, and I love him,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cFine. He\u2019s in the cellar.\u201d</p><p>Dad has a little corner in the basement, where he often hides from Mom, pretending to do something constructive. He likes to make birdhouses, and the yard outside is full of tiny creations in every style and color imaginable?Victorian, log cabin, gourd, southwestern, apartment building. His corner has stacks of tiny pieces of wood, a shelf of tools and six or seven birdhouse books. He also has a stash of Robert Ludlum novels and a tiny radio. Dad\u2019s bomb shelter, we call it.</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cGo talk to your mother,\u201d he orders, giving me a kiss. \u201cShe says you only come here to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared of her today. She\u2019s in quite a mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. Go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoward,\u201d I tell him fondly. Obediently, I go upstairs.</p><p>\u201cMom, would you like some tea?\u201d I ask, putting the kettle on.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to stop wasting your time at the diner?\u201d she demands, yanking out a chair and slamming herself into it.</p><p>Okay. So it\u2019s going to be one of those days. A \u201cChristy Good, Maggie Bad\u201d day.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m wasting my time, Mom,\u201d I say resignedly. \u201cI really love it, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t send you to college to be a waitress,\u201d she snaps. \u201cChristy managed to find a decent career. Why can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I sit down. \u201cI do own the diner, too. And run it. And cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not as if you bought it. You just took it over from my father. And it\u2019s just a diner, Margaret.\u201d The use of my Christian name indicates that I\u2019ve done something quite heinous. If she calls me Margaret Christine, I\u2019m dead.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you went to cooking school,\u201d Mom continues, her voice brittle and sharp as broken glass. \u201cYou just crack eggs and sling hash and fry bacon. Look at your hands, Maggie! Don\u2019t you know people judge you by your hands? Hands make the man, they say.\u201d</p><p>Do they, I wonder? \u201cIt\u2019s actually clothes, Mom. \u2018Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What are you babbling about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Mark Twain quote.\u201d She looks blank. \u201cAnd I might not have gone to culinary school,\u201d I continue, \u201cbut the food at Joe\u2019s is great. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? Are you going to spend the rest of your life in that greasy little diner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not greasy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your opinion,\u201d she snaps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you on my case today, Mom?\u201d I ask through clenched teeth. \u201cHave I done something wrong? I just came to see you and Dad, and you\u2019re all over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better do something about your life, young lady. And fast. If you want to have a family and do something meaningful with your life, you\u2019d better stop hiding out at the diner.\u201d</p><p>I study her. These are the kinds of lectures I\u2019ve heard all my life. In high school, it was Don\u2019t Become Obsessed with That Boy (unfortunately, she was right). In college, it was Study Something That Will Help You Find a Job (again, right on the money...while being an English major at least allows me to quote the classics better than Mummy here, it hasn\u2019t done much to further my career). We\u2019ve since moved on to That Diner is a Dead End and my personal favorite, Your Ovaries Are Shriveling.</p><p>These lectures tend to bounce off me like hailstones bouncing on the roof of a car...tiny pings, but no real damage. Doesn\u2019t mean I like them, of course. But today, she seems more worked up than usual.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you hate the diner, Mom?\u201d I ask. \u201cIt was your dad\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she snaps.</p><p>\u201cSo? Now it\u2019s a family business. It\u2019s a nice place. I might even win best breakfast in Washington County. I\u2019d think you\u2019d be kind of happy about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that silly contest is pointless. And yes, it was my father\u2019s. He worked there seven days a week so I could go to college, make something of myself. Not so my own child would go back there, like some high school dropout. You pay that cook of yours more than you make yourself! Why, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he has five kids, Mom,\u201d I tell her patiently.</p> <p>\u201cSo? If he doesn\u2019t have the sense to use birth control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. That\u2019s enough. I\u2019m leaving. Love you, even though I\u2019m not sure why.\u201d I get up and open the cellar door. \u201cDaddy, stay down there. It\u2019s not safe up here. Love you, you big chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only want what you want, Maggie,\u201d my mother says, her voice a little gentler. \u201cI want you to meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201c?someone like Will.\u201d I say the words along with her. \u201cI know, Mom. He\u2019s a great guy. But Christy got him, okay? In fact, you\u2019re the one who picked Christy for him. You didn\u2019t pick me.\u201d I shrug into my coat, my movements quick and angry. \u201cAnd yes, I want to marry someone nice and have kids, but if it doesn\u2019t happen, it\u2019s not the end of the world, right? I\u2019ll be that helpful spinster daughter everyone dreams of, bringing you a bedpan, changing your sheets, spooning gruel into your mouth. I\u2019ll even give you that nice morphine overdose when the time comes, okay? In fact, I\u2019m tempted to give it to you now. Gotta go.\u201d</p><p>I tell myself that I don\u2019t mind, but my hands clench the handlebars of my bike in a death grip. I pedal slowly and carefully so my dog can keep pace. I realize my eyes are tearing. It might be the wind.</p> <p>Back at Joe\u2019s, Colonel flops down into the bed behind the register and yawns. I squat down to give him a hug, kissing his beautiful white cheeks repeatedly. \u201cI love you, puppy,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI love you, best boy.\u201d He licks me gently, enjoying the salt deposits on my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cHey, boss,\u201d Octavio calls. \u201cBeautiful day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Judy approaches me. \u201cFour more ballots, Maggie,\u201d she says, fishing some papers out of her apron. \u201cI think we\u2019re gonna win this year.\u201d Judy showing optimism is a near-biblical event, so my mood must be written clearly over my face.</p><p>As I\u2019m doing the last bit of cleanup, I decide to drop in on Christy. Before the thought is fully formed, she sticks her head in the diner door, and I can glimpse Violet\u2019s stroller just behind her on the sidewalk. \u201cMaggie? Want to run some errands with me?\u201d my sister asks.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say. \u201cJust let me finish scraping the grill.\u201d</p><p>I finish my chores and wash my hands, grimacing at the grease under my fingernails. But my hands are a little better. The painful cracks that appear at my fingernail line are healing. I\u2019ll have to find out where Malone got that cream.</p><p>Christy is waiting on the sidewalk. \u201cI heard you\u2019re wasting your life, slaving away for nothing,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been a dream of mine,\u201d I tell her. \u201cCan I push Violet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>The thrill of having identical twins in town has never left the good folk of Gideon\u2019s Cove. Colonel walks beside us like a guard, and we make a bit of a parade (or freak show, depending on how you look at it). School is getting out, and several kids beeline for my dog, one pretty young girl cooing at the sleeping Violet. Two ladies from church stop to admire the baby and advise Christy to bundle her up a little more. \u201cThanks, I will,\u201d Christy tells them as we continue. \u201cShe\u2019s wearing a onesie, tights, a turtleneck, a wool sweater, corduroys, socks and a coat,\u201d Christy mutters to me. \u201cI may be cooking her as it is.\u201d</p><p>The barber comes out to greet us and give Colonel a cookie. From inside his shop, Christy and I hear a roar of laughter...there\u2019s the usual gang of older men?Bob Castellano, Rolly, Ben?and, strangely enough, our dad. Apparently, Dad left the bomb shelter and is hanging out with the guys.</p><p>\u201cYour father sure is funny,\u201d Mike, the barber, tells us fondly. \u201cWhat a riot that guy is!\u201d</p><p>Christy and I exchange a glance. Riot is not the usual word that leaps to mind when thinking of our henpecked, quiet dad. Mike goes back inside, but Christy and I linger a minute in silence. Dad waves, smiling, and continues regaling the other men.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of nice, seeing Dad with some friends,\u201d Christy comments.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I agree. Odd, but nice.</p><p>We go into the little pharmacy to get some diapers. Colonel waits outside, patient and trusty as a statue. As I am separated from my dog and pushing the carriage, a few people call me Christy, and I answer as if I were. Christy smiles and pretends not to hear as she peruses the aisles for shampoo and chocolate.</p><p>\u201cTell Will I said hello,\u201d says Mrs. Grunion.</p><p>\u201cI sure will,\u201d I answer.</p><p>We leave the store, and Christy takes over pushing. Violet starts to stir, and I peep in at her. \u201cHi, sugar plum,\u201d I say. She rewards me with a smile and a yawn, her cheeks rosy. \u201cWho\u2019s your auntie, hmm? Can you say hi to Auntie Mags?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh-nu,\u201d she says cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cI think that was hello,\u201d I tell my sister.</p><p>She grins. \u201cSo what\u2019s going on with you and Malone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I tell her. \u201cWe\u2019re not really...I don\u2019t know. Nothing. Just a fling. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She looks disappointed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem like the type for a fling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him. There he is.\u201d I feign nonchalance as Malone comes out of the liquor store, a six-pack under his arm. He lurches to a stop at the sight of us.</p><p>\u201cHi, Malone,\u201d Christy calls out pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I echo.</p><p>\u201cHey, Christy,\u201d he says. His eyes flick to mine. \u201cMaggie.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s almost strange to see him during daylight hours. He has the looks for a vampire, that dark hair and grim face. He\u2019s wearing a black wool coat and faded black jeans, rubber-soled boots. But the lines around his face are less harsh, and the wind ruffles his hair teasingly. He bends down for a look at Violet. \u201cHey, there,\u201d he says to her.</p><p>Violet stuffs a corner of her blanket in her mouth and chews, staring at him solemnly. The lines around Malone\u2019s eyes deepen. I look away, embarrassed by the softening of my wicked heart. \u201cSweet baby,\u201d he tells Christy.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she smiles.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you, Maggie,\u201d Malone says. He turns and walks away from us.</p><p>When he\u2019s a safe distance, Christy hisses, \u201cSee? He still likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeezum. You sound so eighth grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she huffs indignantly.</p><p>\u201cWell, nothing, Christy. He said a handful of words and left. Where you come up with your theories is beyond me. We haven\u2019t spoken since we slept together. Well, hardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. But I can just tell.\u201d She looks at me. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Great Swami. Thanks for the input.\u201d I smile and pat her arm. How patient I am today! First with Mom, now with my sister. Clearly I deserve some Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s tonight while I watch the Sox game. Perhaps the entire pint.</p><p>\u201cDo you like him, Mags?\u201d my sister says, irritating as a greenhead at the beach. My patience evaporates.</p><p>\u201cI like him in bed, Christy. Okay? In bed, he\u2019s awesome. Otherwise, we barely speak. So. Any other questions? Would you like to know if he has any identifying marks or deviant tendencies?\u201d I realize I\u2019m barking.</p><p>Christy shoots me a grin. \u201cWell, actually...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tattoo. On his arm. A Celtic band, right around his bicep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more interested in the deviant tendencies.\u201d She widens her eyes expectantly, and I can\u2019t help laughing.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>IT TURNS OUT she\u2019s a little bit right.</p><p>That night, I\u2019m at home as usual, already dressed in my pjs at eight-thirty, a huge basket of laundry on my coffee table. Ever since my Skip days, I\u2019ve been a baseball fan, and, because it\u2019s a Maine state law, I am a devotee of the Boston Red Sox. I watch with smug satisfaction as the designated hitter clips a double into right field, then decide I deserve that Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s. While I rummage in the freezer, there\u2019s a knock on my door.</p><p>\u201cSissy, it\u2019s me, your favorite brother,\u201d Jonah calls.</p><p>\u201cDmitri?\u201d I call.</p><p>\u201cWicked funny,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cCome on in,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cTV\u2019s out at the firehouse. Can we watch the Sox game with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s already on.\u201d The freezer is crammed with foil-wrapped leftovers from the diner and I can\u2019t find the damn ice cream. Shoot. \u201cUm, who\u2019s we?\u201d</p><p>Jonah sticks his head in the kitchen door. \u201cJust me and Stevie. Malone, too.\u201d</p><p>I jerk my head out of the freezer. \u201cMalone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh,\u201d Jonah says, turning his head to see the TV. \u201cSaw him at the dock, asked him if he wanted to come.\u201d He seems unaware of the import of his actions, but then again, Jonah is unaware of much in life. He blinks owlishly at me.</p><p>\u201cRight, Malone,\u201d I say. \u201cOkay. Sure. Yeah. That\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>A sudden image of my laundry causes me to lunge into the living room. I\u2019m too late. Underwear of varying ages litters the coffee table. \u201cYou need some new stuff, Mags,\u201d Stevie says, snatching up a pair of once-white panties.</p><p>I reach for them, feeling my face go nuclear-hot. \u201cOut on parole, I see, Stevie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe some thongs. I like a woman in a thong,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNot that you\u2019ve ever seen one,\u201d I say, snatching the panties back. I stuff them, along with my faded bras and T-shirts, deep into the laundry basket. \u201cHi, Malone,\u201d I say, hoping my voice sounds casual.</p><p>\u201cMaggie,\u201d Malone says.</p><p>He makes the boys look like just that?boys. He\u2019s not smiling exactly, but he\u2019s not glaring, either, and he doesn\u2019t look away. It seems very small in my apartment; of course, it is a very small apartment, and three full-grown males make it microscopic.</p><p>\u201cGot any beer, Maggie?\u201d Jonah asks. \u201cMaybe a snack?\u201d</p><p>I yank a sweatshirt over the tank top I\u2019m wearing. \u201cSure, hang on. Don\u2019t move him, Stevie, he\u2019s old,\u201d I say as my brother\u2019s friend, who must weigh close to three hundred pounds, tries to wedge himself in next to Colonel. \u201cSit on the floor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe or him?\u201d Stevie asks.</p><p>\u201cYou, dummy. Want a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He bats his eyes at me and lies on my floor, taking up approximately half of it.</p><p>I speed back into the kitchen and open the freezer again, letting the frosty air cool my face. Calm down, Maggie, I urge myself. Nothing to worry about. Malone\u2019s here, it\u2019s no big deal. Just think of him as another one of Jonah\u2019s annoying friends.</p> <p>\u201cNeed some help?\u201d</p><p>Malone leans in the doorway between the kitchen and living room. His coat is off, and he\u2019s wearing a faded blue work shirt. The color matches that of his eyes, and he\u2019s so attractive, tall and angular and so damn male that I feel slightly dizzy.</p><p>\u201cSorry, what did you say?\u201d I ask, pretending to look in the freezer for something.</p><p>\u201cNeed any help?\u201d</p><p>In the other room, Stevie and Jonah give a yell and high-five each other. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I tell my other guest. \u201cSo, Malone, what a surprise. Are you a big Sox fan? I mean, you probably are, I guess we all are, right, living here in Red Sox Nation and all th?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Malone says, stepping closer to the fridge, where I continue to stare. \u201cYour brother asked if I wanted to come over and watch the game here, and I said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Uh-huh. And, um...why is that?\u201d I ask, leaning a little deeper into the freezer.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I risk a glance at his face, and the little smile he\u2019s wearing causes a tug of desire to pull at my insides. \u201cI do have a phone, you know,\u201d I whisper. Without thinking, I take an ice cube from the bin and press it against my forehead.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like talking on the phone,\u201d Malone says softly, and his voice scrapes a soft place in me.</p><p>\u201cReally? What a surprise,\u201d I manage. He reaches out and smoothes the little hairs at the back of my neck, and my knees practically buckle.</p> <p>\u201cMaggie! How \u2019bout that beer, hon?\u201d Stevie calls from the living room.</p><p>\u201cSo is it okay?\u201d Malone asks.</p><p>\u201cIs what okay?\u201d I ask, tossing the ice cube in the sink.</p><p>\u201cIs it okay if I stay?\u201d</p><p>I look him full in the face. It\u2019s a face I\u2019m really starting to like, I realize. \u201cSure,\u201d I say, smiling. He grins back, and my heart squeezes hard, because his front tooth has the tiniest chip in it, and that imperfect smile makes him suddenly the most delicious, appealing man I\u2019ve ever seen, and without even being fully aware of what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019ve wrapped my arms around his neck and am kissing him greedily, relishing the scrape of his five-o\u2019clock shadow, clutching his hair, practically wrapping my legs around him.</p><p>Malone\u2019s hands slide under my shirt, and his hands are so hot after the cold air from the freezer, his mouth hard and soft at the same time?</p><p>\u201cMaggot! The beer!\u201d my brother yells. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re missing a great game.\u201d</p><p>With a shaky laugh, I untangle myself from Malone. His eyes are smoky. \u201cListen,\u201d I say, swallowing, glancing toward the living room, \u201cI\u2019d rather that Jonah...um...well, not know about this...you know, this thing of ours. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>Malone opens the fridge and takes out a couple beers. His face is back in its usual lines. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>For the next hour, Stevie and Jonah ignore me, except to ask for snacks, which I bring to them obligingly, glad for the excuse to distract myself from the lust that writhes around in the pit of my stomach. Malone deigns to drink a beer, but he doesn\u2019t eat anything. Stevie takes up most of my floor space, and Jonah has the club chair that I got three years ago at a going-out-of-business sale in Bangor. Malone and Colonel sit on the couch, the dog\u2019s head in Malone\u2019s lap. Malone\u2019s hand rests on the dog\u2019s shoulder, and Colonel sighs contentedly once in a while.</p><p>I fold my laundry discreetly, putting my shirts and jeans on top of anything I don\u2019t want the guys to see. I sneak a look at Malone every once in a while, and each time I do, he seems to know. Blushing becomes my permanent facial state. I pretend to watch the game, though the Sox could have all been murdered and left disemboweled on the field for all the attention I truly pay.</p><p>It\u2019s Stevie, good old Stevie whom I\u2019ve known since he was in kindergarten, who livens things up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Maggie,\u201d he says idly, eyes fixed on the TV, \u201cI heard you told Father Tim you were in love with him the other night. At the spaghetti supper.\u201d</p><p>I choke on the beer I\u2019m nursing, the fizzy burn surging up my nose. Stevie and Jonah roar with laughter. Malone, I note through tearing eyes, does not.</p><p>\u201cYeah, so what\u2019s going on, Mags? You dating Father Tim?\u201d Stevie continues.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I rasp. \u201cNo! Of course not! Jeez! I\u2019m not?God!\u201d Malone isn\u2019t moving, just staring/glaring at me, his eyes like chips of ice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I heard!\u201d Stevie singsongs. \u201cHave you kissed him yet, Mags? Father Tim and Maggie, up in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Stevie, you\u2019re such an ass,\u201d I say, getting better control of my voice. \u201cI wasn\u2019t...there\u2019s nothing...he\u2019s a priest! Come on! Kissing! Jeez.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause, Maggie, if you\u2019re that desperate, I could help you out, babe. Show you a good time, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonah! Can you beat him up or something? That\u2019s your sister he\u2019s talking about,\u201d I remind my brother, shooting another nervous glance at Malone.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Stevie,\u201d Jonah says automatically, stuffing a fistful of popcorn into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dating Father Tim,\u201d I say emphatically, my eyes darting between Malone and Stevie. \u201cHe\u2019s a priest! Of course I\u2019m not...you know. Oh, look, another run.\u201d Thank God, I think, as the Red Sox divert Stevie\u2019s tenuous attention.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t divert Malone\u2019s. He continues to look at me, the lines that run between his eyebrows and slash alongside his mouth harsher. I shrug as if to say, Stevie, what an ass, but I\u2019m betting my face gives me away. Goddamned fair skin.</p><p>At the next commercial break, Malone extricates himself from Colonel and the couch. \u201cThanks, Maggie. Guys. I\u2019m gonna go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe game\u2019s not over!\u201d Stevie protests.</p><p>\u201cGotta get up early,\u201d Malone says. \u201cSee you.\u201d He grabs his coat and opens the door. I start to go after him, then stop.</p><p>\u201cOkay, bye, Malone. Nice to see you,\u201d I call out idiotically. He gives a curt nod and walks out, his feet thumping down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an odd one,\u201d Stevie says, glancing at the door.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not bad,\u201d Jonah says mildly. \u201cHey, Maggot, got any more beer?\u201d</p><p>Because my luck is pretty bad these days, the Devil Rays (the Devil Rays!) somehow catch up with the Red Sox, and the game goes into extra innings. It\u2019s after eleven by the time the boys finally leave, full of popcorn, beer and woe. The minute they\u2019re gone, I throw on my coat, stuff my feet into my wool clogs and call to Colonel. It only takes me a few minutes to get to Malone\u2019s house.</p><p>There are no lights on inside, and the house is quiet. I knock softly, then wait. No answer. I knock again, a bit more loudly this time. After a minute, I hear Malone\u2019s footsteps. Colonel wags as he opens the door.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late, Maggie,\u201d he answers, looking over my head.</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019ll just be a minute. Can I come in? It\u2019s kind of important. Plus, it\u2019s cold. Got really chilly, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I clamp my mouth shut against the automatic babble that pours out of me when I\u2019m nervous and slip past Malone, who looks wicked sexy, if less than welcoming. He\u2019s wearing a pair of jeans and a white T-shirt, and his feet are bare. Even so, he\u2019s a good six inches taller than I am.</p><p>Colonel is panting after our walk, and without a word, Malone goes into the kitchen, takes a bowl down from the cupboard and fills it with water. He sets it on the floor, kneeling down to scratch Colonel\u2019s ears as my dog drinks. \u201cYou\u2019re a good crittah,\u201d Malone says, our Maine designation for anything four-legged. Colonel wags in agreement, then goes under the table to lie down. Malone stands up and leans against the counter, folding his arms across his chest. \u201cSo what do you want, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath, distracted by the sight of his thickly muscled arms. How I ever felt Malone was unattractive is a mystery. I remind myself to focus, but before I can, I start talking. \u201cWell, I just...I guess...\u201d I guess I should have planned what to say, that\u2019s what. \u201cI just wanted to say, you know...Stevie, what Stevie said about me telling Father Tim that, um, you know...well, of course I\u2019m not dating Father Tim. Of course. I mean, he\u2019s a priest, right? So of course not.\u201d</p><p>Malone purses his lips as if deciding whether to believe me or not, and the words continue to rush out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends, Father Tim and I. He\u2019s actually one of my best friends. We hang out sometimes. Well, I mean, he comes into the diner every morning for breakfast. Sometimes we go to a movie. Once in a while. Actually, it was maybe twice. There was a group of us, not just us two, of course...And I do a lot for the church, you know? Committees and stuff like that. But no dating. Obviously. Since he\u2019s a priest.\u201d</p><p>Malone looks at the floor, and I force my mouth shut and wait for him to speak. He sighs, running a hand through his hair. \u201cLook, Maggie,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI live in this town, too. I hear things.\u201d He looks back at me.</p><p>My nervous energy drains into the floor. \u201cRight.\u201d The clock over the fridge ticks loudly, reminding me that it\u2019s almost midnight and Malone and I both have to get up early. \u201cWell, the thing is, I did have a thing for Father Tim. And I did actually?\u201d I swallow \u201c?I did say that I loved him. While I was under the influence, I might add.\u201d</p><p>Malone says nothing.</p><p>\u201cSo. There you have it.\u201d I fiddle with the zipper of my coat, wondering if I just severed things completely with Mr. Happy here. As the silence stretches on, I feel a stir of irritation. \u201cYou know, Malone, I\u2019ve heard things about you, too,\u201d I say, a defensive note creeping into my voice. \u201cAnd just because that\u2019s the gossip doesn\u2019t mean I believe it.\u201d</p><p>His face darkens, but I continue anyway. \u201cThere was that thing about your cousin last year, right? I mean, people had a whole lot to say about that. But I didn\u2019t jump to any conclusions or anything.\u201d</p><p>Still no reaction from Malone, which I find slightly ominous. But, true to character, I keep going. \u201cLet alone what they say about your wife.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. Now I\u2019ve gone too far, and even I realize it. My heart starts thumping erratically against my rib cage. Though Malone hasn\u2019t moved or changed expression, I\u2019m suddenly a little afraid.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do they say about my wife?\u201d he asks very, very quietly.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, you know...I don\u2019t know. People talk about all sorts of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cThat you hit her. That she was scared of you and that\u2019s why she moved across country.\u201d</p><p>His face looks so hard now it could be carved from granite. \u201cAnd do you believe that?\u201d he asks in that scraping, quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if I did, Malone.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me and I force myself not to look away. Finally, his gaze flicks somewhere past me. \u201cWhen?\u201d he growls.</p><p>\u201cWhen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you make your little announcement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Well, that was a while ago. You know, a couple, three weeks ago? A month, maybe. But before you and I...um...hooked up.\u201d Colonel\u2019s tail starts thumping in his sleep. Malone exhibits no such happiness, just continues glaring at me, the creases between his eyebrows unrelenting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, well, I wanted you to know that,\u201d I say, peeved at his lack of reaction to both my confession and my trust. \u201cWhatever.

Instead, I stare back at Malone a minute, then decide to take a chance. \u201cNo,\u201d I say softly. \u201cIt seems like I have a thing for you.\u201d</p><p>He looks back at me, not smiling, then covers the space between us, takes my hand and leads me to bed.</p> <p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>AT LEAST I DIDN\u2019T wake up alone, I think the next day as I slice onions for potato soup. Malone was already dressed, granted, and it was still dark out, but he kissed me gently and said the tender words, \u201cGotta go.\u201d And he did.</p><p>But he kissed me, he woke me up...that must be a step forward, I think. Last night marks the third time we\u2019ve spent the night together. This must be a relationship, right? The fact that I still don\u2019t know much about him rankles, though. What we really need to do is go out and not just go to bed. This idea holds a good bit of appeal in theory, until I remember the night we spent staring at each other at the restaurant. Maybe I should go ahead with that list and just hand it to him. Please fill in the answers to the following questions. What is your first name? Do you have any hobbies? Are you going to introduce me to your daughter? Am I your girlfriend?</p><p>The sun is shining brightly today, the air cool and clean, and business is slow. A few people come in to pick up an order, but that\u2019s about it for the lunch crowd. It\u2019s Octavio\u2019s day off. Since we\u2019re so slow, and since she\u2019s reading a novel anyway, I send Judy home at noon and handle the few customers who actually come in to eat.</p><p>After I close, I take Colonel home and swing by the soup kitchen with the vat of soup and a few dozen biscotti. Then I spend an hour or two writing letters to tourism writers and restaurant critics, hoping to lure someone to Joe\u2019s Diner. But my mother is probably right. Even if Joe\u2019s wins best breakfast in our county, or even in the whole state, it wouldn\u2019t change much. Gideon\u2019s Cove is just too far from anywhere to be popular.</p> <p>I take a walk to the harbor. My brother\u2019s boat is in, but Malone\u2019s, the Ugly Anne, is not. I wonder how he picked the name, who Anne is. Another question for the list, I suppose. I walk back home, oddly deflated.</p><p>Having cooked all day, the last thing I want to do is make myself some dinner. On a whim, I get into my car, which is caked with dried mud, drive twenty minutes to the next town, which has a car wash. I\u2019ve always loved the car wash, that feeling of surrender to the conveyor belt, the ease with which the car is suddenly sparkling clean. As I\u2019m feeding quarters into the vacuum machine, another car pulls up next to me.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, how are you?\u201d says Father Tim, getting out. \u201cGreat minds think alike, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Father Tim! How are you?\u201d I haven\u2019t spoken to him in several days, and that mere fact gives me pause. He hasn\u2019t come into the diner since...heck, a few days. And I haven\u2019t really noticed.</p><p>\u201cWe missed you at Bible study last night,\u201d he chides gently, fishing around in his pockets for quarters of his own.</p><p>\u201cRight. Shoot. I\u2019m sorry. I guess I had some things to take care of,\u201d I say. My face and other parts grow warm at the thought of just what those things were, but I cover by vacuuming the back seat.</p> <p>When Father Tim is finished, he straightens up and glances down the street. \u201cWould you care to grab a cup of coffee, Maggie?\u201d he asks. \u201cI thought I saw signs of life at Able\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure! That would be nice.\u201d</p><p>Able\u2019s Tables is a tiny little caf\u00e9 down the street, and they are indeed open, though business is light at this time. A sign promises open mike night beginning at eight, but I don\u2019t expect Father Tim and I will be around for that. We order coffees?and Father Tim gets a brownie the size of Rhode Island?and sit at a table near the window.</p><p>\u201cImagine, us meeting,\u201d Father Tim says. \u201cThere I was, feeling a bit lonely, and who should I run into but you. A happy coincidence. God knows our hearts and hears our prayers, sure enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you feeling alone, Father Tim? I\u2019d think you\u2019d love a little solitude, away from all your fans.\u201d I smile, taking a sip of my cappuccino.</p><p>He laughs morosely. \u201cSure enough, that\u2019s true sometimes. God speaks to us in the silences, after all. You\u2019re right. But today, I think I\u2019m merely in need of a little companionship, Maggie,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSometimes, even when a person\u2019s surrounded by others, he can feel a bit on the lonely side of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I murmur sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. You know just what I\u2019m speaking about, don\u2019t you, Maggie?\u201d He gazes at me thoughtfully, his eyes soft and kind on mine. \u201cIt must be hard for you, having Christy being married with a baby and all.\u201d</p> <p>I sit up straighter. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not hard,\u201d I say, frowning. \u201cI love Will. And Violet...well, don\u2019t get me started. It\u2019s not hard. I\u2019m very happy for my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you, then, Maggie, good for you.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry my efforts at finding you a decent man haven\u2019t panned out.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t worry about it. Not at all. Thanks for trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lovely girl like you should have someone,\u201d he continues almost sadly.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer for a moment, just look out at the street. \u201cWell, actually, I might be seeing someone,\u201d I venture.</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Father Tim exclaims. I nod. \u201cIs he good enough for you, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>I blush. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful, then,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, I was thinking about you the other day and that person we met at Dewey\u2019s, the fisherman. Dark hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalone?\u201d I say, my face going from blush to inferno.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Malone. I wouldn\u2019t want you with someone like that, now. Such a churlish fellow, barely speaking. He was hardly civil the whole time we were there. Couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Chantal, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually?\u201d I attempt.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found a man with potential, Maggie. I\u2019d hate to see you settling for someone who wasn\u2019t blessed with the same good heart that you have.\u201d</p><p>My mouth opens and closes a couple of times before the words come out. \u201cActually, Malone is the person I\u2019m...seeing.\u201d</p><p>Father Tim\u2019s mouth falls open with comical surprise. \u201cIs that?is he? Oh, dear. I\u2019m terribly sorry, Maggie.\u201d He looks away, wincing.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not really that churlish,\u201d I manage. Great job, Maggie. Talk about damning with faint praise. \u201cLet\u2019s change the subject.\u201d</p><p>The waitress comes by with a free refill for Father Tim. \u201cHere you go, Father,\u201d she croons. She ignores my now-empty cup.</p><p>\u201cAh, thank you, that\u2019s lovely,\u201d he says, smiling up at her. Her cheeks grow pink.</p><p>Is that how I am? Oh, God, it is, isn\u2019t it? Gross. I\u2019m mortified. Poor Father Tim, to have us waitresses fawning over him all the time! The woman finally fills my cup and goes back behind the counter, her eyes still on my companion.</p><p>\u201cIs it hard being a priest, Father Tim? Always having to be so, um, well-behaved?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He laughs, long and hard. \u201cNo, Maggie, it\u2019s not hard. It\u2019s a beautiful calling, a privilege, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re always a little?\u201d I stop, fearful that I\u2019m once again about to put my foot in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cA little what?\u201d he asks. He really is just pointlessly good-looking, those soft green eyes, the gorgeous hands.</p><p>\u201cA little apart from everyone else,\u201d I venture.</p><p>His smile drops. \u201cMmm. Well, yes, you\u2019ve a point, don\u2019t you, Maggie?\u201d He sets his cup down. \u201cThe price we pay to serve the Lord.\u201d He forces a smile and takes another sip of coffee. \u201cMaggie,\u201d he continues, more quietly, \u201cdid you know Father Shea when you were growing up?\u201d</p><p>I gasp, unfortunately just at the moment I\u2019m sipping my cappuccino, and burning foam drips into my lungs. \u201cI...yup,\u201d I rasp.</p><p>Father Shea was our priest when I was probably ten or eleven. He was handsome, somewhere in his forties or fifties (who can tell when you\u2019re little, right?), a jovial, teasing priest who shamelessly bribed us kids to be good in church by giving us Hershey\u2019s Kisses after Mass.</p><p>Then Annette Fournier\u2019s husband dropped dead of a heart attack when he was out for a run one day. Father Shea was a great comfort to the tragic young widow and her three kids. Such a comfort that he left the priesthood and married her a year later. I believe they had one or two more kids themselves, making Father Shea go from Father to plain old Dad.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember Father Shea,\u201d I say, still coughing a little. \u201cHe was...well, he was pretty nice. But he...you know. Left. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>Father Tim shakes his head a little, his eyes distant. \u201cNo reason. Well, no reason I should be discussing, at any rate, Maggie. Sorry to bring it up. He\u2019s just...never mind. On my mind lately. Enough said.\u201d</p><p>I stare out the window, my face hot. Guilt flashes like heat lightning?how many times have I wished Father Tim wasn\u2019t a priest? In truth, I don\u2019t really...he\u2019s a very good priest, from all accounts, anyway, and I\u2019d hate for him to scandalize the town as did Father Shea. Leave the priesthood. Break his vows.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d best be getting back,\u201d Father Tim announces, putting down a dollar for the waitress. \u201cThanks, Maggie, for the nice chat. You\u2019re a lovely friend.\u201d He squeezes my shoulder. \u201cThe church\u2019s doors are always open to you, you know. God is waiting, and His patience never wears thin.\u201d He grins and winks, ever campaigning.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks. Nice to see you, Father Tim,\u201d I say, slipping another couple bucks for the waitress, glad that he\u2019s back to his normal, chipper, priestly self. I get into my newly clean car and head for home, but the trickle of discomfort remains. Why would he ask about Father Shea? Why would he ask me, in particular? Surely the dragon Plutarski would give him every salacious detail at the merest flicker of interest.</p><p>By the time I get back to Gideon\u2019s Cove, the sky glitters with stars overhead, the air so clear that I can see the Milky Way swirling above me. Standing on my front porch, I take a deep breath. The smell of wood smoke from the many fireplaces and stoves mingles with the faint smell of pine and sea, and to me, it\u2019s the best smell there is. I suck in another breath, then jump at the sound of the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, dear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Mrs. K. You startled me,\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cDear me, I\u2019m terribly sorry.\u201d She motions for me to come in, and I obey. \u201cThere was a man here earlier,\u201d she says. \u201cThat dark man who came over the other day. The tall one.\u201d</p><p>I am simultaneously thrilled and nervous, which seems to be the hallmark combination of emotion Malone evokes. \u201cMalone? He was here? When was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout an hour ago, dear.\u201d She shuffles over to her chair and lowers herself carefully into it. \u201cMaggie, would you find the remote control? There\u2019s nothing on tonight, nothing! Three hundred channels and nothing worth seeing!\u201d</p><p>The remote sits in plain sight on the coffee table. I hand it to her. \u201cSo, um, did you talk to the...to Malone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I must say, I tried. He didn\u2019t say much in return, Maggie. He seemed quite angry, if you ask me.\u201d Mrs. K. flips through the channels. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAngry? Are you sure? I mean, I can\u2019t think of why he\u2019d be mad.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Kandinsky stops on a station. Linda Blair\u2019s head rotates around as Father Damian looks on in horror. \u201cOh, look, Maggie! The Exorcist is on! Damn it all to hell, I\u2019ve missed the first part!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. K.,\u201d I say, trying to steer her back to our conversation, \u201cdid Malone say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm? Oh, the angry man? Malone, you say his name is? Well, yes, I told him I didn\u2019t know where you were, and he said he\u2019d see you soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound angry,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh, my! Isn\u2019t she hideous,\u201d Mrs. K. croons appreciatively. \u201cMy word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, this one is too scary for me.\u201d The priest, however, is quite good-looking, but I have enough good-looking priests in my life. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go, Mrs. K. Enjoy the movie.\u201d She doesn\u2019t acknowledge me as I kiss her goodbye, too engrossed in the terror on the telly. I head up to my apartment.</p><p>There\u2019s no note or phone message from Malone. I pick up the phone book, look up his number and call. The line is busy. Fifteen minutes later, I try again. Still busy. The idea that Malone can speak for this long is somewhat surprising. Certainly, he never speaks to me that much. No, we seem to have other things to do than speak.</p><p>Well. He said he\u2019d see me soon. Maybe he wasn\u2019t angry. What does he have to be angry about, anyway? It\u2019s not like I was out with my boyfriend...Father Tim is a friend, and I don\u2019t have to feel guilty about having a cuppa joe with him. Besides, he needed me. He was lonely. We spent an hour talking. Just talking. Nothing to feel guilty about at all.</p> <p>Out of curiosity, I check the Internet dating site I visited last time. The messages haven\u2019t changed. The god is still seeking his goddess, the angry husband is still angry.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Colonel,\u201d I say to my dog. \u201cLet\u2019s go to bed.\u201d</p><p>I take the phone into the bedroom with me, but Malone doesn\u2019t call.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>\u201cFOOSH,\u201d Violet says, patting Colonel. \u201cMubba.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s close, honey,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s doggy. Can you say doggy?\u201d</p> <p>She opts to kiss Colonel instead, leaving him with a large wet spot on his side and her with a mouthful of fur. Colonel wags his beautiful tail as Christy swoops in with a tissue, smiling and grimacing at the same time.</p><p>\u201cYou love Colonel, don\u2019t you, Violet?\u201d she asks. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie, for heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t let the baby lick that dirty animal,\u201d my mother says.</p><p>\u201cColonel is not dirty,\u201d I snap. \u201cHe\u2019s immaculate. Look at that coat. People stop us in the street to tell me how beautiful he is. I brush him every?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristy, there\u2019s still a hair on her lip. There you go. Come here, Violet.\u201d My mother appropriates the baby, taking her off to an area free from germs and dog hair. We\u2019ve gathered for our command family dinner, and while my mother is a fine cook, I feel as welcome as a cockroach in a salad. Dad is in the den, reading and hiding, and Will, Christy and I sit in the living room, waiting for our summons to the table.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really on my case these days,\u201d I tell Christy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d Will agrees. \u201cThat\u2019s all we hear about at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d I ask. \u201cShe talks about me at your office?\u201d</p> <p>Christy shoots Will the \u201cshut up\u201d glare, and he pretends he doesn\u2019t hear me and reads the paper instead.</p><p>At that moment, my brother bursts through the door. \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what happened today,\u201d he blurts.</p><p>\u201cThree women came to your doorstep, announcing that you\u2019re the father of their babies,\u201d I guess.</p><p>\u201cNo. Stop joking around, it\u2019s serious.\u201d He flops down into a chair. \u201cMalone went overboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Christy and I bark simultaneously. Panic floods my limbs, and it feels like my heart drops to my knees.</p><p>\u201cHe was pulling up a pot, and this Masshole came by in a speed boat, tangled the line, and bam. Malone went right over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened? Is he okay?\u201d I ask my brother. Adrenaline makes my joints feel too loose and electrified.</p><p>\u201cMasshole?\u201d Will murmurs. He\u2019s from away, having only moved to Maine during his residency.</p><p>\u201cMassachusetts tourist,\u201d Christy tells him.</p><p>\u201cJonah, is he all right?\u201d I repeat. My palms are slick with sweat.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right,\u201d Jonah says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t caught in the line, thank God, but he was in the water for about twenty minutes, half an hour. Got wicked cold.\u201d</p><p>The water in the Gulf of Maine is cold enough to cause death if you\u2019re in it long enough. Every few years, it seems, a lobsterman drowns when he goes overboard, tangled in the line that connects his pot to the buoy. Even if they don\u2019t get pulled under, an arm caught in the line can be torn right off. Or sometimes they simply can\u2019t climb back aboard. A lot of lobstermen work alone, especially in the off season.</p><p>\u201cWas he wearing a survival suit?\u201d I manage weakly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jonah says grimly. \u201cJust his coveralls. Must be colder than a witch\u2019s tit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s okay?\u201d I insist.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. He\u2019s fine. Still out there, though,\u201d Jonah said. \u201cFuckin\u2019 foolish if you ask me. Said he still had to check his traps. At least he had a change of clothes.\u201d</p><p>Christy turns to look at me.</p><p>\u201cMom, I gotta go,\u201d I call, standing up. My knees are weak and sick-feeling, and I stagger a little, knocking into the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, God, you are still the gawmiest girl,\u201d she says from the kitchen. \u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re leaving? I\u2019ve already set the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGawmy is clumsy, right?\u201d Will asks.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d my father tells him, emerging from the den. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not, sweetheart.\u201d He pats my head as I shove my arms into my coat.</p><p>It\u2019s nearly dark by the time I reach the harbor. Malone\u2019s boat isn\u2019t back yet, and the adrenaline continues to zing through my joints. As I stand on the boardwalk, looking down at the many berths, Billy Bottoms come along. He\u2019s a fifth-generation lobsterman and looks the part?white hair, chiseled, leathery face, crisp, snowy beard. In the summer, tourists often ask to take his picture, and his accent puts the rest of us Mainahs to shame.</p><p>\u201cHello theah, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Billy,\u201d I answer. \u201cListen, did you hear what happened today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Malone? Ayuh. He\u2019s not back yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cSome flatlandah was flyin\u2019 by in a sweet little corker. Buoys so thick you could walk home, but this guy don\u2019t care. Seems Malone was haulin\u2019 a pot when his line got picked up by the out-a-townah and he got pulled in. Flatlandah didn\u2019t even stop. Your brother saw the boat circlin\u2019, came over to see what was what. Said Malone was madder than a bucketful a\u2019 snakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I whisper. \u201cHe could have died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, Maggie, most of us go ovah at one time or anothah. Malone\u2019s fine, I\u2019m sure.\u201d He pats my shoulder. \u201cYou have a good night, now, Maggie, deah.\u201d</p><p>The images in my head are too terrifying. Malone being towed to the bottom of the ocean by his weighty trap. Malone trying helplessly to climb back aboard the Ugly Anne until his strength is sapped away by the cold. His head slipping under, his body floating?</p><p>I can\u2019t bear those thoughts. Before I\u2019ve fully decided what to do, I\u2019m running to the diner, Colonel loping happily at my side, and burst in through the kitchen door. Among the items in the freezer are a quart of potato soup and an apple pie. I grab them, add a block of cheddar and a loaf of pumpernickel and bag them up, then head for Malone\u2019s.</p><p>That will be just the thing, I think as I climb the hill. A house filled with the smell of hot apple pie, a hearty soup simmering on the stove, a sympathetic woman and an excellent dog. What could be a nicer homecoming? Certainly, it\u2019s what I\u2019d want after a shitty day. Aside from the woman thing, of course.</p><p>His house is locked, which presents a problem. I put the food on the porch and walk around, wondering if there\u2019s a spare key hidden in an obvious place, like under a doormat or in a pot, under a rock near the porch. No such luck. But in the back, the window is cracked, and without too much struggle, I lift the window and manage to boost myself in, flopping onto the floor with the grace of a dying haddock. But I\u2019m in.</p><p>After I bring in the food, preheat the oven and find a pot, I take a look around. I\u2019ve only been here twice, I realize, and I haven\u2019t seen much of the house. Not that there\u2019s much to see. It\u2019s a bungalow, three rooms downstairs, a bedroom and bathroom upstairs. It\u2019s a bit sloppier than last time; there are dishes in the sink, a cup and plate in the living room. It\u2019s chilly, too. After a dip in the frigid Atlantic, Malone shouldn\u2019t have to come home to a cold house.</p><p>Because I\u2019m a Maine native, I have no problem starting a fire in the woodstove. I tidy up the pile of newspapers in the woodbin and refold the afghan and drape it over the couch.</p><p>There are a few photos here and there; snapshots of a younger Malone and the little girl who grew into such a beauty. I study the photos, unable to see Catherine Zeta-Jones in the chubby-faced child. Well. People change. I touch Malone\u2019s image, his chipped tooth smile makes my chest tighten. A few books are scattered around the living room, and I stack them neatly on the coffee table. The Perfect Storm. Cheerful little ditty, that. In the Heart of the Sea, which apparently tells about cannibalism after a whaling accident. Jeezum. No wonder Malone scowls all the time.</p><p>Still restless, I walk past the piano, which has a light coat of dust on the top. I push a few keys. The Beethoven sheet music I saw the first time I was here is gone, replaced by a Debussy piece. It looks hard, but I never was any good at reading music, despite four years of clarinet lessons in school, so everything looks hard to me.</p><p>Malone can play the piano. So I do know something about him, I realize. He likes classical piano music. It\u2019s a nice little fact.</p><p>Colonel is snoring quietly in the kitchen. The oven has reached four hundred and twenty-five degrees, so I brush the top of the pie with some milk, sprinkle it with sugar and pop it in. I look at the clock. It\u2019s seven-thirty, and the temperature is dropping outside. It\u2019ll probably be in the thirties tonight. I hope Malone gets home soon.</p><p>The dishes beckon, and as I\u2019m still filled with nervous energy, I wash them, then figure out where they go through a process of elimination. For the most part, Malone is pretty neat. His bed isn\u2019t made, though, and the sheets are tangled and twisted. I open a closet in the hall and find some clean flannel sheets and remake the bed.</p><p>There. I turn down the heat on the pie, set the timer, check the soup. What a nice little place this could be with a few personal touches here and there, a few more prints, maybe some better furniture...</p><p>I sit on the sofa and wrap up in the afghan. Leaning my head back, I close my eyes. Colonel comes over and sits next to me, putting his big head in my lap. Worn out from worry, I find myself getting drowsy. Poor Malone, I think. But lucky, too, because God knows he was spared today. And I\u2019ll be waiting for him when he comes home from this terrible day, offering both comfort and company. I can\u2019t wait to see him, to make sure he\u2019s okay.</p><p>Some point later, I jerk awake at the sound of the door and scramble off the couch. The smell of apple pie is rich in the air. Relief and joy have me leaping off the couch. \u201cHi, Malone!\u201d I call. \u201cHow are you? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He stands in the doorway, his orange coveralls balled up beside him, a length of line coiled on top. He looks thinner, gaunt instead of lean, and utterly exhausted, the lines on his face seemingly carved by a heavy knife today. I\u2019m already in the middle of the kitchen, headed straight for him, when his voice, scratchy and hoarse, cuts me off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I lurch to a stop. \u201cWell, um, I heard about your day...um, Jonah came by and told me you went in the drink.\u201d Suddenly the idea of giving him a hug or kiss or even patting him on the shoulder seems out of the question. \u201cI thought I\u2019d bring you some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not ask for this,\u201d he grates out. There are streaks of salt deposits on his sweater, and his hands are shaking with fatigue.</p><p>My mouth falls open. \u201cWell, I know. I just thought you might want a hot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Maggie! This is the last thing I wanted! You here playing house, for Christ\u2019s sake!\u201d he barks. Colonel comes from the living room at the sound of his voice, wagging gently, but Malone ignores him. The dog takes the hint, flopping down in front of the oven.</p><p>\u201cLook, Malone,\u201d I begin, more than a bit confused. \u201cI just brought over some soup and...\u201d</p><p>He peers into the living room. \u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake, did you clean up, too? Damn it, Maggie!\u201d Slamming over to the counter, he bangs his hands down. Colonel startles at the noise.</p><p>Okay, now he\u2019s pissing me off. Taking a deep breath, I say calmly, \u201cExcuse me, but what the hell is your problem? I did something nice for you. No big deal. For God\u2019s sake, Malone, you were submerged in the Atlantic Ocean today! I thought you could use a little?\u201d I stop myself from saying \u201cTLC\u201d?\u201cfood. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not one of your little church projects, all right?\u201d he barks. \u201cThis is?oh, for Chrissake, you did the goddamn dishes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, Malone. I guess I should have just left you alone to snarl and brood and do whatever else the hell you do. Take the pie out when the timer goes off. Enjoy it, you surly bastard. Come on, Colonel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you, Maggie?\u201d Malone growls, and his glare could cut glass. \u201cI don\u2019t want your pie and your soup and whatever the hell else you\u2019ve got in your little picnic basket. Okay? Save it for your priest and your little old ladies and whoever else you\u2019ve got on your list. Not me.\u201d</p><p>My temper snaps. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re mad at me! How can you be mad? I\u2019m just trying to help!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the whole point, Maggie! I don\u2019t want your help. I don\u2019t want you doing anything for me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll send you a bill. And I don\u2019t have a picnic basket.\u201d With that, I snap my fingers at my dog, who lumbers to his feet and follows me. I stomp off the porch and down the street. When I\u2019m safely at the intersection, I sit down on the curb, the cold seeping through my jeans immediately. My breath fogs the air in front of me, but we don\u2019t have any street lights, so I know Malone can\u2019t see me. My legs are shaking.</p><p>Colonel nuzzles my hair, and I automatically put my arm around him. My throat is tight with tears and anger, but I don\u2019t cry. \u201cScrew him,\u201d I say. \u201cUngrateful bastard.\u201d</p> <p>So, fine. Malone doesn\u2019t want anything from me. Fine. Just fine. He\u2019s made things clear, at least. No, I\u2019m not his girlfriend. Just a roll in the hay now and then. Well, too bad. I want more than that.</p><p>\u201cWhen people care about each other, they show it,\u201d I tell my dog. He licks his chops thoughtfully. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that. That\u2019s the way things are supposed to be.\u201d The image of Malone rubbing lotion into my long-suffering hands flashes through my brain. Well. That was just a seduction move, and it worked brilliantly. \u201cI don\u2019t think Malone is a very nice person, do you? You don\u2019t, either? Well, you\u2019ve always been smart about these things.\u201d Colonel lies down next to me, but the pavement is too cold for his old bones. I stand up, and my dog does the same. \u201cAt least we got that out of the way,\u201d I say. My dog wags reassuringly. Still, my throat stays tight, like there\u2019s a piece of glass wedged there.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>FOR SOME REASON, Joe\u2019s Diner is hopping the next day. It always seems to be the case?something in the tides or the moon causing a mass hysteria for breakfast out. People are actually waiting for tables, which usually only happens on Thanksgiving weekend or during both good weekends of summer. Octavio whips orders out, and both Judy and I are working at top speed, smiling (well, I am, at least), sliding orders to the hungry of Gideon\u2019s Cove, passing out ballots and pens for the best breakfast rating, trying to ring people up before a line forms at the register. Jonah comes in, but I don\u2019t have time to do more than shove a plate of French toast in front of him?as he eats for free, he gets what I give him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, sissy,\u201d he calls as I fly into the kitchen.</p><p>My parents, also succumbing to breakfast fever, make a rare appearance. Mom frowns as she surveys noisy crowd. \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll have to wait,\u201d she says. When she comes in and things are slow, she tells me I\u2019ll never make a living. If I\u2019m busy, she\u2019s put out. And today, I\u2019m just not in the mood.</p><p>\u201cBusiness looks good today, Maggie,\u201d my dad says.</p><p>\u201cIt sure is, Dad. Hi, Rolly. How was everything?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cCracklin\u2019,\u201d he says. I take this as a compliment.</p><p>\u201cYou filled out your ballot, right?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cEvery day, Maggie, every day.\u201d</p><p>Finally, a booth is free for Mom and Dad, since the counter is jammed. \u201cWhat would you like, Mom?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I should have eaten a bowl of bran flakes, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about pancakes, Maggie, hon?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>\u201cPancakes it is.\u201d Having been a waitress for half my life, I don\u2019t need to write down orders. \u201cAnd you, Mom?\u201d</p><p>My mother sighs. \u201cWell, I just don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019ll start with orange juice, only don\u2019t fill the glass. It\u2019s too much. Your glasses are too big. Fill it about three quarters full. Can you do that? Because otherwise, I won\u2019t be able to drink it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSqueeze one, three quarters. Got it.\u201d</p><p>Georgie comes in and attaches himself to my side, his head only reaching my collarbone. \u201cHi, Maggie! How are you, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>I put my arm around him and kiss his crew cut. Mom assumes her lemon-sucking expression. \u201cHey, buddy,\u201d I say to Georgie. \u201cSomeone spilled juice under the last stool. Can you take care of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Maggie!\u201d He gives me a squeeze and goes to the back room to get the mop. I glance back to the counter, where people are in various stages of eating and ordering, then do a double take.</p><p>Malone\u2019s here.</p><p>He\u2019s sitting next to Jonah, talking to him, and his presence causes my face to go hot. He looks my way, his face as blank as a blackboard in July. No sheepish grin. No apologetic shrug, just the penetrating blue stare and the slashing lines of his perpetual scowl. I turn back to my parents.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Maggie! There\u2019s too much to choose from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You get nothing.\u201d I snatch the menu from her hand and fly back into the kitchen, ignoring Malone, ignoring my mother\u2019s squawks of indignation. I grab an order of the spinach omelet special, some pumpkin bread French toast and a plate of silver dollar pancakes. \u201cAnother stack for my dad, Tavy,\u201d I tell Octavio.</p><p>\u201cAyuh,\u201d he answers.</p><p>I serve the family at the fourth booth, then grab the coffeepot and head for the counter, overhearing Jonah saying, \u201cOh, shit, it was nothing. You\u2019d do the same for me.\u201d</p><p>So. Malone came here to see Jonah. To thank him. Not to see me, or, God forbid, thank me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Malone,\u201d I say briskly. \u201cCoffee? Let me guess. Black, murky and bitter. Maybe you\u2019d just like to suck on the grounds?\u201d</p><p>Malone turns his clear blue eyes to me. \u201cMaggie,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>\u201cHope you slept well,\u201d I snap. Jonah\u2019s eyes widen, but he wisely refrains from comment. Malone\u2019s eyes don\u2019t flicker from mine. I slosh some coffee into his cup, spilling some, and smack the pot down on the counter. Without looking away, Malone deliberately takes the creamer and dumps about half of it into his cup, then shakes four sugar packets, tears them open and pours them in as well.</p><p>\u201cAll done, Maggie!\u201d Georgie calls cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Georgie. Don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you,\u201d I call back, not looking away from Heathcliff of the moors here.</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely day it is outside. Hello, Mabel, love, how are you this fine morning?\u201d Father Tim is here, but still I don\u2019t look away from Malone\u2019s somber face.</p><p>\u201cHave you got something to say to me, Malone?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve got a lot to say to you, Maggie,\u201d he answers grimly. Jonah slips away to join our parents.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, can we get some ketchup over here?\u201d calls Helen Robideaux from the corner.</p><p>\u201cHello, Maggie dear. How nice you look today.\u201d Father Tim comes behind the counter?he\u2019s a regular, after all?and grabs a mug. Finally, I break the staring contest between Malone and me and turn to greet my friend. My happy, cheerful, dependable friend.</p><p>\u201cFather Tim! How nice to see you! And what a great mood you\u2019re in today. You really brighten a place up, you know that?\u201d I believe I hear Malone growl.</p><p>\u201cAh, Maggie, you\u2019re too kind. I\u2019ll just grab some coffee, shall I, and let you get back to work.\u201d He opens the kitchen door a crack and sticks his head in. \u201cGood morning, Octavio, my fine man. Can I throw myself at your mercy and get an order of the pumpkin French toast?\u201d</p><p>I have work to do. Malone can go to hell and play with his compatriots there. Stepping around Colonel, I ring up a young couple who\u2019s been waiting patiently, ask about their kindergartner and bring the ketchup to Mrs. Robideaux. Malone sits at the counter, staring straight ahead.</p><p>The bell over the door tinkles, and I sigh. Another customer, a man about my age with silvery hair. He looks around uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cBe with you in a sec,\u201d I call. Judy has disappeared. Must be time for her ciggie break.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, for heaven\u2019s sake, can I please have a fried egg?\u201d my mother asks.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I\u2019ve heard about how, in some fancy New York restaurants, the wait staff spits on the orders of bitchy customers. I\u2019m tempted to give it a whirl. \u201cHi, Stuart. You want the usual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great, Maggie,\u201d he says, sitting next to Malone.</p><p>\u201cAdam and Eve on a raft, burn the British,\u201d I call to Octavio, slang for two poached eggs on a toasted English muffin.</p><p>\u201cSide of hash, too?\u201d Stuart asks.</p><p>\u201cSweep the kitchen!\u201d I call, hearing Octavio grumble; he\u2019s quite proud of his hash and doesn\u2019t like that particular moniker. Stuart, however, laughs.</p><p>\u201cSweep the kitchen,\u201d he repeats to Malone, chuckling. Malone doesn\u2019t chuckle back.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say to the gray-haired stranger. \u201cSorry, we\u2019re a little swamped today. Just one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you Maggie?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Doug,\u201d he says, holding out his hand. \u201cThe guy who stood you up,\u201d he adds at my look of incomprehension.</p><p>\u201cOh! Hi!\u201d I shake his hand and look over my shoulder. \u201cHere, why don\u2019t you sit with Father Tim? He kind of fixed us up, right, Tim? This is Doug...oh, sorry, I forgot your last name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrews,\u201d he says. He\u2019s a nice-looking man, kind brown eyes with shadows under them.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019d love to sit and chat, but I\u2019ve got to take care of those people. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>Malone is gone. There\u2019s a five-dollar bill tucked under his cup. I note that he hasn\u2019t drunk any of the overly sweetened coffee. Should\u2019ve stuck with the grounds.</p><p>I clear and wipe and take orders and serve and pour coffee. I don\u2019t have a chance to talk to Doug, who is deep in conversation with Father Tim. Occasionally, I catch a snatch of their conversation...\u201cnot for us to understand the reason\u201d...\u201ccomfort of knowing she was deeply loved\u201d...and my heart warms at Father Tim\u2019s kind, gentle words. Finally, Doug comes to the register to pay his bill. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaggie,\u201d he says, \u201cI just wanted to apologize in person for not meeting you that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d I answer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have a chance to talk to you this morning. The joint\u2019s been jumping since six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I really enjoyed talking with Father Tim,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I wanted to say again that I\u2019m really grateful for how nice you were about everything. Under different circumstances...\u201d His eyes tear up.</p><p>\u201cWell, listen, now, don\u2019t cry. You\u2019re welcome,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re a nice guy, Doug. Take care.\u201d</p> <p>By the time I turn off the Eat at Joe\u2019s sign in the far window, my feet are throbbing, my face is oily, my hands are raw and my back hurts. Needless to say, I\u2019m in a bit of a mood. Because I would hate to snap at Georgie, I send him home early (Judy\u2019s long gone), and Octavio and I clean up in silence.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay, boss?\u201d he asks as he shrugs into his jacket.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been married, Octavio?\u201d I ask, wringing out the dishrag.</p><p>\u201cEight years,\u201d he smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou and Patty seem really happy,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cOh, we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling I\u2019m never going to find someone,\u201d I say, and suddenly that tight-throated feeling is back.</p><p>Octavio gives me a thoughtful look. \u201cWhat?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cMalone came in today,\u201d he says. \u201cNever seen him here before.\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cYeah. He came in to thank my brother. Jonah gave him a hand yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Octavio is a man of few words. \u201cWell. Good night, boss.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBye, big guy.\u201d And it\u2019s only four o\u2019clock.</p><p>It\u2019s beautiful out, finally, fifty degrees or so. The trees have the soft fuzz of buds on them, the palest green imaginable, and the wind is salty and gentle. Unfortunately, I\u2019m too busy today to take a bike ride or even a decent walk. Instead, I bake some brownies for tomorrow\u2019s dessert offering. Then I load up the car and head over to the firehouse.</p><p>I get paid to cook their monthly dinner, and though it\u2019s not much, it\u2019s one of those fees that helps, especially during the off-season. While I\u2019m able to pay all my bills each month, there\u2019s usually not a lot left over. Mornings like today\u2019s are few and far between. I know I should have a cushion in case something goes wrong, but I\u2019m tapped out. Winning the best breakfast title would help, even if it was just to get people from neighboring towns to take a drive in on the weekends.</p><p>Colonel settles himself down in the corner of the firehouse kitchen while I unload the car. The soft April air beckons, and I wish again that I could take a bike ride, but by the time I\u2019m finished, it will be getting dark. Plus, Colonel needs to get home. He seems stiff today, quieter than usual.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, pup?\u201d I ask him. He looks at me with his beautiful eyes, but his tail doesn\u2019t wag. \u201cWho\u2019s my pretty boy?\u201d I croon, kneeling to stroke his head. There. His tail swishes. I give him a piece of roast beef and get to work.</p><p>What\u2019s Malone doing tonight? I wonder, then immediately purge the thought from my head. Malone is a callous user, and I\u2019m no better. My behavior toward him has been embarrassingly slutty, says a chastising inner voice sounding exactly like my mom. Fools rush in where angels fear to bed, she\u2019d say. And in this case, she\u2019d be correct. I snap on the radio to drown out my self-condemnation.</p><p>The boys?sorry, firefighters?start filing in around five-thirty, Jonah among them. He waves to me but is engrossed in a conversation with the head of the truck committee...the firefighters are convinced that Gideon\u2019s Cove needs a ladder truck, though we\u2019d also need a new structure to house it, which would be just fine with the boys?sorry, firefighters.</p><p>I set up the Sterno burners and bring out the trays of food, basic, hearty fare?roast beef, horseradish mashed potatoes, green beans, pesto chicken, pasta and sauce. Twenty or so guys usually show up. Chantal pokes her head in the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cHey, girlfriend,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chantal,\u201d I answer. \u201cI forgot you\u2019re a member here.\u201d I grin as I say it.</p><p>\u201cBest thing I ever did,\u201d she sighs dramatically. \u201cCommunity service and all that crap. Not to mention the best-looking guys in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize sleeping with the fire department was community service,\u201d I retort, pouring the sauce over the ziti.</p><p>\u201cOh, it is, it is. Don\u2019t let her talk you out of it, Chantal,\u201d Jonah says, coming in and putting an arm around my laughing friend. \u201cAnd here\u2019s a fireman who needs your special skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting,\u201d I tell him. Chantal purrs.</p><p>\u201cWanna test some hose?\u201d Jonah murmurs, ignoring me.</p><p>\u201cJonah, leave us,\u201d I command, and for once, my little brother obeys. \u201cYou want to go out later on, grab a beer or something?\u201d I ask Chantal. Her eyes are still on my baby brother. His ass, to be precise. \u201cChantal!\u201d</p><p>She jumps. \u201cOh, sorry, Mags,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans.\u201d Her voice changes. \u201cHi there, Chief,\u201d she coos, her voice dropping into a sultry croon.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my little recruit?\u201d Chief Tatum croons back. \u201cPractice any search and rescue lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I can\u2019t take anymore,\u201d I say, sounding quite peeved even to my own ears. \u201cCome on, Colonel. I don\u2019t want you hearing this kind of talk, anyway.\u201d Chantal and the fire chief don\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>I bring some ziti to Mrs. K. and heat it up for her. Then I help her find her comfortable slippers, \u201cnot those horrible ones that make my bunions ache.\u201d But I\u2019m edgy and irritable tonight and make my visit quick. Faced with my long flight of stairs, Colonel turns to me, and I boost him all the way up.</p><p>Adding insult to injury, the soup, bread, cheese and pie that I made for Malone are sitting in front of my door. I let Colonel inside and then go back and grab the food, slamming the pot on the counter. Frickin\u2019 Malone. Let him starve, then. Who cares?</p><p>Colonel doesn\u2019t seem interested in dinner tonight. I give him some EtoGesic and glucosamine and fluff up his doggy bed, then write a note on the blackboard to call the vet and see if there\u2019s anything else I can do.</p><p>Maybe my mother is right, I think as I dump the soup down the drain. Maybe the diner is a dead end. It was something I fell into. Granddad put us to work at a young age, washing dishes, clearing tables, working our way up to waiting tables. But is it something that I really want to do for the rest of my life?</p><p>I stare out the window toward the harbor, thinking.</p><p>The answer is yes.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s not the most illustrious career in the world, but what Joe\u2019s Diner does?what I do?is give a center to our town. A meeting place. Anyone can come in, even if they just want a cup of coffee, and spend the morning catching up on news, seeing their neighbors. There\u2019s Dewey\u2019s, of course, but that\u2019s only open at night, and it has a different attitude. People go there with more of an agenda?meet someone, have a few drinks, and if you\u2019re hardcore, get drunk. But Joe\u2019s is a social center in a town that desperately needs one. And the fact that it\u2019s an authentic Mahoney design doesn\u2019t hurt. I wonder if I could get it listed on a national register or something.</p><p>But my mother\u2019s constant nagging has dented my armor lately. When I picture growing old at the diner, I picture a husband and kids coming in and out, or me going home to them. I don\u2019t picture me alone, soaking my swollen feet in Epsom salts every night with only a series of increasingly smelly dogs for company.</p><p>I throw a pizza into the oven, wait for it to heat, then eat listlessly. How many dates have I gone on in the past month or so? Four? Five? And let\u2019s not forget Malone, not that we dated, of course. Just sex. Best sex of my life, in fact.</p><p>Time to call Christy, I think when the self-pity disgusts even me. I punch number one on the speed dial.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s me,\u201d I say when Will answers.</p><p>\u201cHi, Maggie. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess. You guys still going out tomorrow? Same time as usual?\u201d I ask. Thursday is my babysitting night.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m not sure. Christy\u2019s not feeling great. There\u2019s a stomach bug going around, and I think she caught it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. Well, if you need anything, let me know. Tell her I said I hope she feels better fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, honey. Will do.\u201d</p><p>When Christy met Will, it was instantly clear to both of them that they\u2019d met their soul mate. Six months later, Will, then a resident in Orono, took a rare night off and asked me out for dinner. Alone. He took me to a nice restaurant, and though he was exhausted from a long shift, he was nonetheless funny and charming. While we were eating dinner, he took out a velvet box and handed it across the table to me.</p><p>\u201cUm, I think you might have the wrong twin,\u201d I said, wincing.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d Will smiled.</p><p>\u201cSo is this a test run or something?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cListen, Maggie,\u201d he said, his face growing serious. \u201cI want to marry your sister. I\u2019ve never met someone as wonderful as she is. Every day I wake up feeling like I\u2019m in a dream because I get to call her or see her or hold her hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so nice,\u201d I said, my eyes growing misty. At the time, I was quite sure I would soon find someone just as wonderful as Will.</p><p>\u201cBut I know how close you are, and I know I\u2019m asking...well, not exactly to come between you, because I know I could never do that, and I never want to. But I\u2019m asking you to share Christy with me. I need your blessing, Maggie.\u201d His eyes were teary.</p><p>In the box was a beautiful garnet ring, Christy\u2019s and my birthstone.</p><p>Of course I gave him my blessing. The thought of my sister spending her life with a man who adored her...well. Who could say no?</p><p>I haven\u2019t met anyone like Will. There may be no one like Will in the whole world. The best I\u2019ve come up with is a tearful widower, a sullen lobsterman and a priest. \u201cWell, crap,\u201d I say. I offer the crust of my pizza to Colonel, who eats it delicately. \u201cYou feeling better, pal?\u201d I ask him. He puts his head on my lap.</p><p>The Red Sox have a travel day, which is just as well. They\u2019ve been playing with all the skill of blind, one-legged five-year-olds lately. I click around aimlessly until nine-thirty or so, then decide to just call it a night. It\u2019s not lost on me that going to bed with my dog is the best thing that\u2019s happened all day.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>COLONEL WON\u2019T GET off the bed in the morning. He wags his tail listlessly but doesn\u2019t even raise his head when I ask if he wants to go out. I check the clock; it\u2019s too early to call the vet.</p><p>After yesterday\u2019s rush, the diner is back to normal?my regulars sit at the counter, Ben, Bob and Rolly. Stuart is at his booth at the window, reading the paper. But I\u2019m worried about Colonel, and as soon as the clock hits eight, I make the call. They tell me to come in tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably just feeling his age,\u201d the nice tech tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s in great shape for an old guy. How old is he now, fourteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirteen,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty good for a big dog like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But he\u2019s just not himself.\u201d</p><p>For the rest of the day, I hop back and forth between the diner and my apartment. I manage to coax Colonel off the bed and outside so he can pee, but he laboriously climbs the steps as soon as he\u2019s done. I help him back onto my bed and give him some water. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, boy?\u201d I ask, stroking his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll go see Dr. Kellar tomorrow, okay? He\u2019ll help you out, Colonel.\u201d</p><p>I have to throw together a couple of lasagnas for a funeral and bake a few dozen cookies, but all day, I\u2019m itching to get home to my dog. It\u2019s the awful plight of a pet owner: knowing something is wrong with your loyal companion, unable to figure out what. Could he have eaten something that\u2019s made him sick? Did he get hurt somehow? Does he have cancer? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I get home for good around four, finally done for the day, then call Christy to see if she might come over and keep me company while I watch Colonel. But she\u2019s still under the weather, and after hearing a description of her all-nighter with the toilet, I feel uncomfortable telling her about my dog\u2019s listlessness. I\u2019m lonely enough that I find myself calling Father Tim.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, I\u2019m terribly sorry, I\u2019ve got to run,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m having dinner with the Guarinos tonight. Thanks for the lasagnas, by the way. They were wonderful.\u201d</p><p>I manage a smile?Father Tim is the only man I know who can eat lasagna at four and go out to dinner at six. \u201cWell, that\u2019s okay,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m just a little worried about Colonel. He\u2019s kind of quiet today. Not himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry,\u201d he answers. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be just fine. Tell you what, I\u2019ll ring you later, shall I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d I hang up and stretch out on the bed next to my dog. I stroke his ears and run my fingers through his silky ruff. He nestles closer and groans in contentment.</p><p>My father gave me Colonel just after Skip dumped me. I was staring out the window a week or two after Skip\u2019s triumphant return to Gideon\u2019s Cove, and my father walked in with Colonel, a blue ribbon tied around his neck. Rescued from one of those breeding mills down south, Colonel was then an overly large, rambunctious two-year old. It was love at first sight. That first night, he climbed, paw by paw, cautious as a jewel thief, onto my bed. Perhaps he thought if he went slowly, I wouldn\u2019t notice the extra eighty pounds wedged into my twin bed. I was still living at home, and my mom had had a fit when she saw us the next morning, Colonel\u2019s head on my pillow, my arm around his shaggy tummy.</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Maggie! It\u2019s an animal! Get it off! It might have fleas or lice or something.\u201d</p><p>The next week, I moved out, into the very apartment I still live in, and Colonel and I began the next phase of our life together. When the humiliation and grief over Skip threatened to overwhelm me, Colonel would come over and nudge my hand with his nose until I petted him. Or he\u2019d drop a ratty tennis ball at my feet, and if I ignored him, he\u2019d repeat this ten or twelve times until I got the hint. He slept on my bed each night, his big head resting on my stomach as I fought off loneliness and tried to come up with a plan for my adult life.</p><p>Colonel only needed a little training, and I soon became known as \u201cthe one with the dog\u201d to distinguish me from Christy. I never used a leash; Colonel just followed me cheerfully, always able to keep pace with my bike or walking beside me, his plumey tail waving like a flag. I\u2019d go into a store, and he\u2019d lie down on the sidewalk outside, patiently waiting for me to emerge. He took to the diner like a veteran waitress, never bothering the customers, just lying behind the register, watching people come and go until it was our turn to leave. Sure, it was against the health code, but no one ever found a dog hair in the food, and no one ever complained.</p> <p>When my mother mused out loud that I\u2019d never meet anyone, or when another date went wrong, when I came home from babysitting Violet, filled with yearning for a baby of my own, all I had to do was turn to his golden face and ask for a kiss. He never told me I was wasting my life?he thought my life was the best thing that ever happened to him. He never thought I talked too much; instead, his eyes would follow my every move, his ears pricked and alert when I spoke. He accepted every tummy scratch, every head pat, every evening on the couch as if it were a gift from God Himself, when really, it was just a drop in the bucket compared to the devotion he gave me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best bud,\u201d I tell him. His tail thumps reassuringly. Cuddled together, we fall asleep.</p><p>I WAKE UP around three in the morning, knowing immediately that Colonel has died.</p><p>His body is still warm under my hand, but there\u2019s just something missing. Tears flood my eyes, but I keep petting him, his beautiful soft golden fur. I stroke his white cheeks, feeling the wiry whiskers, the soft jowls of his throat. I don\u2019t turn on the light?it would be sacrilegious somehow, because then I\u2019d have to see that my dog of the past eleven years is dead. Instead, I just move closer to him, wrap both arms around his neck, bury my face in his fur and cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Colonel,\u201d I choke out. Sorry that I didn\u2019t rush him to the vet to see if there was anything wrong, sorry that I didn\u2019t take the day off to be with him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, boy.\u201d</p><p>I cry until the sheet beneath my face is soaked, until the sky goes from black to blue velvet to pink. When I can\u2019t avoid it any longer, I sit up and look at him, his noble, gentle white face, the silky feathers of his belly and legs.</p> <p>\u201cThanks for everything,\u201d I whisper, my words pitifully inadequate.</p><p>The phone rings, and I know it\u2019s Christy before I hear her voice. We know when the other is hurting.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d she whispers. It\u2019s only five in the morning.</p><p>\u201cColonel died,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cOh, no! Oh, Maggie!\u201d she cries, and I start crying again, too. \u201cMaggie, I\u2019m so sorry, honey. Did he?did you have to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just died in his sleep, right on my bed,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cOh, Colonel,\u201d she murmurs, sniffing. I hear Will\u2019s voice in the background, and Christy tells him my sad news.</p><p>\u201cCan we do anything?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m calling Jonah. He\u2019ll give me a hand. How are you guys doing? Still sick?\u201d</p><p>Christy sighs. \u201cI\u2019m still pretty whipped, and Violet\u2019s got it now. She threw up all night, after she ate three helpings of ground-up spaghetti and meatballs for supper. We\u2019ve barely slept.\u201d</p><p>I notice that I\u2019m still petting Colonel\u2019s soft fur. \u201cI hope you feel better,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>I call my brother and ask if he\u2019ll help me bring my dog to the vet for cremation when they open. Then I call Octavio and ask him to cover for me.</p><p>When Jonah comes over at quarter to eight, he thumps up my stairs and hugs me tight, tears in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShit, Maggie. This just sucks,\u201d he says, looking at the floor. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s with Dicky now or something. They were both awesome dogs.\u201d</p><p>We go into the bedroom, and I kiss Colonel\u2019s head once more as Jonah wipes his eyes on his sleeve. Then we wrap him in a blanket and carry him down to Jonah\u2019s truck. Mrs. K. comes out to see what\u2019s going on.</p><p>\u201cColonel died last night, Mrs. K.,\u201d I tell her, and the old woman, who has buried a husband, three sisters and two of her four children, bursts into tears.</p><p>\u201cOh, Maggie,\u201d she weeps, and I hug her frail shoulders, crying again myself.</p><p>Jonah and I slide Colonel into the back of his pickup, and I climb in beside my dog. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be cold back there, Mags,\u201d my brother says.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d I tell him. I hunker down and put my arm over the blanket so it won\u2019t blow off, because that would just be too sad to see.</p><p>The people at the vet\u2019s are so kind. They help us carry Colonel in through the back entrance and give me a moment to say goodbye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait in the truck,\u201d Jonah offers, closing the door softly behind him.</p><p>I pull the blanket off Colonel\u2019s head and take one long, last look. He seems cozy, wrapped in the red plaid blanket that we used together on chilly nights. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you so much, buddy,\u201d I whisper, my throat barely able to force the words out. \u201cYou were such a good dog. The best.\u201d</p><p>I kiss his cheek, my tears wetting his fur. And then I leave.</p><p>Jonah drives me home so I can shower and strip the bed. I can barely look at my apartment, so lonely and empty, so I trudge to the diner, where Judy and Octavio cry over the news.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t be the same without him,\u201d Judy sobs. \u201cShit. Shit, shit, f**k. I\u2019m going out for a cigarette.\u201d</p><p>Octavio makes a little sign that says \u201cWe regret to tell you of the passing of our great friend, Colonel\u201d and tapes it to the cash register. Rolly shakes his head sadly, Bob Castellano gives me a whiskery kiss. Apparently Jonah or Christy calls my parents, because they come in around ten with Christy, who still looks pale and a bit shaky. She and my dad, who is crying openly, sandwich me in a hug.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d I whisper. My own eyes are dry for the moment.</p><p>Dad blows his nose, then hugs me tightly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, honey,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cHe was the best,\u201d Christy says, her mouth wobbling.</p><p>\u201cI know. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Maggie,\u201d my mother says, and I brace myself for what comes next. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I blink in surprise. She never tried to hide her disapproval, not being a dog lover herself. She barely tolerated Dicky, another of my father\u2019s saves.</p><p>Judy takes care of the two remaining breakfast patrons, shooting us little glances and pretending not to listen.</p><p>\u201cAt least you won\u2019t have to vacuum up its fur every day,\u201d Mom says idly. \u201cAnd the diner here will certainly be more sanitary without it.\u201d</p><p>Ah, here she is, my real mother. My swollen eyes narrow.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Christy squeaks. \u201cJeezum!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she says innocently. \u201cIt\u2019s true. And look at you, Maggie, you\u2019re a wreck. You look awful. All over a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I say, my voice is pleasingly calm. \u201cGet the hell out of my diner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d she asks. Dad steps back in alarm, and Christy puts her hand on his arm protectively.</p><p>\u201cGet out, Mom. I loved that dog. He saw me through some of the worst times of my life. I\u2019m sick of you disapproving of me, sick of you telling me that my life is a dead end, sick of you comparing me to Christy and her perfect life. Get out. Come back when you can act like a mother who loves all her children.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s mouth is hanging open, and it\u2019s odd, because at that moment, I love her more than I have in a long time. But enough is enough.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d I say, \u201cyou really should stick up for me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cChristy, sorry. Love you.\u201d I give her a stiff hug. \u201cHope you feel better. I\u2019m going in the kitchen. Please be gone when I come out.\u201d</p><p>Octavio, diplomatic as Switzerland, says nothing as I come in. I open the supply closet and sit down on the floor among the vinegar and canned tomatoes. My breath is ragged, and my hands, I note, are shaking. Tavy gives me five minutes, then opens the door.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, boss?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cPeachy,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAbout time you told that woman off,\u201d he says, smiling his nice gap-toothed smile.</p><p>I give a grim laugh. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I SEND JUDY HOME EARLY, preferring to stay as busy as possible. Word has spread, apparently. Chantal comes in for lunch, hugs me with uncharacteristic sweetness and hands me a bunch of tulips.</p><p>\u201cSorry, pal,\u201d she says, sliding into a booth.</p><p>\u201cThanks. What can I get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe just some coffee today. I\u2019m not feeling great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. There\u2019s a stomach bug going around,\u201d I tell her. \u201cChristy and the baby both have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYuck. Well, if I don\u2019t have it, I\u2019d be happy to come over tonight, okay? If you want some company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I think I just want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Chantal nods. \u201cHey, has Father Tim been in today?\u201d she asks, checking her lipstick in the chrome of the little jukebox.</p><p>\u201cActually, no. I have to drop by and tell him about Colonel.\u201d Suddenly, the idea of seeing Father Tim, being comforted by him, maybe having a cup of tea in the rectory living room, overwhelms me with longing. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll finally be able to find some comfort.</p><p>I call Beth Seymour and ask her to handle my meals on wheels tonight. When she hears about Colonel, she offers to tell my clients, many of whom loved my dog. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks, Beth. That would be nice,\u201d I say. My eyes feel grainy and hard.</p><p>When I leave the diner, I automatically hold the door open a second too long before it occurs to me that my dog won\u2019t be following me. There\u2019s no one to look out for, no one to talk to...shit. Mom\u2019s right. I\u2019m pathetic.</p><p>Mrs. Plutarski glares at me when I ask if Father Tim is in. \u201cHe\u2019s quite busy today, you know,\u201d she says, pushing up her glasses on her razor-sharp nose. \u201cThis might not be the time for a...social visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just had a death in the family, Edith,\u201d I say, knowing she hates it when I call her by her first name. She waits for a name, but I don\u2019t give her one. \u201cIs he in or not?\u201d I demand.</p> <p>\u201cMaggie? I thought I heard your voice.\u201d</p><p>There he is. \u201cHi, Father Tim. Do you have a minute? In private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you, Maggie, always. Edith, my darlin\u2019 girl, would you mind faxing this over to the mother ship? It needs to be there today.\u201d He hands her a piece of paper, which she accepts as if it were an engagement ring. \u201cSorry, Maggie. Official diocese business. Thanks, Edith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget you have that meeting in Machias at six,\u201d she says, her eyes on me. Make it short is what she\u2019s really saying.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you today, Maggie?\u201d Father Tim asks, ushering me into the parlor.</p> <p>I sit in the chair, ready to be comforted. \u201cFather Tim, Colonel...he died last night.\u201d</p><p>At first, the news doesn\u2019t register. I suddenly remember that Father Tim said he would call me last night and didn\u2019t. \u201cOh, dear,\u201d he says, his expectant smile turning to sorrow.</p><p>I wait for more. It doesn\u2019t come.</p><p>\u201cHe died in his sleep,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a comfort, then, isn\u2019t it? Better than having him put down, I\u2019d imagine.\u201d He glances at his watch.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to go?\u201d I ask brusquely.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no. I\u2019ve got a bit.\u201d He sits back and folds his hands. \u201cWell. You must be feeling quite sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I agree.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, then.\u201d He smiles kindly, but for the first time ever, I get the feeling that he\u2019s not really listening.</p><p>\u201cFather Tim,\u201d I say, \u201cdo you think animals go to heaven?\u201d The question comes only from my desire to engage him, not from any spiritual need. I know exactly where Colonel is.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been asked that before,\u201d he answers thoughtfully. \u201cAnd while you might say that though God created them, the truth is that they don\u2019t have the ability to make a choice. That\u2019s a gift God only gave to man, Maggie, free will, don\u2019t you know. And so?\u201d</p><p>He keeps talking. I stop listening.</p><p>Father Tim is not going to comfort me. He\u2019s not going to say something that\u2019s tender, compassionate and insightful. He\u2019s off on some tangent about church teachings, ignoring my sadness, oblivious to my irritation.</p><p>\u201cOkay, whatever,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cListen, I have to run.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaggie,\u201d he says, standing. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry.\u201d He folds me into a hug. It doesn\u2019t do much for me today, but I soften a little. At least he\u2019s trying.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Father Tim,\u201d I say, extricating myself. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Plutarski doesn\u2019t acknowledge me as I come out, choosing instead to bustle frantically around the room to show just how busy they are. \u201cFather Tim, you\u2019ve really got to get going,\u201d she calls out for extra measure. I hate her.</p><p>I walk home slowly. My eyes automatically check for Colonel at each corner, and I almost expect a nose to bump reassuringly against my hand.</p><p>Mrs. K. is lying in wait for me. The second my foot hits the step, she opens her door. \u201cHello, dear,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mrs. K.,\u201d I say. The last thing I want to do is cut her toenails or plunge her toilet. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, Maggie, for me, at any rate. Here. I baked today. I can\u2019t remember the last time I baked. These are for you.\u201d She hands me a paper plate of peanut butter cookies, the crisscross marks sparkling with sugar. Her wizened, soft face is so kind and sweet that my eyes instantly fill.</p><p>\u201cNow, you probably need some time alone, so I won\u2019t keep you,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m here if you need me.\u201d She squeezes my arm and closes the door.</p><p>I open the door to my apartment and step in, then stand for a minute, facing my loss. I\u2019ve never come home and not had Colonel either with me or here to greet me. His bowl is still there, still filled with kibbles. His doggy bed, worn on one side where he draped his paw over the side these many years, seems enormously empty.</p><p>A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER, I\u2019m in my oldest, most comfortable flannel pajamas. Winged blue coffee cups float over an orange background, a color combination that explains why I got them for three dollars. Two inches of my ankle stick out, and my bosom?or lack thereof?is now coated with peanut butter cookie crumbs. Exhausted but not sleepy, I listlessly watch the Red Sox blow a four-run lead. My mother hates me, my father\u2019s disappearing, my sister\u2019s perfect, and hey. Let\u2019s not forget that my dog is dead. In a word, I\u2019m not feeling too chipper. Of course, that\u2019s when someone knocks on the door.</p><p>I heave myself off the couch. Probably Jonah, I think. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s the last thing I need. Malone.</p><p>I open the door. \u201cMalone, it\u2019s not the best time for me,\u201d I say, looking at his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute,\u201d he answers, pushing past me.</p><p>Why is he here? Do we need to break up? Did we have a relationship that actually requires a breakup scene? \u201cLook,\u201d I say, but I\u2019m talking to his back because he\u2019s ignoring me and going into the kitchen. Taking off his coat, even. The nerve. And opening a cabinet. Pretty rude, if you ask me. I stay where I am, hands on my hips. If he wants a fight, he\u2019s in for it. I am in no mood for shit today, as Mommy Dearest could attest. This has been a piss-poor day, and my throat grows tight with anger.</p><p>\u201cMalone, I really don\u2019t want you?\u201d</p><p>Malone comes back in the living room with two glasses of what looks and smells like scotch. He hands one to me, then clinks his glass against mine. \u201cTo Colonel. He was a great dog, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>Whatever hardness I\u2019m feeling crumbles like a sand castle. I cover my eyes, which have instantly filled with tears. \u201cMalone...\u201d I whisper. He puts his arms around me, kisses my head, and the kindness of the small gesture just destroys me. My fists clench in his shirt, and I sob against his chest.</p><p>\u201cJonah told me,\u201d he says, kissing me again. \u201cHere, take a drink. You\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s one of his longer speeches. I obey, wincing as I swallow. Then he leads me to the couch and sits down, pulling me with him, tucking my head against his shoulder. My tears leak out, wetting the wool of his sweater, and I hiccup occasionally. We sit there like that for a long time, watching the Sox lose, not saying anything. I sip the drink, feeling a pleasant warmth grow in my middle. Malone\u2019s fingers play idly in my hair, and I\u2019m curled against his side. My eyes begin to burn, my thoughts grow sketchy and jumbled.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember falling asleep, but when I wake up, I\u2019m in bed, the covers pulled up to my chin. My arm reaches out automatically, and I do touch a warm, solid figure, but it\u2019s not Colonel, of course. It\u2019s Malone. He\u2019s lying on top of the covers, fully dressed. The moonlight that pours through the window allows me to see that he\u2019s awake.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cDid you carry me to bed?\u201d</p><p>He nods once.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty strong, then,\u201d I say, and he smiles, tugging my heart.</p><p>He reaches out and pushes a strand of hair back from my face, his smile fading. \u201cMaggie,\u201d he says, his voice as gravelly as the stones at Jasper Beach, \u201cthe other night, when you came over...I wasn\u2019t exactly at my best.\u201d</p><p>My goodness. An apology. \u201cI think you\u2019re making up for it now,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cCan you spend the day with me tomorrow?\u201d he asks, still playing with my hair.</p><p>A date, I think. He wants to take me on a date. Octavio and Judy can run the place without me for a day. It\u2019s been known to happen. \u201cSure.\u201d My eyes are getting tired again. \u201cDo you want to come under the covers?\u201d I murmur. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty chilly.\u201d</p><p>The bed squeaks as he gets off it. I hear his clothes rustle, but I can\u2019t keep my eyes open another minute. He slides under the covers with me, minus his sweater, though the jeans and shirt remain. He pulls me against him, and I slip my hand under his shirt against his warm skin. Malone kisses my forehead, and in another minute, I\u2019m asleep.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>MALONE WAKES FIRST, sliding out of bed. \u201cMeet me at the dock at seven, okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, rubbing my eyes. He leaves, closing the door quietly behind him.</p><p>I get up, trying not to look for Colonel in every corner, and take a quick shower, then throw on some jeans and a sweater. I pause for a minute by Colonel\u2019s bed, kneeling down to pat the fleecy cushion. \u201cMiss you, buddy,\u201d I whisper. Then I call Octavio and tell him I\u2019m taking a day off.</p><p>\u201cSure, boss,\u201d he says. \u201cYou deserve it.\u201d</p><p>Now while seven isn\u2019t early if you work in a diner, it\u2019s downright late if you\u2019re a lobsterman. Most of the boats are already out, including the Twin Menace. Malone\u2019s Ugly Anne sits bobbing on its mooring as the tide rushes in. He\u2019s waiting for me by his dinghy.</p><p>\u201cSo are we going lobstering?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he says, handing me into the little boat.</p><p>The smell of herring, the bait lobstermen use for their traps, is musty and thick, but it\u2019s a smell I\u2019ve dealt with most of my life. Still, I breathe through my mouth until we get to the Ugly Anne, the waves slapping against the hull of the dinghy, spraying me occasionally. \u201cCharming name,\u201d I comment as we approach the boat. Malone\u2019s face creases into a smile. \u201cWho\u2019s Anne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cAnd does she know that you\u2019ve immortalized her this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh.\u201d He smiles but offers nothing more, climbing aboard and reaching out his hand to me. \u201cHave a seat,\u201d he says.</p><p>A lobster boat is all about work, nothing about comfort. There are no chairs, just an area in the middle where you can sit if you\u2019re so inclined, which the lobstermen aren\u2019t and therefore don\u2019t. The pilot house is crammed with equipment?a couple of radios, the GPS equipment, radar. There are barrels for bait and a holding tank for the lobsters. If Malone was going out to check pots, there\u2019d be ten or twelve extra traps stacked on deck and miles of line coiled and waiting, but each night, the lobstermen unload at the dock, and the deck is clear and empty right now. I sit on the gunwale, not wanting to get in the way.</p><p>Malone does his preflight check, as it were, and then starts her up and releases the Ugly Anne from her mooring. The wind is brisk as we head out to sea. Malone steers us past Douglas Point, dodging Cuthman\u2019s Shoal. Colorful buoys illustrate the water, so thick you could walk home, as Billy Bottoms would say, and we work our way as if navigating a maze. It takes us about twenty minutes to hit clear water, and even then the Maine coast is loaded with abrupt shoals, tiny islands, currents and tidal dangers. Once we\u2019re out a bit, Malone sets the wheel and glances over at me.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to check your traps?\u201d I guess, pulling the hood of my coat on.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going, then?\u201d</p><p>He adjusts the controls, then looks over to where I sit on the gunwale, insecure enough that I\u2019m clenching a handhold. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise,\u201d he says, unscrewing a thermos lid. \u201cWant some coffee?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pours me a cup?black?but I don\u2019t complain (or mention the fact that I just knew he took his coffee black). Then he turns his attention ahead, and I tilt my head back and watch the seagulls and cormorants that follow us, hoping for some bait. Colonel would have loved this, I think. The smells, the fish...maybe he\u2019d roll around in something foul, a pastime he loved above all others.</p><p>The sound of the motor is soothing, and the damp breeze is tinged with salt and the slight smell of fish. The sun flirts with the idea of putting in an appearance, then reconsiders, and strands of fog still hug the rocky, pine-dotted shoreline.</p><p>I sip my coffee and study the captain, who seems different out here. He\u2019s at ease, I realize, something I\u2019ve rarely seen in Malone. He checks the instrument panel occasionally, makes adjustments to throttle, steers steadily and with confidence. Because the door of the pilot house is open, the wind ruffles his hair and jacket. \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I answer.</p> <p>Malone points out a group of puffins, the fat little black-and-white birds toddling on the shore of a small island. I ask him a few questions about the boat, but otherwise we don\u2019t talk much. It\u2019s actually kind of nice, being quiet. The dark head of a seal pops up about ten yards off the port side. It watches us for a moment, the silky brown fur gleaming, then slips noiselessly beneath the surface. My hair blows around my face until Malone offers me an elastic, one of the thousands he has to slip over the strong claws of the lobsters. The motor is loud and strong, but not strong enough to drown out the cries of the gulls that follow us, or the slapping of the waves as we cross a wake or current.</p><p>After an hour or so, we once again encounter a sea of offshore buoys. Malone slows down, navigating carefully through them, and heads to a wooden dock where about a dozen other boats are tied.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cLinden Harbor.\u201d He doesn\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cAnd what are we doing here?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugs, looking a little sheepish. \u201cWell, there\u2019s a thing here. A lumberjack competition. Thought you might like to see it.\u201d He secures a line and steps onto the dock, then reaches a hand back for me.</p><p>\u201cA lumberjack competition?\u201d I ask, hopping off the boat.</p><p>\u201cAyuh. You know, tree cutting, axe throwing, the like. There\u2019s a little fair, too. Games, craft tent, that sort of thing. Good food, too.\u201d</p><p>Is he blushing? He turns for the gangplank before I can tell for sure.</p><p>\u201cMalone,\u201d I call.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis sounds suspiciously like a date, you know.\u201d I smile as I say it. \u201cSounds like you actually planned this.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrow at me, but he\u2019s smiling. \u201cYou want me to win you one of those ugly carny toys or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do, I do,\u201d I answer, tucking my arm through his and continuing up the dock. \u201cThe question is, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can, Maggie,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question really is, how much money will I lose doing it?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s almost surreal, being here with gloomy old Malone. Arm in arm, no less. There\u2019s a bubble of happiness in me, a strange and lovely new feeling as we head toward the tents on the town green. The smell of fish is drowned out with something deliciously cinnamon.</p><p>\u201cLooks like the rod and gun club\u2019s selling breakfast,\u201d Malone says. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m starving. Your bait fish was starting to look good.\u201d</p><p>Malone orders me a ham and egg sandwich, a cinnamon roll and a cup of coffee, then the same for himself. We take our food and sit at a table, watching people.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever seen you eat much, Malone,\u201d I comment around a mouthful of what is surely the best breakfast sandwich ever made.</p><p>\u201cAlmost every day,\u201d he says. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s walk around.\u201d</p><p>For this part of Maine, it\u2019s a pretty big event. We\u2019re too far south to have driven along the coast...it would have taken us hours, but by boat we were able to go in a fairly straight line. There\u2019s a small midway with a few rides. Kids dash from the merry-go-round to the Ferris wheel, tugging their parents\u2019 hands, asking for more rides, more food, more games. The happy sound of a fair washes over us in waves, the music from the rides, screams of kids, laughter of parents. Before I think about it, I slip my hand into Malone\u2019s. He turns his head to look at me, and as the corner of his mouth pulls up in a smile, my heart pulls, too.</p><p>\u201cWin a prize for the lady!\u201d calls a carny. \u201cShoot the target just three times, win a prize.\u201d A row of battered-looking BB guns lines the counter.</p><p>\u201cOh, goody,\u201d I say. \u201cHere\u2019s your chance, Malone. Prove your manliness and win me, oh, gosh, let\u2019s see...how about that blue stuffed rat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Don\u2019t you want that the pink zebra instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I\u2019m a blue rat kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue rat it is, then.\u201d</p><p>Twelve dollars later, I am the proud owner of the ugliest stuffed animal I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on. \u201cThank you, Malone,\u201d I say, kissing my prize.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. And I want you to know that gun barrel was bent.\u201d</p><p>We pass on the rides, as I\u2019m afraid of heights, and aside from the merry-go-round, the rest look like a quick way to die. Instead, we walk over to see the speed-climbing competition, the men scampering up forty-foot wooden posts with the agility of squirrels. When that event is over, we watch a man carve a life-size black bear from a huge block of wood.</p><p>\u201cThat would look great in front of the diner,\u201d I say, half serious. Malone laughs.</p><p>There\u2019s a crafts tent where quilts and afghans and embroidery hang on display, ribbons fluttering in the breeze. I pore over the baking tables, eyeing the coffeecakes and cookies, the beautiful pies and cheesecakes. Malone buys me a slice. \u201cI like a woman who can eat,\u201d he says, and I punch him in the arm.</p><p>\u201cSo, Malone,\u201d I say as I take a bite of the creamy, lemony cheesecake. \u201cAre you ever going to tell me your first name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d he asks. He doesn\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cBecause...because I just would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Well, too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ask Chantal, you know. She has all the public records. I bet your name is listed somewhere. Plus, I won\u2019t give you a bite of this cheesecake if you don\u2019t, and as you can see, it\u2019s disappearing fast. Your chances are dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother time, maybe.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cYou realize you don\u2019t talk that much, don\u2019t you, Malone?\u201d I say, taking the last bite of cheesecake.</p><p>\u201cYou talk enough for both of us,\u201d he says. He takes my hand again.</p><p>It\u2019s a wonderful day, not painfully cold, not raining, which by our standards means gorgeous. A barbershop quartet sings a corny song from World War II, and apparently some bagpipers will make an appearance later in the day.</p><p>By one-thirty, we\u2019ve exhausted the event, having seen every little corner of it, and we walk down to shore. There\u2019s a breakwater made from great slabs of rock, and we walk out on it a way, then sit. The stone is cold, but I don\u2019t mind. Malone puts his arm around me.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answer. I lean my head against his shoulder. \u201cSo, Malone,\u201d I say, \u201ctell me about your family.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t stiffen so much as go completely still. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Of course, the first thing I want to ask about is his daughter. A teenage daughter...what must that be like for him? And, let\u2019s be honest, what would that be like for me? Truthfully, I haven\u2019t dared to picture anything with Malone past what we\u2019ve had thus far, but I want to. Would his daughter approve of her dad having a girlfriend? Would we be friends? Would she hate me, refuse to come visit her dad, stick pins in a Maggie-style voodoo doll? I clear my throat. \u201cWell, you have a daughter, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre the two of you close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose as you can be when you live on opposite coasts,\u201d he says neutrally.</p><p>\u201cYou must miss her,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAyuh.\u201d</p><p>I stifle a sigh. The subject of his daughter seems closed. \u201cDid you know I went to school with your sister?\u201d I offer.</p><p>\u201cAyuh.\u201d</p><p>I wait, but more doesn\u2019t come. \u201cI seem to remember that you guys didn\u2019t have the best childhood,\u201d I venture carefully. It\u2019s not exactly true?Christy\u2019s the one who remembers, not me?but I hope it will open things up a little.</p><p>Malone\u2019s arm drops from my shoulders, and he turns to face me. \u201cMaggie?\u201d His mouth becomes a tight line. \u201cLook. You\u2019re right. It wasn\u2019t great. But it was a long time ago, and I took you here so you could have a nice day, all right? Let\u2019s not talk about this shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Fine.\u201d The lines between his eyebrows are fierce. All in good time, Maggie. I pick up his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. And I am having a nice day. Very nice.\u201d The lines soften. \u201cYou\u2019re being really sweet. In fact, I had no idea you could be such a prince.\u201d</p><p>At last he smiles, grudgingly. \u201cOkay. Well, it\u2019s been half an hour since you ate, so you must be starving. Want some chowder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about some lobster bisque? I want to support the local industry and all.\u201d</p><p>He stands up and pulls me to my feet, and we head back for the tents, stopping in front of a sign that says Best Freakin\u2019 Lobstah Bisque Evah. And I have to say, it just might be. As I scrape my bowl, I notice Malone\u2019s amused gaze.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really eat that much,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you barely eat at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean I don\u2019t eat your food,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI have noticed that, yes. Which is your loss, since my cooking skills are incredible.\u201d</p><p>He leans in close, his unshaven cheek scratching mine. \u201cI\u2019m more interested in your other skills, Maggie,\u201d he whispers. My knees grow weak, and I toss my empty bowl into a nearby trash can, then wrap my arms around his lean waist. He kisses me, that deliberate, wonderfully intense kiss, his lips warm and silky smooth in contrast to his rasping stubble.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he mutters. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the boat.\u201d</p><p>Malone steers the Ugly Anne out of the cove to the far side of a tiny island, where he teaches me a few more things about a lobster boat?that you can make love standing up in the pilot house, though there\u2019s little room for error. We bang into a few things here and there, and my legs are still shaking when we\u2019re finished, my breath coming in gasps.</p><p>\u201cSorry if I was too loud,\u201d I whisper. Sure, I\u2019m quiet now...two minutes ago, I was?well. Not quiet.</p><p>\u201cI thought you sounded just about right,\u201d Malone says, smiling against my neck. A few minutes later, Malone starts the engine once more and steers us out of the maze of lobster buoys.</p><p>I zip my jacket and watch Linden Harbor disappear behind us. Some hopeful seagulls follow the Ugly Anne for a while, then, realizing we\u2019re not going to catch anything, give up and wheel toward land.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Malone says from the pilot house.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOh, the fins on the turbo charger are clogged again. Damn it.\u201d</p><p>I go over to the little doorway. \u201cCan we get home okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll be fine for that. I\u2019ll just have to clean it later, see what\u2019s going on.\u201d He glances at me, then stands aside. \u201cHere. Want to be captain for a day?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re already away from the buoys and lines that could become entangled in the propellers, so I\u2019m safe enough. Malone stands behind me, gently correcting my course when he needs to, and I lean against him, his chin resting on my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you like lobstering?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cTough life, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat life, too.\u201d He smiles at me. \u201cOkay, look out there, Maggie, we\u2019ve got some porpoises about three o\u2019clock.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know what, Malone?\u201d I ask as we watch the silvery-white flashing of the porpoises.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cThis is the best day I\u2019ve had in a long time.\u201d I turn away from the wheel to kiss his cheek.</p><p>\u201cWatch out there,\u201d he says as the boat veers suddenly. He reaches around me and adjusts us. \u201cTide\u2019s coming at us pretty strong.\u201d He swings us back around. \u201cMe, too, by the way.\u201d</p><p>When we get back to the dock, it\u2019s near dinner time. \u201cDo you want to try out my cooking skills, Malone? Since you\u2019ve sampled my other skills already?\u201d I smile as he makes the boat fast to the mooring.</p> <p>He straightens up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Maggie,\u201d he says. \u201cI need to fix the charger before morning, and it\u2019s an ugly job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly deflated. Malone climbs into the dinghy and reaches up to help me, and before I know it, we\u2019re back at the dock. Billy Bottoms waves to us from the gangplank, heading for home, but aside from him, no one seems to be around.</p><p>\u201cWell, okay. Thanks, Malone. It was, um, a very nice day. Thank you so much.\u201d I feel my cheeks grow hot as we stand there, looking at each other. The old uncertainty about the two of us has returned.</p><p>\u201cSee you soon,\u201d he says. He pinches my chin. When? I want to ask, but I can tell his mind is on his boat.</p><p>\u201cThanks again. Bye.\u201d I scurry up the gangplank to solid ground and walk home.</p> <p>There are four messages waiting for me?Christy, Jonah, Chantal and Father Tim. They all want the same thing?to know how I\u2019m doing, if I want company. But for tonight, I think I want to be alone. The sadness I feel over the loss of my pet is tempered with Malone\u2019s surprising sweetness, and I want a night to indulge in both of those feelings. I put a frozen pizza in the oven and then pack up Colonel\u2019s things in a box, letting myself have a vigorous cry as I do. Someday I\u2019ll get another dog, but there will never be a friend like Colonel. But I do have a new friend?Malone. When I needed it most, he really came through.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>IN A SHOCKING NEW DEVELOPMENT to our relationship, Malone actually picks up the phone and calls me a couple of days after our date, just when I\u2019m starting to grow irritated. Jonah had mentioned that Malone had to go down to Bar Harbor for a part, so I had granted him a grace period, but his time was running out. And I miss him, I realize with a bit of a shock.</p><p>When the phone finally rings around five on Thursday night, I am washing my kitchen floor, wondering how it gets so dirty when I am the only one who lives here. I actually expect it to be Father Tim, wanting to hit me up for the upcoming bake sale.</p><p>\u201cMaggie,\u201d comes the gruff voice.</p><p>\u201cMalone! My God! You\u2019re using a phone!\u201d I can\u2019t help the smile that has burst over my face.</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d he says. There\u2019s a pause, then, \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. How are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. So. Are you busy tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cut right to the chase, don\u2019t you, Malone?\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question,\u201d he growls.</p><p>\u201cSorry, pal. I\u2019m busy. I\u2019m babysitting my niece tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cAll right, then. What about tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>My grin fades a bit. \u201cWell, actually, tomorrow I\u2019m supposed to have dinner with, um, a friend. With Father Tim. A bunch of us, actually. Church people. You know.\u201d It\u2019s an appreciation dinner Father Tim hosts for the five or six of us who do everything he asks. \u201cHow about Saturday?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer for a minute. \u201cSure. Saturday\u2019s fine. Seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven o\u2019clock. Um, do you want me to cook you dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Maggie,\u201d he says, his voice dropping to a scraping bottom note. \u201cDon\u2019t cook for me.\u201d My body reacts as if he\u2019d said he\u2019d like to just rip off my clothes and take me on the floor.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I answer in a strangled whisper, suddenly needing to sag against the counter. \u201cNo cooking.\u201d</p><p>CHRISTY IS ALL DRESSED UP in a long, pretty skirt and filmy blouse, and Will looks preppy and handsome as always, blue blazer and Dockers.</p><p>\u201cBye, Snooky,\u201d my sister says, smothering Violet in kisses and a cloud of Eternity. \u201cMommy loves you! Yes she does! Mommy loves Violet! Aaaah...bwah!\u201d She simulates the noise Violet makes when kissing someone.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough,\u201d I say, prying my niece out of Christy\u2019s arms. \u201cGet out, you clearly need a strong drink. Bye, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Mags. Thanks, as always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, actually. Violet, honey, it\u2019s Auntie time!\u201d</p><p>Violet grabs chunks of my hair and pulls with glee.</p><p>For the next hour, we play Farmyard Animals?at least, I do, crawling around on the floor, mooing, oinking, quacking?while Violet chortles and throws plastic toys for me to fetch.</p><p>\u201cMooo,\u201d I say, retrieving the yellow ring.</p><p>\u201cOooo,\u201d she echoes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a genius,\u201d I tell her. \u201cSmart baby. Violet is a very smart baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBanuck,\u201d she agrees.</p><p>As I hover over her crib, watching her sleep a little while later, I indulge, very briefly, in a domestic fantasy. Just trying it on for size, I tell myself, blushing. Me, watching the baby sleep. Malone, standing in the doorway. The baby has black hair like her daddy, gray eyes like me.</p><p>Then, embarrassed with my private stupidity, I go into the kitchen to see what Christy\u2019s left me to eat. She may not pay me to babysit, but she does feed me well. Ooh. Tuna casserole, our mutual favorite and something our mom refuses to cook, and chocolate chip cookies. Good sissy.</p><p>I\u2019m watching TV when they come back, flushed and cheery. \u201cMy God, you guys,\u201d I comment, dragging my gaze away from Donald Trump\u2019s latest victim, \u201cwere you doing it in the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really uncanny,\u201d Will says. \u201cThe whole twin thing?creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I tell him. \u201cThe fact that your pants are unzipped was just confirmation.\u201d</p><p>Will grins, zips and flies upstairs to look in on his precious while Christy flops down on the couch next to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do with Violet?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cOh, the usual. We lit matches and I gave her a few sips of vodka, which she really seemed to like, and then we went up on the widow\u2019s walk, and I let her stand on the railing. It was fun.\u201d</p><p>Christy hits me with a throw pillow. \u201cSo are you doing okay?\u201d she asks. \u201cAbout Colonel and all?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019m okay. It\u2019s weird, though. I\u2019ve never been without him, really. Not as an adult.\u201d My eyes grow misty, but I smile.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you the other day? I called you and even swung by, but Octavio said you took the day off.\u201d</p><p>I tell her about Malone, how he came over and slept on my bed like a good dog himself, how he took me to the festival, how incredibly nice he was the whole day.</p><p>\u201cSo you guys are...what? Dating? Back together?\u201d she asks. She takes a cookie from the tin on the coffee table and bites into it. \u201cThese are great, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they are. And I guess we\u2019re sort of...well...yeah. Dating. I guess so.\u201d</p><p>Christy cocks an eyebrow at me. \u201cYou\u2019re not sure?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cWell, it\u2019s weird. He\u2019s?he was great, he really was. But it\u2019s not like...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s still kind of a stranger. When we were at the lumberjack thing, I asked him a couple of questions, you know, normal things, like if he\u2019s close with his daughter. What his first name is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t know?\u201d Christy interrupts.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. And he never really tells me anything. So we\u2019re together, but I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re just sleeping together or if we\u2019re actually going somewhere relationship-wise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s a great idea. Why don\u2019t you ask him?\u201d my sister suggests.</p><p>I grimace. \u201cYeah,\u201d I muse, taking another cookie. It may be my fifth. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not, dummy? It shouldn\u2019t be a mystery. You have a right to know what he\u2019s thinking. I mean, what if he just wants a warm body once in a while and here you want marriage and children? I think you should ask.\u201d</p><p>I consider this. She has a point, of course, but then again, she\u2019s never confronted the challenge of engaging Malone in conversation, let alone relationship conversation. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>I think about it as I walk home. The night is cool and misty, the damp air soft and gentle against my cheeks. Of course, my reluctance to talk to Malone stems from the fear that he does indeed just want a warm body. Then again, if that\u2019s the case, I shouldn\u2019t be wasting my time with him. As usual, Christy has a point. How irritating.</p><p>MY FATHER COMES IN for breakfast the next day, alone. He sits at a booth, which is fine, since the place is deserted this morning. Since six o\u2019clock, I\u2019ve had a grand total of four customers. I\u2019ve paid my monthly bills, sent in my order to the food suppliers and cleaned the bathroom, and it\u2019s only nine o\u2019clock. Judy left at eight, disgusted with the lack of patrons for her to ignore, and Georgie only comes in three times a week.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad,\u201d I call from behind the counter. \u201cWhat would you like today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe just some coffee when you have a chance, dear,\u201d he says. He looks out the window, his face somber. I come over and pour him a cup, then sit down.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay, Daddy? You look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother and I are getting divorced,\u201d he interrupts.</p><p>My mouth falls open, but no sound comes out, just a little wheeze. Dad shifts in his seat, then looks at the table, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, pumpkin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?you?but?\u201d</p><p>Dad sighs hugely. \u201cI know. We\u2019ve been married for thirty-three years now. Seems silly, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>My eyes fill, and I grab a wad of napkins out of the dispenser and blot. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Nothing big, really. It\u2019s just?\u201d He pauses, fiddling with the silverware. \u201cIt\u2019s not your mother\u2019s fault,\u201d he continues. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to...I\u2019m trying to say this gently, understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t want to live with Mom for the rest of your life,\u201d I supply.</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m tired of hiding in the bomb shelter.\u201d</p><p>I sit up a little straighter. \u201cDad, look. I know Mom can be quite a...harridan sometimes. I mean, I certainly get tired of her nagging me all the time, but I thought...\u201d My voice chokes off suddenly. \u201cI thought you loved her,\u201d I finish in a hoarse whisper.</p><p>Dad\u2019s own eyes tear up. \u201cI do. I did. But Maggie, the past few years...well, we haven\u2019t been happy. She hasn\u2019t been happy, and I\u2019m just exhausted with trying to guess what mood she\u2019s in and why and how I can make it better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does she think about all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s furious.\u201d Dad\u2019s mouth tightens again, then wobbles. \u201cShe told me if that\u2019s what I want, then I\u2019m even a bigger idiot than she thought and she\u2019d be glad to get rid of me.\u201d</p><p>Sounds like Mom, all right.</p><p>Mom was never the kind of cookie-baking, Girl Scout leader mother depicted in most of our childhood books. She took care of us, certainly, fed us nutritious meals and sent us to bed on time. But there was always an edge to her, and while I never doubted her love, I often doubted that she liked me very much. Christy dealt with her better. She was the quieter, more studious, more helpful child, while I tended to be a little sneakier, disappearing when the kitchen needed cleaning up, drifting into the bathroom when the groceries had to be unpacked. And with Jonah, the classic little boy, always grubby, always making messes and losing things, Mom\u2019s thin patience had evaporated completely. Only after he moved out did Jonah become someone my mother really seemed to enjoy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe had to get married, you know,\u201d my father tells me, interrupting my bemused thoughts.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother was pregnant with you girls when we got married.\u201d Dad, more composed now, takes a sip of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re love children?\u201d I blurt. \u201cChristy and I are love children?\u201d</p> <p>My father gives a half smile. \u201cAyuh. You never figured it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Dad! One bombshell at a time!\u201d</p><p>Octavio sticks his head out the door. \u201cYou still need me, boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Tavy. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna run home before lunch, if that\u2019s okay,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cSure, sure. Fine.\u201d A moment later, the back door closes, and Dad and I are completely alone. I look at my dad in a new light. \u201cSo. You knocked up that nice Lena Gray and had to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. You and Christy?two for the price of one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Mom want to get married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Maggie, that\u2019s what you did back then. None of this unwed mother stuff that goes on nowadays. You got a girl pregnant, you married her, and fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your anniversary is really...when?\u201d Because my parents never really celebrated their special day (the reason now a little more clear), it was never a big event in our calendar year to begin with.</p><p>\u201cWe got married on March fifteenth. You and Christy came along six months later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe ides of March? You got married on the ides of March, Dad?\u201d I start laughing. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re getting divorced. \u2018Beware the ides of March, Caesar,\u2019\u201d I quote. \u201cShakespeare knew what he was talking about.\u201d</p><p>Dad graces me with a smile, but his eyes are sad. \u201cListen, sweetheart, your mother\u2019s going to need a little sympathy. Don\u2019t be too hard on her, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re not really speaking at the moment,\u201d I tell him. \u201cNot since I kicked her out of the diner the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. Well, it would be nice if you could patch things up.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cYeah. Sure. She only insulted my beloved dog on the day he died.\u201d</p><p>Dad sighs again. \u201cI know, Maggie. But do it for me, won\u2019t you, dear?\u201d</p><p>Of course I will, and Dad knows it. \u201cHave you told Christy and Jonah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Joe last night. I\u2019m headed for Christy\u2019s now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you want me to tell her, Dad? You must be worn out.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shine with gratitude. \u201cThat would be great, honey. I\u2019d appreciate that. You know you\u2019re my best girl, now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I know you say the same thing to Christy, you dog.\u201d I slide around to sit next to my father, wrapping my arms around his neck. \u201cI love you, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, baby,\u201d he whispers. \u201cSorry about all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying? I can\u2019t imagine you both in the same house, if Mom\u2019s on a tear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my lawyer said not to leave home just yet?\u201d His lawyer! He\u2019s already called a lawyer! \u201c?so I\u2019m still there. In the cellar, as usual.\u201d</p><p>He leaves a minute later. I watch him walk down the street, his shoulders slumped, eyes on the pavement. Poor Dad. He must feel completely desperate if he\u2019s resorted to this. And yet not just desperate?actually doing something about it.</p><p>I summon my sister to a late lunch at Joe\u2019s Diner and break the news as she eats. Christy isn\u2019t as stunned as I expect her to be. \u201cI always wondered about that,\u201d she muses. \u201cIf they had to get married. It makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean it explains why Mom\u2019s been in a bad mood since the day we were born?\u201d I say, far less sympathetic than my sister. She really deserves her title of \u201cthe good twin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, Maggie. I mean, in those days, there was a lot of shame over being pregnant before you were married. So suddenly she\u2019s twenty-two years old, and her life is mapped out for her. No choice in the matter now. She\u2019d just finished college, remember? She wanted to be an editor in New York City, and instead she\u2019s pregnant and living in her hometown, knitting booties. For twins. The icing on the cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to be an editor? I never heard that,\u201d I say. Christy breaks off a piece of grilled cheese and offers it to Violet, who opens her mouth as obediently as a baby bird.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Christy turns away from her baby to look at me. \u201cImagine, Maggie. The first girl in our family ever to go to college. Granddad would have been so proud, the whole town would have talked about it, little Lena, a college girl, look at that. And then bam. She\u2019s pregnant. Knocked up. No career, no New York, just mud season and black flies and two colicky babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does put things in a new light. You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll done, Violet?\u201d Christy asks. \u201cAre you all done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBwee,\u201d Violet says, squirming in the high chair. \u201cNahbo.\u201d</p><p>I gird my loins for battle and call my mom that afternoon, but the gods are merciful and I get the machine. \u201cHey, Mom, it\u2019s Maggie. I heard the news...um, sorry. Uh, I\u2019ll call you later, okay? Hope you\u2019re okay. Bye.\u201d A feeble message, but a message nonetheless.</p><p>I drop in on Mrs. K. for a visit and a chat, leaving my parents\u2019 situation out of it. Mrs. K.\u2019s grand-niece is coming to get her for the weekend, and my tiny tenant is busy packing.</p><p>\u201cWere you happily married, Mrs. K.?\u201d I ask as her gnarled hands fold sweaters with surprising agility. Though she\u2019s only going for two days, she\u2019s got six complete outfits laid out on the bed. I sit on the comforter, handing her clothes as directed.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she replies. \u201cWe were. I\u2019ll take those pink argyles, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was your secret?\u201d I smile, knowing how she loves to talk about Mr. K., who\u2019s been dead for more than twenty years.</p><p>\u201cI think, dear, that our secret was lots of sex,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. \u201cYou can\u2019t be too unhappy if you\u2019re having lots of sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I\u2019m blushing. \u201cWell. Good for you. That\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss it, I must say,\u201d she says. \u201cOf course, now it would probably kill me, but if you\u2019re going to die...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. K.!\u201d I laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re so surprising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, people aren\u2019t really so different, Maggie,\u201d she tells me. \u201cDear, I need that cardigan. You and that scowling man, what\u2019s his name? McCoy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalone,\u201d I mumble, my face igniting.</p><p>\u201cYes, Malone. From the sounds of it, you\u2019ll be very happy.\u201d She laughs merrily. \u201cYou were quite rosy when you came home the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Must run. Have a wonderful weekend.\u201d Mortified and secretly pleased to have impressed the old lady, I kiss her cheek and flee upstairs.</p><p>And speaking of secretly pleased, there\u2019s a part of me that can\u2019t help feeling a little...smug...about my parents\u2019 divorce. Though it\u2019s a shock, and not a good one, there\u2019s a certain sense of vindication floating around in my chest.</p><p>I always thought my father was too good for my mom. She never seemed to appreciate him, always picked on him, ordering him about like Napoleon sending his troops to Russia. And like Napoleon, she\u2019d gone too far. I\u2019m sorry for the embarrassment and discomfort, sorry that our family will never be the same, but it seems my mother had this coming.</p><p>I pull out one of my nicer sweaters and take a little time with some makeup. The volunteer appreciation dinner is guaranteed to be a fun event. Father Tim feeds us well, gives us plenty to drink. We usually out stay fairly late. Last time, Beth Seymour played the piano and we all sang. Later, several of us went into the church, supposedly for a midnight prayer, and ended up laughing so hard that Betty Zebrowski wet her pants. It\u2019s one of the better parties in town.</p><p>When I get to the rectory, everyone else is already there?Mrs. Plutarski, unfortunately, Louise Evans, Mabel Greenwood, Jacob Pelletier, Noah Grimley and Beth Seymour. Betty the pants-wetter is in the hospital for bladder suspension surgery.</p><p>\u201cMaggie!\u201d Father Tim barks as I enter. He leaps over to me and takes my hand warmly, holding on to it for a long moment. \u201cHow are you, dearie?\u201d he asks. \u201cI called you the other day, but you weren\u2019t home. I\u2019ve been thinking of you and your lovely Colonel, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Father Tim,\u201d I say, warmed by his consideration.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you came. Now the party can really begin. A drink, Maggie? I\u2019ve broken out the good stuff, and it\u2019s going faster than the devil in a roomful of Baptists.\u201d</p><p>Father Tim is in top form. He passes hors d\u2019oeuvres, prying the tray out of Mrs. Plutarski\u2019s clenched hands as she tries to nail her part as \u201cmost helpful one here.\u201d Though I often compete for that role, tonight I\u2019m content to be waited on. I chew contentedly on scallops wrapped in bacon and lobster cheese puffs and chat with Jacob, who reshingled the leaky part of St. Mary\u2019s roof last year.</p><p>\u201cThese are delicious, Father Tim.\u201d I gesture with my lobster puff as the priest refills my glass.</p><p>\u201cI knew they were your favorite, Maggie,\u201d he says with a crooked grin. \u201cI\u2019d serve them at Mass if it\u2019d get you coming back.\u201d I smile in response but don\u2019t answer. Jake wanders off to flirt with Louise Evans?apparently they had a thing in high school, some forty years past?and Father Tim\u2019s face grows serious.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, I had a talk with your dear mother today,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow. That was fast. Yes.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cHow is she? I called her but she wasn\u2019t in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s devastated, of course. And hoping your father will see the light. I\u2019ve offered to do some counseling in the hope that we can make things better without having to resort to...well, you know.\u201d He pats my hand, then squeezes it. \u201cIt must be terrible for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a shock,\u201d I say carefully. \u201cThe thing is, Father Tim, my mother?well, she\u2019s not an easy person to live with. And she doesn\u2019t really try to see anyone else\u2019s point of view, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I do, Maggie, that I do. And yet we\u2019re talking about the sacrament of marriage. It\u2019s to be preserved at all costs. You don\u2019t just walk away from someone you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I say. \u201cYes, of course. But my father\u2019s been henpecked for years, Father Tim. You\u2019ve seen that, haven\u2019t you? She really doesn\u2019t...well. Maybe now\u2019s not the time to talk about it,\u201d I say as Beth makes desperate eye contact with me. Noah Grimley has left the platter of shrimp cocktail and moved on to her, and as he\u2019s old enough to be her grandfather and missing his front teeth to boot, I must intervene. She did the same for me last fall.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can talk later,\u201d Father Tim suggests.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Not that I\u2019m dying to discuss my parents\u2019 marriage with anyone, to tell the truth. I walk over to Noah and ask about his new boat, a subject guaranteed to take any man\u2019s mind off sex, at least on the coast of Maine.</p><p>The party is wonderful. Father Tim entertains us, feeds us, pours drinks until we\u2019re all buzzed and laughing at stories of his Irish childhood, the pranks played by his six older brothers and sisters. And I can\u2019t help feeling special?it seems that he\u2019s going out of his way to acknowledge our friendship. \u201cWell, of course, poor Maggie\u2019s heard this one already,\u201d he says at the beginning of a story, or \u201cWhen Maggie and her daddy and I went to Machias last fall to pick up the statue from Our Lady of Fatima...\u201d Edith Plutarski\u2019s face grows more and more sour, I note through the pleasant fog of wine. Definitely the sign of a happy night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When we can eat no more, Father Tim walks us to the door. \u201cDrive safely, Jacob,\u201d he calls to our token teetotaler. Jake\u2019ll be driving everyone who lives more than a few blocks from here, though Noah and I will walk back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tag along with the two of you, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Father Tim offers. \u201cI could do with a bit of air myself.\u201d</p><p>Noah wraps a few shrimp in a napkin and slides them into his pocket. Father Tim and I pretend not to notice. \u201cYou coming, Noah?\u201d I ask as he surveys the rest of the leftovers.</p><p>\u201cAyuh,\u201d he grunts.</p> <p>The night air is cold, feeling more like February than April, but it feels good after being in the stuffy rectory. Noah\u2019s street is a block or two before mine, and Father Tim shakes his hand. \u201cThank you for coming, my good man,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Noah responds. \u201c\u2019Night, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Noah.\u201d</p><p>Father Tim pauses. \u201cWell. I\u2019ll just see you the rest of the way home, shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I answer. It\u2019s only a block. I can\u2019t help but notice that Father Tim looks...well, quite sad. My heart tugs.</p> <p>\u201cIs everything okay, Father Tim?\u201d I ask as we walk.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny you bring that up,\u201d he says softly, his eyes scanning the heavens before returning to my face. As ever, the old attraction thrills through me as I look at his gentle eyes, his perfect bone structure. He doesn\u2019t say anything for a minute, and my heart starts thumping with nervousness. Or maybe it\u2019s guilt for still finding him so appealing. \u201cWell. Difficult decisions lie ahead,\u201d he says obliquely, sounding more like a fortune cookie than a priest. He doesn\u2019t elaborate, and I don\u2019t ask him to.</p><p>It only takes a minute more to get to my little house. Father Tim turns to me. \u201cI hope you know you\u2019re a special friend to me, Maggie,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cA great friend.\u201d</p><p>Weird. \u201cSure.\u201d I swallow. \u201cRight back at you.\u201d I glance up at my house to see if Mrs. K. is spying, then remember that she\u2019s out of town for the weekend.</p><p>\u201cYou have a way about you, Maggie,\u201d Tim says quietly. \u201cI hope you know that. Even if things change, I hope...well.\u201d He looks at me intently, as if he\u2019s trying to telecommunicate something.</p><p>If things change...what the heck does that mean? What\u2019s he trying to say? My face flushes. \u201cThat\u2019s nice. You\u2019re so nice. And?and?tonight. Was nice. Really nice. Thank you, Father Tim.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t move, just continues to look deeply into my eyes, then looks away, sighing. \u201cWell. Good night now, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night! Thank you. Thanks, Father Tim! For everything. Bye, now!\u201d I scurry the remaining distance to my porch, then race up the stairs, glad, perhaps for the first time, to put some distance between me and Father Tim.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>\u201cI HAVE A DATE with Malone,\u201d I tell my reflection the next afternoon. \u201cJust have to go see Mom, get that over with, and then I have a date. With Malone.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a calming thought. Malone, after all, is not my angry mother. Nor is he a priest. No vows of chastity for Malone, that\u2019s for sure. \u201cAnd thank goodness for that,\u201d I grin.</p><p>But something is definitely going on with Father Tim, and I\u2019m not sure I want to spend a lot of thought on what it could be. When he didn\u2019t come into the diner this morning, I was surprised to find myself a bit relieved.</p><p>However, any sense of reprieve I might feel is cancelled out by the dread I have of seeing my mother. Still, I can\u2019t just ignore her, so I pedal my bike out to my parents\u2019 house, take a few cleansing breaths outside and go in. Dad is nowhere in sight, as usual, but Mom is sitting at the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d I say, bending down to kiss her cheek.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Maggie. Hello,\u201d she answers. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, pulling out a chair and sitting. \u201cWhat about you? This must be very...\u201d My voice trails off.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Yes, it is. Very.\u201d She stares at the table. \u201cSo. What\u2019s new? Did you get another dog yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no. I think I\u2019ll wait a while. Mom, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She sighs and looks at the ceiling. \u201cNo, Maggie. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m the town laughingstock, dear. Divorce after all these years. Poor Mitchell Beaumont couldn\u2019t stand it another minute. That\u2019s what they\u2019re all saying, you know. Nice old Mitch, married to that bitch.\u201d She gives a grim smile to acknowledge her rhyme.</p><p>\u201cOh, jeezum, Mom, I don\u2019t think people are saying that,\u201d I blurt, though I myself have thought almost those same words verbatim. Many times.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve always been naive,\u201d she says. \u201cWant a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...no.\u201d I watch as she gets a bottle of vodka out of the freezer and pours herself a half a glass, then adds a shot of orange juice. It may be the first time I\u2019ve ever seen her drink anything other than white zinfandel.</p><p>She takes a healthy swallow, pats down a stray lock of her curly hair, then sits back down with a thump. \u201cSo. What do you want me to say? Or would you like to tell me I\u2019m a bad mother?\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head, looking at her. She actually looks quite pretty today, for some reason. Then I see what it is; she\u2019s not wearing makeup. \u201cYou\u2019re not a bad mother, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you for saying that.\u201d She takes another slug of her pale orange drink.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I blurt, \u201cyou were kind of rushed into marrying Dad, being a mother, all that. Maybe this is your chance to have some independence, start a new life, you know. That kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rich, Maggie,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m fifty-five years old. I don\u2019t want a new life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want your old one, either,\u201d I point out cautiously. \u201cYou\u2019ve been unhappy most of your life, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, she reaches out and takes my hand, frowning automatically at the roughness, my short fingernails, the cut on my left middle finger. \u201cI want to tell you that\u2019s not true,\u201d she admits slowly. \u201cI do love you kids. And your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know that, Mom,\u201d I tell her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so generous, Maggie,\u201d she snaps, and only she could make it sound like such a put-down. \u201cOh, it makes me mad sometimes! You\u2019re just like my father, and your father, as well! Everything, anything for everyone and anyone! It drives me crazy, honey! You give away everything and never take anything for yourself, you with all the chances I never had! My God, honey, do you want to end up like me?\u201d</p><p>My mouth hangs open, but Mom is on a roll. \u201cTake a good look, Maggie! I was all set to have a life I\u2019d dreamed of. Get out of Washington County, get out of Maine and live in a big city, have a career, really do something. I imagined myself climbing up the ladder at some publishing house, becoming like Jackie O or something, surrounded by books and creativity and excitement.\u201d Her fist slams down on the table, her voice rising. \u201cAnd I ended up here, working in a stupid doctor\u2019s office instead! And now my goddamn husband is divorcing me and I\u2019m terrified!\u201d</p><p>My mother bursts into tears. I get up from my seat and kneel next to her, gingerly putting my arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I say gently. \u201cListen. Calm down. It\u2019s going to be okay. Daddy\u2019s not going to kick you into the street or anything. You\u2019ll be fine. And if you want to do something else, you can now. This is a second chance for you. You can move, you can get another job, do anything...Don\u2019t cry, Mom.\u201d</p><p>But she continues to sob. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Maggie,\u201d she chokes out. \u201cIt\u2019s too late. I\u2019m too old. You can\u2019t teach an old dog young tricks. And before you know it, honey, you\u2019re going to be just like me.\u201d</p><p>SO, OKAY, that didn\u2019t go too well, I think as I ride home. That was definitely not good.</p><p>I never thought of my mother as \u201cpoor Mom,\u201d but I can\u2019t seem to help it right now. Maybe Father Tim\u2019s right, maybe my parents should work it out. Then again, it seems like my dad has suffered enough. Besides, it\u2019s not like they\u2019d be fighting for their old happy life. Maybe a divorce will give them both a new chance. Clean slate, all that crap. But I\u2019m shaking a little. My mother was never afraid of anything before.</p><p>I decide to go to Malone\u2019s house, even though we had said seven at mine. I don\u2019t care. He\u2019ll have to deal with me showing up on his doorstep two hours early.</p><p>Malone\u2019s house is at the top of a hill, and I get off my bike and push it up the steep incline. When I\u2019m a few doors away, I hear the nicest sound?someone\u2019s playing the piano. I pause and listen, but the wind is pretty strong, and I can\u2019t catch it all.</p><p>Afraid that he won\u2019t play if he knows I\u2019m there, I push my bike into the neighbor\u2019s driveway, then walk into Malone\u2019s small yard, making my way around a couple of lobster traps that are stacked neatly near the side of the house. The living room window is open, and I can hear quite well now. Smiling, I sit down on the ground, resting my back against the sun-warmed shingles. Malone continues to play, so I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve remained undetected.</p><p>The song is lovely, a sweet, delicate melody. Occasionally, there\u2019s a change in key, so it goes from happy to sad, though the melody is still essentially the same. It sounds difficult, and once in a while, Malone stops and goes back to repeat a bit of the song. I even hear him swear once?\u201cShit,\u201d followed by the correct notes, then, \u201cGotcha.\u201d A car pulls up on the street, not far from Malone\u2019s, and I hope the driver doesn\u2019t see me. It would be embarrassing to be caught sitting here.</p><p>I don\u2019t get caught.</p><p>Instead, there\u2019s a knock on Malone\u2019s door. He stops playing. I\u2019m about to get up when I hear a familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cMalone? Oh, thank God you\u2019re home.\u201d It\u2019s Chantal. I freeze, midcrouch.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Malone asks. Their voices are as clear as if I were in the same room.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Malone, you\u2019re not going to believe this.\u201d I think Chantal may be crying, and a strange sense of apprehension pins me to where I squat. \u201cDo you have a sec? I need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asks. I hear the squeak of springs, a rustle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>The air is sucked out of my lungs. Chantal is pregnant? And she\u2019s telling?</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ,\u201d Malone says. \u201cOh, honey.\u201d Chantal bursts into tears.</p><p>The realization hits me slowly, their voices fading to a background undertone.</p><p>Chantal is pregnant. And Malone...</p><p>\u201cHow far along?\u201d Malone asks, his voice coming back into reception.</p><p>\u201cJust a couple weeks. I don\u2019t know what to do, Malone. This is the worst?\u201d</p><p>My vision swims, my hearing fades, and my hands are clenched over my mouth. I\u2019ve never fainted before, but this must be close. A couple of weeks.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, Malone and I were sleeping together. And, apparently, he was also sleeping with Chantal.</p><p>I don\u2019t realize that I\u2019ve left my spot under the window until I grip the cold handlebars of my bike. Without making a sound, I push it robotically down the road. When I reach Water Street, I climb on and ride to my sister\u2019s house.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter, I tell myself over and over, the wind biting my damp cheeks. There was nothing real between us anyway.</p><p>But it seems that there was, because I\u2019m crying so hard I can barely see.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>THERE\u2019S A MESSAGE on my answering machine when I finally return to my apartment the next afternoon. I\u2019ve been hiding at Christy\u2019s, and yes, I told her the whole story. She and Will fed me, let me put Violet to bed and opened a good bottle of wine. I slept in the guest room and went straight to the diner this morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The light on the answering machine blinks, waiting to tell me the big news. It takes me a minute to push the button.</p><p>\u201cHey, Maggie, it\u2019s Malone. Uh...thought we were getting together tonight. Call me later.\u201d</p><p>Really. He thought we were getting together. Not when another woman is carrying his child, that\u2019s for damn sure.</p><p>I flop down in a chair and hug a worn throw pillow to my stomach, my eyes hard. Chantal made no bones about the fact that she found Malone attractive. That she\u2019d put the moves on him before. And she mentioned something about him having a crush on her once, long ago. Or more recently, as the evidence indicates. Yes, God forbid that Chantal doesn\u2019t get a man. Every damn male in town is required to adore her, aren\u2019t they? I clench my teeth hard, willing the lump in my throat to dissolve.</p> <p>The edges of the throw pillow are frayed, the material thin from years of use. I really should make it a new cover, but why bother? In fact, as I look around my cramped little apartment, impatience rushes through me. Why do I have all this crap? Does anyone really need six TableTop pie tins? So what if they\u2019re collectibles? Suddenly, I hate collectibles. Collectibles. Why not just call them what they are? Old junk. Why own them? To collect cobwebs? If that\u2019s their purpose, they\u2019re doing an excellent job.</p><p>I jump up, grab some garbage bags and newspaper and start wrapping with a vengeance. I should have a yard sale. Or bring this crap to an antiques dealer. Suddenly, I want to have a spartan, clean living space. Just floor and futon, Japanese style. Or Swedish, maybe, with just a streamlined dresser for my clothes.</p><p>And clothes! I practically leap into the bedroom and rip open my bureau drawers. How many sweaters do I really need, anyway? About a third of them are my father\u2019s cardigans, which I\u2019ve stolen over the years?maybe he\u2019ll want them back. And God, look at how many stained T-shirts I have. Working in a diner is no excuse. Surely I can afford clean shirts. When I dribble gravy or coffee on them and can\u2019t get the stain out, into the trash they shall go. Maybe I should have T-shirts made up for the diner. Yes. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. That will eliminate the question of what to wear every day. Just a black T-shirt with red writing. Joe\u2019s Diner, established 1933, Gideon\u2019s Cove, ME. Perfect. The summer nuisance will love them.</p><p>Ruthlessly, I stuff half a dozen shirts into a trash bag, vaguely noting logos of places I\u2019ve been, sayings I thought were cute. Stupid cluttering crap. I barely pause at the blue rat, stuffing it with far greater force than necessary into the giant black trash bag. Good. Bury it. Stupid cheap thing.</p><p>After Skip traded me in for a classier model, I moved in here, renting the place from some summer people who had bought it as an investment. When Gideon\u2019s Cove failed to be the new Bar Harbor, they sold it to me for an affordable price, and Dad and I overhauled the place and found Mrs. K. as a tenant. It was so safe here, so cozy and tiny. But now it seems crowded and stuffy, just as my mind is crammed with memories of my romantic failures.</p> <p>Skip, of course, is at the head of the class. But there were others, too, before Malone, before Father Tim. A couple of years after Skip was Pete, a very nice guy from a few towns over. We dated for a year, practically living together at the end. When he asked me out for dinner one night, I imagined that he was going to pop the question. And I imagined myself saying yes. We were very solid, very content, I thought. It wasn\u2019t a huge romantic love, but I thought it would last.</p><p>Instead, Pete gently informed me that he was moving. To California. And he would really miss me.</p><p>If he\u2019d asked, I would have said, No, no, I can\u2019t possibly come with you. I love Maine. I don\u2019t want to move. My life is here. My family. Our breakup would have been sad, regretful but required, because I honestly wouldn\u2019t have left home for that guy. My heart was not broken. Still, it would have been nice to turn him down.</p><p>I pull out a green sweater that still has a few golden hairs on it. Colonel\u2019s hair. He must have rubbed his head against me while I was wearing this. My eyes fill?sudden, desperate longing for my dog flows over me like a river. This sweater can stay, I decide, putting it in the \u201ckeep\u201d pile. I blow my nose and continue purging.</p><p>After Pete was Dewitt, my boyfriend of four months. He asked me to put some distance between myself and my sister, successfully ending our romance with that one sentence. Unfortunately, he then told everyone that I had an \u201cunnatural thing\u201d going on with Christy and implied that I\u2019d never find someone because I was fixated on my own sister. Asshole.</p><p>\u201cMaggie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus! God! You shouldn\u2019t sneak up on people like that!\u201d I squawk.</p><p>Malone leans against my door frame and smiles. I have to look away.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI knocked. Must not have heard me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. So. You\u2019re here. That\u2019s...\u201d The animal magnetism he exudes shrouds my reasons for being mad. Oh, yeah. Chantal. Got it. \u201cOkay, Malone, so what\u2019s up? What\u2019s new? Anything new?\u201d</p><p>His smile fades. \u201cNot really. Missed you last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you. Hmm. Well. Something came up.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019s not going to admit anything. You\u2019d think even Malone would acknowledge something...Hey, by the way, Chantal and I are having a baby. Wanna grab some dinner? Fine. If he\u2019s not going to say anything, I\u2019m sure as hell not going to admit I was lurking under his window the moment he learned of his impending fatherhood.</p><p>Swallowing bile, I feel so tired of having my relationships make me look like a fool. Skip, those other dweebs, Father Tim, and now Malone. I just can\u2019t take it. I won\u2019t be made an ass of again. I just can\u2019t. I finish stuffing the contents of my drawer into the trash bag, willing myself not to feel anything but anger. However, the image of Malone lying on my bed the night after Colonel died shoves its way into my head. How could he be so?</p> <p>\u201cEverything okay, Maggie?\u201d he asks, a slight frown between his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? No. Everything is not okay, Malone. Here. Come in the living room, okay?\u201d I shove my way past him into the mess I\u2019ve made in the next room. \u201cSit down. Have a seat.\u201d I take a deep breath and sit on the other side of the coffee table, not wanting to be too close to him. He hasn\u2019t shaved today, and the memory of what it feels like to be kissed by Malone, that scraping sweetness, makes my knees wobble. Disgusted with myself, I force an image of him with Chantal. In bed with Chantal, kissing her with the same intensity that he kissed me. There. Wobbling over.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Malone asks quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s good that you came over, Malone. It\u2019s...look. You\u2019re here. So. The thing is, Malone, I?\u201d My throat tightens inexplicably. \u201cMalone, this isn\u2019t working for me. This thing you and I have going on. Whatever it is.\u201d</p><p>Though his expression doesn\u2019t change, his head jerks back a fraction, and for a tiny second, I feel bad for him. He\u2019s surprised. Didn\u2019t see it coming. Well, I know the feeling, don\u2019t I?</p><p>I keep talking, taking a grim pleasure in the fact at least that I\u2019m not on the dumped end of this breakup stick. \u201cYou know. I mean, you\u2019re very...attractive, I guess...I mean, I think so, anyway. But aside from that...physical stuff...well, to tell you the truth, Malone, I\u2019m looking for a little more.\u201d</p><p>He just stares at me, not frowning exactly, but almost?concerned. \u201cDid something happen, Maggie?\u201d he asks, and the kindness in his rough voice causes fresh fury to slap my heart like a rogue wave.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Malone,\u201d I snap. \u201cDid it?\u201d</p><p>His black brows come together. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he says, and now there\u2019s a note of irritation.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d I stand in front of him, hands on my hips, daring him to admit what he\u2019s done.</p><p>\u201cAre we fighting here?\u201d he asks, scowling. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t remember us having anything to fight about.\u201d</p><p>Fine. He\u2019s being a coward. Fine. \u201cI\u2019ll make it simple for you, Malone. You\u2019re really just not my type.\u201d</p><p>Score a direct hit?his mouth closes abruptly, his face is fierce and dark. \u201cAnd just who is your type, Maggie? Father Tim, maybe?\u201d he growls.</p><p>I c**k my head. \u201cWell, funny you should say that. Aside from the priest thing, yes, actually. He\u2019s a true friend to me. We talk, we have fun, we laugh together. We tell each other things. That\u2019s more of what I\u2019m looking for. A friend and a lover. That\u2019s not so surprising, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend? By that, do you mean someone to wait on hand and foot? Someone you can feed and clean up after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called caring, Malone. When you care about someone, you do things for him. Hence the soup and pie I made for you the night you went for a swim in the forty-degree Atlantic! But you don\u2019t want that, do you?\u201d My voice rises in anger. \u201cSo yes, I want someone who\u2019s not closed off from every human feeling, Malone. That\u2019s what! Someone who can speak in full sentences. Someone who can actually answer a personal question when asked, someone who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the point,\u201d Malone says, standing. \u201cFine. Take care.\u201d</p><p>He slams the door behind him, and I burst into tears once more.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>\u201cBLESS ME, Father, for I have sinned,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s been twenty-two years since my last confession.\u201d Funny, how the words come racing right back. \u201cCan we get to it, Father Tim? I really need to talk.\u201d So much so that I quick-stepped in front of Mrs. Jensen. I had tried calling Father Tim at the rectory, but he didn\u2019t return my call. He\u2019s been terribly busy lately.</p><p>\u201cWell, Maggie, this is the sacrament of reconciliation. We probably shouldn\u2019t rush it. Though of course, I\u2019m very glad to see you in church.\u201d</p><p>I take a ragged breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Father Tim,\u201d I say roughly. \u201cThe thing is, I\u2019m just so?I can\u2019t seem to?\u201d My throat is gripped by all the misery of the past week. Colonel. My parents. Malone. Chantal. My own future stretches ahead of me, alone, childless, ankles swollen, no one to change my diapers in my dotage...Tears drip down my cheeks and I sniff wetly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Maggie?\u201d Father Tim asks, his voice full of alarm and concern.</p><p>\u201cMy life is a joke,\u201d I manage. \u201cI know what I want, but I just can\u2019t seem to get it, and I don\u2019t understand why everything is so hard and confusing.\u201d</p><p>Why do I miss Malone? Why have I analyzed every second we\u2019ve ever spent in each other\u2019s company? Why does my mother\u2019s fear break my heart the way it does? Why can\u2019t people just meet and get married and be happy like Christy and Will? And worst of all, why does it feel like my last chance will die with Malone, even knowing what I know?</p><p>\u201cI broke up with Malone,\u201d I blurt. \u201cYou were right. He\u2019s churlish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Maggie, I\u2019m sorry. Sorry to be right.\u201d He leans forward so I can see his face through the filigreed screen of the confessional. \u201cThere are times when life tests us,\u201d he says gently. \u201cTimes that seem so lonely and bleak. It\u2019s how we handle these difficult situations that really proves who we are.\u201d</p><p>I swallow and wipe my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve been so jealous of Christy lately,\u201d I admit in a whisper. \u201cShe has everything, Father Tim. Everything I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re happy for her, as well, Maggie,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want those same things, there\u2019s no shame in admitting that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t seem fair,\u201d I protest. \u201cI don\u2019t want to end up alone, Father Tim. I get so scared sometimes that I\u2019ll be this weird aunt who\u2019ll be passed around like a virus. Like, \u2018It\u2019s your turn to feed Aunt Maggie\u2019?\u2018No, it was my turn last week! You do it!\u2019\u201d</p><p>Father Tim doesn\u2019t laugh, bless him. He doesn\u2019t say anything for a moment. \u201cNone of us wants to look into the future and see ourselves alone, Maggie,\u201d he nearly whispers. \u201cNo one wants that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There it is again, that undercurrent of his own loneliness. Of sadness, maybe. Or am I reading into things? But there\u2019s something. I raise my hand to the screen that separates us, pressing against the pretty scrollwork of the metal, and suddenly...suddenly my old fantasy of being with him doesn\u2019t seem so ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cFather Tim?\u201d I whisper. Outside in the church proper, Mrs. Jensen coughs loudly.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, you\u2019re such a wonderful person,\u201d he says, so softly I can barely hear him. \u201cDon\u2019t be sad. Something\u2019s going to change, Maggie, and you won\u2019t be alone forever. Have faith.\u201d</p><p>I draw a shaky breath, dizzy at the thoughts that pour into my mind.</p> <p>Mrs. Jensen hacks again, her cough bouncing off the stone walls of the church. Can\u2019t the old bag take some Robitussin? But the moment is over. Father Tim sits back. \u201cLet\u2019s speak again soon,\u201d he says. \u201cGod bless you, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS, my thoughts keep me quiet, almost withdrawn. I go through the motions at Joe\u2019s, calling out diner slang for Stuart, hugging Georgie, joking with Rolly and Ben, passing out ballots. Father Tim doesn\u2019t come in, and the significance of his absence causes all kinds of ideas to flutter like birds against a window?unpleasant thoughts, really, that I don\u2019t want to dwell on. But fragments of words float through my mind...Father Shea...You\u2019re special, Maggie...Something\u2019s going to change.</p><p>And yet, while those thoughts are concerning, they\u2019re also just a reflex. When I look at the answering machine every afternoon when I come home, it\u2019s Malone I think of. Did he call? Will he? Then I stop myself. Malone has other problems to take care of. He won\u2019t be calling me. Besides, I don\u2019t even want him to call, do I? Leave me out of it, Malone, I command. He obeys.</p><p>Chantal leaves a message, a brief one, asking me to call her when I get a chance, no hurry, but I can hear the solemnity in her tone. There\u2019s a call I\u2019m not eager to return. Slutty Chantal. Slutty Malone, too. Who needs \u2019em?</p><p>On Sunday, the Beaumont children are summoned for dinner as usual. Mom and Dad are painfully civil to each other, Dad carving the roast, Mom setting the side dishes on the table with terrible care. Jonah, Christy and I are very well-behaved and helpful, no jokes, no teasing. It\u2019s freakish and agonizing. Will is covering at the hospital, so there\u2019s no one to ease the tension, just us kids and Violet. Dinner takes an eternity, and even the baby\u2019s cheerful babble can\u2019t break the pall of gloom that hangs over the table. When Jonah actually volunteers to wash the dishes afterward, it\u2019s proof positive that something is dreadfully wrong.</p> <p>\u201cSo what happens next?\u201d he asks, his back to the rest of us as he runs the water. \u201cIs one of you moving out?\u201d</p><p>Mom and Dad\u2019s eyes meet across the table, perhaps for the first time today. Christy\u2019s eyes fill, and she lowers her nose to Violet\u2019s silky hair to hide the fact.</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, yes,\u201d Mom says carefully. \u201cNot just yet, but I\u2019m thinking of moving to Bar Harbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a change from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re moving?\u201d Christy shrieks. \u201cYou can\u2019t move, Mom! Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?\u201d Jonah and I exchange a startled glance, but Christy keeps going. \u201cNo! You can\u2019t! It\u2019s?It\u2019s?Bar Harbor is so far!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Mom says. \u201cIt\u2019s just an?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an hour and a half, Mom!\u201d Christy yells. \u201cDon\u2019t you care about Violet? What about your only grandchild? And your children! Don\u2019t you want to see us more than once a month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristy,\u201d I begin, but she cuts me off.</p><p>\u201cNo, Maggie. It\u2019s selfish. You\u2019re being unbelievably selfish, Mom.\u201d She smacks her hand down on the table.</p><p>Our mother looks down at the tablecloth without comment. Dad is pulling his silent routine, and I feel a sudden tug of annoyance with him. Staying on the sidelines only gets you so far in life, and in a flash, I can see how hard it must have been for my mother?married to a man who never dissented, never voiced his unhappiness, just bobbed along with the tide until he was so miserable that he had to leave or drown.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want, Mom? To live in Bar Harbor?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She sighs. \u201cWell, in some ways, yes. I think it would be nice to be in a bigger place. Spread my horizons, expand my wings, so to speak. So Bar Harbor would be a step in the right direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Christy demands, shifting Violet. \u201cMove to Paris? London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAustralia, I was thinking,\u201d Mom mutters, and I smile.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia!\u201d Christy yelps. It\u2019s almost funny to see?the former social worker acting like a spoiled twelve-year-old. Violet grabs a handful of tablecloth and stuffs it in her mouth.</p><p>Mom sighs. \u201cI\u2019m kidding, Christy. Okay? Just relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family is falling apart, Mom. I can\u2019t relax. And I can\u2019t believe you guys aren\u2019t going to even try to work on things! Get some counseling, for God\u2019s sake. Go see Father Tim! But moving is absolutely ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Christy, shut up,\u201d Jonah says. \u201cThey\u2019re adults. They can make their own choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about being an adult, Jonah?\u201d my sister snaps. I haven\u2019t seen her so riled since Skip dumped me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Christy,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cMom and Dad have been married for a long time. If they want something different now, well, they\u2019re in a position to know. We\u2019re not. If Mom wants to live somewhere other than Gideon\u2019s Cove, she can. It\u2019s her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, nothing\u2019s going to happen for at least a few weeks,\u201d my mother says. \u201cYour father and I aren\u2019t getting divorced right away, just separated. And we\u2019ll see how things are after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s gonna be my sternman,\u201d Jonah informs us. Dad offers a tentative smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Dad! Are you crazy?\u201d Christy says. \u201cA sternman? What do you know about lobstering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s neat, Dad,\u201d I say. \u201cChristy, you need a drink. Mom, can we leave Violet here for an hour or so? Dewey\u2019s opens in ten minutes, and I think Christy and I should talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d my mother says, reaching for her grandchild.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy,\u201d Christy snaps. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I say, dragging her forcibly from the room.</p><p>We ride in silence to Dewey\u2019s, Christy driving with sharp movements, braking hard, jerking the steering wheel. She stomps into the bar in front of me, not making eye contact as we sit at a table in back. The bar is nearly deserted?it\u2019s four on a Sunday?and Dewey is still taking chairs down.</p><p>\u201cDewey, can we get a couple of...what do you want, Christy?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she mutters.</p><p>\u201cScotch, I guess, Dewey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, girls,\u201d he calls. He pours us our drinks and brings them over, then hustles off to fill the register.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your problem?\u201d I ask my sister.</p><p>\u201cOur parents are acting like idiots,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to all that nice compassion you had last week? Poor Mom, getting knocked up, abandoning her dreams...\u201d I take a sip of my drink and instantly remember the last time I had scotch?with Malone, the night Colonel died. I shove the thought aside.</p><p>Christy takes a sharp breath, and her eyes fill with tears. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she would leave, Maggie! How can she?and Dad\u2019s going to become some stinky, weird old guy without her. A sternman! For crying out loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you a little bit...I don\u2019t know, proud, in a way? That our parents are doing something new, that just because they\u2019re middle-aged doesn\u2019t mean their lives are carved in stone? I think it\u2019s kind of neat.\u201d Christy shoots me a death glare. \u201cA little neat, anyway,\u201d I amend.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she sulks. \u201cIt\u2019s not neat, Maggie. Mom is moving. Moving far.\u201d Her tears slip down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ll miss her,\u201d I say. \u201cBut she deserves a chance to do something different, Christy. She\u2019s not obligated to stay around and watch our lives anymore.\u201d</p><p>My sister stares out the window for another minute. \u201cOh, shit, you\u2019re right,\u201d she says, swallowing a mouthful of scotch. \u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. I guess I just feel abandoned. And sorry for myself. I mean, I\u2019ll miss her, Maggie! And so will Violet. She loves Mom so much.\u201d Christy\u2019s face scrunches up in misery, and I reach across the table to squeeze her hand.</p><p>\u201cHere now, what\u2019s this?\u201d Dewey asks. \u201cMaggie, why are you crying, hon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I say. \u201cChristy is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, dear. No crying in my bar, sweetheart,\u201d Dewey says. \u201cAnd the day I can tell you girls apart will be a banner day, let me tell you.\u201d He pats her head and walks back to the bar.</p><p>Christy gives me a watery smile. \u201cMan, I was such a bitch back there, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer, smiling. \u201cA right bitch. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s high time I got to be the good twin,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou. You\u2019re so funny.\u201d She smiles genuinely now, and simultaneously, we reach out a foot under the table and nudge each other. \u201cHey, what happened with Malone?\u201d she asks, her head swiveling to the door. My heart sinks like an anvil. But no, it\u2019s not Malone. Just Mickey Tatum, the fire chief.</p><p>\u201cI broke up with him,\u201d I tell her. There\u2019s a tightness in my throat that the scotch doesn\u2019t alleviate.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say about Chantal?\u201d Christy asks.</p><p>\u201cNothing. We didn\u2019t talk about it. He didn\u2019t say boo about her.\u201d</p><p>Christy sighs. \u201cSorry, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, other fish to fry, right? Other eggs to scramble. At least I cut bait before things got too...whatever.\u201d I don\u2019t fool Christy; she smiles sadly, seeing right through me. \u201cI do have to tell you, though,\u201d I say, artfully changing the subject, \u201csomething\u2019s going on with Father Tim. Have you talked to him lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why? What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Dewey comes over with a bag of potato chips. \u201cFor the beautiful weeping lady,\u201d he says, handing them to me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Christy,\u201d I correct, pointing across the table.</p><p>\u201cOf course. For the beautiful weeping lady,\u201d he repeats.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dewey,\u201d she says. \u201cJust the ticket.\u201d She opens the bag and offers some to me, then takes a few herself. \u201cSo. Father Tim?\u201d she prods.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know. But something\u2019s weird. He\u2019s been very...tender. And saying things that have sort of a double meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Christy asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t remember exactly what he said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a first,\u201d she interjects dryly.</p><p>\u201c?but just sort of...well. Obviously I don\u2019t quite know.\u201d I can\u2019t bring myself to say the words aloud. Instead, I fidget in the hard wooden chair. \u201cDo you want to go home and grovel in front of Mom and Dad now?\u201d</p><p>Christy laughs. \u201cSure. You\u2019ve been good twin long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s you in a nutshell,\u201d I say, taking out a few bills and laying them on the table. \u201cAlways stealing my thunder.\u201d</p><p>Christy grovels, re-assumes her title and we all have apple crisp.</p><p>On the way home, I pedal my bike toward the harbor. It\u2019s a windy day, and a Sunday to boot, so most of the lobster boats are in, including the Ugly Anne. Don\u2019t go down there, Maggie, I warn myself. A large seagull glides down, landing a few feet away on one of the wooden support posts, the wind ruffling its feathers but not its composure. I envy that bird. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And if Malone was here? I ask myself. What then? What would I say? How\u2019s Chantal? Are you happy that you\u2019ll be a father again? That is, of course, if Chantal will actually go through with it....</p><p>I still can\u2019t reconcile the idea of Malone and Chantal together. For some reason, I thought?</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake, Maggie,\u201d I mutter aloud to myself. I mount my bike once more but remain where I am, one foot firmly on the ground, and continue to stare at the harbor. The wind carries the scent of pine and salt on it, stinging my cheeks, howling in my ears, but I still don\u2019t move. Malone\u2019s face is stuck in my mind, the harsh lines, craggy cheekbones, those tangled black lashes. The way he smiled at me, begrudgingly almost, as if he didn\u2019t really want to like me but just couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cRight, Maggie,\u201d I snort. \u201cYou\u2019re so irresistible that Malone got Chantal pregnant. Live with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat say, theah, Maggie?\u201d</p> <p>My shriek causes the gull to startle off, echoing my sound. \u201cYikes! Billy! God, you scared me!\u201d</p><p>Billy Bottoms takes the pipe from his mouth. \u201cSorry, dahlin\u2019. Just comin\u2019 down to check somethin\u2019. Thought you were talkin\u2019 to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. No. Not you. Just, you know, blathering to myself. Sorry. Have a nice day.\u201d</p><p>I need to do something, I think as I ride back home. I need to figure out a plan for the rest of my life. If my mother can make a big move, so can I. Last week, she was sitting at the kitchen table tying one on. This week, she\u2019s got a plan. I can do the same thing. I need to forget Malone and move on. Focus on other things. Take action.</p><p>Being at Dewey\u2019s has given me an idea. Not the most honorable idea, granted, but a pretty good idea nonetheless. An awful, horrible, wonderful idea.</p> <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>\u201cMY CAR IS RUNNING a little rough,\u201d I lie to my sister on the phone a few days later. \u201cCan I borrow yours?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Monday. The diner is closed, the wind is blowing, and it\u2019s a great day to stay home and do nothing, but my idea has been lurking in the corner of my mind, and its patience wearing thin. Besides, I can\u2019t just sit around and think about Malone and Chantal all day.</p><p>Christy runs water in the background. \u201cSure. I\u2019m not going anywhere. Can you believe how cold it is? Cripes, it feels like December out there, not April.\u201d</p><p>Maine has tricked us yet again, pretending to embrace spring while all the time getting ready to dump six inches of snow on us, mixing with the muddy ground in a sloppy, tired, icy goop. All four members of the town crew are out, wearily sanding the main roads, defiling the streets they cleaned just last week. I pull my hat down over my ears and wave to them as I slip and slide up Christy\u2019s hill. Then, as planned, I choose a particularly damp-looking splotch of gray snow, trip and land face down in it.</p><p>\u201cOh, jeezum, look at you!\u201d My sister holds the door open, Violet balanced on her hip. \u201cCome in here, you gawmy girl!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI slipped,\u201d I confess sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cWell, go upstairs and change, dopey,\u201d she chides. \u201cDo you want to stay for lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no, no, but thanks. Other plans. I, um...\u201d God, I am the worst liar. \u201cI\u2019m going to the mall. After my errands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mall?\u201d Christy asks. \u201cThat\u2019s two hours away, hon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight! I know. Maybe not the mall.... I need shoes. New shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Christy gives me that knowing look, and I flee upstairs to raid her closet, as is the plan. I pull out some nice tweed pants and a silk sweater. A little scarf goes into my pocket. I glance at her bureau.</p><p>\u201cChristy? Can I borrow some jewelry? I want to look a little nicer. I might, uh...meet a friend? For lunch. If I have time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she calls back. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p> <p>By that, she probably doesn\u2019t mean her anniversary band, a circle of small diamonds that Will gave her to mark their first year together. But, I rationalize, she did say \u201cwhatever,\u201d so I take it, first using some of the hand cream she\u2019s got on her night table.</p><p>\u201cOh, you look so nice!\u201d Christy comments. By nice, she means \u201clike me,\u201d but I don\u2019t take offense. She has beautiful clothes, and the point of this little adventure is in fact to look like Christy. Violet, who sits on the kitchen floor banging a whisk on a pot, crawls over to me and drools on my?Christy\u2019s?boot.</p><p>\u201cThank you, baby,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll be back around four, okay?\u201d I grab the car keys from the counter.</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d she says. She smiles from her seat on the floor. \u201cViolet, want to try this one?\u201d She holds up a wooden spoon and demonstrates its banging ability. \u201cHey, Maggie, don\u2019t forget a coat. Yours is a mess.\u201d She gestures to her beautiful faux shearling coat, which hangs on a hook near the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a great sister,\u201d I say, flushed with guilt. \u201cThanks a million.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun!\u201d she calls.</p><p>Fun is not exactly what I have planned. I grab the diaper bag that my sister leaves in the garage, climb in the car, look in the rearview mirror and take out my ponytail. Then I brush my hair to a side part and tuck it behind my ears. The band goes on my left ring finger, the scarf around my neck, and voila?I\u2019m Christy.</p><p>This very morning, I had called the rectory. \u201cMrs. Plutarski, hi, it\u2019s Christy Jones. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, dear,\u201d Mrs. Plutarski said. \u201cHow\u2019s that beautiful baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s wonderful,\u201d I answered sweetly. \u201cListen, I was wondering if Father Tim had a few minutes to spare for me today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, honey,\u201d she cooed, and my jaw clenched. Mrs. Plutarski is such a pill to me. You\u2019d think I routinely crapped on the altar, the way she treats me. When I ask to see Father Tim, she always takes great pains to tell me how busy he is. For Christy, though, he\u2019s wide open.</p><p>\u201cHow about one o\u2019clock, Christy? I imagine you want to discuss your poor parents,\u201d she suggested, gossipmonger that she is.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect.\u201d Violet takes her nap from noon to three, and the real Christy will be snug at home.</p><p>My heart is pounding as I pull Christy\u2019s Volvo into the rectory\u2019s small parking lot. I turn off the car and sit a minute. After being delayed for God knows how long, common sense finally makes an appearance.</p><p>Here I am dressed as my sister, about to trick a priest. Nice, Maggie. Very noble. For some reason, I had the notion that if Father Tim thought I was Christy, he\u2019d tell me what was bothering him lately, why he kept dropping those hints about how special \u201cMaggie\u201d was. I roll my eyes in the rearview mirror. No. I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m not that much of a jerk. Whatever personal issues Father Tim is having, they\u2019re not my business. Maybe it was cabin fever, maybe I was just trying to distract myself from thoughts of Malone, but clearly, this is the stupidest idea I\u2019ve ever had. Maybe the stupidest idea anyone\u2019s ever had.</p><p>Disgusted, I restart the car. I\u2019ll drive down to Machias and catch a movie, get a big bag of popcorn and some Swedish fish?</p><p>I scream as a knock comes on the car window.</p><p>\u201cFather Tim! Oh! Wow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, there, Christy!\u201d he beams. \u201cCome in, dear girl, come in.\u201d</p><p>My stomach contracts with the agony of being caught. \u201cHi, Father Tim,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>Well, it looks like I\u2019m going to have to go through with it, because I just can\u2019t think of anything else. Wobbling a bit in Christy\u2019s boots, which have a higher heel than I\u2019m used to, I grab the diaper bag from the back seat?my prop, further evidence that I am my sister.</p><p>\u201cHello, dear,\u201d Mrs. Plutarski says from her position of power in the rectory office. \u201cHow nice to see you! Don\u2019t you look smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mrs. Plutarski, you are so sweet,\u201d I simper. \u201cI just love that color on you! Would you call that oatmeal or liver? It\u2019s wonderful!\u201d Don\u2019t blow it, I warn myself savagely. You got yourself into this mess, now just get out as fast as you can. If they figure out you\u2019re Maggie, you\u2019re dead.</p><p>\u201cMake yourself comfortable, Christy,\u201d Father Tim says, holding the door of his office for me. My toes curl in discomfort.</p><p>\u201cThank you for seeing me, Father Tim,\u201d I say, glancing around, trying not to make eye contact.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, my dear, you\u2019re welcome. How are Will and little Violet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just great. Just great. Wonderful.\u201d Okay, stop babbling. It\u2019s a dead giveaway. I sit down, cross my ankles and try to have good posture. My gaze flits around the office. There\u2019s a note on his desk, and a prickle of warning goes through me at the sight of it. Though it\u2019s upside down to me, I can read Father Tim\u2019s writing...Ask Bishop?</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Christy?\u201d the priest asks. I look away from the note.</p><p>\u201cWell, um, I guess you\u2019ve heard about my, my, um, parents,\u201d I stammer.</p><p>\u201cI have, yes.\u201d He smiles encouragingly. Ask Bishop T. about?</p><p>\u201cAnd of course we\u2019re all...saddened. Quite saddened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy, thirty some-odd years of marriage,\u201d he murmurs. Ask Bishop T. about the Father Shea situation.</p><p>Holy moley! Jeezum! The Father Shea situation? The left-the-priesthood-for-a-pretty-woman-situation? Oh, my God! I gulp in a huge breath.</p><p>\u201cChristy, ah, dear, don\u2019t cry, now. There\u2019s still hope, and if you turn to prayer, perhaps it will help your parents remember how sacred those vows were and still are.\u201d</p><p>How are your vows, Father Tim? Everything rock solid there? I realize that a response is required. \u201cMmm. Right. We\u2019re all taking it pretty hard. Uh, Maggie and me, I mean.\u201d I take a sharp breath at referring to myself in third person, then swallow. \u201cAnd you know. Jonah, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spoken with Maggie a bit. But how can I help you, Christy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I suppose I was wondering...\u201d Yes, Maggie/ Christy. What exactly can you wonder about? My mind drains of all intelligent thought. \u201cHow I can...um, support my parents? Other than pray?\u201d I sound like an idiot because all I can think is Father Shea, Father Shea, oh, shit, Father Shea.</p><p>Father Tim glances out the window. \u201cWell, as their daughter, Christy, you could remind them of all the good things their marriage has given them. You three children, of course, and their darlin\u2019 grandbaby. A life together, rich with family and happy memories, trials and tribulations, as well, of course...\u201d His voice trails off, his eyes still focused outside. I get the strong impression he\u2019s phoning it in today. Lucky for me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Excellent advice.\u201d I swallow, then decide to risk it. \u201cSo, Father Tim, how are you? I mean, do you like it here? Being our parish priest and all? It\u2019s been, let\u2019s see now...a year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, about that,\u201d Father Tim says, dragging his gaze back to me and forcing a smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, the community is so lucky to have you, Father Tim. You\u2019re a great priest. Very, um, holy. Devout, I mean.\u201d There. Said it, even if I sound like a jerk. \u201cWill and the baby and I, we love church. I hope you won\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>His attention is suddenly laser-sharp. \u201cWhy? Have you heard something?\u201d he blurts, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cUm...no. No, not really...No. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>Father Tim stares at me a minute, then sits back in his chair, relaxing. \u201cWell,\u201d he says. \u201cChange is inevitable, and we\u2019re none of us in control of our futures. That\u2019s in God\u2019s hands, as is everything.\u201d</p><p>Again with the clich\u00e9s. \u201cWell. Yes.\u201d I tuck some hair behind my ear. God, I feel guilty! Lying, tricking, deceiving a man of the cloth. I am surely damned. Sweat trickles down my neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have a wonderful family, Christy,\u201d Father Tim says, appropos of nothing.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that you and Maggie...well. Never mind.\u201d</p><p>Desperate to somehow set Father Tim straight regarding my own feelings while not blowing my cover, I swallow convulsively. \u201cYou...you\u2019re a, um, a good friend to Maggie. It\u2019s nice for her to have a friend who\u2019s a priest. Very comforting. And she, you know, values your friendship.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on that,\u201d he says, smiling and rising. \u201cShe\u2019s very special.\u201d</p><p>Oh, my dear God. He\u2019s counting on that. I\u2019m special. Shit! My pulse zings through my veins, my heart pounds. What does that mean? Why would he be counting on my friendship? And why is he so interested to know if I\u2019ve?Christy\u2019s?heard something about him leaving?</p><p>\u201cWell, okay, Father Tim, thank you so much for everything. I really should get back to the baby. Thanks. This was so helpful.\u201d</p><p>Father Tim\u2019s face is puzzled. \u201cGlad to be of service, Christy,\u201d he says. He stands aside as I practically leap out of the room, nearly colliding with Mrs. Plutarski, who is too close to the door for any purpose other than eavesdropping.</p><p>\u201cSo nice to see you, Christy,\u201d she says, pretending to pick up a piece of paper already in her hand.</p> <p>\u201cIt certainly is. Take care,\u201d I say distantly, grabbing my coat. I need some air. My head is buzzing and my hearing seems to be off, and I need to get outside and away from the rectory.</p><p>I burst into the slush, sliding and nearly falling on the sidewalk, then slip over to Christy\u2019s car, taking great gulps of air. Where did I put the keys? Where are the damn keys? I check the diaper bag and can\u2019t find them. Father Shea! How many compartments does this thing have? Diapers here, wipes there, changing pad, pacifier, teething ring, Goodnight Moon, a stuffed dog, a sterilized bottle in a sealed plastic bag, some emergency formula, but no goddamn keys.</p><p>And then, around the corner comes Malone.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I hiss. I can\u2019t believe the crap luck. Where are the f**king keys? Fifteen more feet and I\u2019ll have to talk to him.</p><p>\u201cMaggie?\u201d he says cautiously.</p><p>Without thinking, I turn and walk away from the Volvo and away from Malone as fast as I dare in the slushy mess on the sidewalk. Jerking open the door of the CVS pharmacy, I hustle inside, looking for a place to hide until he passes. I stop in front of the tobacco display, which hides me from the front door, and pretend to look at pipes. I\u2019m sweating bullets.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Mrs. Jones,\u201d calls a teenager from behind the counter. The Bates girl...what\u2019s her name? Susie? Katie? Bessie? Shit, I can\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cHello, honey!\u201d I call a little too loudly.</p><p>The bell over the door rings, and Malone comes in. I scamper further down the aisle, then take a left. Ha! Here, I\u2019ll go here. I try to stop panting and run a hand through my hair. I\u2019m shaking, but I should be safe. He wouldn\u2019t dare follow me here.</p><p>He dares. \u201cMaggie?\u201d His voice is low and grumbling and vaguely menacing.</p><p>I stretch my mouth into an approximation of a smile and turn to him. \u201cOh, hello, Malone. It\u2019s actually Christy. Don\u2019t worry, happens all the time.\u201d Shimmers of heat are rolling off my face. I snatch a box of tampons from the shelf and study it hard. Extra absorbent for your heaviest days. That should scare off any male.</p><p>Malone doesn\u2019t move. I shove the box back and grab some pads large enough to serve as dog beds.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you pretending to be Christy?\u201d he growls.</p><p>I steal a glance at him. He\u2019s scowling, of course, and his hair is rumpled from the wind. He hasn\u2019t shaved today, and he\u2019s so ridiculously male that even here, even knowing what I know, my knees soften in a biological rush of attraction.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Christy!\u201d calls a red-haired woman I\u2019ve never seen. She has a baby on her hip.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d I call back, waving. \u201cHow\u2019s the baby?\u201d</p><p>Malone folds his arms over his chest and narrows his eyes.</p><p>\u201cA little fussy. Teething, I think. Your husband said I could try Motrin if it gets worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Motrin. That will do the trick. Mmm-hmm. Will knows these things. Definitely try the Motrin. Works for Violet.\u201d I shove the pads back on the shelf and go for the big guns?yeast infection treatments. I shake the box for emphasis, hearing the applicator rattle.</p><p>\u201cMaggie,\u201d Malone rumbles. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christy, okay? You made a mistake. Even our parents mix us up. Now, I really need to concentrate because I have a raging yeast infection, okay? So goodbye.\u201d</p><p>He leans in close enough that I can feel the warmth of his body, and suddenly the box is shaking in my hands. Do not look at him, I warn myself. Do not even turn your head.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d Malone whispers. Then he turns and walks away. I hear the bell over the door tinkle, and he\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cDON\u2019T BE MAD at me,\u201d I tell my sister as I hang up her coat.</p><p>\u201cDid you dent the car?\u201d she asks, taking a sip of tea. The baby monitor is on, the house warm and quiet, an oasis of calm.</p><p>\u201cI pretended to be you,\u201d I admit, bracing myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Maggie! Come on!\u201d she exclaims.</p><p>\u201cHey, quiet now, you\u2019ll wake the baby,\u201d I say, grateful that there\u2019s a sleeping child to protect me from her wrath.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we a little old to be switching?\u201d Christy grumbles. \u201cAnd what the hell for, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the water hot? I could use a cup,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d Christy says, putting aside her crossword puzzle. \u201cYou got some \u2019splainin\u2019 to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. First of all, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cI had just decided not to do it when Father Tim busted me. It was a bad idea. But you\u2019re not going to believe this.\u201d I spoon some sugar into my tea and sit down across from her. \u201cI think Father Tim is leaving the priesthood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d My sister nearly falls out of her chair.</p><p>I tell her about my sophomoric routine and Father Tim\u2019s mysterious words, not to mention the Father Shea situation.</p><p>\u201cSo did he actually say anything concrete?\u201d my sister asks, abandoning her irritation with me in the wake of the more shocking news.</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d I acknowledge. \u201cBut he\u2019s already said a couple of times that he\u2019s lonely...and then things like how special I am and that he\u2019s counting on me. And the Father Shea thing.... You have to admit, that sounds...you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromising?\u201d Christy suggests.</p><p>\u201cNo! I was going to say scary, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she agrees, tracing the grain of wood on the table. \u201cImagine the scandal, Maggie, if he left the priesthood for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love him, Mags?\u201d She winces as she says it. \u201cNo! Oh, shit, I don\u2019t know, Christy. I mean, sure, I love Father Tim. Who doesn\u2019t, right? And we really are great friends. I\u2019ve always felt like there was some bond between us....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d she prompts.</p><p>\u201cBut...not that way. A crush is one thing, you know, but my God, no!\u201d My sister nods. \u201cBesides,\u201d I admit in a quieter voice, \u201cI still have some...feelings. For Malone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that that matters, right? Because of Chantal and all. I should just forget him. Malone was a fling, that\u2019s all. A pretty good fling, but there was nothing really...no real....\u201d</p><p>Except there was something, and the truth brings tears to my eyes. He held my hand, took me to that hokey little lumberjack competition, comforted me, cheered me, made me feel like the most beautiful woman in the world, and I?</p><p>\u201cI miss him,\u201d I acknowledge in a whisper.</p><p>Christy nods.</p><p>\u201cHe was at CVS,\u201d I say. \u201cHe knew I wasn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows pop up. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>We have fooled everyone at one point or another?our parents, our brother, our teachers, our closest friends. Only Will has never once confused us.</p><p>And now Malone.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>\u201cMAGGOT, you think you could run lunch down to Dad and me at the dock? We\u2019re overhauling the engine on the Menace and we\u2019re a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, baby boy,\u201d I tell my brother. I\u2019ve been at the diner since six this morning, and now, at nearly two, the place is empty. I could use the fresh air.</p><p>Today\u2019s special was lobster bisque, and there\u2019s just enough left over from the two giant vats I made this morning for Dad and Jonah. I throw together a couple of ham and cheese sandwiches on pumpernickel and fix two coffees the way my menfolk like them. A few coconut macaroons, plus one for me, and I bag everything up and set out to the dock.</p><p>The sun is blindingly bright today, and it\u2019s still cold enough that the snow has stayed on the ground. I walk carefully down the gangplank, clutching the boys\u2019 lunch to my chest, watching my feet so I don\u2019t take a header (wouldn\u2019t be the first time). I\u2019m surprised to see my dad standing in a group of four or five men, who are apparently supervising Jonah?that is to say, they\u2019re slouching helpfully at the base of the gangplank, gossiping while a banging noise comes from my brother\u2019s boat.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad,\u201d I call. \u201cHi, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, sweetheart,\u201d Dad says, giving me a one-armed hug. \u201cHow\u2019s my girl? Need a hand? Isn\u2019t she pretty, boys? My little girl, all grown up.\u201d</p><p>I blink as the boys murmur assent. \u201cWell. Thanks, Dad. Aren\u2019t you...jovial.\u201d I smile up at my dad. \u201cWhere do you want to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I guess you can bring it to the captain, honey. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father nearly lost his finger today,\u201d Sam comments. The men guffaw as my father raises his hand and wiggles his fingers at me. \u201cFirst thing you gotta learn, there, Mitch! Those mothers clamp down pretty goddamn hard!\u201d</p><p>Apparently, this is hilarious, because the men all bark with laughter, Dad right along with them.</p><p>Bemused, I walk down the dock to the Menace. Seeing Dad out with the boys...it\u2019s different. \u201cJonah, lunch is here,\u201d I call as I step carefully onto the boat.</p><p>The door of the hold opens, and Malone comes out. My heart lurches, then sinks.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing his black peacoat and a scowl, wiping his hands on a rag. \u201cMaggie,\u201d he grunts.</p><p>\u201cMalone,\u201d I grunt back, instantly irritated. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t step aside, just stares at me, looking both angry and...well, no, just angry.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What do you want? Huh, Malone?\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mags, do you have enough for Malone, too?\u201d Jonah sticks his head out of the hold. \u201cHe\u2019s giving us a hand.\u201d His head pops back in and he resumes banging.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have anything for you,\u201d I mutter, staring at Malone.</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d he asks, eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cI?you?\u201d My mouth works a minute before I force it closed. \u201cHave a lovely day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie,\u201d Malone says.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Malone?\u201d I ask, and I\u2019m suddenly desperate for him to say something that would make everything the way it was, that would erase him and Chantal and whatever they did together, and the intensity of that longing makes my chest ache.</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Malone says, and he turns his back on me.</p><p>\u201cMAGGIE, I really need to see you.\u201d Chantal\u2019s voice is grim, and I wish I hadn\u2019t snatched up the phone. Of course, I\u2019m at Joe\u2019s, and I don\u2019t exactly screen calls here. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been busy, but I have to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>I heave a sigh that could propel a sailboat to Deer Isle. \u201cYeah. Fine.\u201d I glance around the diner, which is sparkling clean at the moment. Six pies are in the oven for tomorrow, lunchtime is over, and despite my best efforts, I\u2019ve run out of excuses. \u201cWell, I\u2019m free tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And every night, now that I mention it. There has been no word from Father Tim, not even his usual calls for help on some committee. There\u2019s got to be a significance to this, I think. I\u2019ve stopped going to Bible study, and aside from Mr. Barkham\u2019s funeral last week, I haven\u2019t seen Father Tim since I pretended to be my sister nearly two weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cCan you come over?\u201d Chantal asks. \u201cActually, this place is a dump. Can I come over to your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Come around eight.\u201d I certainly am not going to cook for her. She\u2019s been to the diner twice, but both times I leapt to the grill and asked Judy to wait on her, waving and pretending to be swamped with myriad duties. When she\u2019s asked to get together at night, I\u2019ve put her off three times. I can\u2019t avoid her forever.</p><p>At least she doesn\u2019t know about Malone and me, so I don\u2019t have to suffer that particular embarrassment. Then again, he may well have told her. At any rate, they don\u2019t know that I know what I know. She can just tell me her big news and I\u2019ll pretend to be stunned. I practice gasping a few times in the mirror, but my face looks too sad.</p> <p>When Chantal knocks on my door, an unwilling flare of sympathy goes off in my stony heart. Her face is gaunt and pale, circles smudging under her eyes. She looks thin, and I wonder if she\u2019s even still pregnant. I don\u2019t have to wonder for long.</p><p>\u201cSo. How have you been?\u201d she asks, sitting on the couch. She grabs a throw pillow and hugs it protectively to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Would you like a glass of wine or anything?\u201d I ask automatically.</p><p>\u201cNo. Sit down, Maggie, okay? We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>I sit stiffly in the club chair, rubbing a healing burn on my index finger. Chantal, as I have noted on many occasions, has lovely hands, plump and pretty with rounded nails that are always painted with clear polish. Malone may have said I don\u2019t have ugly hands, but compared with Chantal\u2019s...</p> <p>\u201cMaggie, I have something to tell you, and you\u2019re going to be shocked,\u201d Chantal says. I have always admired her bluntness.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, forcing myself to look at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she says in a low voice.</p><p>I don\u2019t gasp, but even though I knew what she was going to say, my stomach aches. \u201cReally,\u201d I say.</p><p>Her face is tormented. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. So who\u2019s the father?\u201d I ask cruelly. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth drops open. \u201cUm...yeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did he say?\u201d My voice is hard, my posture painfully erect.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s...he\u2019s not really in the picture. I\u2019m gonna have the baby on my own.\u201d</p><p>Now I do gasp. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>This is a huge surprise?Chantal has made no secret of lusting after Malone. Images of Malone\u2019s daughter, the round-cheeked little girl in the photos at his house, flash through my head. The one time I saw him with her?if that really was his daughter, that is?he looked happy. He\u2019d been smiling. I can\u2019t believe he wouldn\u2019t care.</p><p>Chantal toys with the fringe on the pillow, not meeting my eyes. \u201cYeah. So. Just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I can\u2019t believe he doesn\u2019t...that he\u2019s not...\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>Chantal\u2019s eyes shine with tears. \u201cThe truth is, Maggie, I\u2019m not going to tell him. It was a one-night stand, and I really don\u2019t want to ruin his life by dumping this on him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait a minute, wait a minute,\u201d I blurt. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him? What about?\u201d Yes, and how does one confess that one was spying? \u201cI thought?I\u2019d think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. It was stupid. A bad mistake, and I\u2019m paying for it, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>My mouth is still hanging open. \u201cWhy do you think he wouldn\u2019t want a baby?\u201d I manage to ask.</p><p>\u201cBecause I just know.\u201d Her tears spill over, and she sags back against the couch.</p><p>I sigh, running a hand through my hair. \u201cChantal...\u201d I sit next to her and pat her leg. \u201cListen, I know who it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, you do?\u201d She sits bolt upright and looks at me in horror, a hand covering her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I overheard. At Malone\u2019s.\u201d A lump rises in my own throat. \u201cAnd...I actually think he\u2019d make a good father, to tell you the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Maggie, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d she blurts, bursting into sobs. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell him, will you?\u201d she pleads. \u201cDon\u2019t tell him, Maggie, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, honey, he already knows,\u201d I say, confused. \u201cI mean, you told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just told you, I didn\u2019t. And I\u2019m not going to.\u201d She seems to deflate in front of my eyes. \u201cI already screwed up. I\u2019m not going to wreck his life, too, and this would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, hang on one sec,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cWho exactly are we talking about here?\u201d</p><p>Chantal freezes. \u201cUm...\u201d She bites her lip. \u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>I look at her a long moment, my heart thudding in my temples. \u201cMalone.\u201d</p><p>Chantal\u2019s breath explodes out of her. \u201cMalone? No. No, no. It\u2019s not Malone. I\u2019ve never even slept with Malone.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open. I pull back to look at her more closely. \u201cWell, you went to his house and told him you were pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, right. Right. I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s not the father?\u201d I ask, my voice rising in confusion.</p><p>Now she won\u2019t look me in the eye. \u201cHe, you know...Well, remember I told you how I picked him up that time, in high school? When he was in a fight? See, I guess I figured he...well, he owed me a shoulder to cry on. And he\u2019s the kind of guy who can keep his mouth shut, right? I didn\u2019t know who else to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not me?\u201d Not that we have that kind of friendship...not that I\u2019ve been all that close with Chantal...or that kind to her, to be honest.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer for a minute. \u201cI\u2019m telling you now,\u201d she finally says.</p><p>I slump back against the cushions. \u201cSo Malone\u2019s not...you didn\u2019t...Okay. Okay.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s starting to dawn on me in a slow rise of panic that I\u2019ve mentally accused Malone of something he didn\u2019t do. That I broke up with him over something that didn\u2019t happen. That for weeks now, I\u2019ve been hating him, condemning him...that I said some rather hateful things to him to save my own stupid pride?\u201cWho is the father, Chantal?\u201d I ask through numb lips.</p><p>\u201cListen, Maggie, that doesn\u2019t matter, does it? I mean, the fact remains that I\u2019m pregnant. I\u2019m thirty-nine and a half, and I\u2019m going to have a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Chief Tatum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Definitely not him.\u201d She looks away. \u201cHe\u2019s...um...can\u2019t have kids, didn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>I wince. No, I didn\u2019t know. Then it comes to me. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d I whisper, the blood draining to my feet. \u201cOh, Chantal, tell me it\u2019s not Father Tim....\u201d</p><p>Her head jerks back in surprise. \u201cFather Tim? Jesus, no! As if he would ever...come on, Maggie! I might be a little...flirty, but I wouldn\u2019t...you know...with a priest!\u201d</p><p>Weak with relief (and yes, definitely shame), I swallow a few times, then stand up. \u201cI need some water. Want some water? How about some water?\u201d</p><p>I get the water. Okay. So it\u2019s not Malone, thank God, and it\u2019s not Father Tim. Again, thank God. I gulp down a glass of tap water and bring another to Chantal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Chantal,\u201d I tell her. \u201cThis is all...well, hell. I\u2019ve been thinking it was Malone.\u201d</p><p>She takes the water gratefully. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you thought that. You know he\u2019s not interested in me. I actually thought he kind of liked you, though. Remember that night at Dewey\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>A bitter laugh bursts out of my lips. \u201cRight. Well, we...never mind. Listen, if you want to tell me who the father is, you could. You know I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone. I\u2019m your friend, Chantal.\u201d Or I could be, if I put aside the jealousy I\u2019ve always felt toward her.</p><p>Her eyes grow sad again. \u201cNo. It\u2019s just somebody...somebody from away. No one local.\u201d She forces a smile. \u201cYou know me. I like being on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be different when you have a baby, though,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd you never know, hon. The father might want to be involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Anyway. It\u2019s good to have you know.\u201d She squeezes my hand, and I squeeze back, caught between sympathy and a bit of shame.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you out,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI love kids. I\u2019ll cook for you and babysit and that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Maggie,\u201d she whispers. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve a friend like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do! What a silly thing to say.\u201d I blush.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could come to the delivery. Coach me or whatever. Slip me painkillers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d I say, hugging her. \u201cIt would be an honor.\u201d</p><p>She starts to cry again, and I smooth her beautiful hair. I\u2019ve been a crappy friend, an untrue friend. I will make it up to Chantal.</p><p>Making it up to Malone will be a little harder.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>THE LATE SPRING SNOW finally melts, leaving us in three fresh inches of mud. I slog to work, taking off my boots before going in through the back door and slipping on my cooking clogs. I throw together the batter for some muffins, then start breaking eggs for omelets and scrambles.</p><p>I know I need to see Malone, apologize and try to make things right. But it\u2019s going to be hard, and I need a little time to plan what I want to say. Can\u2019t be rambling all over the place as I usually do. Still, it\u2019s hard to find a nice way to say \u201cI thought you were sleeping around on me, fathering children...Want to see a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, boss,\u201d Octavio says, coming in the back. \u201cNice day, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it sucks, Tavy,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of moving to Florida or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Florida,\u201d he answers. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>Stuart slides onto his stool at the counter. \u201cGood morning, Maggie,\u201d he says. \u201cGot any apple pie this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEve with a lid on it, coming up,\u201d I tell him, forcing a smile. \u201cAnd one blonde with sand.\u201d I pour him his coffee and slide a creamer over.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Stuart says, shaking out two sugar packets. \u201cEve with a lid. I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMold with that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHmm...would that be cheese?\u201d he guesses correctly.</p><p>\u201cYup. Side of cheddar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, Maggie. No mold.\u201d</p><p>I settle down as I work. The diner, my shining little jewel, calms me. When Granddad owned it, I have to confess, it was much more a diner in the bad sense of the word. Fairly filthy, mediocre, greasy food, lots of prepared stuff that Granddad would just heat. Even if I don\u2019t win the best breakfast title, I know that Joe\u2019s is the heart of our town. Where would Rolly and Ben go? Who would throw Stuart his diner lingo? Where would Georgie work? Where would Judy pretend to work?</p><p>Speaking of Georgie, in he bursts, an ebullient ray of sunshine. \u201cHi, Maggie! Did you see the sunrise today? It was so pretty!\u201d He hugs me tight. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I tell him. \u201cMuffins are still warm if you want one, Georgie. Or two. And Tavy\u2019s waiting to scramble your eggs.\u201d</p><p>The regulars are in and out early, and only a couple of people still linger. I wipe down the counters and start the meat loaf for today\u2019s lunch special. Everyone loves meat loaf day, so I know we\u2019ll be busy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bell above the door tinkles and in comes Father Tim. I flush, remembering that horrid flash of a moment when I thought he was the father of Chantal\u2019s baby. \u201cHey, Father Tim!\u201d I call out.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Maggie,\u201d he says. \u201cHow are you, Georgie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, Father Tim!\u201d Georgie announces. \u201cI\u2019m great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s everything?\u201d I ask Father Tim. \u201cI, um, haven\u2019t seen you for a while.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Maggie,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been a bit swamped these days. Some difficult matters to attend to.\u201d</p><p>Difficult matters...like how to leave the priesthood? He slides into his booth and smiles up at me. I force a smile back. \u201cI\u2019m thinking it\u2019s the eggs benedict today, love.\u201d</p><p>Is it normal for a priest to call his friend \u201clove\u201d? Am I reading into too much here? What did the \u201ccounting on it\u201d phrase mean, exactly?</p><p>\u201cMaggie? Eggs benedict?\u201d His smile is full of warmth.</p><p>\u201cRight. Right, Father Tim. Coming up.\u201d</p> <p>I FIND MYSELF pedaling up the hill to Malone\u2019s house on Thursday. The late afternoon wind gusts hard enough to make biking difficult, and I have to stand on the pedals to make it to the top. I still haven\u2019t figured out exactly what I\u2019ll say to Malone, but I can\u2019t put it off any more.</p><p>Because it\u2019s so windy, the lobster boats are all in today, bobbing wildly on their moorings. I stop and take in the view. The water is deep blue with sprays of foam dancing off the waves. White horses, my dad once called them. The sky is rich, a blue so pure you can almost taste it, thin cirrus clouds streaking across the horizon. The leaves on some of the earlier trees are out, and hyacinth and daffodils poke up here and there. The past few days have been sunny, and the mud has finally dried into earth. Tomorrow we may even hit fifty-five degrees, the weatherman says. People will be wearing shorts, teenagers will grease themselves up with baby oil and iodine and try to fry some color into their skin. Maybe I\u2019ll take a hike up in the blueberry barrens. Maybe Malone will want to come with me.</p><p>I knock on his door, but there\u2019s no answer. However, I hear a vague banging from the back, so I walk around to the dooryard. Malone is wrestling some traps off his pickup, and at first he doesn\u2019t see me. I take a minute to study him.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to believe I ever called him unattractive, because now he\u2019s the most appealing man I\u2019ve ever seen. Even compared to Father Tim. Long and lanky but with the broad shoulders common to lobstermen, he moves with efficient grace, hefting the pots onto the ground. The lines of his face tell the story of Washington County?severe, difficult and beautiful, too. His flannel shirt flaps in the breeze, his workboots thunking against the floor of the cab. Then he sees me and freezes, midswing.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say.</p><p>He sets the trap down, then turns to unload the final two or three. Not exactly the warm greeting that would make this a little easier for me, but hey. He\u2019s got reason to be mad at me; more than he knows, in fact.</p> <p>\u201cGot a minute?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He picks up two traps, one in either hand, and walks them to his cellar door, then returns to the pile of traps and repeats the action. Apparently, he\u2019s not going to stop.</p><p>\u201cUm, Malone, well...listen, can you take a break for a second? I really...just...I need to...\u201d He tosses the traps down with considerably more emphasis than the last time and finally relents, leaning against the tailgate of his truck, oozing impatience. I inch a little closer so I won\u2019t have to yell to be heard. I\u2019m nervous, I realize. Of course, he\u2019s glaring and that doesn\u2019t do much to put a person at ease. Did he ever actually smile at me? It\u2019s hard to conjure at this moment.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, fiddling with the zipper of my jacket. \u201cHow are you? How\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>He says nothing, just stares at me from those icy eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, okay, listen, Malone. Um, I\u2019m here to apologize. Remember I said you weren\u2019t my type?\u201d I wince even as I speak...Of course he remembers, dummy, you were such a bitch, who could forget? \u201cRight. So anyway, here\u2019s the thing. I think we might have a laugh over this, actually.\u201d</p><p>Malone continues glowering, and he is, I must admit, excellent at it. A true skill.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cMalone, look. I thought you were the father of Chantal\u2019s baby. That\u2019s why I broke up with you.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes widen slightly, then narrow dangerously. My nervousness grows, and my mouth picks up velocity. \u201cYeah. I?I?I just misunderstood something. See, I was there, that night that Chantal told you she was pregnant. I was listening to you play the piano, and?\u201d God, his scowl could make an Al Qaeda terrorist wet himself. \u201cOkay, I guess I should\u2019ve stayed and heard the whole thing, but I didn\u2019t. But she...I know that I was wrong. And I\u2019m wicked sorry.\u201d</p><p>Malone considers me for another long moment. \u201cYou thought I slept with Chantal,\u201d he states, as if for clarification.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes. Sorry.\u201d Adrenaline makes my feet prickle. I tuck some hair behind my ears and try not to look at that scowling face.</p><p>\u201cEver think about asking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould have, but no.\u201d I realize I\u2019m compulsively zipping and unzipping my jacket...zip, zap, zip, zap. \u201cYou can be...um, a little, uh, hard. Hard to talk to.\u201d Zip. Zap.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Maggie. So you thought I was two-timing you, with Chantal, no less, and didn\u2019t bother saying anything about it. Great. Thanks for coming over.\u201d He picks up two traps and starts stacking them in the dooryard.</p><p>\u201cMalone...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he barks, and I jump.</p><p>\u201cI thought...I kind of thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What did you think, Maggie?\u201d He drops the pots with a crash and puts his gloved hands on his hips.</p><p>I wince. \u201cUm...well, maybe you could...you know. Forgive me. Because I was thinking the wrong thing. That\u2019s why I broke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, Maggie,\u201d he snarls. \u201cI don\u2019t want the priest\u2019s leftovers.\u201d</p><p>Youch! Direct hit, like a blow to the head. My mouth drops open. \u201cLeftovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, coming over to me. I have to force myself not to look away. \u201cYou spend half your time drooling over that guy, dropping everything when he crooks his finger. You don\u2019t want to be with a real person. Think it\u2019s an accident you picked a priest to fall in love with?\u201d</p><p>My head jerks back. \u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother. Any relationship you and I might\u2019ve had was a joke, anyway. You were just killing time with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t killing time!\u201d I yelp. \u201cYou never?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want anyone to know that we were together, did you, Maggie?\u201d Malone asks. He jerks another trap off the truck and I jump out the way. \u201cThink I didn\u2019t notice that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, neither did you, Malone!\u201d I snap, my face heating with anger. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you were falling over yourself to see me. You never came into the diner. You never came over for dinner or lunch or anything! We were sleeping together. We didn\u2019t do much more than that.\u201d His jaw clenches, and I continue. \u201cWhat about that day you went overboard? I wanted to see how you were doing and you practically kicked me out of your house. That\u2019s not what happens in a real relationship, Malone.\u201d</p><p>Malone hurls the traps onto the pile and turns to face me, folding his arms across his chest. The anger shimmers off him in waves, and I feel my own rising to match it.</p><p>\u201cSee, the way I see it,\u201d I say tightly, \u201ca relationship would involve, I don\u2019t know?talking? Communication? A little more than just sex, maybe? Now, okay, the thing when Colonel died, that was nice. But Malone, you barely speak to me! Not about your daughter, not about your family, nothing! I don\u2019t even know your first name!\u201d</p><p>His whole face looks knotted and furious, but I don\u2019t care. Everything I\u2019m saying is pathetically true, and if he won\u2019t talk, then I will. \u201cRemember that piece of pie?\u201d I snap. \u201cI wanted to give you some pie for helping me out, but God forbid you should come in and eat it, right? God forbid that anyone is allowed to be nice to you, Malone, let alone?\u201d love you, I\u2019m about to say, but fortunately or not, he interrupts.</p><p>\u201cMaggie?\u201d he says through clenched teeth. His jaw is iron, his neck stiff. \u201cWe\u2019re done here.\u201d And then he turns and walks away.</p><p>I\u2019M SHAKING WITH RAGE the whole way home. Stupid Maggie, to think that Malone?Malone!?would forgive me. Ha! The wind snatches the words from my mouth as I mutter aloud. \u201cOf course I thought you were the father! How many times does a woman burst in and say \u2018I\u2019m pregnant\u2019 to a man who\u2019s not the father? Not many! So it wasn\u2019t such a stretch. You\u2019d think you could cut me a little slack, Malone!\u201d</p><p>Mrs. K. is lying in wait, an arthritic little panther, when I stomp up the porch steps. \u201cMaggie, dear! I need a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I sigh. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to help if you\u2019re in a mood, dear.\u201d She folds her arms and frowns disapprovingly.</p><p>\u201cMrs. K., whatever you need, I\u2019m happy to help. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve had a really shitty day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to tell me about it?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I laugh grimly. \u201cNo. But thank you. I\u2019d like to forget it, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could watch a movie,\u201d she suggests, and there\u2019s a hopeful note in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d I say. \u201cThat would be just the ticket.\u201d I reach down and give her a careful hug. \u201cThank you, Mrs. K.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how sweet you are! The Fly is on TNT tonight, and I\u2019ve been dying to see it again!\u201d</p><p>And so I fix us some dinner, cut the new bunion pad for her as directed and make popcorn. As we watch Jeff Goldblum vomit on and then consume a donut, Mrs. K. reaches over and squeezes my hand. \u201cThings will get better, dear,\u201d she murmurs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I tell her, and her cheeks flush with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, honey,\u201d she says. The Fly goes into commercial break. \u201cNow tell me, dear, when is that handsome man coming back? MacDuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalone,\u201d I correct automatically. \u201cWe broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d she says. \u201cWell. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll work things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Mrs. K. He\u2019s a little too busy hating me to work anything out right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, too bad for him, right, my dear? You\u2019ll meet someone else and he\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I\u2019m quite certain she\u2019s wrong.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>THE NEXT DAY, Jonah drags himself into the diner. \u201cMy God, you look awful,\u201d I say. \u201cHung over?\u201d</p><p>Jonah\u2019s groan of misery answers for him. \u201cJust coffee today, Mags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, baby boy.\u201d I take pity on him and set the cup gently on the counter. \u201cWhat\u2019s new, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing. Hey, Maggot...\u201d Jonah glances around. Only Judy is within range, pretending to read a book as she eavesdrops while Rolly gets himself more coffee.</p><p>\u201cJudy,\u201d I say. \u201cHow about a ciggie break?\u201d</p><p>She scowls. \u201cFine, fine. I always get kicked out when it\u2019s something juicy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you won\u2019t have to pretend to be working,\u201d Jonah offers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pretending anything, little boy.\u201d She cuffs him on the back of the head as she walks past. Jonah yelps, then winces.</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad hangover, isn\u2019t it? Such are the wages of sin, the Bible tells us,\u201d I say with mock seriousness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSave it,\u201d my brother mutters. \u201cMaggie, are you seeing Malone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no. No.\u201d My face warms, and I grab a few ketchup bottles for refilling. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jonah sighs morosely. \u201cI thought you guys were hanging out lately. Anyway, I heard something about him the other day.\u201d His voice trails to a mutter.</p><p>\u201cOh, really? What was that?\u201d I ask, hoping for and failing to achieve a casual tone.</p> <p>\u201cHe and Chantal are having a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No, they\u2019re not. What?where did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown at the dock,\u201d Jonah answers. He takes a listless sip of coffee, then shudders.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not really my business to talk about this, Joe, but...\u201d Shit, what is the protocol on this? \u201cSee, actually, Chantal told me that the father is some out-of-towner. Not from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jonah stares into his coffee.</p> <p>\u201cWho told you it was Malone?\u201d I can\u2019t help but ask. \u201cI mean, does everyone know Chantal\u2019s...you know? Pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Bunch of guys were talking at the co-op yesterday. Johnny French, Dad, Billy Bottoms, Sam...I don\u2019t know. But yeah. Word\u2019s out on Chantal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys gossip worse than a bunch of high-school girls.\u201d</p><p>Jonah forces a smile and presses his thumb against his eye socket.</p><p>\u201cWant some aspirin, hon?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he says. I fetch the bottle and hand him two.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad about Chantal,\u201d I say to my brother, remembering his long-standing crush on her. \u201cMaybe the post office has your mail-order bride.\u201d</p><p>He gives a halfhearted laugh. \u201cThanks. Hey, you going to see Mom later?\u201d he asks, standing.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cYeah. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid goodbye yesterday. Can\u2019t believe she\u2019s really moving.\u201d</p><p>It is a little hard to believe?our mother, she of the Sunday dinners and good china, is moving out of the house she\u2019s lived in for thirty years. Both she and my dad are putting a good spin on things...new start, yadda yadda...but there\u2019s a sadness to both of them these days.</p><p>My dad\u2019s in the bomb shelter when I go over. He\u2019s crying as he screws in a perch on a tiny birdhouse.</p><p>\u201cHey, Daddy,\u201d I say, my throat growing tight at the sight of my father in tears.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Maggie,\u201d he says, surreptitiously wiping his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess so. It\u2019s just a sad day, you know?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYou sure it\u2019s what you want, Dad? Are you having second thoughts?\u201d I pick up a tiny scrap of wood shaving and toy with it.</p><p>Dad sighs hugely. \u201cI think we need to try being apart,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing together hasn\u2019t made either of us real happy. Doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love your mother, of course. I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I watch as he taps a shingle, no bigger than a postage stamp, onto the roof of the birdhouse. \u201cThat\u2019s a cute one,\u201d I say. \u201cI like the tire swing. Do you think they\u2019ll use it?\u201d</p><p>Dad smiles. \u201cYou never know.\u201d</p><p>Upstairs, my mom is folding some clothes into a suitcase. \u201cHi, Maggie,\u201d she says brightly.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Fine.\u201d Her smile doesn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cA door closes, a window breaks, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I\u2019m going to miss those screwed-up clich\u00e9s. \u201cAre you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d She nods briskly and continues packing.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your job,\u201d I urge, sitting on the bed. It\u2019s hard not to cry, but I swallow and try to be excited for her.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s nothing, really. I\u2019ll just be answering phones,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cStill, you got a job at a magazine. That\u2019s great,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>I look in the box of things she\u2019s packing, a surprisingly paltry amount. My mother is taking?for now, anyway?only some clothes, a few pictures of us kids and Violet and some books. She\u2019s leaving all the pots and pans, all the Hummel figures, the paintings, all the crap of a three-decade-long marriage, and starting fresh.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re really brave, Mom,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She bursts into tears and sinks onto the bed next to me, covering her face with her hands.</p><p>\u201cOh, Maggie,\u201d she sobs. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m terrified! I have no idea how I\u2019m going to pull this off.... I have this awful image of myself, creeping back here in the dead of night because I just don\u2019t know how to live on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, don\u2019t cry. It\u2019ll be okay. You can call me anytime, you know that, right? I\u2019ll come right down. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to the moon.\u201d I pat her back. \u201cI\u2019ll help you pick out new towels and pillows and stuff like that. We can go to the outlets and have lunch. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me hopefully. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cAbsolutely. And if you do come back, it won\u2019t be creeping in the dead of night. It\u2019ll be because you want to, not because you have to.\u201d</p><p>She sighs, then blows her nose. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d She pauses. \u201cYou could come with me, Maggie. The apartment has two bedrooms.\u201d There\u2019s a touching note of hope in her voice, and I smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mom. Thanks for asking. But I\u2019m...I\u2019m really happy here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you, honey?\u201d</p><p>I think a minute. \u201cYes. I am, Mom. I know you wanted more for me, but I love what I do. Even if it\u2019s blue-collar, even if I\u2019ve never really lived anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about...marriage? Children?\u201d she asks carefully. I can see she\u2019s trying not to have a fight.</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice. I do want those things,\u201d I acknowledge. \u201cBut it\u2019ll happen when it happens, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want you to look back on your life twenty years from now, Maggie, and see all the things you could have done,\u201d Mom says, blowing her nose again.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll look back and see all the things I did do, Mom,\u201d I say, a little starch creeping into my voice. \u201cI\u2019ll see that I fed people and welcomed them, I helped them and kept them company...those are good things, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are, Maggie,\u201d she says, standing up to resume her packing. \u201cBut what about you, sweetheart? I want you to have someone to take care of you, too. You deserve that, you know. And if you can\u2019t find someone wonderful, someone like Will, then you need to take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. It\u2019s hard to disagree with that. \u201cWell,\u201d I say, forcing a smile. \u201cYou need to be thinking about your own life, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my life, Maggie,\u201d she says matter-of-factly, not looking at me. \u201cThe child who needs me the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT CAN I GET YOU, girls?\u201d Paul Dewey bellows a few days later. \u201cWill the little mother be drinking tonight?\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open. \u201cDewey knows, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNews travels fast,\u201d Chantal murmurs. \u201cHow about cranberry juice, Dewey, hon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a Sam Adams, Paul,\u201d I call.</p><p>He brings our drinks over and sits with us, gazing lovingly at Chantal\u2019s br**sts, which have grown noticeably in her delicate condition. \u201cSo, Chantal, sweetheart, who\u2019s the lucky guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost guys in this town have been lucky at one time or another,\u201d I quip. Chantal chuckles, but Dewey turns a scowling face to me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no way to talk about a lady in her condition, Maggie. Shame on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Chantal,\u201d I say. \u201cPlease forgive me for stating the truth.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, and I feel a rush of more affection than I\u2019ve felt for her before. Chantal has never pretended to be anything other than what she is, and for that, I admire her.</p><p>\u201cSo, Chantal, you gonna come clean with old Dewey? Who knocked you up, girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business, Paul,\u201d Chantal says coyly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I heard a rumor,\u201d Dewey says.</p><p>\u201cOh, really? About little old me?\u201d Chantal asks.</p><p>\u201cAyuh,\u201d Dewey says. \u201cAbout you and a certain someone who hasn\u2019t been around much lately. Afraid to show his face, apparently.\u201d</p><p>Chantal and I exchange looks, her smile fading. \u201cReally,\u201d she says. \u201cSpill, Dewey.\u201d</p><p>Dewey does. \u201cMalone. Is he the father?\u201d</p><p>I choke on my beer, lurching forward in my seat as tears swamp my eyes and nose.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chantal says firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s not Malone. I never even slept with him, Dewey, and that\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not what I heard,\u201d Dewey drawls.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, wouldn\u2019t I be in a better position to know?\u201d Chantal hisses, eyes narrowing, as I continue to splutter.</p><p>\u201cWord on the street is that Malone won\u2019t own up to being the daddy. That he won\u2019t take a DNA test so he can avoid paying child support. Well, don\u2019t you worry, Chantal, honey. We\u2019ll make sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDewey, this is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d I wheeze, still coughing. \u201cIf Chantal says it\u2019s not Malone, it\u2019s not Malone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not Malone,\u201d she confirms.</p><p>\u201cSure, sure, darlin\u2019. If you say so.\u201d Dewey hauls himself up and lumbers to the bar.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Chantal mutters, patting my back. With her uncharacteristically straight answer, Chantal has cemented the idea that Malone is indeed the father of her baby. \u201cWhere did he hear that? Maggie, you didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I protest. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t tell anyone anything.\u201d I consider for a moment. \u201cWell, I told Christy what I thought, but she wouldn\u2019t tell anyone. I\u2019m sure of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Well, screw it. Someone else\u2019s name will come up in about five more minutes.\u201d She takes a sip of her juice and rubs her stomach unconsciously.</p><p>\u201cChantal,\u201d I ask. \u201cAre you sure you shouldn\u2019t tell the father? Doesn\u2019t he have rights and stuff like that?\u201d</p><p>Her face falls. \u201cMaggie, it\u2019s not that simple. It would completely screw up his life. We only did it once, and I\u2019m not going to saddle him with a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he married?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cBut he\u2019s...look, I\u2019m just not going to tell, okay? Oh, look. Malone just came in.\u201d</p><p>My physical reaction is immediate and dramatic. My face flushes lobster red, my legs go loose and watery, and my heart rate doubles. Malone sees us?it\u2019s hard to miss the only two females in the bar, especially when you\u2019re accused of impregnating one and have slept with the other?and gives a characteristically curt nod in our general direction. Then he sits at the bar and waits for Dewey to notice him.</p><p>Dewey ignores him.</p><p>\u201cCan I get a beer?\u201d Malone growls after a solid minute has passed.</p><p>\u201cNot in my bar, you can\u2019t,\u201d Dewey answers.</p><p>\u201cDewey!\u201d Chantal yelps. \u201cAre you being an ass?\u201d She pushes back from our table and sashays up to the bar. \u201cHi, Malone,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he grunts.</p><p>\u201cDewey, is there a problem here?\u201d Chantal asks.</p><p>Malone stands up, glances at me and grabs his coat.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Chantal says. \u201cStay, Malone. Dewey, what\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf a man can\u2019t acknowledge his responsibilities, honey, he can\u2019t expect people not to care,\u201d Dewey begins. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not the only one who thinks so. Heard you got some lines cut, Malone.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, shit.

But the men of Gideon\u2019s Cove feel very proprietary toward Chantal, who has given many of them a happy night or two, and if they think Malone is shirking his duties, they\u2019re bound to take action. Malone remains silent.</p><p>\u201cI already told you, Malone\u2019s not the father!\u201d Chantal barks. \u201cI never slept with him, and it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying. My trying. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Chantal,\u201d Malone says. \u201cSee you.\u201d</p><p>Without any thought backing my movement, I\u2019m up and across the bar in a heartbeat. \u201cHi, Malone,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cMaggie.\u201d He gives me a quick once-over, then stares off over my shoulder. \u201cHave a good night,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cMalone, hang on.\u201d I put my hand on his arm to stop him, swallowing. Perhaps I should have thought before I acted, but apparently it\u2019s not my way. \u201cPeople are saying you\u2019re the father of Chantal\u2019s baby,\u201d I announce pointlessly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I picked up on that. Wonder where they got that idea.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s hard to look him in the face, but I do. The scowl lines are in full force. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone what I thought, Malone. Well, except Christy. But she wouldn\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>He just stares at me.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably why your lines got cut,\u201d I say stupidly.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d The contempt in his eyes stings.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do, Malone?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cNothing. If Chantal doesn\u2019t want people to know who the father is, that\u2019s her business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He looks at me and doesn\u2019t answer, choosing instead to pull on his coat. Chantal is still in a heated argument with Dewey. \u201cTake care,\u201d he says, heading for the door.</p> <p>\u201cMalone?\u201d I call, taking a step in his direction. He doesn\u2019t stop, doesn\u2019t even turn his head, just pushes open the door and heads out.</p><p>\u201cOh, great!\u201d Chantal huffs. \u201cHe left! That\u2019s just great, Dewey. Come on, Maggie, let\u2019s get out of here. I\u2019m very mad at you, Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChantal, honey, I was just?\u201d Dewey attempts, but Chantal is riding a wave of moral outrage, and out we go.</p><p>\u201cPoor Malone,\u201d she murmurs as she takes out her keys. \u201cWell, I\u2019m kind of tired anyway, Maggie. See you Thursday?\u201d</p><p>Her day for lunch at the diner. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I go back to my lonely, too-empty apartment. It\u2019s looked strange since I purged my little collections; Dad\u2019s birdhouses and pictures of Violet are the only decorations I have left. Colonel dying has left a huge void, too. I click around the TV, too distracted to think about any one thing in particular.</p><p>At 2:00 a.m., I jolt awake. I did tell someone. By accident, of course?Billy Bottoms. That day at the dock, I was talking to myself. I didn\u2019t realize he heard me.</p><p>Shit.</p> <p>Sleep is ruined for the night. I assure myself that Billy didn\u2019t hear me that day. And this is a tiny town. Malone and Chantal have spoken at Dewey\u2019s any number of times, so there\u2019s no reason to think that this rumor is my fault. Chantal is generous with her affection, she flirts with Malone (as much as it\u2019s possible to flirt with Malone, anyway), so there you go. Billy didn\u2019t hear me. I\u2019m sure.</p><p>I still can\u2019t get back to sleep.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>A FEW DAYS LATER, I walk to St. Mary\u2019s in a gentle, steady, cozy rain. I miss Colonel so much it aches...the past few days have been so quiet, both at the diner and in my personal life, that I\u2019m a little stir-crazy. The diner is closed for the day, the baking done. It\u2019s not my night for Meals on Wheels, and I\u2019ve spent so much time at Christy\u2019s lately that she told me outright to give her a little space. Clearly, it\u2019s time for me to find another dog.</p><p>So. The high school had a dance in the church basement this past weekend, and I decide to go over and clean the kitchen, which always suffers during this type of event.</p><p>As I cross the street, I see Bishop Tranturo walking out of the rectory. Father Tim stands in the doorway, his arms crossed on his chest. He sees me and lifts his hand in a wave, then goes back in, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Bishop Tranturo has been around forever. He\u2019s not often seen in these parts, as we are a tiny parish, but I remember his round, jolly face from years past. When making his annual visit to confirm Gideon\u2019s Cove\u2019s Catholic teenagers, he usually stops by the diner for breakfast. In fact, he presided over my own confirmation.</p><p>I wonder what he\u2019s doing here. I wonder?</p><p>\u201cHi, Bishop,\u201d I call out, splashing across the street as he\u2019s about to get into his car.</p><p>\u201cHello, dear,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you are...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie. Maggie Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he says, recognition lighting his cherubic face. \u201cYou\u2019re Maggie, from the diner. Of course. Nice to see you.\u201d He smiles and waits.</p><p>\u201cSo how are things?\u201d I ask. \u201cHow\u2019s everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fine, dear. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m...so. We love Father Tim around here. He\u2019s great. A great priest.\u201d My stomach cramps with anxiety.</p><p>Bishop Tranturo nods and looks over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIs he leaving? Is that why you\u2019re here?\u201d I blurt, glancing back at the rectory. \u201cIs Father Tim...?\u201d</p><p>The bishop sighs, his breath fogging in the cool air. \u201cI think I\u2019ll let him tell you that himself, dear,\u201d he says. \u201cTake care. God bless you, my child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, yes. Thanks. And you, too,\u201d I say manically. \u201cDrive safely. Bye.\u201d</p><p>I step back and let him get into his car. The rain is falling harder now, but I barely notice.</p><p>Father Tim is leaving the priesthood.</p><p>My heart pounds sickly in my chest and my legs feel weak and shaky. Lost in thought, I drift into the church and slide into the last pew.</p><p>It\u2019s empty in here, the smell of lemon oil and candles soothing and welcoming. The door clicks shut behind me, and I am alone in this haven of stillness. The rain patters against the small stained-glass windows, and below me, the furnace kicks on. The candles in the front flicker in the drafts. Only one light is on, shining gently on the cross that hangs over the altar.</p><p>I haven\u2019t been in St. Mary\u2019s for a while, too flustered by Father Tim to come here. And it\u2019s a shame, really, because it\u2019s lovely, truly a place to think, to open myself up and listen for a whisper of wisdom. I haven\u2019t done that in a long time. My embarrassment over Father Tim has distracted me from any true spirituality I might have had in the past year.</p><p>Father Tim. My mind is oddly blank as I sit there. Fragments of conversations slip through, but I\u2019m unable to hold on to one. Father Tim has been lonely. He cares about me. I\u2019m special to him. He\u2019s counting on that...and he asked me about Father Shea.</p><p>The question is, what if it\u2019s true? What if he\u2019s leaving the priesthood and wants to find someone? What if he thinks he wants to be with me? What then? It\u2019s not like I have other contenders...the pet psychic, the groin injury guy, the old men...and unforgiving, closed-off, angry Malone.</p><p>I rush outside and over to the rectory, bursting in on Mrs. Plutarski.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I demand. \u201cI know he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very busy,\u201d Mrs. P. answers. \u201cWhat\u2019s got into you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather Tim?\u201d I call, sticking my head into his office. He\u2019s not there. \u201cFather Tim?\u201d I shove my wet hair back from my face.</p><p>He comes into the common room, holding a cup of tea. \u201cAh, Maggie,\u201d he says warmly. \u201cJust the person I wanted to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather Tim,\u201d I say, grabbing his arm. \u201cI need to speak with you. It\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. P. sighs dramatically. \u201cAnother death in the family, Maggie? Your goldfish this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me,\u201d I tell her. Father Tim\u2019s eyes widen as I tow him through the common room, into the kitchen. I don\u2019t want Mrs. Plutarski to overhear us, and I know she\u2019ll try.</p><p>\u201cHere now, Maggie, maybe you should slow down. In fact, I was hoping to see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d I tell him. He obeys, and I take a seat opposite him at the small table. \u201cI just spoke to Bishop Tranturo. About, you know...you.\u201d My hands are shaking, the palms sweaty.</p><p>Father Tim\u2019s face grows somber. \u201cDid you, now? I was hoping to tell you myself.\u201d He gives me a sad smile. \u201cMaggie, you know I care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I bark. \u201cPlease wait. Don\u2019t say anything.\u201d I take a deep breath, then another, as Father Tim looks at me, concerned and expectant. \u201cOkay...um, Father Tim,\u201d I say more gently. \u201cListen. You are a wonderful priest and the thing is, I understand that it\u2019s not always easy for you, but...\u201d I swallow. He waits patiently. \u201cListen, Father Tim, you\u2019re a very nice, kind man. And of course I...you know. Care for you. But I think you\u2019re making a mistake. You know, about leaving. You can\u2019t just give this all up!\u201d</p><p>Father Tim sighs and leans back in his chair. \u201cI know, Maggie. It\u2019s been wonderful. I\u2019ve loved being pastor here, as you know. But change is going to come, whether we like it or not.\u201d</p><p>I take another breath, my legs feeling weak and sick. \u201cDoes anyone else know about?about your, um, decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Maggie. I was planning to say something at Mass.\u201d At Mass! My mouth falls open, but he continues. \u201cOf course, the bishop knows, but that goes without saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, wait. I need to say this.\u201d My hands are curled into fists. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, you and I, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think you have a lot of nice qualities.\u201d He blinks, ever patient. \u201cRight. So. You know I had a killer crush on you.\u201d He smiles?is that a happy smile? Forgiving? Expectant??and I force myself to go on. \u201cBut, Father Tim, I don\u2019t anymore. I just think you should know that. In case I was figuring into your decision in any way. Any way whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>The smile falters, flickers, then dies completely. \u201cI\u2019m not clear on what you\u2019re getting at, Maggie,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cWhy would you figure into it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the thing with Father Sh?um, what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He frowns, clearly puzzled. \u201cAh...well, why don\u2019t you say what\u2019s on your mind, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip, wince, and go for it. \u201cUm...I don\u2019t want you to leave the priesthood because of me.\u201d</p><p>Under other circumstances, Father Tim\u2019s reaction would be funny. He lurches back in his seat, then staggers to his feet, grabbing the chair and putting it between us. \u201cDear Lord, Maggie! I\u2019m not leaving the priesthood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God!\u201d A hysterical laugh escapes my lips. \u201cOh, thank God! Great! This is great news!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?why?where on earth did you get an idea like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...um...ah...\u201d Breathe, Maggie, breathe. He\u2019s not leaving the priesthood. \u201cWell, Bishop Tranturo...he said you were leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being transferred to another parish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Oh, that is fantastic news.\u201d I heave a sigh of relief, my head spinning. Father Tim cocks his head. \u201cOkay. That makes a lot more sense.\u201d I pause. \u201cI guess I just thought that...well, you said a few things that I thought...I was afraid you had feelings for me, Father Tim.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrow, and he keeps a good grip on the chair, and he keeps that chair solidly between us. \u201cMaggie,\u201d he says, very, very carefully, \u201cI think you\u2019re a lovely person, but no. No feelings of a romantic sort. At all. Ever. I\u2019d hope we\u2019d stay friends after I leave, but of course, nothing else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s great. Sure. I just could\u2019ve sworn...\u201d My heart rate is returning to normal, and I take a deep breath. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m sorry that the parish is losing you, but Father Tim, what about Father Shea? I mean, you...you seemed kind of interested in him, and there were these things you said about me and being friends and...\u201d My voice trails off.</p><p>Father Tim closes his eyes in understanding. \u201cOh, dear. I\u2019m so sorry if I ever led you to believe...oh, shite. No, Maggie, Michael Shea, formerly Father Shea, has been in hospice, and I had to ask the bishop if special arrangements might be required for his funeral, being that he was a priest at one time...nothing else, Maggie.\u201d He pauses tentatively. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry if I ever gave you any impression whatsoever that...well. I\u2019m not sure what to say.\u201d</p><p>At this point, he could say he was pregnant and I wouldn\u2019t care. He\u2019s not leaving the priesthood, he\u2019s not in love with me, and I am simply limp with relief. No doubt other feelings are going to make themselves known sometime soon, but right now, all I feel is utter, beautiful reprieve.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not say anything, okay?\u201d I offer. \u201cIn fact, if we could just pretend this conversation never took place...\u201d</p> <p>He offers me an uneasy smile. \u201cThat would probably be best,\u201d he agrees. \u201cThough I\u2019m glad to hear your crush on me is done.\u201d</p><p>I pause. \u201cSt. Mary\u2019s is really going to miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I them. And now, Maggie, I have things I need to take care of....\u201d</p><p>On trembling legs, I walk through the rectory. Alas, Mrs Plutarski\u2019s lips are white with disapproval, and I know her too well to believe she wasn\u2019t eavesdropping. She\u2019ll tell everyone. Once more, Gideon\u2019s Cove is going to have a good laugh over me, but right now, I simply don\u2019t care.</p><p>A bit numbly, I walk through the rain and find myself at the harbor. The boats are all out, as the demand for lobsters has already risen, though it\u2019s only May. I picture Malone out there, alone. Maloner the Loner.</p> <p>I miss him irrationally.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p><p>ON MONDAY, my day off, I give Mrs. K.\u2019s apartment a quick clean, leave her a chicken and spinach casserole and kiss her goodbye. Then I run back upstairs and survey my closet.</p><p>This errand has been a long time coming. I\u2019m not sure what to wear. I\u2019d be happy in a Joe\u2019s Diner T-shirt and jeans, but maybe something nicer would help at the critical moment. Plus, my mother will be happy to see me in something that\u2019s not stained, so I pull out some cream-colored pants that Christy bought me two Christmases ago and top it with a chocolaty silk shirt. I brush my hair and put it into a French twist, add some big gold hoops, a little lip gloss and mascara, a few dashes of blush. Then I hop into my car and head out of town.</p><p>It takes about an hour and a half to reach my destination, and the drive is beautiful. The ponds gleam an electric blue under the cloudless sky, the leaves are that engaging shade of pale green. The sun beats through the windshield and I crack my window a little, turn up the radio and sing along.</p><p>I haven\u2019t heard from Father Tim since our last conversation a week ago. He hasn\u2019t come into the diner, but the word is out that he\u2019s leaving. Most of Gideon\u2019s Cove is devastated. As for me, my feelings are still a bit mixed; I\u2019ll miss him because he was nice to have around, but I sure won\u2019t miss feeling so stupid when it came to him.</p> <p>The directions I got off the Internet last night are fairly accurate, and I find the car dealership with no trouble, right next to McDonald\u2019s, as promised on Mapquest. I pull into the lot in my battered Subaru, a lump of coal among diamonds.</p><p>A rather pleasant thrill of anticipation and nervousness runs down my legs as I get out. I glance at my reflection in the car windows, then turn and go inside.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d asks a pretty woman behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see Skip Parkinson, please,\u201d I say pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She presses a button on the phone. \u201cSkip, please come to the front desk. Skip, front desk, please.\u201d Her voice is soothing and robotic.</p><p>I glance around the showroom while I wait, admiring the sleek lines and tasteful colors of the expensive cars. Cars are like racehorses to me?I enjoy looking at them and have little use for them. Given where I live and what I do, I require something far more pragmatic than a seventy-five thousand dollar big-boy toy.</p><p>\u201cHi, can I show you something today?\u201d Skip\u2019s voice comes from behind me. I turn around.</p><p>\u201cHi, Skip,\u201d I say. He\u2019s wearing a beautiful charcoal suit, his blue shirt open at the neck, stylish as a European duke.</p> <p>His mouth drops open with a quick intake of breath. \u201cMaggie! Wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d I tilt my head and smile. It\u2019s so much more pleasant, being the surpriser, not the surprised.</p><p>\u201cUm, sure. Sure. Uh, come on back to my office.\u201d He walks me to a soulless room in the back of the dealership, his windows overlooking the parking lot. A chrome-and-glass coffee table holds some expensive-looking sales brochures. There\u2019s a matching bookcase along one wall, a large desk covered with papers.</p><p>I sit in a leather chair and look around. Scattered on the walls and shelves are pictures of the Parkinsons?Annabelle, their children, even one of his snobby parents.</p><p>\u201cSo, Maggie, what a nice surprise,\u201d Skip says carefully, lowering himself into the chair opposite me. \u201cAre you looking for a car?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cNo. No car, Skip. I\u2019m just here to see you.\u201d</p><p>He tugs on his shirtsleeves and tries to look pleasantly interested, but a flush is creeping up from his collar. \u201cWell. How nice.\u201d</p><p>I cross my legs and just look at him. Still a handsome devil. But his face is bland, a classic American face, well-proportioned features, brown eyes, the hint of gray in his tidy little beard. Only the lines around his eyes give him any distinction at all. I imagine being married to him, having him come home to our big, lovely house, handing him one of our kids. We might have a cocktail, and I\u2019d feign interest as he told me about the irritating customer who went with the Audi instead of the Lexus SUV he can\u2019t seem to unload.</p><p>I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t end up together. That wasn\u2019t always true, but it is now. Suddenly, I realize I don\u2019t need anything from Skip.</p><p>\u201cSo, Maggie...\u201d Skip says, pasting a fake smile on his lips. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I came for that apology you owe me, Skip,\u201d I answer. The smile falls off his face with a nearly audible thud. \u201cBut...well, I don\u2019t know. I thought it mattered. But it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says. The flush has his face in its grip now. \u201cWell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty bad, you know,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou bringing Annabelle to town, not telling me that we broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I guess I\u2019ve sort of been cleaning house emotionally, you know? And it occurred to me that you never really...well. Like you said, it was a long time ago.\u201d I stand up. \u201cSorry I wasted your time.\u201d</p><p>Skip stands also. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he says, a hopeful note in his voice.</p><p>I laugh a little. \u201cYeah. Kind of anticlimactic, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I stick out my hand. \u201cTake care. Your wife seems very nice.\u201d</p><p>His hand is softer than mine, smooth and pampered. \u201cThank you, Maggie,\u201d he says carefully. \u201cTake care, yourself.\u201d He makes a movement to the door, but I wave him off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see myself out. Goodbye, Skip.\u201d</p><p>When I\u2019ve just reached the door, his voice stops me. \u201cMaggie?\u201d</p><p>I turn. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry.\u201d He looks a little forlorn, somehow. \u201cI wish I\u2019d done it better.\u201d</p><p>I pause, then give a nod. \u201cThanks for saying so.\u201d</p><p>I wave to the receptionist and walk out into the bright sunshine. \u201cWell, that was a waste of gas,\u201d I say to myself as I climb back in my car. But I\u2019m laughing as I say it.</p><p>Around five, I find the building where my mother works and climb the stairs to the third floor. For a second, I just watch her from the doorway?she sits behind the reception counter, wearing a headset, talking animatedly. The wall behind her has Mainah Magazine painted in large green letters.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d I say when she clicks off from her conversation.</p><p>\u201cMaggie!\u201d she cries. We hug and kiss, and I breathe in her familiar perfume, realizing that I\u2019ve missed her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you look nice!\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYou, too. I love your hair,\u201d I tell her. She really does look lovely...not younger, exactly, but very stylish in her bright green top and pretty scarf.</p><p>\u201cLet me introduce you,\u201d Mom says, pulling me along. \u201cLinda, this is my daughter, Maggie. Maggie, this is our editor, Linda Strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I say, shaking her hand.</p><p>\u201cMaggie owns a restaurant,\u201d my mother announces. \u201cCara, this is my daughter, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Maggie. We\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d Cara shakes my hands. \u201cWhere are you going for dinner, Lena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, first I\u2019m going to show her my apartment, then I thought we\u2019d go to Havana.\u201d</p><p>The three women take a moment to discuss the various restaurant choices while I revel in the rare glow of my mom\u2019s pride. A restaurant owner. She\u2019s never called me that before. Formerly, I was a cook or I ran a diner, but today, I own a restaurant.</p><p>She loves hearing about my visit to Skip, loves showing me her tiny apartment. Honestly, I can\u2019t remember a time when she\u2019s gone for so long without criticizing me.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss Dad?\u201d I ask as we eat dinner.</p><p>She thinks a minute. \u201cYes and no,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet in the evenings. I\u2019m so used to having him just be there, I suppose.\u201d Her voice trails off. \u201cI don\u2019t really do anything on my own yet. But there are times when I think I\u2019ve never been happier. I caught a mistake the other day, and Linda told me she didn\u2019t know I could proofread, and now she\u2019s asked me to look over everything before it goes out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Mom. It sounds like you really like it,\u201d I say, watching her flush with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI do. But there are also times when I cry, I\u2019m so lonely,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cWe miss you. All of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home this weekend,\u201d she says. \u201cTo see the baby, and everyone else, of course.\u201d She pauses. \u201cHow are you, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I say. \u201cI...well. There are some things that are clearer to me these days, and I\u2019m trying to kind of sort them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Mom asks.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d I take another bite of fish, then decide to tell her. \u201cI\u2019m over my stupid crush on Father Tim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally.\u201d She smiles, not unkindly. \u201cAre you seeing anyone, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>I feel my back stiffen, preparing for battle. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have someone for you, dear,\u201d she says. \u201cHe works at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, Mom. I need a little break from dating, actually,\u201d I interrupt. I take a breath. \u201cI was seeing someone for a few weeks. Remember Malone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalone? The lobsterman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, we were kind of seeing each other, but then we had a fight.\u201d I take a gulp of water.</p><p>\u201cDid you apologize?\u201d Mom asks.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you assume it was my fault?\u201d I snap, setting my glass down with a thunk and a slosh.</p><p>\u201cWas it?\u201d she says with a smile.</p><p>I grit my teeth, then give a rueful nod. \u201cWell, yes, actually, it was. And I did apologize. But he\u2019s not the forgiving type.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, when you\u2019re ready, then, you let me know and I\u2019ll give you this person\u2019s number. But you don\u2019t have?I mean, I hope...\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t have much time...I hope you won\u2019t wait too long.... I know what she wants to say. But to her credit, she stops herself. \u201cWell. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should probably get going,\u201d I say, glancing at my watch. \u201cIt\u2019s a long drive.\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s eyes fill with tears. \u201cAll right,\u201d she says, fiddling with her bracelet to hide the fact. \u201cIt was so wonderful seeing you, honey.\u201d</p> <p>We walk together to where we parked. \u201cDrive safely, now,\u201d she says. \u201cLet the phone ring once so I know you made it home all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mom. Will do.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her cheek, hug her tight for a minute. It\u2019s still a bit of a shock that I\u2019m taller than my mom. Even though that\u2019s been the case for more than fifteen years, I still expect to look up to her.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M SO TIRED of being a joke, Christy,\u201d I tell my sister as we walk along the shore one afternoon. Violet sits in a backpack on my back, babbling happily.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a joke,\u201d Christy assures me. \u201cYou just drew the wrong conclusions, that\u2019s all. It could happen to anyone.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s the nice thing about having an identical twin. Loyalty. I smile gratefully. Up ahead, a group of puffins scatters at our approach.</p><p>\u201cDird!\u201d my niece yells. \u201cDird!\u201d</p><p>Christy\u2019s mouth drops open in glee. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Violet! Bird!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh-do! Dird!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so smart,\u201d I tell my sister. Violet pulls my hair vigorously, jerking my head back.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Violet,\u201d Christy says, unwrapping her daughter\u2019s pudgy fist. \u201cNo pulling.\u201d</p><p>The air is cool and damp, clouds blowing in from the east. Rain is in the forecast. Gulls cry above us and the waves slap at the shore.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s wrong with Jonah these days?\u201d Christy asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admit. \u201cHe\u2019s been a real sad sack. Unlike him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman trouble?\u201d Christy guesses.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I answer. \u201cI saw him with some cute young thing a while back. They were kissing. He hasn\u2019t named names, though, so I really don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Christy asks, bending down to pick up a piece of sea glass. She studies it for a moment, then slips it into her pocket. \u201cWhat about your love life?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cI think I\u2019m just gonna sit tight for a while,\u201d I say. \u201cNo more obsessing, no more dates. Someone will come along someday, maybe. And if not...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf not, then what?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cIf not, then I\u2019m still okay,\u201d I tell her with a smile. \u201cCan\u2019t have everything, unless your name is Christine Margaret Beaumont Jones.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s true. It\u2019s taken a while, but I\u2019ve been pretty...happy these days. The weight of Father Tim is off my back, as it were, my crush and wonderings finally gone for good. No more guilt over lusting after a priest, no more wasted hours imagining us together. I feel clean, somehow. Emptier, brighter. Like my apartment.</p><p>I smile at my twin, who looks beautiful today, her cheeks flushed with the damp breeze, her hair blowing in wisps around her face. \u201cWhen are you going to tell me?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She stops dead, her mouth falling open, and I laugh and hug her. \u201cCongratulations, Christy,\u201d I say, tears of happiness pricking my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cHow did I miss it?\u201d I ask back. \u201cSo how far along are you?\u201d</p><p>She smiles hugely. \u201cA month. It was a surprise, but we\u2019re thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are. And so am I! Violet,\u201d I say, craning my neck to address my niece. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a big sister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh do!\u201d she proclaims. \u201cGo ba!\u201d</p><p>When we get back to town, Christy and I part ways, and I watch her walk away. Melancholy pricks my heart. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m jealous of her?I love her more than I love anyone. But she doesn\u2019t feel the same way about me. She has Violet and Will, and now a new little crittah on the way. And while that\u2019s as it should be, there\u2019s a small part of me that feels left behind. Once, we were all we needed, Christy and I. Just the two of us.</p><p>I see the Ugly Anne coming into the harbor. There are two figures on deck, a man and a woman. Jonah mentioned that Malone\u2019s daughter is going to be his sternman for the season. It must be nice for Malone, having his child with him all summer. Imagining that closeness, that biological link, causes a sting of jealousy to burn in my heart...and a prickle of shame, too. Because though Father Tim once said I made people feel wonderful, I\u2019m quite sure I didn\u2019t get to do that for Malone. He did it for me, but I didn\u2019t reciprocate.</p><p>EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING, I pack a suitcase and head out of town. Tonight is the Best Awards dinner from Maine Living, all the way down in Portland. Since my car isn\u2019t the most reliable vehicle in the world, Christy loans me the Volvo.</p><p>\u201cGood luck! You\u2019ll win! You deserve it!\u201d she calls from her driveway as I back down. \u201cAnd you look fantastic!\u201d</p><p>Last year, I had a great time at the dinner, meeting other restaurant owners, picking up tips on publicity, advertising, media and the like. I had naively thought that Joe\u2019s might at least come in second, but we didn\u2019t. Of course, last year, I didn\u2019t realize the rules let us print out as many ballots as we wanted. The evil innkeepers (actually, they\u2019re quite nice) at Blackstone B&amp;B were not so ignorant and won by hundreds of votes.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it will mean a significant change if Joe\u2019s wins, but I know it would feel different. How thrilling to put \u201cBest Breakfast in Washington County\u201d in the window! Maine Living will feature the winner in an article with a color photo, which I can already picture: me, Octavio, Judy and Georgie?standing in front, the sun bouncing off Joe\u2019s chrome, the impatiens full and healthy.</p><p>And, I admit, as I pull onto the interstate, it would be nice to drop that nugget at the Blessing of the Fleet this coming weekend. Each year, the Blessing is a marker for our town. Who\u2019s divorced since last year? Whose kid got arrested for drug dealing? Anyone get married? Graduate from college? Buy a house? Have an affair? Bury a spouse? And each year for nearly a decade, I\u2019ve remained the same. No, still not married. Nope, no prospects. No kids. Not engaged. Not seeing anyone. Just at the diner, you know?</p><p>But this year?hopefully?I could say, \u201cWell, maybe you heard that Joe\u2019s Diner just won best breakfast in the county? No? Oh, well, it will be in Maine Living next month...\u201d Each former classmate who returns to town would hear that Joe\u2019s Diner is moving up in the world. That Maggie Beaumont has a real accomplishment to her name.</p><p>\u201cWho am I kidding?\u201d I say out loud. \u201cNo one cares but me. And maybe Octavio.\u201d I turn on the radio.</p><p>It\u2019s a small event when compared with the Pope dying, say, or a U2 concert, but the Best Awards still attract a fair number of people. As a treat, I\u2019ve booked myself in a nice room at the hotel where the awards are being held, a beautiful building on the water in Old Port. I check in, relishing the rarity of the act. The last time I was away for an overnight was last year, for this same event.</p><p>The room is small but elegant, and I indulge in a nap on the sleigh bed, enjoying the fine cotton sheets and down pillows. Afterward, I shower and dress carefully. Maybe I\u2019ll meet someone tonight, who knows? But the thought holds little appeal, oddly enough. God knows, I primped as carefully as a prom queen last year, hoping fervently that I would run into a good-looking, kindhearted Washington County restaurateur or innkeeper. I didn\u2019t, but I sure as hell hoped.</p><p>Nope. This year is different. I\u2019m not over Malone.</p><p>As I let his name enter my consciousness, loneliness wells up in my heart. It would be so much fun if we were together, if I had Malone\u2019s hand to hold tonight. I bet he\u2019d look gorgeous in a suit. And if I didn\u2019t win, well, that would be okay. We\u2019d still have a night in a city together. We could take a walk afterward, or order dessert in our room. We\u2019d sleep past 6:00 a.m. and feel like we\u2019d been away for a week.</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d I tell my reflection. \u201cYou blew it. Now get down to that ballroom and win that award.\u201d</p><p>I DON\u2019T WIN. Blackstone Bed &amp; Breakfast wins for the fifth straight year. I clap dutifully along with the others, congratulate the irritatingly nice couple and order a scotch. Later, when I\u2019m safe in my room, I indulge in a quick cry. Then I call Octavio.</p><p>\u201cWe came in third,\u201d I tell him wetly.</p><p>\u201cHey, third\u2019s not bad,\u201d my cook says.</p><p>\u201cThird sucks, Tavy,\u201d I sniffle. \u201cThere are only about three restaurants in the damn county!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, now you\u2019re just feeling sorry for yourself, boss,\u201d Octavio says. \u201cThird is pretty damn good when you live where we live. Okay? You should be proud of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cHow much did we lose by?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cSixty-seven votes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixty-seven! That\u2019s great! Only sixty-seven! We\u2019ll definitely get it next year, boss.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile. \u201cThanks, big guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you Friday?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe should have a good crowd this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. See you then. I\u2019ll open.\u201d I hang up the phone and look out my window. Portland is so clean and bright and lively, but I\u2019m suffering a bad case of homesickness at the moment. Poor Joe\u2019s. Such a cute little place. It deserves better than third. We do serve the best breakfast in Washington County, and next year, so help us God, we\u2019ll have the award to prove it.</p><p>This year, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to get a restaurant reviewer to the diner. And a travel writer. I\u2019ll e-mail every day if I have to. Send letters. Or better yet, send scones or muffins. Bribe them with the quality of my goods. I can redo the menu, jazz up my lunch specials. Tavy\u2019s right. Sixty-seven more votes is not out of the question. My self-pity dries up with my tears. We didn\u2019t win, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not the best.</p><p>I take the certificate I got from Maine Living and read it. \u201cCongratulations to Joe\u2019s Diner, Gideon\u2019s Cove, Maine. Second Runner Up, Best Breakfast in Washington County.\u201d</p><p>To hell with Washington County, I think, smiling wetly. Someday we\u2019ll get best breakfast in Maine.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p><p>THE BLESSING of the Fleet is held annually the third weekend of May. The boats fly their flags, the town decorates our three public buildings, local organizations sell hot dogs and lobster bisque on the green. The high school band plays, the chorus performs a few patriotic songs. Little Leaguers, the fire department, the board of selectmen and our three living veterans march in the five-minute parade. Then on Sunday, every boat in the harbor lines up and motors to Douglas Point, past the granite memorial for lost fishermen. They continue up to the dock, where the local clergy blesses them and prays for a safe and productive year.</p><p>Last year, Father Tim had been new in town, and I\u2019d still been getting over the embarrassment of my mistake. In order to show what a good sport I was, I threw myself into the planning committee with a vengeance. I baked cookies for the first communion class to sell, donated my efforts to the Saturday night spaghetti supper at the church hall, helped decorate the podium on which Father Tim and the Congregational minister stood to sprinkle holy water on the passing boats. I may be an idiot, I was trying to convey after humiliating myself in front of the town, but at least I\u2019m a hardworking idiot.</p><p>This year, I can admit that maybe Father Tim and I used each other a bit. He got a lot of work out of me this past year, and I, as I can now see quite clearly, got more than a guilty thrill concerning him. It\u2019s safe to be in love with someone you know you\u2019ll never have. Nothing is really risked when you know you can\u2019t lose. He was a distraction, an excuse, and a friend. No more, no less. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Saturday morning of Blessing Weekend dawns foggy and warmer than usual, and by 10:00 a.m., the sun is shining, the air is clear and it\u2019s a perfect spring day. May is the month of blackflies, but a strong breeze off the water keeps them away, and only the most determined bugs are able to draw blood through their tiny, painful bites. As Christy, Will and I walk down to the green, Violet in the carrier on Will\u2019s back, the smell of outdoor cooking?chowder and bacon, hot dogs and hamburgers and smoke?hits us in a thick, mouthwatering wave.</p><p>This weekend seems like a thank-you to the residents for not moving away to an easier place. Our sense of neighborhood and friendship is strong at the Blessing. People call greetings to each other, shake hands as if it\u2019s been weeks, not hours, since they last met. Couples hold hands, children dance with excitement. When are the lobster boat races? Can we get a balloon? I\u2019m hungry! Everywhere, people smile and laugh. Music drifts in snatches on the breeze.</p><p>I wave to friends, customers, neighbors...there\u2019s virtually no one I don\u2019t know by name. Now and then, I catch a glimpse of Father Tim in his all-black priest clothes, but he is swamped with teary-eyed well-wishers.</p><p>Main Street is closed off to cars, and people stroll the block and a half of the \u201cdowntown,\u201d stopping to sample a cookie from the Girl Scouts, a muffin from the PTA. The chrome on Joe\u2019s Diner glistens from the cleaning I gave it yesterday. Octavio, Georgie and I hung out bunting while Judy smoked and squinted in approval. I feel a little thrill of pride looking at it, even though it\u2019s closed.</p> <p>\u201cOw,\u201d Will says, reaching up to pry his hair from Violet\u2019s dimpled fist. \u201cLet go, sweetie.\u201d He shifts the backpack as Violet knees him in the spine.</p><p>\u201cWant me to take her, Will?\u201d I offer. \u201cYou won\u2019t pull Auntie\u2019s hair, will you, pumpkin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Will asks gratefully.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll take Violet and you two can stroll around alone for a while, what do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say thank you,\u201d Christy says, unsnapping the harness. \u201cYou\u2019re the best, Maggie.\u201d She holds the pack with Violet still in it as Will slides his arms out, then straps it on me.</p> <p>\u201cAgga,\u201d Violet says. \u201cAgga bwee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just said Aunt Maggie, clear as day,\u201d I say. \u201cDid you hear? What an honor.\u201d Violet takes a fistful of my hair and tugs in affirmation, I\u2019m quite sure.</p><p>Will and Christy laugh. \u201cMeet you in an hour?\u201d Will says. \u201cWe\u2019ll buy you lunch at the fire department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great,\u201d I say.</p><p>With Violet on my back, I don\u2019t feel so obviously single. We stroll around, stopping to admire the display of art projects from the first grade students, and I brace for the inevitable assessment that is an integral part of Blessing Weekend.</p><p>\u201cHey, Maggie!\u201d</p> <p>And here we go. It\u2019s an old high school classmate, Carleigh Carleton. She went to college in Vermont, as I recall. She also had a wicked crush on Skip.</p><p>\u201cHey, Carleigh,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, you had a baby?\u201d she shrieks, her eyes popping. She never was that attractive.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, this is my niece, Violet,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. Christy\u2019s baby. That makes more sense!\u201d Carleigh\u2019s smile is full of smugness and condescension. \u201cI have three myself. Are you still working in your grandfather\u2019s diner?\u201d What she means is, Are you still stuck in the same job you\u2019ve had since high school, since Skip dumped you? Haven\u2019t you gotten married yet, Maggie? Don\u2019t you know the statistics for a woman over thirty?</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd what about you, Carleigh?\u201d I pretend to listen as she tells me of her fabulous life, which is probably not nearly so fabulous in reality. But that\u2019s what Blessing Weekend is for, in a sense. Pretense. Leaving Carleigh, who has gained another fifteen or so pounds since last year, I note with deep satisfaction, I wander through the crafts tent on the green.</p><p>There are a few more Carleigh types, mostly women who nod sympathetically when I tell them yes, I\u2019m still at the diner. Poor Maggie, they seem to be saying, I may have married an abusive drunk, had to file a restraining order and gotten divorced before I was twenty-three, but at least I got married!</p><p>I refuse to feel inferior. Screw \u2019em, I think. My life is just fine. I make a difference in this town. Violet knees me in the back, and I continue in a fog, absentmindedly waving here and there. A familiar name jerks me out of my daze.</p> <p>\u201c...and that Malone person won\u2019t admit that it\u2019s his,\u201d the hideous Mrs. Plutarski stage-whispers to one of her wrinkled old cronies, Mrs. Lennon.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Mrs. Lennon asks.</p><p>\u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t want to be saddled with child support,\u201d Mrs. Plutarski says, as if she had actual information on the subject. \u201cWell, that woman had it coming, if you ask me. All those years of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, what are you talking about?\u201d I ask, shoving in between them, a tugboat between two tankers.</p><p>\u201cOh! Maggie. How are you, dear?\u201d Mrs. Lennon asks sweetly. Mrs. P. assumes the lemon-sucking face she does so well.</p><p>\u201cChild support? Admitting that something is his? Tsk, tsk, Mrs. Plutarski. Does Father Tim know you gossip like this?\u201d I fold my arms, my moment of righteous indignation somewhat marred by Violet yanking my hair.</p><p>\u201cThis is a private conversation, Maggie,\u201d Mrs. Plutarski says coldly. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say you should be worried about what people are saying about you instead of butting into other people\u2019s conversations. Everyone knows that you thought Father Tim was going to leave the church for you.\u201d She smirks and cuts her eyes to Mrs. Lennon.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Edith?\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re a nasty, gossiping, eavesdropping busybody, and no amount of ass-kissing of priests is going to change that. Mrs. Lennon, you have a nice weekend.\u201d</p><p>Enjoying Mrs. P\u2019s squawking rage, I walk away. \u201cHow was I?\u201d I ask my niece. She doesn\u2019t answer. Glancing back, I see that she\u2019s fallen asleep. Her angelic face calms my seething anger, but my heart is still pounding, my face hot.</p><p>Poor Malone. He\u2019s done nothing wrong, but the town won\u2019t drop it. All day, I hear snatches of damning conversation?Chantal and Malone are the hot topic. During the trap-hauling race, when everyone crowds the dock to see which boat will make it in fastest, Christy and I stand with the firemen to cheer on Jonah and Dad. \u201cWhy do you think Malone\u2019s not here?\u201d Fred Tendrey asks as he leans against a post. \u201cAshamed to show his face, I\u2019d guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should he be ashamed, Fred?\u201d I ask. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. He\u2019s not the one standing around looking down women\u2019s blouses. Maybe he doesn\u2019t want his daughter to hear a bunch of idiots gossiping about him, huh? Ever think of that?\u201d</p><p>My protestations fall on deaf ears. Malone\u2019s boat is conspicuously absent from the festivities. Or maybe he never comes to the Blessing. I can\u2019t say I ever noticed before.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want Malone involved,\u201d I overhear Leslie MacGuire murmuring to her neighbor as they buy cups of chowder. \u201cYou know the rumors about his first wife. How she left in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right,\u201d the neighbor murmurs. My jaw clenches, but I say nothing. There\u2019s no point.</p><p>By four o\u2019clock, I can\u2019t take any more.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I\u2019m heading out,\u201d I tell my sister and Will. \u201cI\u2019ve got a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Christy asks, tilting her head.</p><p>\u201cYup. Just tired.\u201d</p><p>Though I have a ticket for the spaghetti supper and the rest of my family, including Mom, will be there, I walk away from town. Climbing the hill to my apartment, I glance back at the harbor. The lobster boats are done with racing for the day, bobbing on their moorings like cheerful seagulls, clean and freshly painted for the new season. The Twin Menace gleams, one of the newer boats, made more noticeable because the Ugly Anne is out. My heart squeezes almost painfully, imagining him off with his daughter. In another few weeks, it will be illegal to pull pots after four, but for now Malone is within the rules, if he\u2019s actually working, that is. And it doesn\u2019t seem as if he misses a chance to work very often.</p><p>Except for that one day when he took me to Linden Harbor.</p><p>I trudge down my street, spying Mrs. Kandinsky sleeping in her chair through the window. Peeking inside, I make sure her chest is still rising and falling with breath, then, assured that she\u2019s not dead, I go upstairs to my dark apartment.</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING, the smell of frying bacon and coffee welcomes me to my parents\u2019 house. Each year, we have a special breakfast before the actual Blessing of the Fleet. And we\u2019re all going to church, since it\u2019s Father Tim\u2019s last Mass. Jonah is slumped in a corner, pale and shaky, timidly nursing a cup of coffee. I lean over and kiss him loudly on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cIs my wittle brother a wittle hung over?\u201d I ask merrily, ruffling his hair. He moans and turns to the wall. \u201cHi, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Maggie, is that what you\u2019re wearing?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I look down at my outfit. Tan pants, red sweater, shoes that match each other. I raise an eyebrow at my mother, who sets the spatula down on the counter. \u201cWhat I meant to say, honey, is why don\u2019t you wear a skirt once in a while? You have such gorgeous legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was better, Mom. Better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing gorgeous about Maggie,\u201d Jonah mumbles from the corner, apparently not in enough misery to resist bothering me. \u201cChristy\u2019s the pretty one.\u201d I smack him on the head, savoring his yelp of pain, and pour myself some coffee.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wear a skirt today, Mom,\u201d I say, giving my mother a kiss, pleased to see her back in the family domicile. \u201cI\u2019m going out with Jonah for the blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you don\u2019t stop yelling,\u201d Jonah mutters.</p><p>It\u2019s wicked fun to be on the water for the Blessing of the Fleet. Gideon\u2019s Cove looks like a postcard?the rocky shore, tall pines, the houses that dot the hills, the spire of St. Mary\u2019s, the gray wood of the dock. Last year, the whole family went on the Twin Menace; this year, because of Violet, Christy and Will opted to stay ashore, and our parents will keep them company.</p><p>Christy\u2019s face appears on the back porch. \u201cHello,\u201d she calls. She has also worn tan pants and a red top, but her outfit cost more, is made with better materials and generally looks better than mine. She hefts in Violet\u2019s car seat, a diaper bag that\u2019s bigger than my suitcase and a vibrating bouncy seat. Will follows her with a tiny bungy-jumping contraption that\u2019s made to dangle from a doorway and another bag.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIn the bomb shelter,\u201d Jonah answers. \u201cCould you stop yelling, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d I yell cheerfully. \u201cWe\u2019re all here!\u201d Jonah whimpers.</p><p>\u201cServes you right, Joe,\u201d Christy says. \u201cJell-O shots. For God\u2019s sake. We were at Dewey\u2019s last night, you know. Saw everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I call you the pretty one?\u201d Jonah says, rising specterlike from his chair. \u201cI changed my mind. You\u2019re both hags.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, we\u2019re all sitting around the dining room table, passing platters of pancakes, scrambled eggs, cranberry scones (my contribution) and bacon. Jonah has swallowed some Advil and looks less green, though he shudders as the eggs pass him. I plop a spoonful on his plate and enjoy the blanching that follows.</p><p>\u201cSo, Mom, Dad,\u201d Christy begins in what Joe and I call her social-worker voice, \u201chow have things been since you\u2019ve...been apart?\u201d Her voice is carefully pleasant.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Dad says. \u201cDelicious scones, Maggie. You sure can bake, honey.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Christy\u2019s eyes close briefly. \u201cGreat. Any decisions about what\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScone, sweetie?\u201d Will asks.</p><p>\u201cNo. Thank you. Mom? Anything to tell us?\u201d</p><p>My mother takes a deep breath. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve been talking, of course.\u201d She looks at Dad at the other end of the table. Dad is looking out the window, apparently fascinated with the flock of springtime birds enjoying his handiwork. \u201cMitch? Would you like to tell the children what we\u2019re planning?\u201d</p> <p>Dad snaps to attention. \u201cOh. Sure. Sure. Okay. Well, we...we\u2019re...we\u2019re not getting divorced. For now.\u201d</p><p>Christy\u2019s face lights up. I take another piece of bacon and look at my mother. \u201cBut...\u201d I prompt.</p><p>\u201cRight, Maggie,\u201d Mom says. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to stay in Bar Harbor. At least for the foreseeable future.\u201d She looks at me for assurance, and I smile. Christy\u2019s face falls.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey,\u201d Mom says to her. \u201cI know it\u2019s not what you want, but?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s okay.\u201d But Christy\u2019s eyes are spilling tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry....\u201d She starts crying in earnest, and Will puts his arm around her, pulling her face against his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s what you want that matters, Mom,\u201d she blubbers. \u201cAnd you, too, Daddy.\u201d</p> <p>Jonah shoots me a classic little brother smirk, and suddenly, we\u2019re laughing. \u201cPoor little Christy, coming from a broken home,\u201d Jonah murmurs, and she starts laughing, too.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up, Jonah,\u201d she says, wadding up her napkin and throwing it at him. \u201cI can\u2019t help it if I care about our family. Unlike you, you freakish troglodyte.\u201d</p><p>En masse, we head for town, Jonah and me in his truck, our parents with Will, Christy and the baby in the Volvo wagon.</p><p>The waxy smell of candles mixes with the lingering scent of spaghetti as we walk into church. Since Father Tim won\u2019t be returning to St. Mary\u2019s after this, the place is as packed as if it\u2019s Christmas Eve. The full choir, all ten of them, is up in the loft, and Mr. Gordon is thumping out a tortuous, wheezing piece on the old organ. My family takes up a whole pew today. We call out quiet hellos, wave to our friends and neighbors and sit on the punishing walnut pews, prepared to offer up our suffering to the Lord.</p><p>The altar servers come somberly down the aisle, washed and brushed and looking like angels despite the hightop Keds that peek out from under their robes. Tanner Stevenson holds up the crucifix and Kendra Tan carefully swings the incense burner. Father Tim comes in last, resplendent in purple and gold, handsome as a movie star. He sings along with the entrance hymn, but his eyes meet mine, and he gives a little smile around the words to \u201cLift High the Cross.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in a very long time, I understand why people come to church. Not because they\u2019re forced to be here by their parents, not because the priest is so cute. I listen to the words and don\u2019t notice the brogue that pronounces them. For the first time in my adult life, I imagine that there might be something here for me. Sorry I haven\u2019t been around. And sorry about lusting after one of Your guys, I say silently to God. No harm, no foul, I imagine Him saying. It\u2019s much more comforting than That will be a year in hell, young lady.</p> <p>At the sign of peace, Father Tim comes off the altar, moving slowly, a kind word for everyone, a blessing for the children. When he gets to the Beaumont clan, he leans in for a chaste hug. \u201cI finally got you in church, Maggie,\u201d he says, and I\u2019m touched to see tears in his eyes. \u201cRight when I\u2019m leaving, but here you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll miss you, Father Tim,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>An hour later, Jonah and I are on the Twin Menace, the brisk breeze ruffling our hair. In honor of my presence, Jonah has placed a plastic chair on deck, where I now sit, sipping a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Dad working out?\u201d I ask my brother as he stands at the wheel.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Joe answers. \u201cHe likes it. Loves hanging out with the guys. Better than building birdhouses, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s nice that you took him on,\u201d I say. Jonah looks older at the wheel. This is a side of him that I don\u2019t usually get to see. He looks manly, in control. Handsome, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smirking about?\u201d he asks, raising his voice to be heard over the diesel engine.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing. Just thinking how cute you are, Bunny-boy,\u201d I answer, using the nickname Christy and I unfortunately bestowed on him at his birth.</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says. He waves to Sam O\u2019Neil, who is in front of the Twin Menace in the parade of boats.</p><p>\u201cBest date you could get was your sistah?\u201d Sam yells.</p><p>\u201cAt least my sister\u2019s pretty!\u201d Jonah calls back. His smile is forced and drops off the minute Sam turns away.</p><p>The boats space out a bit more as we head for Douglas Point. The memorial is visible even from a distance, starkly beautiful against the backdrop of pines and stone. The mood becomes somber throughout our flotilla; no one cracks any jokes now. Jonah bows his head as we motor past. His eyes are wet when he looks up.</p><p>\u201cJonah?\u201d I ask. \u201cIs everything okay, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d he says, wiping his eyes on his sleeve. He adjusts course a bit, then shoots me a glance. \u201cNot really,\u201d he admits.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, hon?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sort of glum lately.\u201d</p><p>His face crumples. \u201cOh, f**k it, Mags. I\u2019m in love with Chantal and she won\u2019t give me the time of day.\u201d</p><p>My eyes pop. \u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. She\u2019s pregnant with some guy\u2019s kid and...and...\u201d It takes him a minute to get the words out. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I thought...I\u2019ve always had a thing for her, Maggie. And now I think I\u2019m in love with her.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. Oh, boy. Oh, shit on a shingle. \u201cJonah,\u201d I say carefully, \u201cyou didn\u2019t sleep with Chantal, did you?\u201d</p><p>He swallows, looks at the deck of the boat, then nods. \u201cI know you told her not to hook up with me, Mags. It was just one time. And afterward, she wouldn\u2019t return my calls or anything. I wanted to start seeing her, make it more than a one-nighter, you know? But she wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gotta be kidding me,\u201d I mutter, looking skyward.</p><p>It has to be. No wonder she wouldn\u2019t tell me. After all those threats, she actually went ahead and did it. With my brother. My baby brother. Whose diapers I changed.</p><p>The wind blows my hair across my face and makes whitecaps on the water. We\u2019re close enough to the town dock that I can see the crowds, catch slips of sound. There\u2019s the podium. There\u2019s our bear-shaped dad. Father Tim, still in his vestments, flicks holy water and makes the sign of the cross. Reverend Hollis from the Congregational church stands next to him, doing whatever Protestants do at these things.</p><p>I heave a sigh, then get up and go to stand next to my brother and rub his back. He chokes out a small sob. \u201cListen, sweetie,\u201d I say. \u201cDid you ever ask Chantal if you were the father of her baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course I did,\u201d he says, wiping his eyes on his sleeve. \u201cShe said I wasn\u2019t. Said she was sure about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s lying.\u201d</p><p>Jonah\u2019s head snaps back. \u201cWhat? Why? Do you know something?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cNo. She said it was an out-of-towner, but...well, she just might be trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would she do that? Doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, honey, you\u2019re twenty-six years old. And she\u2019s what, thirty-nine? She said a few things....\u201d My voice trails off. \u201cI bet it\u2019s you, Jonah. I think you need to ask her again.\u201d</p><p>My brother\u2019s face lights up in a sudden burst of joy. \u201cOh, my God, Maggot! Holy shit!\u201d He claps his hands against his head. \u201cHoly shit! Hold the wheel, will you, Mags?\u201d He shoves me against the wheel, then goes aft.</p><p>\u201cJonah! Joe! Come on, you know I\u2019m stupid around boats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChantal! Chantal!\u201d Jonah bellows, cupping his hands around his mouth. In front of us, Sam\u2019s head jerks around.</p><p>\u201cJonah!\u201d I bark. \u201cThe boat! I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here! We\u2019re gonna hit Sam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cChantal!\u201d Jonah yells again, his voice breaking. Heads start turning on the dock. \u201cChantal!\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, we can make her out, her red hair as noticeable as a lighthouse beacon.</p><p>\u201cJonah,\u201d I warn, trying to figure out which lever will slow us down, \u201cthis is not the time?\u201d</p><p>He ignores me. \u201cThe baby\u2019s mine, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he bellows.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Jonah!\u201d I yelp. \u201cMom\u2019s gonna kill you!\u201d</p><p>People are pointing and talking, then shushing each other. \u201cI love you, Chantal!\u201d my idiot brother shouts. We\u2019re about thirty yards from the dock now, close enough that people definitely hear him. The crowd turns to look at Chantal, who is frozen like a moose about to be hit by a pickup truck.</p><p>\u201cChantal! The baby\u2019s mine, isn\u2019t it? I love you, I want to marry you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Jonah!\u201d Chantal yells back.</p><p>Oh, to see my mother\u2019s face at this moment! I can\u2019t help it. I start laughing. I hear a splash, and sure enough, my brother has jumped overboard and is swimming to the dock. If the water is fifty degrees, I\u2019d be surprised.</p><p>\u201cJonah! You f**kin\u2019 idiot!\u201d yells Sam.</p><p>\u201cSam, I think I\u2019m gonna hit you!\u201d I call out.</p><p>\u201cSteer out to sea, dumb-ass!\u201d he barks.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay! No need for names.\u201d I obey, turning the wheel east. The Twin Menace cruises away from the parade. I decide to just turn the damn engine off and bob there. Safer than anything else I can think of. Besides, now I can watch.</p><p>The blessing has been put on hold as Jonah, always a good swimmer, works his way toward his lady love. He makes it to the dock and someone, Rolly, it looks like, pulls him up. I can\u2019t hear him, but I can see my brother clear as day. He pushes his way to Chantal, streaming water, and makes his case, his hands flying. I see her shaking her head, then putting her hand over her mouth. Jonah takes her in his arms and kisses her while my parents look on in stunned horror, and in spite of my reservations about Chantal, I find that my eyes are a bit wet.</p><p>Billy Bottoms pulls out of the parade and comes alongside the Twin Menace and jumps aboard as neatly as a mountain goat. His son, Young Billy, waves to me from the wheel of their boat.</p><p>\u201cHey theah, deah,\u201d Billy says. \u201cLooks like your brothah\u2019s gonna be a fathah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like it,\u201d I agree, happily surrendering the controls to someone who won\u2019t get us killed.</p><p>The blessing resumes, albeit completely overshadowed by Jonah\u2019s proclamations, and Billy steers us past the dock, where Father Tim and Reverend Hollis dutifully bless us.</p><p>\u201cWould you let me off here, Billy?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cSure enough, deah.\u201d Billy maneuvers the boat alongside the dock and I jump out. Christy is waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cHoly. Mother. Of God!\u201d she proclaims.</p><p>\u201cAyuh,\u201d I agree.</p><p>\u201cDid you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until about five minutes ago,\u201d I say. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>Christy leads me up the ramp and through the crowd. My brother, a blanket draped around his shoulders, is drinking a cup of coffee, gripping Chantal\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHey, sis,\u201d Jonah says.</p><p>\u201cChantal,\u201d I grind out, \u201cdidn\u2019t I tell you Jonah was off limits?\u201d</p><p>She grimaces. \u201cSorry, Maggie.\u201d She looks at the ground. \u201cThe damage is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s his?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She looks nervous, but her hand is in my brother\u2019s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take a big breath, then another, then take the coffee from my brother and have a long sip. \u201cWell!

For figuring it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, dummy.\u201d I give him a hug, too.

He was sleeping with me. So there.\u201d</p><p>Oops.</p><p>A speculative murmur goes up from the crowd. My mother frowns, my dad goes white, Christy grimaces, Jonah laughs.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p> <p>WE SPEND the rest of the day as the chief entertainment. Ah, the Beaumonts, always good for some laughs. Jonah is beaming with pride. Chantal does a fair amount of eye rolling, but the pall that\u2019s been hanging over her is gone. She seems happy. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll stay with Jonah, but hey. Anything is possible.</p><p>\u201cAnother grandchild, Mom,\u201d I comment as the two of us sit at a picnic table.</p><p>Mom swats her arm; the blackflies are making themselves known. \u201cYes,\u201d she sighs. \u201cAnd won\u2019t that be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you upset?\u201d I ask tentatively. \u201cI know Jonah\u2019s your favorite....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Maggie, don\u2019t be silly. Mothers don\u2019t have favorites. Someday you\u2019ll know that for yourself.\u201d She pats my arm. \u201cI\u2019m not upset. It\u2019s Jonah\u2019s life. I hope things work out for him, but it\u2019s really not my problem, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve reached a stage of life, Maggie, where I finally realized that your kids are going to do what they want. My job is done. You don\u2019t need me hovering, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess not, Mom. Not hovering. But still, we want you involved.\u201d</p> <p>My mom smiles, then glances at her watch. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got to get going,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a long drive.\u201d She kisses my cheek, and I stand to hug her. \u201cSee you next week, all right, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve decided to have lunch twice a month, just the two of us. \u201cYou bet, Mom. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Maybe you can get something done about those roots when you come.\u201d</p><p>Oddly reassured that she\u2019s still my insulting mother, I wave as she walks off.</p><p>Blessing Weekend is over. Families drift to their cars. Tables are folded, grills extinguished. Noah Grimsley is taking apart the podium. One of Octavio\u2019s kids runs past me, calling out a greeting, and then flits away, quick as a hummingbird.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to say goodbye, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather Tim,\u201d I say. A lump rises in my throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Do you have a replacement yet? For St. Mary\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather Daniels will be filling in until they find someone more permanent,\u201d he answers.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Father Daniels, now retired, is the priest who gave Christy and me our first communions.</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself, Maggie,\u201d he says, smiling though his eyes are bright with tears. \u201cIf you ever need anything...spiritual, that is...\u201d</p><p>I laugh and pat his shoulder. \u201cTake care, Father Tim.\u201d</p><p>WITH FATHER TIM GONE, the festivities over and everything cleaned up, I go to Joe\u2019s and make myself a cup of coffee. Sitting at the corner booth, I look out at the quiet street.</p><p>Father Tim\u2019s era is over, in my town and in my life; the new phase is waiting to begin. And suddenly I feel the overwhelming urge to see Malone. Before I know it, I\u2019m walking, practically running to the dock. The tide is out and the ramp to the water is steep, but the lobster gods have heard me, because the Ugly Anne is pulled right up, not out, not at its mooring, but right there at the end of the dock, as if the fates want me to see Malone. As if it\u2019s meant to be. My feet pound against the weathered boards.</p><p>\u201cMalone?\u201d I call out, skidding to a stop. His boat is tied stern to dock, the bow furthest from me. A head pops out of the wheelhouse. Not Malone\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she calls. The new sternman. His daughter.</p><p>Her resemblance to Malone is unmistakable?sharp cheekbones, thickly-lashed blue eyes, long and lanky. She\u2019s a beautiful, beautiful young woman. How old did Malone say she was? Seventeen?</p><p>Whatever force has propeled me this far suddenly falters. Maloner the Loner is lonely no more. Maybe he never was. After all, he\u2019s had a marriage, has a child, this lovely creature who\u2019s spending the summer with him. He already has his little family. He doesn\u2019t need me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Emory,\u201d she says, picking her way gracefully around the coils of rope that litter the deck. She\u2019s wearing cutoff jeans and a tank top and yet she looks like she stepped out of a photo shoot. The lobstermen must be smitten.</p><p>I swallow. \u201cUm...hi. Yeah. I\u2019m Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking for my dad?\u201d she asks pleasantly. I don\u2019t answer. What am I doing here? I ask myself. If Malone wanted anything from me, he\u2019s had weeks to find me.</p><p>Emory raises her eyebrows. \u201cDid you want to see Malone?\u201d she repeats, and I feel even more like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. Actually, it\u2019s no big...deal. I\u2019ll come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalone!\u201d she calls. \u201cSomeone to see you, cap!\u201d</p><p>Malone emerges from the storage area in the bow, wiping his hands on a grease-stained towel. \u201cAye-aye, skipper,\u201d he says, grinning. He snaps the towel at her as he walks past, and she giggles and leaps away.</p><p>God, he seems so happy. Malone of the scowls and lines has what he needs to be happy, and it ain\u2019t me. I briefly consider jumping into the water to escape. Worked for Jonah.</p><p>Malone catches sight of me, and the smile on his face falls like a stone. \u201cMaggie.\u201d</p><p>I take a big breath and release it. \u201cYup. Hi.\u201d</p><p>He jumps off the stern onto the dock and puts his hands on his hips, and even though his daughter is watching, I can\u2019t help feeling the effect he has on me. My chest feels tight, my eyes hot and dry.</p><p>\u201cYou met Emory?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Yup. Sure did. She\u2019s...she\u2019s...beautiful.\u201d</p><p>His face softens into a smile as he glances back at the subject of our conversation. I swallow against the lump in my throat. \u201cYeah,\u201d Malone agrees. \u201cSo. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...it\u2019s?well...\u201d Any plans I had have evaporated. To hide the fact that my hands are shaking, I stuff them in my pockets. \u201cUm, well, guess what? It turns out that Jonah...you know, my brother, well, he\u2019s the father of Chantal\u2019s baby. And he just figured it out, and they\u2019re together, I guess. Sort of. So no one thinks it\u2019s you anymore.\u201d</p><p>His bottom lip is so full and soft-looking among the black razor stubble. Those irritating lashes drop for a moment as Malone looks at the dock.</p><p>\u201cYou knew, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I ask. \u201cAbout Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve told me, Malone.\u201d My voice sounds soft and trembly.</p><p>He sighs. \u201cChantal didn\u2019t want me to. I thought you should know, but...well. Not my call.\u201d He frowns and looks back at his boat. He starts to say something, then apparently changes his mind.</p><p>I give in to my urge to flee. \u201cYou know what, Malone? I have to run. But you know, nice seeing you and all. Have a good night.\u201d I wave to Emory, who looks as graceful as a swan even as she stuffs a bait bag. \u201cBye. Nice meeting you.\u201d She smiles back, very sweetly, and tears burn in my eyes.</p><p>Turning to leave, I actually take a few steps before stopping. I came for a reason, after all. \u201cListen, Malone,\u201d I say, turning around. \u201cUm, I just want you to know that...Listen. I accidentally helped spread that rumor about you and Chantal. I\u2019m sorry for that, and I\u2019m sorry I never gave you the benefit of the doubt. You deserved better.\u201d</p><p>I force myself not to look away. His face is unsmiling, not exactly scowling, but not happy, either, God knows. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about what you said, too,\u201d I continue, my voice unsteady. \u201cAbout Father Tim and me, and you and me, and me killing time with you...\u201d I\u2019m babbling again. \u201cWell, whatever. I guess I also wanted to say that...\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cMalone, I never meant to make you feel...inferior. I think you\u2019re...well. Not inferior at all.\u201d I swallow. \u201cPretty superior, actually.\u201d</p><p>If he were to give me anything at that moment, I\u2019d say more. If he smiled, if he took a step toward me, if he said something. But he doesn\u2019t, just looks at me. Finally, he gives a slight nod. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>And that\u2019s it. I wait another second, then nod and, painfully aware of my every move, walk back down the dock.</p><p>Malone doesn\u2019t stop me. He doesn\u2019t forgive me, and he lets me go.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d I hear Emory ask, but though I hear the rumble of his voice, I can\u2019t make out the words. I run up the gangplank because I don\u2019t want them to know that I\u2019m crying.</p><p>OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS, I feel a bit hollow. After all, I\u2019ve lost four people in my daily life?Father Tim, my mom, Colonel and Malone. They were a big part of things, even if only for a while. Obviously, my mother falls into a different category, as She Who Gave Me Life, and though we\u2019re starting a better phase of our relationship, it\u2019s strange to have her gone.</p><p>Thank you for everything, God, I say morosely as I clean Mrs. K.\u2019s apartment. I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have cancer, I haven\u2019t amputated a limb, I\u2019m not blind. I\u2019m not an orphan, I have friends, health, home, all that crap. Then I immediately chastise myself and apologize for calling it crap...but God knows what I mean. I\u2019m not exactly a mystery wrapped in an enigma.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to take a cooking class,\u201d I tell Mrs. K. when I\u2019ve turned off the Electrolux.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already a magnificent cook! Pooh!\u201d she cries staunchly, thumping her cane for emphasis.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, thanks, Mrs. K. But I might like to learn a bit more, you know? New sauces, new techniques, stuff like that. I\u2019m trying to jazz up the menu at Joe\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a master class being offered in Machias, twice a week for twelve weeks. I\u2019ve already signed up. French Cooking with a Twist. It sounded fun.</p><p>\u201cWell, as long as you don\u2019t change your lemon cake,\u201d Mrs. K. says. \u201cDon\u2019t tamper with perfection, Maggie!\u201d</p><p>Maybe at the class, I\u2019ll meet some new people. It would be nice to have someone else to pal around with. It\u2019s starting to dawn on me that getting out of Gideon\u2019s Cove once in a while isn\u2019t a bad idea. Chantal and I are still a little tentative with each other, but our friendship will survive her shtupping Jonah. After all, he may be my little brother, but he is also a grown-up. Theoretically, anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Christy calls me later in the week. \u201cListen, I know the last time was a disaster,\u201d she says, failing to excite me about what comes next, \u201cbut Will knows this nice guy, a drug rep who came into the office last week. Can we give him your number?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. I\u2019m stretched out sideways on my bed, a pillow clutched to my side. It\u2019s no substitute for Colonel. I need to get another dog. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Christy,\u201d I say. \u201cNot for a while. But I\u2019ll let you know, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Malone?\u201d she asks. I had told her about my visit to the dock.</p><p>\u201cOh, Christy,\u201d I confess. \u201cIt was one of those things...I didn\u2019t realize how much he meant to me until it was too late. Dumb, huh? Stupid Maggie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dumb,\u201d she chides. \u201cIt was a good learning experience. Think of it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d I say with false bravado. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Christy launches into a description of her fatigue and vomiting, then describes Violet\u2019s newest incisor in thrilling detail. I smile. \u201cYou still going out tomorrow?\u201d I ask. \u201cIt\u2019s my day to babysit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want to,\u201d Christy says.</p><p>\u201cI certainly do.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>ON SUNDAY, I find myself back at St. Mary\u2019s. Christy, Will and Violet sit in the cry room, as Violet has discovered the church\u2019s impressive echo and enjoys piercing eardrums during Mass. Father Daniels is on the altar, his roly-poly figure barely contained in the vestments that once swirled gracefully around Father Tim. No danger in falling for Father Daniels, whose resemblance to Jabba the Hutt has been commented on many times.</p><p>My mind wanders as I sit there, a feeling of gentle peace engulfing me. The stained-glass windows, the flickering candles, the rock-hard pews and cracked kneelers seem familiar and dear to me. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m here. This is my church, I think. Father Tim was just a temp here, but the church belongs to me. Or it could, if I showed up once in a while.</p><p>Dear God, I pray as Father Daniels lifts the host high, please look after my family. And Octavio and his gang and Georgie and Judy and Chantal and all the rest. And thanks for everything. And this time, I\u2019m sincere.</p><p>Mrs. Plutarski gives me the evil eye during the recession, but I don\u2019t care. I smile at my neighbors and wait for Christy and Will to fight their way out of the cry room.</p><p>\u201cNice Mass, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cWas it?\u201d Christy returns. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear a word. The Robinson twins were screaming the whole time.\u201d</p><p>We go outside and I stop dead in my tracks, causing Ruth Donahue to crash into me. \u201cSorry,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>Malone is leaning against the back of a bench, watching the door. Waiting, it seems, for me.</p><p>\u201cOoh, it\u2019s Malone,\u201d Christy murmurs. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here? Hi, Malone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Christy,\u201d he says. Then his eyes shift to me. \u201cMaggie.\u201d</p><p>Adrenaline pricks at my joints, making my hands tingle almost painfully. \u201cHi, Malone,\u201d I say, and my voice squeaks. I clear my throat. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>His hands are cupped over his coat in a rather strange way, I notice, and the lines around his eyes crinkle as I come closer. Hope aches suddenly and sharply in my heart, and I swallow. He looks happy?for Malone, that is. Happy to see me.</p><p>Just then, Emory pops over to his side. \u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d she announces in that perfectly confident way beautiful girls have. \u201cMalone, can we get some breakfast? There\u2019s a cute little diner down the block.\u201d Her eyes light upon me. \u201cOh, hi. Maggie, right?\u201d She tucks her arm through Malone\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cRight. Hello,\u201d I say. I feel the blush creep up my neck, feeling very much like an outsider.</p><p>\u201cDad? What do you say? Breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Emory. Give me a second, okay?\u201d Malone says.</p><p>An awkward silence falls over our little group. My heart is thudding. A crow calls in a nearby tree. Will clears his throat. \u201cHey, Maggie, we\u2019ll see you later,\u201d he says, towing my sister away.</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d Christy says joyfully. \u201cSee you later.\u201d Her eyes are dancing.</p><p>Malone gives his daughter a pointed look. \u201cEm, go find something to do for five minutes,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cSure, Malone,\u201d she says, trotting up the stairs of St. Mary\u2019s. We both watch her go, then, because there\u2019s no one left to look at, turn to face each other. My face prickles with heat. Malone swallows. It seems neither of us knows what to say.</p><p>Then, with one hand still cupping his stomach, Malone reaches into his coat and pulls out a very small puppy.</p><p>\u201cFor you,\u201d he says, handing the warm little bundle of fur to me. \u201cIt\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s sound asleep, cuddled against my chest before I\u2019m fully aware that I have her. Pale blond fur, silky ears, black nose. I can feel her little spine through her fur...clearly she needs a good meal. \u201cOh, Malone,\u201d I whisper, my eyes filling.</p><p>\u201cTen weeks old. Half yellow Lab. She\u2019s had her first shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful. Aren\u2019t you, honey? Malone, thank you.\u201d I stroke her tiny little head and give Malone a watery smile.</p><p>He\u2019s not smiling back. He\u2019s practically glaring. My smile falters.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Matthew,\u201d he growls.</p><p>I blink. \u201cI thought you said she was a girl.\u201d He doesn\u2019t answer. \u201cYou want me to name the dog Matthew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Maggie,\u201d he says, looking away. \u201cThat\u2019s my name.\u201d</p><p>The dog shifts in my hands and groans, a tiny, funny sound. She wakes enough to chew on my thumb with her needle-sharp teeth, but I barely notice.</p><p>\u201cIt was my father\u2019s name, too,\u201d Malone says, still looking down the block. \u201cMy mom called me Little Malone when I was a kid, and then eventually she dropped the \u2018little.\u2019 Since my father knocked us around, I didn\u2019t really feel like using his first name anyway, so I just go by Malone.\u201d</p><p>His longest speech to me by far. Ever, maybe. \u201cOh,\u201d I manage.</p><p>His eyes snap back to me. \u201cMaggie,\u201d he says, stepping closer. He takes a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about what you said, too, about me and how I don\u2019t let people in. Talk. Whatever.\u201d He rolls his eyes, then swallows. \u201cI\u2019m not really the type, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders drop a little. \u201cWell, I guess not every?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m willing to try.\u201d</p><p>My mouth pops open.</p><p>\u201cSeems like I have a thing for you, Maggie,\u201d he says quietly, meeting my eyes with some difficulty.</p><p>My eyes are suddenly full of tears. \u201cWell, that\u2019s great, Malone,\u201d I whisper, \u201cbecause I know I have a thing for you.\u201d</p><p>Those slashing lines soften as he smiles. \u201cThen why are you crying?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cOh, these are the good tears. Happy, lovey-dovey tears. You know. The kind when things go great and you didn\u2019t expect?\u201d</p><p>Mercifully, Malone cuts off my words as he kisses me, right there in front of the church, on Main Street, clear as day for anyone to see, an intent, hard kiss that nearly makes me drop the puppy.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean you guys are ready? I\u2019m gonna faint soon.\u201d Emory is smiling at us from the door of St. Mary\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Malone calls. He puts his arm around my shoulders. \u201cI hear Joe\u2019s has the best breakfast in Washington County,\u201d he says to me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I answer. My words are so ordinary, but happiness is rolling through me in big, warm waves. \u201cThe desserts are excellent, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I think you still owe me a piece of pie.\u201d</p><p>He smiles and my heart swells. We walk down the street, the three of us?four, if you count my new puppy?and open the door to Joe\u2019s Diner.</p>  </body></html>"]
