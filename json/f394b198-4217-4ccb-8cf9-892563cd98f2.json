He insisted she give school a try. He was positive she would like it. As it turned out, he was right. On her first day in kindergarten at the exclusive Briarwood School she made two new friends, Sophie Rose and Regan Madison.</p><p>Cordie saw Sophie that first morning crossing the parking lot and was sure the girl had just stepped out of a fairy tale. Her long white-blond hair bounced as she walked, and she had a twinkle in her eyes. Regan arrived shortly after. She was very pretty, too, with thick brown hair and freckles on her nose that Cordie wished she had. It didn\u2019t take long for the girls to form a bond. All it took was one incident on the playground. A second-grade bully tried to take Cordie\u2019s hair barrettes from her, and Regan and Sophie immediately came to her defense. Sophie was outraged on Cordie\u2019s behalf, but it was Regan who proved to be the brave one. She stood up to the bully and wouldn\u2019t back down. From that moment on the girls became inseparable. Where one went the others followed.</p> <p>Cordie\u2019s new friends came from homes that were very different from hers. Regan and Sophie were driven to school by chauffeurs in limos and town cars. Cordie\u2019s father drove her to school in his old, reliable pickup truck. Regan and Sophie had attended prestigious preschools for two years before starting at Briarwood. Cordie hadn\u2019t gone to preschool, yet when she started kindergarten, she already knew how to read. Her father had taught her, sitting down with her every night after dinner and her bath.</p><p>Reading wasn\u2019t the only thing her father taught her. While other children worked on arts and crafts and played games like hide-and-seek, Cordie spent her days with her father in his automotive shop learning all about cars. He loved working on what he called clunkers, and because she wanted to please him, she paid attention to what he was doing and managed to get grease on her clothes almost daily. Every night before they went home they played a game. He would lift the hood of a car, then pick her up in his arms and point to something in or around the engine. It was her task to tell him what the part was called and what its job was. As she got older, she got better and quicker. Her favorite thing was to ride along with her father in his tow truck and help stranded people. Sometimes it took only a few minutes to get the engine going; other times he had to tow the car back to his shop. The easiest to fix were dead batteries and worn spark plugs. She knew what both of those were because her father had told her. Like other children, she had coloring books and crayons, but she never used them. She preferred following her father around and being his helper.</p><p>Because she didn\u2019t have playmates, she was fearful of what school would be like. But once she met Sophie and Regan, all her fears slipped away.</p><p>Cordie shared a special connection with Sophie. Both of their mothers had died before the girls were old enough to remember them. Regan was the lucky one. She had a mother, and Cordie and Sophie would have envied their friend except for the fact that her mother was never around. She was always traveling and, even when she was in town, seldom spent time at home. If it weren\u2019t for Regan\u2019s three brothers, she wouldn\u2019t have known any family at all. She might have been the only one of them fortunate enough to have siblings, but that didn\u2019t matter to Cordie and Sophie. When they were together, they were sisters.</p><p>Since Sophie was the oldest by almost a year, she felt she should be able to boss the other two around, and for a while they let her. Then, as time passed, the girls became competitive with one another in almost everything . . . except soccer. They all joined a team, but Sophie didn\u2019t like sweating or getting dirty, so she usually walked down the field or just stood where she was and waited for the ball to come back her way. Regan, the shortest member of the team, was a powerhouse. But then, so was Cordie. The two of them usually scored at least one goal each. They were girly girls who loved ribbons in their hair and ruffles on their skirts, but on the field they were aggressive and out to win.</p> <p>It was at the end of one of their soccer practices that Cordie met him.</p><p>Evan, Regan\u2019s driver, had been sent to the airport to fetch a friend of her mother\u2019s, so Aiden, Regan\u2019s oldest brother, got stuck with soccer carpool. Spencer, the middle brother, decided to ride along with him.</p><p>The practice field was out in the middle of nowhere. Aiden took a wrong turn, had to backtrack, and was fifteen minutes late getting to the field. The soccer coach always waited until all the girls had been picked up before leaving, and he was about to put Regan and Sophie and Cordie in his van and take them home when Aiden finally showed up. The SUV he was driving was making a loud noise.</p><p>The girls stood together with their backpacks at their feet, squinting against the setting sun at the two figures in the noisy vehicle.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an old car,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cReally old.\u201d</p><p>Cordie nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a clunker,\u201d she announced with authority.</p> <p>The car came to a chugging stop, and the two teens got out and started across the field.</p><p>\u201cWho are those boys?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cMy brothers,\u201d Regan said. \u201cThe big one is Aiden. He\u2019s sixteen. Spencer is only fourteen,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t know where Walker is. Maybe he stayed home.\u201d</p><p>Aiden whistled and motioned to Regan. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cHe sounds mad,\u201d Sophie whispered.</p><p>Regan shook her head. She lifted her backpack over her shoulder as she said, \u201cHe isn\u2019t mad. He\u2019s just always in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>Aiden whistled again. Regan picked up the pace and shouted, \u201cStop whistling. We aren\u2019t dogs, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>Her brother obviously thought her comment hilarious and had a good laugh. She handed him her backpack and, following her lead, Sophie and Cordie handed him theirs as well. As they proceeded toward the SUV, Regan introduced her friends. Sophie looked back at the two boys, smiled, and said hello, but when Cordie turned around, she could only stare. Her attention was locked on Aiden. She thought he was the most perfect boy she had ever seen. He looked just like the prince in her favorite story, \u201cSnow White.\u201d His hair was almost as dark and his face was just as handsome. He was big, too, bigger than her father. Maybe he really was a prince, she thought.</p> <p>\u201cHow was soccer?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Regan answered.</p><p>\u201cIt must have been,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cYou\u2019re covered in dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordie\u2019s got dirt on her, too,\u201d Regan pointed out. \u201cBut Sophie doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Spencer turned to the little blond girl. \u201cDidn\u2019t you get to practice today?\u201d he asked, taking in her pristine appearance. She was spotless, and her soccer shoes looked brand-new, as though she\u2019d just taken them out of the box.</p><p>\u201cI practiced,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cBut your\u2014\u201d</p><p>Regan explained. \u201cSophie doesn\u2019t like to get dirty.\u201d</p><p>Spencer glanced at Aiden before asking Sophie, \u201cThen why do you play soccer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like soccer,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Regan nodded. \u201cShe does.\u201d</p><p>Aiden laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re being logical, Spencer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d his brother asked.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>They reached the faded blue SUV. Aiden tossed the girls\u2019 backpacks in the back while Spencer opened the door for them to get inside. \u201cPut your seat belts on,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you driving this car?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>\u201cI borrowed it,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cIt\u2019s a loaner while my car is being serviced. It\u2019s all they had.\u201d</p><p>He got behind the wheel, put the key in the ignition, and turned it. The engine sputtered, then died. He tried again. The same thing happened. Then again and again while he pumped the gas pedal.</p><p>He felt a hand on his shoulder. When he turned, he saw that Cordie had unhooked her seat belt and was sitting on the edge of the seat watching him. Before he could tell her to put her seat belt back on, she said, \u201cYou should stop doing that. You\u2019re probably flooding it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>\u201cThe engine.\u201d Didn\u2019t he know anything? she wondered. \u201cHe\u2019s flooding the engine,\u201d she explained slowly so he would understand.</p><p>She remembered what her father often said. If he had a dollar for every call he got about a car that wouldn\u2019t start because the driver had flooded the engine, why, he\u2019d have a whole lot of dollars.</p><p>Aiden was so surprised by the quiet authority in her voice that it took him a few seconds to react.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not flooding it,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked him in the eyes and replied, \u201cYes, you are. If you keep doing that, you\u2019ll have to wait a long time before you can try again, and you know what? You\u2019ll probably flood it again.\u201d She patted his shoulder as though she was trying to console him and added, \u201cIt\u2019s because you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. If you want, I could show you.\u201d</p><p>Having given her opinion, she scooted back, clicked her seat belt on, and offered her friends some of the fruity snacks she had in her pocket. Within seconds the girls were whispering and giggling. The topic was Halloween and what costumes they were going to wear to school for the party. Regan announced she was going as a scary witch, and Sophie couldn\u2019t quite decide but was leaning toward a ballerina.</p><p>\u201cAre you still going to be Cinderella?\u201d Sophie asked Cordie.</p><p>Cordie stopped to think for a second and then looked up at Aiden before answering. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019m going to be Snow White.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the chatter in the backseat, Aiden asked Spencer if he remembered passing any filling stations on the way to the field.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking. Do you know anything about cars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cAnd neither do you.\u201d He tried to start the engine again a couple of times before giving up. \u201cDamn,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhy in God\u2019s name do they have soccer practice all the way out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats me. One of us should start walking, I guess. It\u2019s probably a couple of miles to the nearest house. I\u2019ll go. I\u2019ll knock on doors until someone lets me use their phone. Unless . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless what?\u201d</p><p>Spencer looked over the seat at the girls. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless what?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cUnless we ask the kid,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to ask a five-year-old how to fix the damn car?\u201d Aiden asked with a hint of sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI\u2019ll ask her.\u201d</p><p>He turned to the girls. \u201cNow, Cordie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Cordelia, but everyone calls her Cordie.\u201d Regan volunteered that information.</p><p>\u201cCordelia\u2019s a pretty name,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>Cordie hadn\u2019t liked her name, but when he told her it was pretty, she changed her mind in an instant. She decided she wanted everyone to call her Cordelia.</p><p>\u201cDid you say you could tell Aiden how to get the car started?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>\u201cI maybe could,\u201d she said. She sat forward again. \u201cIt\u2019s easy. All you have to do is put your foot on the gas pedal and push down. Hold it there. You don\u2019t push up and down like you were doing. Then turn the key on and leave it on. You keep turning it off and on, and that\u2019s wrong. Everything you did was wrong,\u201d she happily informed him. Then she patted him again and added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Aiden. The engine will maybe start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, huh? Okay, I\u2019ll give it a try.\u201d He followed her instructions, smiling inside over the fact that he was listening to a five-year-old, but after several seconds with nothing happening, he started to ease off the pedal.</p><p>She shouted in his ear. \u201cNo. Wait!\u201d</p><p>He kept his foot pressed to the floor, and the engine coughed a couple of times, then gained momentum and came to life.</p><p>Aiden turned to look at Cordie and was met with a broad, satisfied grin. He straightened in his seat and put the car in gear. As they pulled away from the soccer fields, he lowered his voice so that only Spencer would hear. \u201cAre we going to admit that a five-year-old\u2014\u201d</p><p>Spencer interrupted. \u201cWe tell no one.\u201d</p><p>In his rearview mirror Aiden could see Sophie and Regan still chattering away, but Cordie was smiling back at him with the clearest blue eyes he had ever seen. He shook his head and laughed. \u201cWho would believe us?\u201d</p><p>ONE</p><p>Some deathbed confessions are expected, others surprising, but this one . . . well, this one was a real doozy.</p><p>It was Andrew Kane\u2019s third heart attack, and he wasn\u2019t going to come back this time. Too much damage had been done to the anterior wall to hope for a recovery. He knew it, and so did his daughter, Cordie, who sat by his side in the critical care unit and prayed for a miracle.</p><p>Her father was hooked to a plethora of machines by a series of tubes and IVs. The constant beep from the heart monitor was a comfort to Cordie because it assured her that, even though his eyes were closed and his breathing was shallow, he was still alive. She wouldn\u2019t leave him, not even for a minute, fearing he would take his last breath alone in the cold, sterile environment while machines sounded his passing with wailing alarms.</p><p>Cordie\u2019s life had come to a screeching halt at eleven o\u2019clock Friday night when she got the news. She had just arrived home from a charity event at St. Matthew\u2019s High School for Boys, and she was exhausted. Her day had started at six fifteen in the morning when she left her brownstone to go to work. After teaching three chemistry classes and two biology classes, she graded papers during study period, supervised two lab experiments, broke up a fight, and filled in for a math teacher who was home with stomach flu. Then, once the students had been dismissed for the day, she, along with most of the other underpaid teachers, helped transform the gymnasium into a Monte Carlo atmosphere for the annual charity auction. The remainder of the evening was spent serving soft drinks and smiling at donors until her face felt frozen.</p><p>She had been teaching at St. Matthew\u2019s for three years while she finished her PhD. The school was located on the edge of Chicago\u2019s South Side, a rough area of the city, to be sure, but thus far she hadn\u2019t had any real trouble. A ten-foot-high wrought iron fence that had been there since the school was built surrounded the property and the parking area, and she had to drive only two blocks from the highway exit to get to it. There was always a guard at the gate. An anonymous benefactor had made a substantial contribution to the school with the condition that there would be a guard on duty at all times, and ever since the principal had hired the highly recommended security firm, the number of slashed tires and smashed windshields had plummeted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Although her father wouldn\u2019t admit it, Cordie suspected he was the benefactor. When she started working at the school, he became a staunch supporter. He even took over the auto shop classes when the regular instructor quit in the middle of the semester. The boys could be difficult. Most of them were high risk, but her father didn\u2019t have any problem controlling them. He\u2019d grown up in New Jersey and, even now, after all these years living in Chicago, still had a bit of a Jersey accent and a tough-guy facade. He treated the boys with respect, and they responded in kind. His gruff, no-nonsense attitude and his enthusiasm won them over. The fact that he had built a national chain of auto repair shops from the ground up didn\u2019t hurt. In the eyes of his otherwise cynical students, it gave him credibility. While he was teaching the class, attendance was one hundred percent.</p><p>She knew it couldn\u2019t have been easy for him raising her alone. It had always been just the two of them. There weren\u2019t any relatives on either side of the family. Her mother had died when Cordie was a baby, so of course she didn\u2019t have any memories of her. Her father told her she looked like her mother, but he never shared any stories about her. Cordie believed it was too painful for him to talk about losing the love of his life.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready to lose him. He was her dad. He had always been . . . indestructible. Until his first heart attack six months ago, he had never been sick, never missed a day of work. Cordie depended on him for strength when times were difficult, and he was always there for her. Always.</p><p>When she had first entered the ICU room, the shock nearly undid her. A priest was standing over him administering the last rites. She barely recognized her father, and she stood there paralyzed with fear. He was a big man, almost six feet, with a muscular frame, but he looked so much smaller in the hospital bed, so weak and vulnerable.</p> <p>Now sitting next to him, she was overwhelmed with the need to help him. Tears streamed down her cheeks, and she impatiently wiped them away. It took several minutes for her to gain control of her emotions. If he opened his eyes, she didn\u2019t want him to see her crying.</p><p>A senior cardiology resident came in to check on her father and assured her that he was resting comfortably. He couldn\u2019t tell her how long it would be before his heart stopped beating.</p><p>\u201cThe heart is an amazing organ,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThen he could get better,\u201d she whispered, clinging to the possibility.</p><p>Snatching her hope away, he shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cDr. Platte explained the severity\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She interrupted. \u201cYes, he explained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe damage\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she interrupted again. \u201cHe\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let herself believe it, though. Oh God, please don\u2019t let him die.</p><p>She knew she wasn\u2019t being rational, pleading for the impossible. She was a fully grown woman, yet sitting there watching him she felt like a little girl again. And she was so scared.</p><p>She took hold of his hand. She wanted him to know she was there and that he wasn\u2019t alone. Gradually her panic began to ease. The initial shock wore off, and she was calm once again.</p> <p>As she sat there hour after hour, she thought about her father\u2019s life. He really was a remarkable man. When she was just a toddler, he went back to school to finish his college degree in business. To support them, he worked as a mechanic in a tiny auto shop. By the time she was five years old, he owned that shop and four more. Then he expanded to sixteen shops in neighboring cities. By her tenth birthday, Kane Automotive was nationwide, and her father was a multimillionaire. Last year he\u2019d sold the company, which had grown to more than twelve hundred shops around the country, but he still tinkered in his garage rebuilding old cars just for the love of the work.</p><p>There was never a time he wasn\u2019t busy. Yet he was always in the front row for any of her school events. He took her to dance classes and piano lessons and never missed a recital. He was at every parent-teacher night as well. And how many times did he put up with all those sleepovers with her two best friends, Regan and Sophie? Three little girls who giggled over everything must have driven him crazy, but he took it all in stride. The countless trips to the art museum, the zoo, the science exhibits, and the children\u2019s movies she wanted to see again and again\u2014her dad had the patience of a saint. When he wasn\u2019t teaching her how to rebuild an engine or change the oil, he was monitoring her schoolwork. Smiling at the memories, she realized how very blessed she was to have such a great father.</p><p>Around two in the morning she dozed off. She awakened with a start when he squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cCordie.\u201d</p><p>She jumped up and moved closer to the bed. She thought his complexion wasn\u2019t quite as gray, and he seemed surprisingly alert.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Dad,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d He took a breath and said, \u201cThis one wasn\u2019t like the other two. It snuck up on me and grabbed me from behind. It felt like my heart was being squeezed by a vise. Dropped me to the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in pain now?\u201d Fear made her voice quiver.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no pain at all. I didn\u2019t think I would go like this . . . or so soon. I thought I had more time, but I guess everyone thinks that.\u201d He closed his eyes, took another shaky breath, and called her name again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay. You know I don\u2019t want to leave you all alone, but you\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>She thought he needed her assurance. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lockbox at the bank. The papers are there. Jared Newton, my attorney, will help you. You remember him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please don\u2019t worry about me. You taught me how to take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>Several minutes passed in silence. His grip had loosened on her hand. She watched him struggle for each breath, and she could feel the fear catching hold once more.</p><p>She thought he had fallen asleep, but suddenly he spoke again. \u201cIt\u2019s all in your name. She won\u2019t be able to get her hands on it.\u201d</p><p>What? Was he hallucinating? \u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. \u201cWhen you fall in love with the right man, I won\u2019t get to walk you down the aisle. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about such things now, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t make the same mistakes I made. Don\u2019t long for what you can never have. Before you know it, you will have wasted years waiting. And then it\u2019s too late. I should have remarried, but I couldn\u2019t let her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean Mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, his voice weaker now, his eyes closed. \u201cIt\u2019s all there in the box. I waited too long.\u201d</p><p>His words came slowly and were whispered between labored breaths. \u201cWhen you were little I didn\u2019t know how to tell you. And when you grew up it didn\u2019t seem important. There was never the right time.\u201d</p><p>She softly stroked his hand. \u201cTell me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no accident . . . Your mother didn\u2019t die in a car accident.\u201d</p><p>Cordie was confused. Why would he lie about that? They never talked about her mother, so why was he focusing on her now? \u201cThen how did she die?\u201d</p><p>His last words were faint but unmistakable. \u201cShe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>TWO</p><p>Cordie was numb with grief and shock. Although her father had had the last rites, the parish priest, Father Patrick Anthony, blessed him again and then sat with her until she was ready to leave the hospital room and allow the body to be taken to Neeson Funeral Home. It took a long while for her to let go of her father\u2019s hand . . . to let him go.</p><p>It was almost five in the morning by the time she reached her brownstone. She went inside and sat at the kitchen table with a cup of hot tea she didn\u2019t remember brewing. If it had been a normal morning, her father would be getting up soon to get dressed for six thirty Mass at St. Peter\u2019s. He never missed. Then he\u2019d come back home and go to work on one of his many projects. She had thought he\u2019d slow down after he sold his business, but that only freed him to concentrate on his other interests.</p><p>He had moved in with her two weeks ago\u2014a temporary arrangement, he\u2019d insisted\u2014while he looked for a smaller home. He hadn\u2019t expected his old house would sell so quickly.</p><p>She\u2019d loved having her dad around, and she hadn\u2019t been in any hurry for him to leave.</p><p>She had to plan a funeral, she thought. There was so much to do she didn\u2019t know where to start. She should call people, shouldn\u2019t she? She picked up a pen to make a list, then put the pen down. Nothing could be gained by calling her father\u2019s friends now. She would wait a couple of hours so she wouldn\u2019t disturb their sleep. Not everyone got up at the crack of dawn like her father. She would also follow his instructions and call the attorney first, she decided. She should probably write that down somewhere so she wouldn\u2019t forget.</p><p>There weren\u2019t any relatives to call. The closest thing she had to family were her two best friends. Cordie could have called them from the hospital, but Regan and her husband, Alec, were in London for a conference, and Sophie and her husband, Jack, were on their honeymoon somewhere in Bermuda. Regan and Sophie loved her father almost as much as she did, and his death was going to devastate them.</p><p>The senior boys at St. Matthew\u2019s High School were going to be upset, too. As tough and streetwise as some of them were, they all had a soft spot for her father. They liked working on cars with him and learning from him. He had also been a father figure of sorts, she thought, remembering all the times after auto class a student would ask him if he could run something past him. Though her father never mentioned it, she had a feeling he got some of them out of trouble with the law.</p><p>Her dad was too young to die. He wasn\u2019t even fifty yet. A tear slipped down her cheek. She didn\u2019t want to call anyone. That would make it real. Once she said the words, she couldn\u2019t take them back. Cordie knew she wasn\u2019t making a lot of sense and blamed her muddled thinking on exhaustion, so she went upstairs and got ready for bed. After she set the alarm on her cell phone, she curled up on top of her duvet cover and closed her eyes. She would sleep for two hours, then get up and do what needed to be done.</p><p>Her mind wouldn\u2019t quiet down. She kept replaying the conversation she and her father had had in the hospital. He\u2019d told her that her mother was alive. Cordie didn\u2019t know how to process that information. He had also confessed that he had wasted years waiting for her to come back to him. Okay, so she had left him. No, she had left both of them. But why? Where was she now? And why had her father lied about her mother all these years? The answers were in the safe-deposit box, he\u2019d said.</p><p>Cordie drifted off to sleep wondering what other secrets her father had had.</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>During morning Mass the priest told the congregation a beloved parishioner, Andrew Kane, had died and to please keep him in their prayers. Word quickly spread, and by noon Cordie\u2019s home was packed with friends, business associates, clergy, neighbors, and enough food to feed the entire parish. Apparently casseroles were a hot item for mourners. She had seven of them in her kitchen by midafternoon. Thankfully, her neighbor and friend Brenda Hagerty took charge of the food, and Brenda\u2019s husband, Tom, helped with the crowd.</p><p>Jared Newton, the family attorney, drove Cordie to the bank to go through the safe-deposit box. It was stuffed with stock certificates, bonds, and all sorts of other legal papers. There was also a long, narrow box labeled For Cordie. Jared made copies of the documents, placed them in his briefcase, and handed the copies and the small box to Cordie. Lifting the lid, she glanced inside and saw a stack of envelopes. She would go through the contents tonight when she was alone.</p><p>It had taken them less than an hour to make the trip to the bank, and when they turned the corner at the end of her block, they were stopped by the congested traffic. Cars were double-parked in front of her door, and a steady stream of people headed toward her brownstone, many carrying covered dishes. Cordie was touched by the outpouring of sympathy, but she had no idea where she was going to put everyone. The crowd already spilled out onto the steps and sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cYour father was well loved,\u201d Jared said. \u201cAnd these people are here for you, too.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drop you off in front and find a place to park,\u201d he said. \u201cCordie, tell me what I can do to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to write an obituary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll help you with that.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Jared was such a sweet man. He was nice looking, too, she realized. She\u2019d known him for five years, but until this moment she had never taken the time to notice how handsome he was. He had asked her out several times, and she\u2019d always declined. Why had she done that? The answer was quick. Because she\u2019d been chasing a foolish dream. Her father was right. It was time for her to face reality and move on.</p><p>She unbuckled her seat belt and opened the car door, but she didn\u2019t get out. She sat there thinking.</p><p>\u201cCordie?\u201d Jared asked, wondering why she was hesitating.</p><p>She turned to him again. \u201cAre you seeing anyone now?\u201d</p><p>The question surprised him. \u201cI was,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t going anywhere, so I broke it off. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering . . . once things calm down, would you like to go to dinner or something?\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe she was doing this now with her life so crazy. She knew she wasn\u2019t thinking straight, but that didn\u2019t seem to matter. She still plunged ahead.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like that,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Okay, she thought. Step one: Move forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to make a couple of calls first.\u201d</p><p>It took her a good fifteen minutes to make her way upstairs. Her father\u2019s poker friends were sitting together at the dining room table reminiscing. She stopped to talk to each one of them, then went up to her bedroom and shut the door.</p><p>She called Regan first. Her husband answered. \u201cHi, Alec,\u201d she said. \u201cHow\u2019s the conference going?\u201d She hadn\u2019t meant to ask that question, but she needed time to get the reason for her call out, to find the right words. He knew something was wrong the second he heard her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She decided not to ease into it. \u201cMy father had a heart attack. He didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cordie, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He wanted details, and she answered each of his questions. As though she were in a trance, her voice was devoid of emotion. Alec was like a brother to her. She didn\u2019t have to be strong with him, but his sympathy was bringing all the grief and pain to the surface again, and she couldn\u2019t afford to lose control now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRegan will be back in an hour,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll have her call you just as soon as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she blurted. \u201cIf I talk to her now, I\u2019ll fall apart, and I have a houseful of people . . . and casseroles. Oh God, there are so many casseroles. Will you call Sophie for me? Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I will,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all for now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRegan and I are going to help you get through this. We\u2019ll be on the next flight out of here.\u201d</p><p>After ending the call, she went to her bathroom and splashed cold water on her face. There was so much to do before she could sit down and take a breath. She descended the stairs and immediately was surrounded by a throng of sympathetic faces. Cordie realized all the offers of help were given with good intentions, and she appreciated each and every one of them, but there were some things she needed to do alone. She had a three o\u2019clock appointment at the funeral home. She eased her way through the crowd so that she could sneak out the back door without anyone noticing or insisting on accompanying her.</p><p>To her surprise she found that her father had already taken care of all the arrangements. He\u2019d left precise instructions. He wanted the funeral Mass to take place at St. Matthew\u2019s Catholic Church, which was just across the parking lot from the high school where she taught. Some of her father\u2019s older friends were going to balk at driving into what they considered a dangerous area of the city, and she would understand if they didn\u2019t attend. Nevertheless, she would honor all her father\u2019s wishes, even if no one showed up.</p><p>She navigated the rest of the day in a fog. She must have listened to a hundred wonderful stories about her father, but after a while they all blended together. His loyal friends had already sainted him.</p><p>The box she\u2019d brought home from the bank was on a shelf in her closet. She had every intention of going through it tonight, but by the time she went upstairs, she was so weary she could barely focus. She dressed for bed and slipped under the covers, the sad faces and words of condolence swimming in her head, and she fell asleep knowing that in the morning the ritual would start all over again.</p> <p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Cordie was in the living room picking up glasses and putting them on a tray to carry to the kitchen when the front door opened and Sophie and Jack MacAlister walked in. The second Sophie saw her, she started to cry. Cordie put the glasses down and went to her.</p><p>As she hugged each of them, she said, \u201cThank you so much for coming.\u201d She realized what she had just said to her dearest friends and shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying those words since yesterday morning to everyone who stopped by. I meant to say, \u2018Thank God you\u2019re here.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Jack put his arm around her and suggested they go somewhere quiet to talk.</p><p>\u201cHow about the study?\u201d Cordie suggested. She didn\u2019t know if there were people in there or not. She grabbed a couple of tissues from the box on the table, handed them to Sophie, and led the way.</p><p>One of her advisors in the science department at the university put his hand on her arm to stop her. He was a gregarious man with a rich baritone voice.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to take off now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was wondering . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your father know?\u201d</p><p>She understood what he was referring to. \u201cNo, I had only just found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound out what?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>Cordie remembered her manners and introduced the professor and his wife to her friends. The professor answered Sophie\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cCordie\u2019s dissertation was approved. She\u2019s now a PhD in biochemistry. Her thesis was groundbreaking. As young as Cordie is, to have accomplished such an impressive feat is quite remarkable.\u201d</p><p>Cordie wasn\u2019t comfortable with compliments because she never knew what to say, and so she quickly changed the subject. A few minutes later she walked the professor and his wife to the door, thanked them again for coming, and then went to join Jack and Sophie in the study.</p> <p>Jack pushed the door closed behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired, Cordie,\u201d Sophie said as she took a seat in the overstuffed leather chair by the window. Jack joined her, sitting next to her on the chair\u2019s arm.</p><p>Cordie couldn\u2019t relax. She leaned against the desk, folded her arms, and took a deep breath. \u201cTired?\u201d she scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re being kind. I look like hell.\u201d She wasn\u2019t exaggerating. The last time she\u2019d passed a mirror she was shocked to see how pale her complexion was, and the dark circles under her eyes looked as though she\u2019d drawn them there with charcoal.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your dad,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cWere you with him when he had the heart attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cordie answered. She explained what had happened.</p><p>By the time she was finished, Sophie was on her second tissue, dabbing the tears from her eyes. \u201cDid he suffer? He didn\u2019t, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t,\u201d Cordie assured her. \u201cThe doctors gave him medication to take care of the pain. I sat with him, and I would have known if he had any discomfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there for you,\u201d Sophie whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you did. He loved you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat needs to be done?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cPut us to work.\u201d</p><p>One of the neighbors knocked on the door and looked in. \u201cCordie, the priest is here to talk to you about the funeral Mass, and there are two policemen at the door. They\u2019re wanting something done about the cars blocking the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to the police,\u201d Jack said, and headed out the door.</p><p>Sophie smiled as she watched him leave. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have an FBI agent for a husband. Certainly comes in handy sometimes.\u201d Standing, she removed her sweater and draped it across the back of the chair. \u201cHow about I go in the kitchen and help while you bring the priest in here and talk,\u201d she suggested. The look on Cordie\u2019s face made her laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t cook. I\u2019ll wash dishes or something.\u201d</p><p>The last time Sophie made pasta in Cordie\u2019s kitchen it took an hour to get the gummy noodles off the burners. The food was actually pretty good, but the entire kitchen was a mess.</p><p>Cordie didn\u2019t have another minute alone with her friends the rest of the day. It was heartwarming that so many people wanted to pay their respects and talk about their friendship with her father, and she felt the least she could do was give each of them her time and attention.</p><p>By nine o\u2019clock that evening, the last of the guests had left. Sophie and Cordie were sitting at the kitchen table, and Jack, with his sleeves rolled up to his elbows, was washing the pans in the sink when Regan and her husband, Alec, arrived.</p><p>Alec looked rested, but then he could sleep anywhere, according to Regan. He had slept all the way from London to Chicago. Regan, on the other hand, looked wiped out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a long trip,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cYou should go home to bed.\u201d</p><p>Regan shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine, and we won\u2019t stay long. I just wanted to see you, to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>Alec wrapped his arm around Regan and pulled her into his side. Cordie watched her lean into him. The way they looked at each other was so sweet, so loving. It was the same way Jack looked at Sophie. Her best friends had found their soul mates, and she was truly happy for them.</p><p>It was amazing, she thought, how fate worked in such mysterious ways when it came to love. Alec Buchanan had come into Regan\u2019s life under the most unexpected circumstances. Regan had become the target of a madman, and it was Alec, a Chicago detective, who was given the responsibility of protecting her. By the time the traumatic event was over, the two knew they were meant to be together. In a short time, they married and moved away so that Alec could join the FBI. Cordie and Sophie missed their friend terribly, and when they got the news that Alec would be assigned to two offices, Chicago and Boston, they were ecstatic. The trio would be back together again. Fate wasn\u2019t through with them yet, however. The moment Regan met Alec\u2019s new Chicago partner, Agent Jack MacAlister, she knew he would be a match for her vivacious friend Sophie. And she was right. They were crazy about each other.</p><p>Her friends had found true and lasting love, and up until the night her father died Cordie believed she, too, could have happily ever after with the man of her dreams, but no longer. She had been a fool long enough. It was time to grow up.</p><p>\u201cWhen is Aiden getting in?\u201d Alec asked Cordie. \u201cDid he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t talked to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call Aiden?\u201d Regan looked dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t call any of your brothers.\u201d</p><p>Alec was frowning at her, and Cordie understood why. Whenever there was anything going on, good or bad, Cordie always insisted on including Aiden. Had her foolish crush been that transparent? Apparently so, she thought.</p><p>She decided to turn their attention. \u201cAre you hungry? There\u2019s all sorts of food in the refrigerator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could eat,\u201d Alec replied.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Jack said as he dried the last pan and set it on the counter.</p><p>Cordie went to the refrigerator and started bringing out covered dishes, but Alec took them from her and turned her toward the living room. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of this. Why don\u2019t you three go sit down and talk?\u201d</p><p>Grateful for the suggestion, Cordie headed to the sofa, dropped down in the center, and put her feet up on the ottoman. Sophie sat on her right and linked her arm in Cordie\u2019s, and Regan sat on her left with her arm around Cordie\u2019s shoulder. The three friends couldn\u2019t be more different\u2014acquaintances usually categorized Sophie as the uninhibited one, Regan as the sensitive one, and Cordie as the scholarly and practical one\u2014yet when they were together, they were an unshakable unit.</p><p>\u201cTell me something happy,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cHow was Bermuda, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>For the next few minutes, Sophie gave her friends a very romantic account of white-sand beaches and warm tropical nights with Jack, listening to the sound of the surf under a starlit sky. When it was her turn, Regan told them all about London. She and Alec had been involved in projects to help at-risk youth in Chicago for a couple of years and were attending a conference in England with representatives from several European countries with similar goals. Her excitement was obvious as she talked about the success of the conference and the new ideas that were shared.</p><p>No matter how hard Cordie tried to keep the subjects light and upbeat, the conversation eventually turned to her father.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize how remarkable he was?\u201d Sophie asked. \u201cWhen you were a baby, he was a mechanic, and when he died, he had just sold Kane Automotive for millions of dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom one little shop to more than twelve hundred across the country,\u201d Regan added. \u201cYour dad was amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he know you were with him?\u201d Regan asked. Tears were already flooding her eyes. \u201cIn the hospital . . . did he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he knew. We talked for a little while, and then he drifted off and was gone. It was very peaceful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you talk about?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>Cordie didn\u2019t want to cry, and so she made light of the question. \u201cHe told me where all the bodies were buried.\u201d</p><p>Regan wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Sophie said, smiling. \u201cYour dad was such a stickler for the rules. I\u2019ll bet he never got so much as a speeding ticket in all the years I knew him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Cordie agreed.</p><p>\u201cSo no surprises?\u201d</p><p>Cordie paused and took a breath before answering. \u201cJust one.\u201d</p><p>THREE</p><p>Aiden Hamilton Madison didn\u2019t suffer fools easily, and after spending twenty minutes with Lester Chambers, he had had enough, but his brother Spencer had dragged him into this deal and was really pushing it. For that reason Aiden held his patience as long as he could.</p><p>Lester Chambers and his cousin, Congressman Mitchell Ray Chambers, had inherited Rock Point, a pristine piece of Oregon land overlooking the ocean, and after lengthy negotiations had agreed to sell the property to the Hamilton Hotel chain for quite a tidy sum. Aiden and his brothers planned to build another one of their exclusive resorts on the site.</p><p>There was another property available about 250 miles south of Rock Point, and Aiden much preferred that area of coastline. As CEO of Hamilton Hotels, he made most business decisions, but he\u2019d agreed to let his brother, a partner in the company, make the choice this time. Both Lester and his cousin had verbally agreed to all the terms. Aiden had the papers drawn up, and as far as he was concerned, the deal was done.</p><p>The hotel was going to be a godsend to the economically depressed area, and perhaps that was why Spencer had pushed so hard. Word had already spread that the acclaimed five-star hotel was going to be built near the small, struggling community of Fallsborough, and men and women desperate for work were once again hopeful about the future. Spencer wanted to expand, and this property was slated to become an all-inclusive resort, a luxurious retreat where the stressed-out could go to decompress.</p><p>The brothers flew to Fallsborough in one of the company jets. The tiny airfield was in dire need of resurfacing, but Aiden would let Spencer deal with that issue once construction was under way.</p><p>A car was waiting for them. It was cold and windy and damp, but neither brother wore a topcoat. On the way to Lester\u2019s office, Spencer suggested a bet. Aiden hadn\u2019t met Lester or his cousin, but Spencer had. He told Aiden exactly how Lester would introduce his cousin. Aiden took the bet, certain his brother was exaggerating.</p><p>When the brothers walked into the lobby of the building where Lester had offices, they were all but ambushed by the local news. A reporter, microphone in hand, and a cameraman a few feet behind chased Aiden to the elevators.</p><p>The reporter was a young woman named Kalie. \u201cIs it true?\u201d she asked, stretching her arm so that the microphone was close to Aiden\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIs what true?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Aiden Hamilton Madison, aren\u2019t you? And standing next to you is Spencer Madison.\u201d</p><p>Aiden smiled. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>She was very nervous. The microphone was shaking. \u201cNo, I mean is it true that the Hamilton Hotel is coming here? That you\u2019re going to build on Rock Point?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s wonderful news. When will you start building? Do you have a target date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo date yet. We\u2019ve agreed to terms and we\u2019re here to get the papers signed. Spencer has the timetable. You should talk to him.\u201d He glanced to his left, where his brother had been standing.</p><p>\u201cHe already went up in the elevator,\u201d Kalie explained.</p> <p>Aiden laughed. Spencer hated doing interviews almost as much as Aiden did. He would have taken off if he\u2019d had the chance and left Spencer to field questions, but he wasn\u2019t fast enough this time.</p><p>\u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one more question, please. How did you find out about Rock Point? This is such a remote area,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cMayor Green,\u201d he answered. \u201cShe waged a relentless campaign to get Spencer to come look.\u201d</p><p>Kalie thanked him, motioned to the cameraman to stop filming, and then followed Aiden to the elevator. \u201cWill you be staying in town tonight?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>His answer was abrupt. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could take you out for a drink . . .\u201d Her voice was wistful.</p><p>He smiled to soften the rejection, then said, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d The elevator doors closed before she could ask another question.</p><p>The meeting was set for four o\u2019clock. They were fifteen minutes early\u2014Aiden couldn\u2019t abide being late for anything\u2014but apparently the Chamberses had a more relaxed notion of meeting schedules.</p><p>Spencer grinned when he saw his brother. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d</p><p>The question didn\u2019t merit an answer. Aiden went to the two-story window and looked out at the landscape. It wasn\u2019t a pretty day. The sky was gray, but darker clouds were moving in, and from the way the trees were swaying, he knew the wind was up.</p> <p>The receptionist, a thirty-year-old single woman, couldn\u2019t stop staring at the brothers. They were handsome men, both tall and muscular through the shoulders, impressively lean and fit, with dark hair and patrician features. They wore business suits, designer label, she surmised. Aiden in his dark suit with pale blue shirt and striped tie, and Spencer in a pinstriped suit with a crisp white shirt and red tie. Oh my, were they sexy. She heard herself sigh and was mortified. But they were just so . . . fine.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Spencer asked when she continued to stare at them.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she stammered. \u201cI was just noticing what nice suits you\u2019re wearing, and I was thinking that both of you look like you belong on Wall Street.\u201d</p><p>Spencer smiled. \u201cThese days that isn\u2019t a compliment.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI guess it isn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to wait. Mr. Chambers should be out any minute now. I\u2019ve buzzed him three times already.\u201d</p><p>At twenty minutes after four the double doors suddenly flew open, and Lester came rushing out to greet them. Aiden supposed he was trying to give the impression that he was a very busy man. He waved his hands while he apologized for keeping them waiting, explaining that he was on an urgent call.</p><p>\u201cVery urgent,\u201d he reiterated as he shook their hands. He ushered them into his office and closed the door. \u201cYou boys are getting quite a bargain. I feel like you\u2019re stealing Rock Point from me and my cousin. I really do.\u201d</p><p>Boys? Spencer glanced at Aiden, who didn\u2019t show any reaction to Lester\u2019s condescension.</p> <p>\u201cThe offer you accepted was more than fair,\u201d Aiden told him in a firm, no-nonsense tone of voice.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your cousin?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>As if on cue, the doors opened and Congressman Mitchell Ray Chambers strolled inside. He didn\u2019t look anything like his cousin. Lester was short, not quite five-two, with a noticeable paunch and a bald spot on the top of his head. Mitchell had a full head of silver-tipped hair, compliments of his stylist. He was a trim six feet, and his face seemed to be cast in a perpetual smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late,\u201d Mitchell began. \u201cI came up the back steps, but I still got caught and asked for autographs. I couldn\u2019t say no.\u201d Almost as an afterthought he added, \u201cI\u2019m a man of the people.\u201d</p><p>If he was out to impress Aiden and Spencer, he was failing.</p><p>\u201cLet me make the introductions,\u201d Lester insisted. \u201cI\u2019d like you to meet my cousin, the very important congressman Mitchell Ray Chambers.\u201d</p><p>Spencer grinned. He\u2019d just won the bet. Very important indeed.</p><p>Lester went to his desk and sat. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how long it\u2019s been since Mitchell has been home. At least a year now.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell frowned. \u201cNonsense. I represent the good people of Fallsborough. I fly back and forth from Washington all the time.\u201d</p><p>Lester scoffed. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t, and the good people of Fallsborough have noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time for complaints,\u201d Mitchell snapped. Turning back to Aiden and Spencer, his smile still plastered on his face, he said, \u201cShall we sit at the conference table? I\u2019m here to negotiate, so let\u2019s roll up our sleeves and get down to business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNegotiate what?\u201d Lester wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cThe sale of Rock Point, of course.\u201d Crossing the office, he turned one of the swivel chairs from the long conference table and sat down. He swung his right leg over his left and rested his ankle on his knee, then leaned back and waited.</p><p>Spencer and Aiden stayed where they were. Since Spencer had talked to both cousins and their attorney multiple times, hammering out all the details, he was the one who had heard both Lester and Mitchell agree to the final price for the land.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be any negotiation today,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cYou agreed to the price. It\u2019s time to sign the final offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t agree to anything.\u201d Mitchell smiled while he told the lie.</p><p>A true politician, Aiden thought.</p><p>\u201cWe both agreed,\u201d Lester reminded him.</p><p>\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t,\u201d Mitchell snapped. He shot his cousin a glare before the smile was back in place.</p><p>Lester didn\u2019t know when to be quiet. \u201cOur attorney looked over the papers. Everything\u2019s in order. Let\u2019s just sign them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t look the papers over,\u201d Mitchell countered.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did. They were sent to you, and you told me you got them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you keep your mouth . . .\u201d Mitchell took a breath and turned to Spencer. \u201cHave your attorneys had time to read the documents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother and I are both attorneys,\u201d Spencer explained. He was trying to keep his anger under control, but the congressman was making that a real challenge.</p><p>\u201cI agreed to an opening bid,\u201d Mitchell announced.</p><p>Aiden watched Spencer. He was letting him take the lead and decide the next move. His brother opened his briefcase and put the folder with the contract inside. \u201cWhat would you consider a fair price, Congressman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least three times what you offered,\u201d he answered with certainty. He sensed a victory and couldn\u2019t have been more pleased. \u201cCome on, now. Sit down and let\u2019s work out this deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that isn\u2019t going to happen. You gave your word.\u201d Spencer\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t pleasant now, but hard, angry.</p><p>Mitchell shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t sign anything. Keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Beads of sweat were beginning to form on Lester\u2019s forehead. He turned to Spencer. \u201cLet\u2019s talk this through. I know how much you want Rock Point. You said yourself it had great potential. You must have walked over that ground a dozen times.\u201d</p><p>Aiden had heard enough. \u201cWe don\u2019t work with people whose word is meaningless. We\u2019re through here.\u201d</p><p>Lester\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cBut we . . . we had a solid offer . . . we . . .\u201d</p><p>Mitchell didn\u2019t say a word while his cousin sputtered his indignation. He simply watched the Madison brothers leave Lester\u2019s office. Then he strolled over to the bar and poured himself a drink.</p><p>\u201cIt was a great offer,\u201d Lester muttered. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Mitchell said, his voice smug. \u201cThey\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Lester shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet they reach the lobby and turn around. Spencer Madison wants Rock Point, and I\u2019m going to make him pay a premium for it. He\u2019ll talk his brother into negotiating. Just you wait and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey seemed angry that you broke your word.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019ll get over it. Saying one thing and doing another . . . that\u2019s all part of negotiating. As long as you don\u2019t sign anything and you\u2019re not being recorded . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hear yourself? A man\u2019s word\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan it, Lester. Just let it go. I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell kept his eye on the elevators, waiting for the doors to open and prove him right. The Madisons were probably on their way back up.</p><p>Aiden and Spencer had no intention of returning to Chambers\u2019s office. As soon as they reached the lobby they were surrounded by a crowd of men and women holding balloons and cheering. The cameraman was there again, standing behind Kalie, the Channel Seven reporter, who stepped forward with a wide smile of greeting. She held the microphone up to Aiden and said, \u201cAnd here are the new owners of Rock . . .\u201d She stopped when Aiden shook his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t purchase the land just yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. He looked directly into the camera as he explained. \u201cCongressman Mitchell Chambers changed his mind. He wanted more money than we originally agreed on. We won\u2019t be buying Rock Point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201d Spencer interjected. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to move on to another property.\u201d</p><p>Kalie looked stunned. \u201cWait,\u201d she pleaded as Aiden walked past her. \u201cAre you saying Congressman Mitchell Chambers stopped the sale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying,\u201d Aiden answered.</p><p>\u201cThen the Hamilton Hotel won\u2019t be built here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His tone was emphatic.</p><p>Aiden walked out the door and didn\u2019t look back. Spencer followed. The plan was to fly to San Francisco and stay at the Hamilton there while Spencer checked on the remodel he\u2019d begun three months ago, but the plan changed when they received a text from their sister, Regan.</p><p>Aiden retrieved his phone from his pocket and looked at the screen.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>\u201cCordelia\u2019s dad died. Heart attack.\u201d</p><p>Shocked by the news, Spencer didn\u2019t speak for a few seconds. The Madison family had known Cordie and her father for almost twenty years, and Mr. Kane had always been so strong and vigorous.</p><p>\u201cAndrew Kane was a good man,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cYes, he was,\u201d Aiden agreed. \u201cCordelia must be devastated.\u201d</p><p>He immediately called Regan to find out when the funeral was scheduled. His sister was crying. \u201cCordie\u2019s all alone now. Are you coming home? She\u2019ll want you and Spencer there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019ll be there. We\u2019re on our way home now.\u201d</p><p>Spencer opened the car door, then paused to look up at the building they\u2019d just left. All that time wasted, he thought. The engineering reports, the back-and-forth negotiating with two of the most unpleasant men he\u2019d ever encountered\u2014all for nothing.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Aiden called out impatiently.</p><p>Lester Chambers stood at the window and watched the SUV pull onto the main road and drive away. \u201cThey\u2019re on their way to the airstrip,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you were so sure they would come right back up here.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell went to the bar to freshen his drink. He dropped an ice cube into his glass, causing the whiskey to splash all over his hand. He grabbed a napkin to mop up the mess, then took a sip of his drink.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not coming back.\u201d Lester continued to stare out the window until the SUV vanished. There was panic in his voice. \u201cIt was a damn good offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop whining. I know what I\u2019m doing. I know how people think,\u201d he boasted. \u201cIt\u2019s why I make such a great congressman. Believe me. The Madisons will be back. Maybe not today, but soon. I\u2019ll give them a week to come begging.\u201d</p><p>Lester\u2019s receptionist rushed into the office. \u201cSir, one of the secretaries . . . Jenny just mentioned that Channel Seven was in the lobby.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell let out a loud, long-suffering sigh. \u201cThey\u2019re here for me. I\u2019ll let them wait a little longer before I go down and do the interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jenny said the channel\u2019s crew just left but that we should all watch the five-o\u2019clock news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey probably got tired of waiting for you,\u201d Lester told his cousin.</p><p>Mitchell agreed. \u201cI can\u2019t be everywhere all the time,\u201d he excused himself. He reached for the remote on the desk and turned the television on. It wasn\u2019t quite five yet, so Mitchell put the sound on mute and sat on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Mayor Green is running against you?\u201d Lester asked.</p><p>Mitchell snorted. \u201cOf course I knew. She\u2019s wasting her time and money. She doesn\u2019t stand a chance. I\u2019ll bet I get ninety percent of the vote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe primary is not that far away,\u201d Lester reminded him.</p><p>No one was going to take his job away. Mitchell loved being a congressman. He loved the power, the position it garnered, and the respect, though admittedly the public didn\u2019t think much of Congress these days, probably because they knew so many of them were corrupt or just inept. There was talk of term limits. Mitchell had promised to push for those if elected, but once he was in office he changed his mind. Besides, no one in Congress was ever going to vote for that, and Mitchell planned to stay in office until he was well into his eighties. The governor had handpicked him for the job, and as long as Mitchell played ball and voted the way the governor wanted, he would remain a congressman.</p><p>\u201cYou know it was Mayor Green who got Spencer Madison interested in Rock Point,\u201d Lester commented.</p><p>\u201cSo she says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there she is. Turn the sound on. I want to hear what our mayor has to say.\u201d</p><p>The segment lasted a good ten minutes without a commercial break, which was unheard of. The last footage Kalie showed was Aiden Madison explaining why they wouldn\u2019t be building a Hamilton Hotel on Rock Point. He placed the blame squarely on Congressman Chambers\u2019s shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then the mayor was on again, telling the viewers what the hotel would have meant to the community: the new jobs, the improved schools, the revived economy. All these were gone now. She ended her speech with a promise that things would change once she was elected to Congress.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Lester said with a snide smirk on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ve just lost your reelection.\u201d</p><p>FOUR</p><p>They would be talking about Andrew Kane\u2019s funeral for months to come, maybe even years.</p> <p>Alec and Jack dropped Regan, Sophie, and Cordie off at the funeral home much earlier than necessary. It had been decided that Regan and Sophie would ride with Cordie in the limousine behind the hearse, and Alec and Jack would meet them at the church.</p><p>It was an unseasonably warm day. Cordie wore a simple sleeveless black sheath dress with a square neckline and black heels. She didn\u2019t wear much jewelry, just a pair of diamond studs for her ears and a Herm\u00e8s watch her father had given her for her last birthday. She didn\u2019t try to do anything fancy with her hair but left it down. Her natural curls were straightened by its length, just past her shoulders.</p><p>Sophie and Regan, who sat on either side of her in the limousine, were also dressed in black.</p><p>Regan held on to Cordie\u2019s hand. \u201cWhen we get to the church, I\u2019ll take your cardigan and your clutch. Is your phone in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cordie answered.</p> <p>\u201cMake sure it\u2019s turned off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe your father\u2019s gone,\u201d Regan whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he tell you just before he died?\u201d Sophie asked. \u201cYou said there was one surprise, remember?\u201d</p><p>If there was a secret, Sophie had to know what it was. She couldn\u2019t help herself. She worked for a newspaper and was always looking for the next story. Her dream was to be an investigative reporter, but for now she was in charge of the food section and wrote about new recipes. Regan and Cordie thought the irony was quite funny since Sophie didn\u2019t know the first thing about cooking. She had learned how to make one pasta dish that was passable, but that was it.</p><p>Smiling, Cordie said, \u201cI also remember telling you that I would explain what the surprise was after the funeral. Today is about his life. Tonight I\u2019ll tell you. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>Still fishing for a hint, Sophie said, \u201cIt must be a big deal. Otherwise you would have told us. You tell us everything.\u201d</p><p>Both Regan and Cordie laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s you,\u201d Regan said. \u201cOf the three of us, you\u2019re the one who can\u2019t keep a secret.\u201d</p><p>The friends fell silent as the somber procession turned off the main thoroughfare and made its way through the streets of run-down apartments and dilapidated houses toward St. Matthew\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhen we get to the church . . . ,\u201d Cordie began, and then hesitated.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cEight of the students my father worked with are going to be the pallbearers. They had a special place in his heart, but I want you to know they can be a little territorial with one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re at-risk kids,\u201d Regan answered.</p> <p>\u201cSome are,\u201d Cordie agreed. \u201cThere might be some pushing and shoving. You know, boy stuff. Nothing to worry about,\u201d she assured them.</p><p>\u201cDo you think many students will attend?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cordie answered. \u201cIt\u2019s a Saturday. They\u2019re kids. The last place they want to be is in church. I don\u2019t expect\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly. The limousine had just turned onto Grant Street, and there in front of the church, filling the sidewalk from corner to corner and spilling out into the street, were the students of St. Matthew\u2019s High School. It looked as though most of the student body had turned out, and all the boys wore their school uniforms: khaki pants, white shirt, and navy blazer with the school emblem on the pocket. The boys were waiting quietly, their expressions solemn. Each class stood together, with the seniors in front. The second the limousine driver turned the motor off, two students stepped forward to open the door. The taller boy pushed the other aside to get to the handle. A transfer student named Victor won the push and shove. One of Cordie\u2019s favorite students, he was a math whiz but thus far hadn\u2019t developed a lick of sense. He opened the door, grasped her hand, and yanked her out. Her feet actually left the ground, but fortunately she landed feetfirst on the sidewalk. Sophie and Regan were given assistance as well. It didn\u2019t matter if they wanted help or not. Both were hauled out and deposited next to Cordie.</p><p>Alec and Jack were waiting on the church steps. When they saw the crowd engulf the women, they rushed down and pushed their way through the teen mob.</p><p>\u201cThat guy has a gun,\u201d one student whispered loud enough for Cordie to hear.</p><p>Before she could explain who they were, another student said, \u201cBoth of them have guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come they get to bring guns into the church?\u201d</p><p>Cordie whirled around. \u201cThey don\u2019t get to,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re FBI agents. It\u2019s their job to carry guns. They also have badges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is the FBI here?\u201d another student asked in a loud whisper. Cordie didn\u2019t recognize the voice, but his tone was hostile. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything, and I\u2019m not going anywhere without a warrant.\u201d</p><p>Cordie explained before more of them could get riled up. \u201cThey\u2019re my friends,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they were my father\u2019s friends, too.\u201d She handed Regan her cardigan and her purse and said, \u201cYou and Sophie go inside now. The pallbearers will sit in the front row, so sit behind them.\u201d</p><p>Sophie nudged Regan. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Jack and Alec didn\u2019t follow their wives. They stood where they were, watching the crowd of restless boys. Several teachers were trying to get the students to go inside, but none of them would obey. In fact, they squeezed closer to Cordie until they all but swallowed her up like a swarm of bees around a hive. Jack and Alec immediately went into defensive mode, but Cordie raised her hand to let them know she wasn\u2019t in danger. Alec hesitated at first, then, realizing the boys\u2019 behavior was protective, not threatening, he motioned to Jack, and the two stepped aside.</p><p>Aiden and Spencer arrived and, spotting Alec and Jack, made their way around the throng. Aiden looked in all directions and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Cordelia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the middle of the crowd,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see her,\u201d Aiden said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cHow is she doing?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>\u201cRemarkably well,\u201d Alec answered.</p><p>The muttering from the boys got louder, and then suddenly the mood changed. As though a signal had been given, the pushing and nudging and shoving stopped. The boys straightened to their full heights and stood silent. Parting to allow Cordie to get to the front, they watched the coffin being removed from the hearse. Two men from the funeral home placed the coffin on a rolling gurney, then covered it with a white linen cloth that nearly reached the ground. After carefully placing a long spray of deep-red roses on the coffin, the men began to push the gurney up the gentle incline to the church entrance, where Father Patrick Anthony waited with an altar boy who held a gold crucifix that was considerably taller than he was.</p><p>Jerome Smith, the senior class president and her father\u2019s constant shadow when he was at school, stepped forward. \u201cNow?\u201d he asked Cordie.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Seven young men separated from the others and followed Jerome up the steps. They quickly moved to flank each side of the coffin, a couple of them noticeably fighting back tears.</p><p>With slow, measured steps, the priest led the silent procession down the main aisle of the church. Cordie walked behind the coffin and was followed by the students of St. Matthew\u2019s. The side pews were already filled with mourners, and by the time the boys filed into the pews behind her, the church was packed.</p><p>Cordie sat on the end and left room for Jack and Alec to join their wives. As the priest turned to face the mourners and the organist began to play the first hymn, she glanced around at the congregation, and that was when she saw him. Aiden, followed by Spencer, was taking a seat several rows back on the other side of the church. A rush of emotions swept over her. She was happy he was here yet angry at herself for the old feelings that surfaced at the very sight of him. He glanced in her direction, and for a split second their eyes met. He gave her a sympathetic smile, and she smiled in return. The old Cordie would have wanted him sitting next to her, holding her hand, but no longer. Things were different now. She was different now. With renewed resolve she turned around, sat up straight, and focused on the ceremony.</p><p>It was a beautiful Mass, and the priest\u2019s remarks about her father were heartfelt and quite lovely. At least a dozen people had offered to give eulogies, but if all of them had been allowed to speak, the funeral would have lasted hours, so it was decided that three of her father\u2019s closest friends would talk. Their speeches were short\u2014no more than a few minutes each\u2014and focused on what a kind and loyal friend Andrew Kane had been. As the last man was finishing his remarks, Cordie heard a rustling behind her. At first she thought the students were just getting restless, but then she noticed several of them nudging one of the boys and urging him to stand up. He was a sophomore and a transfer from Truman High School. She hadn\u2019t had him in class, but based on the number of times he\u2019d served detention, she knew he was one of those kids who liked to skate on the edge.</p><p>The boy finally gave in to the prodding and, rising out of his seat, headed toward the pulpit. Uh-oh, Cordie thought, this was not planned. She suddenly felt uneasy. There was no telling what he had in mind. As he stepped up to face the congregation, his hands firmly planted in his pockets, he looked at his feet and shuffled back and forth as though he was searching for something to say, and then he began.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Jayden Martin, and I\u2019ve been at St. Matthew\u2019s High School since last November when I was . . . you know . . . asked to leave my old school because of a misunderstanding. My favorite class is auto shop, and my favorite teacher is Mr. Kane. I mean he was my favorite teacher until . . . you know . . . he died.\u201d</p><p>Several students nodded, and Cordie had to force herself not to smile.</p><p>Jayden paused for several seconds, and she thought he was finished, but he continued to stand there looking unsure of himself. He suddenly straightened as though he\u2019d just made a very important decision and said, \u201cMr. Kane told me a story about this kid who wanted a car . . . you know . . . for transportation. He was sixteen, and he had a driver\u2019s license, but he didn\u2019t have any money to buy a car, so he did something really stupid and stole one.\u201d He paused to look around the church to gauge his audience\u2019s reaction, and seeing that everyone was intently listening, he continued. \u201cIt was a sweet ride, a five-year-old Camry in mint condition, like it just came off the showroom floor. Anyway, this kid took the car from the front of this old guy\u2019s house\u2014he had to be almost as old as Mr. Kane\u2014and he drove it around for a couple of miles, but then something happened . . . I don\u2019t know . . . maybe his conscience kicked in, and he realized he shouldn\u2019t have taken it. I mean, I . . . he could go to prison for stealing a car, right?\u201d Several students nodded in agreement. Because his classmates were hanging on his every word, Jayden relaxed. Draping one arm over the pulpit, he leaned forward as he continued. \u201cSo what he did was drive the car over to Mr. Kane\u2019s house, and he told him what he had done. Mr. Kane was real angry, and he yelled at the kid for doing something so stupid, but once he calmed down he said he\u2019d help fix it. He had him wipe his fingerprints off the car handle and everywhere else he touched, and he followed him back to the old guy\u2019s house.\u201d Jayden couldn\u2019t keep from grinning a little. \u201cThe funny thing was, another car had parked in front of the house, so Mr. Kane had the kid park the Camry across the street. If he hadn\u2019t been so scared, he might have waited until the old guy came out to get in his car just to see the look on his face. Would the guy think he had parked it across the street and just forgot? Mr. Kane said he would probably just scratch his head and go on about his business, and I guess he was right because there wasn\u2019t anything in the local news. Mr. Kane saved that kid from going to prison. At least, that\u2019s what I think.\u201d He stopped and looked down at his feet again. When he finally could speak, his voice cracked. \u201cMr. Kane was okay.\u201d With his hands back in his pockets and his head down, he hurried back to the pew.</p><p>The church was completely silent. When Cordie took a quick look at the people behind her, all she saw were stunned faces. She took a deep breath and hoped Jayden\u2019s flimsily veiled confession would be passed over, but before she could turn around to the altar again, another student was heading to the pulpit. Like Jayden, he recounted another story, allegedly told to him by Mr. Kane, of an anonymous student who, in a fit of anger, broke into the school and vandalized it with a couple of cans of black spray paint. According to his account, after the boy had made the mess and written some pretty foul words on the walls outside the principal\u2019s office, he started to think that maybe what he was doing might be a bad idea and he could be in some real trouble. He had heard Mr. Kane had helped another student get out of a bind with the police, so he called him. \u201cMr. Kane was steaming mad, all right . . . at least that\u2019s what he told me,\u201d the boy said, \u201cbut he got some paint and brushes and helped the student clean it all up.\u201d He added, \u201cIt took all night.\u201d</p><p>And on it went. Seven students in all told stories of how they had heard of incidents where Mr. Kane had helped some kid in trouble. When the parade of narrators finally ended, Cordie sat motionless, almost afraid to look around.</p><p>\u201cHow many felonies are we up to now? Four?\u201d Jack whispered the question.</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d Alec corrected.</p><p>Cordie knew there were several detectives and policemen in the congregation because her father had been a big financial supporter of the department. They would most likely call some of her father\u2019s acts of kindness aiding and abetting, tampering with evidence, obstructing justice, and God only knew what else. If she didn\u2019t do something quickly, there was a strong possibility that at least two students would be arrested when the Mass was over.</p><p>Father Anthony had just started back to the altar when Cordie sprang to her feet. The priest saw her and went back to his chair. Her mind was racing as she slowly walked up the three steps to the altar and then crossed over to the pulpit. She didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what she was going to say until she started speaking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy father was proud of the fact that he was Irish, and he used to tell me that the Irish are great storytellers. He certainly was,\u201d she began. So far, so good. The crowd seemed to be buying it. She went on. \u201cHe loved to tell stories about students from the past, and the boys here today . . . like me . . . have all heard his stories so many times now, they\u2019ve almost made them their own. Of course, you can assume that all those kids my father talked about and some of the things he said they did were greatly exaggerated. He meant his stories to be lessons so that the students would learn from mistakes others had made in the past . . . cautionary tales.\u201d</p><p>Cordie wasn\u2019t quite sure what she said after that. When she went back to her seat, she noticed that Alec and Jack weren\u2019t smiling, but there was a definite sparkle in their eyes. They knew exactly what she had just done and why. Like her father, she was protecting the boys.</p><p>Somehow Cordie got through the rest of the day, though she couldn\u2019t remember most of it. After the funeral and the burial, a large number of well-intentioned and caring people followed her to her home and stayed most of the afternoon. Gradually the guests began to thin out, and by evening most of them had said their good-byes, leaving only her close friends. With her house finally quiet again, she curled up in the corner of her sofa, her bare feet tucked under her. All she wanted to do was close her eyes and sleep.</p><p>Spencer and Aiden were still there. They were in a deep conversation with Alec and Jack. The topic was a congressman named Mitchell Ray Chambers, and from the look on Aiden\u2019s face, he wasn\u2019t a fan. Up until now she had avoided looking at Aiden whenever possible. He was like a magnet, though, drawing her to him. She had had a crush on him for so many years\u2014she refused to call it love\u2014and she knew it would take time to break old habits. She\u2019d been completely infatuated with him, but infatuation wasn\u2019t love. She imagined most women who met him quickly became captivated. It wasn\u2019t just his looks that drew women to him. Yes, he was one gorgeous man, the epitome of tall, dark, and devastatingly handsome, but it was the power that radiated from him that kept women begging for his attention. And until a couple of days ago, Cordie had been just like all those silly women under Aiden\u2019s spell.</p> <p>Her eyes were open now. Her father\u2019s confession had opened them. She had never been in love with Aiden; it had been just a foolish crush. That was all. Fortunately for her, the man was clueless. As brilliant as he was in business matters, he was a neophyte where women were concerned. She knew for a fact that he didn\u2019t have any idea how she felt\u2014how she had felt\u2014about him. If she weren\u2019t his sister\u2019s friend, she doubted he would have even given her a second glance. She certainly wasn\u2019t his type. From all the women who had hung on his arm in the past, she knew he preferred tall, slightly anorexic blondes. Cordie was the complete opposite. Her hair wasn\u2019t blond; it was as black as ink and looked even darker against her fair complexion. At five feet six inches she considered herself average height, though she was a smidge taller than Regan and Sophie. She supposed she was in good shape, but no matter how much she dieted, she couldn\u2019t attain the flat-chested skinny-mannequin look. She was what men called curvaceous.</p><p>She realized she was staring at Aiden and quickly turned away. God, she had been such an idiot for such a long time.</p><p>Sophie nudged her. \u201cHave you eaten anything today?\u201d</p><p>The question jarred her. \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t know. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me fix you something,\u201d Regan suggested.</p> <p>Cordie shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry, but thanks for offering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Sophie asked. She reached for her coat and put it on. \u201cCome on, Regan. We should all go home and let her get some rest. It\u2019s been a long, stressful day. Do you think you\u2019ll be able to sleep tonight, Cordie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe one of us should stay over,\u201d Regan suggested.</p><p>Cordie laughed. \u201cNo one is staying with me. I\u2019m fine, really. I\u2019m begging you, please go home. And take those men with you,\u201d she added, waving her hand toward Jack, Alec, Spencer, and Aiden.</p><p>Hearing her, Aiden turned around. \u201cThose men?\u201d He grinned as he repeated her comment.</p><p>\u201cI could be wrong, but I\u2019m getting the feeling that Cordie might want us to leave,\u201d Jack said.</p> <p>Aiden reached for his suit jacket and slipped it on. He looked as though he were about to walk into a boardroom. His suit was a perfect fit, of course. Everything about the man was impeccable. After asking her if there was anything she needed, he and Spencer, insisting that she not walk them to the door, came over to give her a hug. Aiden smelled divine when he wrapped his arms around her, and she tried not to react. She pulled away as quickly as possible.</p><p>After they were gone, Sophie and Jack, along with Regan and Alec, prepared to follow, but just as Sophie reached the door, she suddenly stopped, causing Regan to bump into her. Sophie turned to Cordie. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I forgot to ask you . . . what was the surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a surprise?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, her father told her something surprising,\u201d Regan remembered.</p><p>\u201cShe promised to tell us tonight,\u201d Sophie explained. \u201cSo what was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she doesn\u2019t want to share it just yet,\u201d Jack suggested, being diplomatic, but Sophie was already back in the living room waiting for an answer.</p><p>Cordie stretched her legs out, then swung her feet down to the floor and sat up. Looking around at the curious faces of her four closest friends, she decided there was no easy way to say it other than to just simply state the facts. \u201cMy mother . . . Natalie Kane . . . didn\u2019t die in a car crash. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sophie exclaimed. \u201cIf not in an accident, then how?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAccording to my father, she\u2019s not dead,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>Sophie pulled her coat off and handed it to Jack as she rushed back to Cordie. Regan dropped her purse on her way across the room.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she? What happened to her?\u201d Sophie demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Cordie replied.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she just up and left you and your father?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>Cordie shrugged. \u201cFrom what my father said just before he died, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s exactly what she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could any mother . . .\u201d Regan couldn\u2019t go on. She was so angry her face turned red.</p><p>Her friends had a hundred questions, and Cordie couldn\u2019t answer any of them. No, her father didn\u2019t give her any other details, and no, she didn\u2019t know why he had gone to such lengths to keep the truth from her, especially after she became an adult.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to try to find her?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d Cordie replied.</p><p>Sophie started to nod, then stopped. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019d be curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlec and Jack could locate her for you,\u201d Regan offered.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Sophie agreed. \u201cThey could use their resources at the FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Cordie said, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in finding her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know why she left?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Alec walked over to the ottoman and sat facing Cordie. \u201cWhat do you know about her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHer name was Natalie Ann Smith, and she was born in Sydney, Australia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did your father tell you about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he didn\u2019t tell me anything. I found out her full name and where she was born when I got a copy of my birth certificate so I could get my driver\u2019s license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you anything about her?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cHe told me she died when I was a baby, and I now know that was a lie, but I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s when she left. My father didn\u2019t like to talk about her. Every time I mentioned her, he would become upset. After a while I knew not to ask questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely sure you don\u2019t want to find her?\u201d Sophie asked again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there could be extenuating circumstances\u2014\u201d Sophie began.</p><p>Cordie cut her off. \u201cI don\u2019t care. She broke my father\u2019s heart. I want nothing to do with her.\u201d</p><p>Cordie left no doubt that the subject was closed and that she was resolute in her decision to let it go, but after she read the letter her mother had left for her father and all the letters he had written that were returned, her attitude drastically changed. She not only wanted to locate the woman who broke her father\u2019s heart, she wanted an answer to the question that was gnawing at her: Did Natalie get the life she wanted or\u2014if there was any justice\u2014the life she deserved?</p><p>FIVE</p><p>Andrew,</p><p>This is a difficult letter for me to write. What I have to say is going to upset and perhaps shock you, and I\u2019m sorry about that. You\u2019ve been working such long hours you haven\u2019t had time to notice how unhappy I am. I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat how I feel, though, no matter how much it hurts you.</p><p>This marriage was a mistake. I never should have let you talk me into keeping the baby. We both know I wouldn\u2019t have married you if I weren\u2019t pregnant. Marrying a mechanic was an act of rebellion and terribly foolish. If my family ever found out, they would disown me.</p><p>I can\u2019t do this anymore. I hate being poor, and as selfish as this seems, I believe I deserve more out of life. You and I are so different. I want adventure, and I want to see the world. I know you love me, Andrew, but it isn\u2019t enough.</p><p>I want to go home. I\u2019m going to pretend this marriage never happened and start over. I\u2019m going to put all of this behind me, and I don\u2019t want any reminders. My home is a continent away, so there should never be any chance encounters.</p><p>I\u2019ll leave it to you to file for divorce. I don\u2019t want anything from you but my freedom. You and Cordelia are part of my past now. I don\u2019t want to share custody. You can have her.</p><p>Please accept my decision and don\u2019t come after me.</p><p>Natalie</p><p>Cordie\u2019s heart ached for her father. She couldn\u2019t imagine what he must have felt when he read the letter. It was so cold, brutal, unfeeling. It had to have devastated him, and yet he mourned her on his deathbed.</p><p>He\u2019d treated the letter as though it was a treasure. He\u2019d wrapped it in tissue, then sealed it in a plastic bag and tucked it in the bottom of the box with his other important papers. His letters to Natalie were there as well. There were four of them, and all had been returned unopened with Return to Sender stamped on the front. The address showed her father had sent them to a post office box in Chicago.</p><p>If her father hadn\u2019t wanted Cordie to read the letters he\u2019d written, he would have destroyed them, she decided. She sat in the middle of her bed, spread the envelopes in front of her, and one by one opened them.</p><p>In the first two letters he pleaded with Natalie to come home. He told her he loved her, that he would always love her, and that he was lost without her. In the third letter, sent two years after she\u2019d left him, he notified her he had filed for divorce and had requested full custody of their daughter, Cordelia. He added that, even though he was taking legal action, he still loved her and wanted her to come back to him. He promised to wait because she would always be the love of his life. The fourth letter was verification that the divorce was final.</p><p>At first Cordie wanted to find the woman, to look her in the eyes and tell her what she probably already knew, that she was a horrible person for causing her father so much pain, but as therapeutic as it would be, Cordie knew she would never confront her. What would be the point? She gave up on the idea of having a conversation with the woman. She still wanted to find her, though. There were a few questions that needed answers. Had Natalie\u2019s life changed for the better or the worse? Had her ridiculous dream of pretending she\u2019d never been married and starting all over worked? Was she being pampered? Cordie most wanted to know if she had any regrets.</p><p>There were two other documents in the box with the letters: the marriage certificate and the divorce decree. The marriage certificate showed that Natalie Smith married Andrew Kane in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was dated four months before Cordie was born. The divorce decree was a very basic notice dissolving the marriage. She read them both and then carefully put everything back in the box and closed the lid.</p><p>It was after midnight when she finally got into bed. She tossed and turned for another hour before her mind calmed. She kept thinking about her father and how he had thrown his life away waiting. He could have remarried and had a wonderful life if he\u2019d only been open to the idea. Did his love for Natalie become an obsession? Or did he feel, once married, always married?</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any answers. She couldn\u2019t understand how he could continue to love Natalie after reading that terrible letter. You can have her. Those were the last words that drifted into Cordie\u2019s thoughts before sleep claimed her.</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Sunday afternoon was spent grading papers, and Sunday evening was spent falling apart. She had been melancholy all day, but she kept busy so that she wouldn\u2019t have time to feel sorry for herself. Not wanting to talk to anyone in her present frame of mind, she let the phone calls go to voice mail and tried to focus on getting organized for school. She was fine, she told herself again and again. She was just feeling a little stressed, nothing more, and certainly nothing to worry about.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t fine. She had lost her dad, her only family, the one person who had loved her unconditionally, like a good parent should, and then she\u2019d read that horrible letter from the woman who had to be talked into giving Cordie life and then couldn\u2019t wait to be rid of her. You can have her. Those words were branded in her mind. And there were her father\u2019s desperate pleas in his letters for the love of his life to come back to him. How could her father have loved someone like that?</p><p>It was getting late. Cordie collected her papers and books for the next day and slipped them into her satchel, then stood and stretched. The strain of the last few days had taken its toll. The tension in her muscles was working its way upward, and now her head was beginning to throb. Rubbing her temples, she climbed the stairs to her bedroom. A long, hot shower was exactly what she needed.</p><p>She let the soothing water flow over her tight muscles, and by the time she stepped out of the shower, the tension had eased and her headache was gone. She washed and dried her hair, then put on a short silk nightgown. She was beginning to feel much better and was proud of herself because she had kept it together all evening. She\u2019d done enough of that in the past few days. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hadn\u2019t been sleeping well lately and hoped tonight would be different. She was so tired now, she thought she might just fall asleep the second her head hit the pillow, but to be sure, she would go down to the kitchen and brew a cup of chamomile tea. Not bothering to put on her slippers, she picked up her silk robe and padded out into the hallway. She was tying the sash on her robe and didn\u2019t notice the box of books she\u2019d left sitting on the landing until she tripped into it, lost her balance, and went flying down the stairs. The box careened down the steps with her, and she landed on her backside with books all around her. It was the last straw in a miserable day. She leaned into the banister and burst into tears. She could have broken her neck, and no one would have known until they found her decomposing body days later. Oh Lord, what a depressing thought. She was so caught up in her misery she didn\u2019t hear the pounding on the door.</p><p>Aiden had just climbed the steps to her front door when he heard a commotion and a loud thud coming from inside. He called her name, but there wasn\u2019t any response. About to break in, he realized he hadn\u2019t tried the doorknob. He\u2019d assumed it was locked, but it wasn\u2019t. He rushed inside and was met with the sight of Cordie sobbing as she pushed books off her and tried to get up from the floor.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d His worry made him sound angry.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in the mood to be sociable. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d He repeated the question, though now his voice was calmer.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck while he studied her. He wasn\u2019t sure what to do. It wasn\u2019t like Cordelia to be difficult. She always had it together. But not tonight. He picked up the books and stacked them in the box in the corner of the foyer; then he turned back to her. She was still crying. He wanted to tell her to stop.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d</p><p>Her first inclination was to glare at him, but she was too weary to give it her best effort. She grabbed the banister and, wincing, pulled herself up.</p> <p>He moved forward and, before she realized his intent, lifted her into his arms and carried her upstairs.</p><p>\u201cDid you know your front door was unlocked? Anyone could have come in. You live alone, Cordelia. You should make certain your doors are always locked and your alarm is always on,\u201d he scolded as they ascended the steps.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an alarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting one,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Aiden\u2019s mind raced with all the terrible things that could have happened to her, and he was furious about her cavalier attitude toward her safety. There was only one bedroom door open and he headed there. He could have put her down, but he didn\u2019t. She weighed next to nothing in his arms. He sat on the side of the bed with her in his lap, his arms wrapped around her as he waited for her tears to stop flowing. Her head was down on his shoulder, and she was so soft cuddled against him. He had the sudden urge to get the hell away from her. He was reacting to her in a way he didn\u2019t like.</p><p>She finally stopped crying and leaned back so she could look into his eyes. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got stuck . . .\u201d He stopped before he hurt her feelings with the truth. \u201cRegan was worried about you. You weren\u2019t answering your phone,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe knew I was out, so she called my cell and asked me to stop by and check on you, and it\u2019s a damned good thing I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? As you can see, I\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d She sniffed.</p><p>Aiden said, \u201cYou were sprawled at the bottom of your steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sitting, not sprawling,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cWearing this flimsy see-through nightgown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly see through this material.\u201d She looked down and saw that her robe was open, exposing a fair amount of her br**sts because of the gown\u2019s low neckline. \u201cOh,\u201d she said as she quickly pulled the robe closed. She glanced up and met Aiden\u2019s eyes. He was looking at her in a way he\u2019d never done before, as though he was seeing her for the very first time as a woman. A warm, tingling sensation coursed through her body.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me and go home. I\u2019m fine, I promise. Tell Regan I\u2019ll call her tomorrow, and thank you, Aiden, for taking time to check on me.\u201d</p><p>Her arms were still around his neck. She leaned up and kissed him on his cheek, then started to move away, but he didn\u2019t loosen his hold. He continued to stare into her eyes as though he was searching for something inside her.</p> <p>The strangest thing happened then. Maybe it was just curiosity to find out what it would feel like, or maybe it was just plain lust on her part. She kissed him again, this time on the lips. He didn\u2019t pull away. He nudged her chin down and gently kissed her back. Then, taking her face in his hands, he deepened the kiss, passion igniting when his tongue swept inside her mouth. He was so incredibly hot and demanding, overwhelming her. He made love to her with his mouth while he caressed her. His hand cupped her breast and he groaned.</p><p>Aiden was lost in the moment. It was only when he felt her tremble that he came to his senses. He pulled back, forcing her to let go of him, then lifted her off his lap and dropped her onto the bed.</p><p>Cordie was so flustered she didn\u2019t know what to say or do. She could see he was upset. He walked to the door, turned back to her, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll lock up. You get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>And he was gone.</p><p>She sat there a long while trying to make sense of what had just happened. She\u2019d ruined everything. She was embarrassed and mortified. What must he think of her? She\u2019d all but attacked the man. How could she ever face him again? Maybe she was overreacting. It had just been a few kisses\u2014long, intense, unbelievably arousing kisses that all but turned her inside out\u2014but they meant nothing.</p><p>After she calmed down she came up with a plan should she run into him anytime soon. She would behave like an adult. Yes, they had shared an intimate moment, but it was still possible to go back to the way things used to be. He would ignore her, and she would do her best to ignore him.</p><p>Monday Cordie was back at work. She was busy, but Aiden kept popping into her thoughts. As the days progressed, it became easier to push him to the back of her mind. Each night she went through one of the boxes her father had packed when he\u2019d sold his house. She assumed it would be easy to find more information about her mother, thinking that there had to be some papers or photos stashed away in one of the boxes. But she was wrong about that.</p><p>The last three weeks of school were hectic, and the search to learn more about Natalie was put on hold. She made a copy of the horrid letter and took it with her when she met her friends for dinner at the Hamilton Hotel. She had tried to get them to eat somewhere else because she didn\u2019t want to chance running into Aiden, who lived in the penthouse at the top of the hotel. He traveled so much he was rarely there, but still, she didn\u2019t want to risk it.</p><p>Then, during a phone conversation with Sophie, after Cordie had suggested two different restaurants, Sophie mentioned that Jack and Alec were going to be at the hotel playing poker with a couple of the Vice detectives from the Chicago Police Department.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s their monthly poker game,\u201d she said. \u201cJack thinks he has a chance of winning a hand or two since Aiden is still in San Francisco. Whenever Aiden plays, he wins.\u201d</p><p>Cordie relaxed. She was worried she wouldn\u2019t be able to control her reaction to him, and she had decided the only way she could move on with her life was to stay as far away from him as possible. She was more determined than ever not to turn into her father and waste her life hoping for the impossible.</p><p>After a stressful day rushing from one meeting to another, then enduring a frustrating session with the principal of St. Matthew\u2019s, Cordie was ready for a glass of wine.</p><p>Regan had reserved one of the smaller private dining rooms at the Hamilton so they wouldn\u2019t be disturbed. The room was just off the bar, and with the doors closed it was nearly soundproof, a perfect place to share secrets and gossip. They could laugh as loud as they wanted and not worry about bothering other diners. On the other side of the bar, tucked into an alcove, was the door to another dining room, one the men used for poker games. It was isolated from the rest of the hotel but close enough to the bar to get beer and anything else they wanted.</p><p>Cordie was supposed to meet her friends at seven thirty, and she hadn\u2019t had time to go home and change her clothes. Dressed in a cream-colored pencil skirt, a deep-blue silk blouse, and nude high heels, she had looked very businesslike all day in her meetings, but she would have preferred to be wearing something more comfortable when she was with her friends. Her hair was driving her crazy hanging in her face, so she put it up in a ponytail. The long mass swung back and forth as she rushed through the shiny brass revolving doors into the Hamilton.</p><p>Cordie loved the hotel. There was a quiet elegance about the place. It had a contemporary feel with the shiny marble floors and granite pillars, yet the furnishings were old-world. The soothing colors and the comfortable seating areas made guests want to linger. She knew the Hamilton like the back of her hand; she had visited it at least once a week when Regan lived there before she got married.</p><p>Cordie realized she was practically running across the lobby and forced herself to slow down. A man dressed in a business suit and tie tried to engage her in conversation as she entered the bar. She smiled at him and shook her head to his invitation to buy her a drink. She walked past him and opened the door to the dining room but was blocked from going any farther. Aiden was standing just inside the doorway talking to Alec and Jack. He grabbed her by the shoulders to stop her from rolling over him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t happy to see him and said the first thought that came into her mind. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in San Francisco?\u201d Her tone was accusatory, which she realized wouldn\u2019t make a lick of sense to him. Before he could ask her what was wrong with her, she blurted, \u201cAre you playing poker tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I thought I would.\u201d Aiden smiled then because he heard Jack groan. Glancing at him, he said, \u201cRelax, MacAlister. You might win a hand. You never know. Miracles do happen.\u201d</p><p>Cordie was distracted by his wonderful smile. It was so sexy. He was such a beautiful man. His eyes turned warm and tender when he was happy. Smiling was a rarity to him, though. He was usually very serious about everything, especially when he was working on his next hotel deal. There was no question Aiden was a workaholic, yet somehow he made a bit of time for rugby, poker, and women . . . skinny blond women.</p><p>That reminder helped her get her head back together. Aiden still had hold of her. Wanting to distance herself from him, she gently pushed his hands away, took a step back, and then walked around him to get to the table. She noticed Alec was watching her, his expression puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWhat has you frowning, Alec?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot frowning,\u201d he countered. \u201cJust observing.\u201d</p><p>Regan pulled out a chair for her. \u201cSit. We have lots to talk about.\u201d</p><p>Sophie sat across from Cordie at the small round table. \u201cIt\u2019s all good news,\u201d she said. \u201cExcept for Jack.\u201d She looked up at her husband and smiled. \u201cHe hates Chicago winters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Cordie prodded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re staying in Chicago. That\u2019s where the Bureau wants him. He and Alec were both promoted and will continue to work together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere in Chicago,\u201d Regan supplied. \u201cThey\u2019re both assigned here indefinitely. No more back-and-forth to Boston for Alec and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cBut what about your town house in Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Alec\u2019s brother Nick still owns it,\u201d Regan said. \u201cAlec didn\u2019t do the paperwork. Neither one of us has had time, and Nick wasn\u2019t in any hurry. He\u2019s going to put it on the market next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that town house,\u201d Cordie said. She had stayed there a couple of times with Regan when Alec was out on assignment. The town house had been completely remodeled and was located in a coveted neighborhood. She loved Boston, too, almost as much as she loved her hometown.</p><p>\u201cFor a while we thought Alec\u2019s brother Michael might buy it, but he decided not to. I\u2019m not sure why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s based in San Diego,\u201d Alec said. \u201cAnd these days he rarely gets back to Boston. The town house would sit empty for months at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when he leaves the Navy SEALs . . . ,\u201d Regan began.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he plans to leave anytime soon, sweetheart,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cCordelia?\u201d Aiden called her name, then walked up behind her and put his hands on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>He tugged on her ponytail. She reached up to swat his hand away.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. His hands were still on her shoulders, but his attention had moved on. \u201cAre we going to play poker or not?\u201d After asking the question, he squeezed Cordie\u2019s shoulders, then turned and walked out of the room. His attitude toward her was so casual; apparently he\u2019d forgotten all about kissing her. She wished she could do the same.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m playing,\u201d Jack said. He rounded the table and bent down to kiss Sophie. Alec also kissed his wife, then whispered something that made her laugh.</p><p>Cordie watched the two couples, and for the first time since both of her friends had married, she felt like a fifth wheel. What had happened to her self-confidence? It seemed to have vanished. Since her father\u2019s death she\u2019d been on autopilot, but now the numbness was wearing off and she was beginning to feel again. There was so much to process and try to understand. Terrified that she was heading down the same desolate road her father had chosen, she was questioning everything about her life and the choices she had made. She didn\u2019t know where she belonged anymore. Her life seemed so empty now. Was she just feeling sorry for herself? Maybe, she decided. She\u2019d admit she was a bit depressed, but who wouldn\u2019t be after reading those heartbreaking letters her father had written to her mother begging her to come back to him?</p><p>A waiter appeared to take their drink orders. Cordie had thought she would drink wine, and a lot of it, but now that she was with her friends and starting to relax, she decided she wanted iced tea. Sophie and Regan ordered the same thing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re such sophisticated drinkers,\u201d Regan said with a laugh. \u201cWe should have ordered champagne to celebrate the fact that we\u2019re all going to stay in Chicago. For a while there I thought Jack and Sophie were going to be transferred to Phoenix, and Alec and I were going to be transferred to Boston permanently, but it all worked out. All of us will be together in the city we love. Even Aiden and Spencer will be home more often.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAiden and Spencer?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cSpencer told me, once Aiden gets the hotel in Florida up and running, he plans to cut way back on travel. In the past year he\u2019s flown all over the world, to Hong Kong, Paris, London, Melbourne, and Sydney, and all over the United States. I hope he\u2019ll slow down, but I won\u2019t believe it until I see it. He practically lives on the Gulfstream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Gulfstream is a beautiful jet,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cThe bedroom\u2019s nicer than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Aiden still staying on the top floor of the hotel when he\u2019s in town?\u201d Sophie asked. \u201cIf he\u2019s around more, maybe he\u2019ll buy a place of his own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s doubtful,\u201d Regan answered. \u201cThe penthouse seems to work for him. Aiden really hates clutter, and the penthouse is sleek, clutter-free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful but sterile,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cVery impersonal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand the appeal. I live in a clutter-free environment,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>Regan and Sophie laughed. \u201cMaybe in your dreams,\u201d Regan said. \u201cYou\u2019re always surrounded by clutter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at work,\u201d Cordie insisted. \u201cChemistry is a precise science, and if I weren\u2019t organized in the lab, it would be a disaster. It\u2019s just that, when I\u2019m home, I want to relax. Besides, the clutter is mostly books,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd scarves and shoes and keys and\u2014\u201d Sophie added.</p><p>Cordie interrupted. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that bad,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we weren\u2019t talking about me. You were catching us up on your brothers. What\u2019s going on with Spencer? Is he going to stay in Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d Regan answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd Walker?\u201d Sophie asked. \u201cI know he\u2019s still racing cars all over Europe, but when he retires, will he come back to Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a whole other story,\u201d Regan said. \u201cAnd not a happy one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Cordie asked.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to Spencer, our brother Walker still hasn\u2019t grown up. I agree with him,\u201d she said. \u201cWalker is seven years older than I am, but he still acts like an impulsive teenager. There are two lawsuits against him, both involving women he jilted. The women\u2019s lawyers are trying to get their greedy fingers on the hotels. It won\u2019t happen,\u201d she rushed to add. \u201cStill, it\u2019s a worry Aiden doesn\u2019t need. He just settled another suit for Walker, and we had to pay quite a lot of money. Even though it was ruled an accident, Walker was responsible. There weren\u2019t any life-threatening injuries, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before something catastrophic happens. I wish Walker would figure out his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could figure out mine.\u201d Cordie didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d said the thought out loud until Sophie asked her to explain what she meant. She was saved from having to answer when the waiter interrupted to take their dinner orders. Because they had dined at the hotel so many times, they didn\u2019t have to look at the menu. Sophie and Regan ordered a Caesar salad with chicken, and Cordie was in the mood for salmon.</p><p>She waited until the waiter left the room and then said, \u201cNatalie Kane, my mother\u2014though calling her \u2018mother\u2019 gives me the willies\u2014left my father a farewell letter.\u201d Her voice was filled with sadness as she added, \u201cHe kept it all these years. He wrote several letters to her, too, but they were all returned unopened. Those letters were in the lockbox along with the marriage certificate and divorce decree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you open your dad\u2019s letters and read them?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. He left them, so he must have wanted me to read them. They were heartrending pleas for her to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say in her farewell letter? Did she give a reason why she was leaving him?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd Cordie,\u201d Regan reminded her. \u201cShe left her baby, too.\u201d</p><p>Cordie reached under the table for her purse and set it on her lap as she fished out a folded piece of paper. \u201cI made a copy of her letter because I knew you both would want to read it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about your father\u2019s letters?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>Cordie shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to read them.\u201d</p><p>Sophie understood. \u201cYou think it might color our opinion of your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel sorry for him. I want you to remember him as a strong, loving father. Natalie was his weakness. Too late he realized he\u2019d thrown his life away waiting for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did he send these letters?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>\u201cThe address on the envelopes was a post office box here in Chicago. He must have thought they would be sent on to her. Maybe that\u2019s what she told him.\u201d</p><p>Sophie read the letter first, and by the time she\u2019d finished, her cheeks were bright pink. She was irate on Cordie\u2019s behalf. \u201cShe\u2019s going to pretend the marriage never happened and start over? Who does that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently Natalie Kane does,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>Regan finished reading the letter and handed it to Cordie, but before she could put it back in her purse, Regan grabbed it again and reread it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe \u2018You can have her.\u2019 Shame on her. What kind of a mother . . .\u201d She was sputtering and couldn\u2019t finish her thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t stay around to raise you, Cordie. After reading this letter I have to say that Natalie Kane is a cold, unfeeling bitch.\u201d</p><p>Regan agreed. \u201cIf she was going through some kind of mental issue, she had years to get her head straight and come back to her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t have mental issues. She just didn\u2019t like being poor or being married to a mechanic. Remember what she wrote? If her family knew, they\u2019d disown her.\u201d</p><p>They continued to discuss the letter and Natalie\u2019s motives all through dinner, though Cordie didn\u2019t eat much because the topic made her stomach queasy.</p><p>\u201cHow does a mother walk away from her baby?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how she would feel if she knew your father left millions of dollars. From a humble mechanic to the owner of thousands of auto shops,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>\u201cMoney wasn\u2019t important to my father, but getting Natalie back was all that mattered. That\u2019s why he became so driven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though he was worth a huge fortune, he lived like an ordinary man,\u201d Regan said.</p><p>\u201cOn his deathbed he warned me not to follow in his footsteps. I guess he finally realized all the years he wasted pining away for her.\u201d She sighed then and said, \u201cHe taught me a lesson. I don\u2019t want to chase a dream anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wasting another minute on any man.\u201d</p><p>Sophie frowned. \u201cWhen have you wasted a minute on a man? Men chase you, Cordie. It\u2019s not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind. I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to find her.\u201d Cordie made the announcement and waited for a reaction.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Regan asked. \u201cWhat do you hope to gain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know how her life turned out. Did she find what she was looking for? Did the end justify the means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe broke your father\u2019s heart,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cI hope she\u2019s miserable. And poor,\u201d she added with a nod. \u201cI really hope she\u2019s poor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you find her, will you walk up to her and introduce yourself?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>Cordie pushed her chair back and stood. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to meet her. I just want to see her with her family. I have no desire to interact with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen hire an investigator to find her and get the information you want,\u201d Sophie suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo, I have to go,\u201d she said, and before Sophie could continue to argue, she asked, \u201cWhose turn is it to pay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d Regan said. \u201cAnd I already took care of the bill, including gratuity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it was your turn?\u201d Cordie asked. \u201cI seem to remember\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to find your mother,\u201d Sophie blurted.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me to before you read the letter, and don\u2019t call her my mother. She left when I was a baby. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be called that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worry you\u2019ll get hurt, Cordie. You just lost your father. You don\u2019t need any more pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to do this, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Regan could detect an argument brewing and decided to deflect her friends\u2019 attention. \u201cIs that a new blouse, Cordie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just haven\u2019t worn it in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I forgot to ask, how did your meeting with Sister Delores go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot well at all. She likes to have her way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why she\u2019s the principal,\u201d Regan said. \u201cShe has to be tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her a long while ago that I wouldn\u2019t be signing a new contract, but she\u2019s determined to get me to change my mind. I\u2019m not going to, though. I want to take some time off from teaching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a wonderful teacher. The boys love you,\u201d Regan protested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m determined to make some changes in my life,\u201d Cordie explained.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of changes?\u201d Sophie asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet . . . just something . . . different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cWe all ate healthy dinners, so let\u2019s go in the bar, order cold beer and potato chips, and Regan and I will help you figure out what you want to change.\u201d</p><p>Cordie followed Sophie out the door. \u201cSince when do you drink beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I married Jack. I\u2019m taking on all his bad habits.\u201d</p><p>Cordie laughed. \u201cBeer and chips. Best dessert ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to go to the bar?\u201d Regan asked. \u201cIf the guys from Vice are in there, they won\u2019t leave Cordie alone. Both Woods and Zahner are smitten. Alec told me they think she looks like a sexy movie star.\u201d</p><p>The hotel bar was filled with businessmen. There wasn\u2019t a single woman in sight. Every eye was on the three of them as they made their way around the tables to get to the far side of the long mahogany bar. It was like walking a gauntlet of admiring stares, Cordie thought, but she didn\u2019t mind. By the time she got to the end of the bar, her self-esteem had gotten quite a boost.</p><p>She could hear laughter coming from the poker room next to them. The door opened and Detective Zahner walked out carrying an empty bowl. To say he was scary looking was an understatement. He was the kind of man who made most intelligent people nervous and ready to bolt. He was big and muscular like a professional wrestler, and both his arms and neck were covered in faded tattoos. His hair was long and in desperate need of a comb, but it was the look in his eyes when he was angry that scared the bejesus out of his targets. The only man who rivaled Zahner in terror tactics was Regan\u2019s husband, Alec, when he worked undercover. To Cordie, however, Zahner was a big teddy bear. He spotted her leaning against the bar and headed toward her, his wide grin making him appear a bit maniacal.</p><p>After kissing Sophie and Regan on the cheek, he turned his full attention to Cordie. He kissed her on her cheek before wrapping her in a bear hug.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to realize how good we\u2019d be together?\u201d he asked, his voice crooning like a seventies blues singer\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to ruin what we have,\u201d she told him, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re a tease, Zahner.\u201d</p><p>He pressed in on her, leaned down, and whispered, \u201cLet me take you home and show you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Get off her, Zahner.\u201d Aiden gave the order from the doorway. He strode over, fully intending to pull Zahner away from Cordelia, but the detective was in the mood to cooperate. He stepped back, winked at her, then frowned at Aiden.</p><p>Aiden wasn\u2019t through acting possessive. \u201cCordelia, don\u2019t encourage him,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Regan and Sophie were looking at Aiden as though they thought he\u2019d lost his mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>Aiden didn\u2019t answer. To be honest, he didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d gotten so angry when he\u2019d seen Zahner draped all over Cordelia. Maybe he was being more protective of her because she was so vulnerable since her father\u2019s death. She was all alone and needed someone to watch over her. Kissing her had absolutely nothing to do with his reaction. That\u2019s what he told himself, anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a jealous husband,\u201d Zahner remarked.</p><p>Ignoring the comment, Aiden said, \u201cAre you playing the next hand, or are you out of money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m playing,\u201d Zahner replied. \u201cMy luck\u2019s bound to change. I figure I\u2019m due for a win.\u201d He grabbed the bowl the bartender had refilled with cashews, turned to Cordie, said, \u201cSee you later, sweetheart,\u201d and strolled back into the poker room. Aiden followed and pulled the door closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Sophie asked. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say Aiden was jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Regan said. \u201cIt\u2019s just Aiden being Aiden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never going to change,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cWho wants to go to the ladies\u2019 room?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>Regan raised her hand. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, I\u2019ll order the beers,\u201d Cordie offered.</p><p>The second her friends were out of sight, Cordie sat down on a barstool and reached for her phone. She texted Alec and asked him for his brother Nick\u2019s cell phone number. She could have gotten the number from Regan, but that would have led to twenty questions, and Cordie wasn\u2019t ready to explain her plans for her future just yet.</p><p>The following morning she called Nick, negotiated the price, and purchased his town house in Boston.</p><p>SIX</p><p>Congressman Mitchell Ray Chambers\u2019s poll numbers were abysmal, and it was all Aiden Madison\u2019s fault. If he\u2019d played ball and given the congressman what he wanted for the land, a Hamilton Hotel would be in the district\u2019s future, but Madison got all bent out of shape because the congressman had given his word and then broken it. It was such a ridiculously stupid reason to walk away from a multimillion-dollar venture.</p><p>It was obvious that Spencer Madison was the one who really wanted the hotel. He was only following his brother\u2019s lead when he walked out of the meeting, and Chambers was convinced that once Aiden was out of the picture, Spencer would be willing to negotiate and move forward on the project. It really was prime property, after all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The hotel wouldn\u2019t have been important to the congressman if it weren\u2019t for the fact that the mayor of Fallsborough had gone after the Madisons and boasted to everyone in the district that the hotel would bring jobs and money. She\u2019d also told them that their congressman, Chambers, had blown the deal and with it all their hopes and dreams for a better tomorrow. In public the mayor may have acted all distraught about the lost deal, but since she planned to run against him in the next primary, she privately had to be jumping for joy at the windfall that had just come her way.</p><p>Although he gave it his best shot, he couldn\u2019t put a positive spin on what had happened. The only solution he could come up with to charm the voters back into his pocket was to find a way around Aiden Madison.</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>Cordie called Sophie and Regan and asked them to meet her at the Palms for lunch. She explained that she had something important to tell them.</p> <p>Cordie was early, Regan was on time, and Sophie was fifteen minutes late as usual. Cordie had asked for a booth near the back so they would have a little privacy. The three friends met often at this restaurant, one of their favorites, especially when there was news to share. They knew the waitstaff by name and didn\u2019t need to place their drink orders after they were seated. Adam, their waiter, immediately appeared with three iced teas and recited the specials. They all agreed on a spinach salad with chicken, strawberries, and feta.</p><p>The moment Adam stepped away, Sophie turned to Cordie. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look beat. Aren\u2019t you sleeping?\u201d Regan asked, her concern evident in her expression.</p><p>\u201cI was up most of the night on the Internet doing research,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cI\u2019ll explain why in a minute.\u201d She was suddenly feeling tongue-tied as she stared across the table at the two dearest friends she could ever have.</p><p>\u201cTell us what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cYou\u2019re worrying me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRegan, have you talked to your brother-in-law today?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cWhich brother-in-law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called him and bought his town house. I\u2019m going to move to Boston.\u201d</p><p>There were at least twenty seconds of stunned silence, then an explosion of emotion.</p> <p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Sophie came close to shouting. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave Chicago. We\u2019re all staying here, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you and your husbands are staying here. I need a change,\u201d Cordie explained. \u201cI need to shake up my life . . . try new things . . . take risks . . . and move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love Chicago,\u201d Regan reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I love Boston, too.\u201d</p><p>Regan became teary-eyed. \u201cNo, this is wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter the death of a loved one, you shouldn\u2019t be making any rash decisions for at least a year. I read that somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that might apply to widows,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t a rash decision. I\u2019ve always loved your brother-in-law\u2019s town house, and I\u2019m ready for a change.\u201d</p><p>A long minute passed. Regan was digging through her purse looking for a tissue.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t cry,\u201d Cordie begged.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying not to,\u201d Regan said. \u201cWhy not mull this over for a couple of months? Then decide on any changes.\u201d</p><p>Cordie shook her head. \u201cI need your support on this. Boston isn\u2019t that far away. It\u2019s a direct flight. You can come see me all the time.\u201d</p><p>Sophie and Regan continued to argue with her for another fifteen minutes. When they finally realized their protests were getting nowhere, they relented. \u201cI know you love Boston,\u201d Regan said. \u201cBut what will you do for work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike she has to work. She\u2019s a multi-multimillionaire,\u201d Sophie reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do need to work,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cI\u2019m going to put some feelers out. I\u2019ll find something I like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeaching again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe . . . or maybe something different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlec\u2019s family will help you get settled and introduce you to people. You won\u2019t be all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your brownstone here?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just finished renovating it, and selling it makes it all seem so final,\u201d Regan said.</p><p>Searching for any argument she could think of, Sophie rushed out, \u201cWhat if you move and then realize you\u2019ve made a mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll move back,\u201d Cordie said, trying to sound cheerful even though the conversation was depressing her. What if she was making a mistake? What then? She couldn\u2019t come back to Chicago. \u201cI love Nick\u2019s town house, and I love Boston. And both of you will come often, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course we will,\u201d Regan promised. A tear slipped down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhen is this going to happen?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cIn a couple of months,\u201d Cordie explained. \u201cDepending on the work that needs to be done. I\u2019m going to make a few minor changes and paint all the rooms. Maybe even refinish the hardwood floors. Nick thinks I should. I\u2019m going to fly out next weekend and sign all the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to stay at the Boston Hamilton?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Nick and Laurant insisted I stay with them. It will be fun to see their kids.\u201d</p><p>Cordie and Sophie knew all of Alec\u2019s family and kept in touch with his five brothers and two sisters through Facebook. Alec\u2019s parents, who lived on Nathan\u2019s Bay, an island accessible by bridge north of Boston, were warm, hospitable people and always insisted that Cordie come for a visit when she was in the area. Cordie imagined she\u2019d spend a lot of time on the island next summer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d she said. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>She was doing her very best to sound enthused. She should be excited about the future, shouldn\u2019t she? It was a brand-new beginning. Why, then, did she want to cry?</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The next two weeks were crazy busy. Cordie flew to Boston, loaded down with presents for Nick and Laurant\u2019s two young children, and ended up spending three nights with the family while all the papers were being prepared. She paid cash for the town house by simply transferring funds, and she didn\u2019t feel quite as nervous about the move once she went through the house because she remembered why she loved it so much. All the wonderful architectural details gave the place a classic timelessness, which was exactly what appealed to her. By the time she left Boston she was convinced she would be happy in her new home.</p><p>Once back in Chicago she tackled the task of getting her house ready to sell. She finished going through all her father\u2019s boxes, and when she was done, she was all the more frustrated because she couldn\u2019t find any information about Natalie, especially since her father had been such a pack rat. He had kept all of Cordie\u2019s grade school and high school papers and art projects in three boxes labeled Keepsakes, and she knew that if he kept every single one of her drawings and test papers, he certainly would have kept mementos of his marriage. And where were all the photos? Surely he would have kept those in a safe place, but where? Was there another safe-deposit box at the bank, or did the law firm that managed her father\u2019s affairs have a folder with her dad\u2019s personal items? Doubtful, but she would still ask.</p><p>Monday morning she called her father\u2019s lawyer, Jared, at his law firm and asked him for his help locating information about Natalie Kane, formerly Natalie Smith.</p><p>Jared was happy to hear from her. \u201cThis firm didn\u2019t start representing your father until he opened his first automotive repair shop. That being said, I\u2019ll be happy to go through the files and see what I can find. Are you looking for anything in particular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just anything and everything having to do with her. I can\u2019t find any photos or mementos, and I know there have to be some . . . somewhere. I thought maybe he had the firm hold on to them . . . maybe when he moved into the house from the apartment,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be surprised if you find anything, but I\u2019d appreciate it if you would look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s anything here. She died before your father hired the firm. Isn\u2019t that right? And you were just a baby back then.\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t know the truth about her mother, but then why would he? Her father had kept the secret until his deathbed. Cordie decided she didn\u2019t want to explain. Let him continue to think that Natalie had died years ago.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see what I can find.\u201d</p><p>They chatted a bit longer, and by the end of the call Jared had talked her into going to dinner with him that evening. He picked her up at seven thirty, and they drove to an Italian bistro a few blocks from her house. As they sat at a table with a red-checkered tablecloth sipping glasses of rich red wine, Cordie was relieved that Jared kept the conversation light and relaxed, but by the time the dinner was over and they were waiting for the check, Jared\u2019s demeanor changed. He looked very serious when she told him about her upcoming move to Boston, and he cautioned her against making any more decisions in her current state of mind.</p><p>\u201cExactly what is my current state of mind?\u201d she asked, trying not to take offense.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in mourning,\u201d he reminded her. He reached across the table and took hold of her hand. \u201cWait to put your home on the market. Don\u2019t do anything that can\u2019t be reversed. You could wake up one morning and realize you\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Sophie and Regan had given her the same argument. Like Jared, they didn\u2019t know the real reason she wanted to leave Chicago, and she wasn\u2019t about to tell them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sweet that you\u2019re worrying about me, but moving to Boston is something I really want to do. I think I\u2019ll be okay there,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll come see you in Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>She meant what she said. She really did like Jared. Although she knew he would disagree, there just wasn\u2019t any chemistry between them now, but who knew what the future held? Could something like that grow from friendship?</p><p>Later he walked her to her door and kissed her good night. He didn\u2019t press to come inside, and she was thankful she didn\u2019t have to say no. As old-fashioned as it made her, she didn\u2019t sleep around. When infatuated with one man, it was impossible to substitute another. At least for her, anyway. Once she was settled in Boston, she would be able to get Aiden out of her head, and then she would change pretty much everything else about her life. She didn\u2019t plan to become promiscuous\u2014that thought made her smile\u2014just not so reserved. It was getting easier to pretend nothing had happened with Aiden. Obviously their kiss hadn\u2019t meant anything to him, and that helped her put it all in perspective. Still, until her move to Boston, she would do her best to avoid him.</p><p>The next week was spent painting bedrooms and closets and thinning out clothes and clutter to get the house ready to put on the market. By Sunday evening all the bedrooms had been turned into showrooms that could grace any home magazine cover.</p><p>Jared called to tell her he hadn\u2019t been able to find anything in the firm\u2019s records relating to Natalie Kane or Smith. Cordie had known it was a long shot but was still a little disappointed.</p><p>She had donated all her father\u2019s clothes, and of all the boxes he had brought with him to her house, there were only three left, the ones that had Keepsakes printed across the tops in black Magic Marker. She had sifted through the contents once already, but feeling nostalgic, she decided to go through them again. She sat on the floor and lifted the lid on the first box. Her father had saved nearly every paper she\u2019d brought home and had everything organized in folders labeled by grade. She laughed as she looked at some of her art projects. Nearly every one of them had something to do with cars.</p><p>In the second box, nestled between the sixth- and seventh-grade folders, was a plain white legal-size envelope. It was stuck to the back of the sixth-grade folder. The first time she\u2019d gone through the boxes she\u2019d flipped through the folders assuming everything in them was her schoolwork. She hadn\u2019t bothered to pull out any of the papers.</p><p>She opened the large envelope and emptied the contents onto the floor. And there they were. Not many mementos, but a few. A faded black-and-white photo of the first Kane Automotive Shop, and another photo of her father\u2019s truck with Kane Automotive painted on the side. She thought it must have been his first truck. There was one other photograph of a stretch of beach and a beautiful sunset on the water. In the distance she could see several people standing on the beach, but they were all turned away from the camera, looking at the horizon. Next she found two flyers for art exhibits, a couple of ticket stubs for a rock concert, and a wedding invitation without an envelope. Hillary Swanson was marrying Jonathan Black at the First Presbyterian Church on Second Street. The wedding date was exactly six months before Natalie married Cordie\u2019s father in Las Vegas. Under the invitation was a birthday card. It was signed, Love, Natalie. A pang of sorrow stabbed at her heart, imagining her father\u2019s happiness at receiving the card, unaware of the insincerity . . . or the grief that was coming. There was a smaller envelope. She opened it, and inside she found a flyer from Las Vegas with a picture of the Forever Wedding Chapel, where she assumed her father and Natalie had gotten married, a matchbook from a Vegas restaurant, a chip from a casino, and a small square of tissue paper. She unfolded the tissue and revealed a simple gold wedding band.</p><p>That was it? This was all her father had saved from his marriage? There wasn\u2019t a single photo of Natalie. Had he not taken any, or had he destroyed them in a fit of anger? Reading the farewell letter would have done it, she thought.</p><p>Now wasn\u2019t the time to delve into her father\u2019s motives, she decided.</p><p>She had enough information to call in the big guns to pinpoint Natalie\u2019s exact location. Alec and Jack would do anything for her, and she didn\u2019t think it would take them any time at all to get Natalie\u2019s address.</p><p>She lured them over to her house with pizza and beer. Their wives came with them, of course, and while Regan and Sophie made salads, Cordie let Alec and Jack read the letter her mother had left for her father. She shouldn\u2019t have been embarrassed, but she was, and she couldn\u2019t understand why. You can have her. Maybe that was why. Maybe being tossed aside as though she had absolutely no value to her mother was the reason.</p><p>The doorbell rang, and she went to collect the pizzas from the deliveryman, thankful to have an excuse to leave the room. When she returned, they had finished reading, but neither Jack nor Alec commented on the letter. They followed her to the kitchen, where she put the pizzas on the table and quickly got out of the way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cYou should eat the salad first.\u201d</p><p>Jack just smiled at her and took a large wedge of pizza. Alec dragged out a chair and sat across from him. He pulled the pizza box toward him and reached for a slice. Cordie handed them each a beer and distributed napkins as though she was dealing cards.</p><p>\u201cSo here\u2019s what I know,\u201d she began. \u201cHer full name was Natalie Ann Smith. She was born in Sydney, Australia, and I assume she went back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other information do you have on her?\u201d Jack asked.</p> <p>She handed him copies she had made of her father\u2019s marriage certificate, the divorce decree, the flyer from the Las Vegas chapel, and the Swanson-and-Black wedding invitation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all there is,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cTell me where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can check government records, and how about we track down Hillary and Jonathan Black?\u201d Jack suggested. \u201cWe have the date they were married, and it\u2019s public record . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could have moved away,\u201d Sophie warned.</p><p>Jack smiled at his wife. \u201cWe\u2019ll find them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the invitation might have been for Cordie\u2019s dad before he met Natalie Smith,\u201d Regan said. \u201cThey might not even know Natalie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordie won\u2019t know until she talks to them,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been on the Internet,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cI pulled up the phone directory for Sydney. Do you have any idea how many Smiths are listed? It\u2019ll take me a year to go through all of them,\u201d she exaggerated.</p><p>\u201cI know a guy,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cAustralia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big place. Where exactly in Australia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerth . . . or maybe Sydney,\u201d Alec answered. \u201cHe moves around a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterpol?\u201d Jack guessed.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. He\u2019s based out of London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam Scott,\u201d he answered. \u201cI did a favor for him a couple of years ago. He\u2019ll help Cordie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of us will call you tomorrow with the information on the Blacks,\u201d Jack told her.</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>They came through just the way she knew they would. Alec called her at nine fifteen the following morning with the address and phone number for the Blacks. Cordie thought about calling first to set up the meeting but decided face-to-face without any warning would be better. Fortunately she wouldn\u2019t have to drive far. They lived in a suburb just north of the city.</p><p>It was a beautiful sunny morning for a drive. And hot. She wore a short white skirt and navy blouse with sandals, but she had her workout clothes in her gym bag in the trunk of her car for her kickboxing class. Regan had signed up both of them for the class, insisting Cordie would love the exercise once she got into it. It was offered twice a week. They normally went on Saturday, but because of a conflict they were going today instead.</p><p>The Blacks lived in an older neighborhood of cookie-cutter ranch houses. She found their house number stenciled on the curb and pulled into the narrow driveway. A dog barked when she rang the bell, and she stepped back and waited. A moment later a woman with curly gray hair opened the door. When she saw Cordie, her hand flew to her throat and she gasped. \u201cOh my God, you have to be her daughter. You\u2019re the spitting image. I swear you\u2019re identical. You could be her twin if she were twenty years younger,\u201d she stammered.</p><p>\u201cI look like Natalie?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>The woman looked confused. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Cordie shook her head and smiled. \u201cI think we should start over. Are you Hillary Black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know who you are. You\u2019re Simone Taylor\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>Cordie was fit to be tied.</p><p>\u201cIt was all a lie, a big, fat, horrible lie,\u201d she ranted as she paced around Regan\u2019s office. \u201cThere is no Natalie Smith. Never was. It was just the name on a fake driver\u2019s license she bought from Hillary for twenty-five dollars so she could go into bars and drink. That\u2019s how they met. Hillary had a nice little sideline going while she was in college. She printed counterfeit driver\u2019s licenses for extra money. Lovely, right?\u201d Hands on hips, she turned to Regan. \u201cHillary bragged that she was really good at it, too; said it was difficult to tell the difference between the fake and real licenses.\u201d</p><p>She paused to take a breath and then continued. \u201cAccording to Hillary\u2014and God only knows if she\u2019s telling the truth or not\u2014Natalie\u2019s real name is Simone. Simone Taylor. Want to hear something else? Simone was nineteen years old when Hillary met her, and wild, really wild. Men were crazy about her, Hillary told me.\u201d</p><p>The pacing started again. Regan sat at her desk watching her friend and waiting for an opportunity to ask questions. She had never seen Cordie so upset, so out of control. Her friend\u2019s cheeks were flushed, and she was sputtering.</p><p>\u201cDid you ask Hillary if she knew your father?\u201d She pushed her chair back and stood.</p><p>\u201cYes and no,\u201d Cordie answered. \u201cI asked her if she had ever met Andrew Kane, but I didn\u2019t tell her he was my father. She said no, she had never met him. You know what was really odd? She never asked my name. I tried to introduce myself, but she interrupted to tell a story about Simone. She talked so fast I could barely keep up. Oh, and she said she could tell by looking at me that my mother had married well. How strange was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have hundred-dollar bills pinned to your shirt again?\u201d Alec asked the question as he walked into the office.</p><p>Cordie knew she needed to take a second to calm down and collect her thoughts. She tugged the scarf from her neck, haphazardly folded it, and tossed it on the desk. It slid to the floor, but she didn\u2019t notice. Her sunglasses were on top of her head. She pulled them off and dropped them into her purse, which was perched precariously on the edge of a chair. When she glanced through the double French doors of Regan\u2019s office, she noticed Aiden in the outer room. He was leaning against the reception desk with one ankle crossed over the other, and he had his phone to his ear. His frown indicated he wasn\u2019t pleased with what he was hearing. His side of the conversation was short and not very cordial. She heard him emphatically say, \u201cNo,\u201d and nothing else. By the time he finished the call he looked as though he wanted to throw the phone across the room. Turning to the desk, he picked up a stack of papers, walked into Regan\u2019s office, and dropped them in front of her.</p><p>He seemed preoccupied when he said, \u201cHere are the forms you wanted. They need to be filled out, signed, and sent over to the accountants as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is as soon as possible with you,\u201d Regan said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of something,\u201d she added. \u201cWe were talking about Cordie\u2019s mother . . . I mean the mother who gave birth . . .\u201d She was making a muddle of explaining.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all caught up,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, he\u2019s caught up?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>Alec went to the desk, sat, and turned on the computer. \u201cRemember I called you on your cell right after you left the Blacks\u2019 house?\u201d</p><p>Cordie nodded. \u201cI had just gotten back into my car after my lovely visit with Hillary, who told me all sorts of fun stories about her wild friend, my mother dearest, and I was reeling, so you can imagine my state of mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan told me where you were going,\u201d Alec said. \u201cAnd I was curious to know how it went.\u201d</p><p>Cordie recalled the phone conversation. She had been practically incoherent when she answered, and Alec had to calm her down before she could explain what she had found out. \u201cI was very upset, and I might have raised my voice.\u201d</p><p>Alec laughed. \u201cMight have?\u201d</p><p>Cordie turned to Aiden. \u201cAlec caught you up on my exciting life, then?\u201d</p><p>Aiden picked up her scarf and moved her purse so it wouldn\u2019t fall on the floor. \u201cAlec was in my office when he called you. He had you on speaker.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. \u201cSo you heard every word?\u201d she asked, mortified. She didn\u2019t mind or care that Alec had listened to her tirade. Aiden was another story. She still stupidly cared what he thought. Have to work on that, she told herself. She would add that to her list of feelings she needed to squelch.</p><p>She motioned to Regan. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get to the gym. I need to kick something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re way too early,\u201d Regan argued.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave yet,\u201d Alec said. \u201cI want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>Aiden walked behind the desk and stood next to Alec, looking at the computer screen.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for Simone Taylor, aren\u2019t you? I wouldn\u2019t bother. That name is probably a lie, too, just like Natalie Smith. I spent hours and hours looking for Natalie on the Internet. Is that what you\u2019re doing, Alec?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d he answered as he typed on the keyboard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d</p><p>Alec sat back. He was staring at the screen as he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too sure.\u201d</p><p>Aiden glanced at Cordie, then back at the screen. \u201cWow,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWow, what?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cCome see.\u201d</p><p>She rounded the desk, stepped in front of Aiden, and looked at what had captured their attention. There was a photo, and for a second Cordie thought it was of her. Same eyes, same dark hair . . . same smile . . .</p><p>Alec tilted the screen up so she could get a better look and said, \u201cMeet Simone Taylor.\u201d</p><p>NINE</p><p>Simone was seventeen when this photo was taken. She had just won some beauty pageant,\u201d Alec explained.</p><p>\u201cWas it difficult finding her?\u201d Cordie asked. She couldn\u2019t stop staring at her double on the screen. The resemblance was freaking her out.</p><p>\u201cNot difficult at all,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>Regan leaned over her husband\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBecause you had her real name.\u201d She looked up at Regan and added, \u201cHillary Black was telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>Alec had found other information as well. \u201cSimone\u2019s mother isn\u2019t alive, but her father, Julian Taylor, is. He\u2019s about to retire and his son-in-law is set to take over the family business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the family business?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cMerrick Enterprises,\u201d Alec answered.</p><p>\u201cMerrick Enterprises?\u201d Aiden responded with surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou know them?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably the biggest real estate developers in Australia, not to mention the other businesses they own. I don\u2019t recall meeting the Taylor family, but I\u2019ve attended so many events in Sydney and Melbourne, there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ve run into them.\u201d</p><p>Pointing to the computer screen, Regan said, \u201cThis photo is more than twenty years old. Can you find one that\u2019s more current?\u201d</p><p>Alec turned back to the computer. \u201cNot yet, but I just started searching.\u201d</p><p>Aiden\u2019s phone rang. He checked to see who was calling and clenched his jaw.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to answer that?\u201d Regan asked. \u201cIt could be important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t important. Lester Chambers is calling again. He\u2019s trying to get me to change my mind about buying his property. He called a few minutes ago, and I did something I\u2019m not proud of,\u201d he confessed.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you smiling?\u201d Regan wondered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d Alec asked at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI dumped it all on Spencer.\u201d His phone rang again. Muttering something under his breath, he walked toward the doorway before he answered.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Simone has tried to find photos of you, Cordie?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>Cordie stopped watching Aiden and turned to her friend. \u201cI doubt it. She erased me, remember?\u201d</p><p>Regan nodded. Aiden was obviously a master at multitasking, because he was still on the phone when he asked Cordie for clarification. \u201cHow did she erase you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe decided she didn\u2019t get married and she didn\u2019t have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Aiden said before going back to his phone conversation.</p><p>Why was he lingering? Cordie wondered. He was usually in such a hurry. If she asked him why he was hanging around, the question would come out as rude. He could go anywhere he wanted; it was his hotel. It was next to impossible not to look at him. He was wearing a deep-navy suit and a white shirt that accentuated his tanned complexion. He\u2019d obviously been playing a lot of rugby. He had the muscles to prove it . . . and the bruises. There was a new one on his forehead, small but still noticeable. Rugby could be a brutal game, which was apparently why he liked it so much. No holds barred, no diplomacy, just brute force and strategy. Alec had caught the fever and was now a player on Aiden\u2019s team. They were, of course, undefeated and loved to boast about it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a game today?\u201d she asked when he joined them again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s tomorrow,\u201d Aiden answered. \u201cRegan mentioned you were thinking about going to Australia. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I want to do anymore,\u201d she admitted. \u201cWhen I found out my mother didn\u2019t die, that she just walked out, I had no desire to find her. Then I read the letter she left for my father, and I changed my mind. I didn\u2019t want to speak to her. I just needed to see for myself if she got what she wanted. But now, knowing about the fake ID she used to marry my father and all the lies she told him . . . if I do go, I\u2019ll probably get arrested.\u201d</p><p>Alec\u2019s head came up. \u201cArrested for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssault.\u201d</p><p>Alec laughed. Cordie was one of the gentlest women he had ever known. She could never knowingly cause any other person pain. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about punching Simone?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, then said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I ever come face-to-face with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordie, you couldn\u2019t deliberately hurt anyone, no matter how horrible or sleazy he or she may be,\u201d Regan said.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Alec said, nodding toward the screen. \u201cSimone Taylor Rayburn. Craig Rayburn is Simone\u2019s husband. She was twenty-one and he was thirty-four when they married. They have two sons, and they live in Sydney. Want me to go on?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIs there a family photo?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Alec pulled up a magazine website and scrolled through the pages to find the one he wanted. He leaned back so Cordie could get a closer look. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cordie stared at the happy family smiling back at her from the computer screen and began to shake with anger. She kept thinking about her father and the anguish Simone had put him through. Her reaction to the photo was intense, and\u2014God help her\u2014she really did want to punch the woman.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize she was leaning into Aiden\u2019s side until he put his arm around her. She knew he could feel her trembling and was thankful he didn\u2019t comment on it. Forcing herself to move away from him, she grabbed her purse and said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough for now. Come on, Regan. We should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on a minute,\u201d Alec said. \u201cI went ahead and e-mailed my friend Liam. Let me know when you\u2019re going to Australia, and he\u2019ll meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter,\u201d Cordie protested.</p> <p>\u201cLiam knows his way around Sydney, and he has a lot of contacts. If you were to get into trouble\u2014\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms defiantly. \u201cWhy would I get into trouble?\u201d</p><p>Alec shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just saying. You won\u2019t know anyone there. He can show you around. He\u2019ll be happy to help. Like I said, he owes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden, are you and Spencer going to Sydney or Melbourne anytime soon?\u201d Regan asked. \u201cIf so, Cordie could go on the company jet with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not necessary,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cReally, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt would be fun,\u201d Regan said. \u201cAnd so much nicer than flying commercial. It\u2019s a long trip. You might as well enjoy it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a good time with Liam, too,\u201d Alec said. He stood and stretched. \u201cJust be careful. Women tend to fall under his spell. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFall under his spell? What does that mean?\u201d Aiden asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cLiam likes women, and they like him. He\u2019s gonna love Cordie,\u201d Alec predicted. \u201cCome on, Aiden. Open your eyes and look at her. Really look at her. She\u2019ll be a dream come true for Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordelia has enough to deal with. She doesn\u2019t need some sexually frustrated man hanging all over her.\u201d</p><p>Alec hid his smile. Aiden was so easy to read. Maybe he was finally waking up. Alec just hoped it wasn\u2019t too late. Since her father\u2019s death Cordie had been different, and she was making big changes. Moving to Boston was one. She wanted a new life, and she was leaving Aiden behind.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the gym, Regan. Are you coming or not?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right behind you,\u201d she stammered. She kissed Alec, grabbed her gym bag, and followed.</p><p>They had just reached the French doors when Aiden stopped them. \u201cCordelia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Aiden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your passport up to date?\u201d</p><p>Frowning now, she turned to him. \u201cYes, but I haven\u2019t decided\u2014\u201d</p><p>Aiden wasn\u2019t looking at her. He had pulled out his cell phone and was checking appointments on his calendar. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave tomorrow. Be ready.\u201d</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Arrogance wasn\u2019t Aiden\u2019s greatest sin. Bossiness was. Did he think she was one of his employees he could order about, expecting her to hop to? And why did he believe it was okay for him to get in the middle of her personal problems?</p><p>There was a bigger and even more confusing question to be answered. Why was she meekly going along? Maybe not so meekly, she corrected. In fact, she\u2019d thrown a fit. While Regan held the elevator, Cordie had chased Aiden down the hall and around the corner to his office. She told him she wasn\u2019t ready to go anywhere, and while she appreciated his concern, he really needed to stop worrying about her. She said all this and more to his back, because he didn\u2019t bother to turn around. He just kept walking.</p><p>She\u2019d been emphatic. She\u2019d even poked him in his shoulder while she once again explained she wasn\u2019t going anywhere with him. She might have even raised her voice, which was so unlike her, but she stopped arguing when she followed him into his office and found two strangers waiting for him. Aiden gave her his undivided attention then. He dismissed her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d he said as he put his hands on her shoulders, backed her into the hallway, and shut the door in her face.</p><p>One day. That was all the time Aiden had given her. Since Cordie wasn\u2019t one to make a scene in front of others, she planned to call Aiden later and calmly but strongly decline his invitation to fly to Australia with him. She could be tough on the phone, and she wouldn\u2019t give him time to argue with her. But first she had to come up with a viable reason, because he would ask for an explanation. She was still trying to come up with that good reason when his driver knocked on her door, carried her luggage to the town car, and drove her to the private airport.</p><p>Her stomach was in knots. Getting to fly to Australia in a private jet instead of flying commercial sounded wonderful and a little decadent. The problem was Aiden. If he weren\u2019t going, she could relax and enjoy the experience. She was so tense around him these days, and anxious. She remembered how she used to follow him, so enamored was she, but now she was trying to run away from him. She just wasn\u2019t having much success. Once she was settled in her new home in Boston, everything would change, especially her outlook on life. That was the hope, anyway. Out of sight, out of mind. Oh, how she hoped that could be true.</p><p>She took a deep breath and told herself to enjoy flying in luxury. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Besides, it was all going to work out. She could handle Aiden.</p><p>Her five minutes of bravado were quickly spent. Handle Aiden? Who was she kidding? She had a feeling those words were going to come back to bite her.</p><p>The Hamilton jet was magnificent. She felt as though she was entering a fantasy. It was all so elegant. There were plush leather seats that magically turned into beds with heavenly down comforters, a sofa with a dining area, and behind the spacious bathroom was a private office that connected to a bedroom with a gorgeous custom-built bed to accommodate Aiden\u2019s height.</p><p>Aiden hadn\u2019t arrived yet. Cordie took her seat and pulled out her laptop. Maybe she could find out something about Simone and Craig Rayburn. With less than a day to get ready, she hadn\u2019t had time to do any research. She didn\u2019t even know why she was going. Would she confront Simone? She kept going back and forth. One minute she wanted to, and the next minute she didn\u2019t. If she had to explain why she was going to all this trouble, she couldn\u2019t, unless \u201cBeats me\u201d was a suitable reply.</p><p>She hated being vulnerable. She used to have it all together\u2014at least she thought she did\u2014and now she felt as though her life was spiraling out of control. She\u2019d never thought she would be afraid of change, but right this minute she was feeling like a coward, afraid to go forward and afraid to go back. Tears gathered in her eyes. Oh God, she really missed her father.</p><p>A young man wearing a light gray shirt with navy pants asked her if she would like something to drink before takeoff. His name was Tom and he explained he would be serving dinner later.</p><p>Looking out the window, she saw another black town car driving across the tarmac. Aiden had arrived. She wondered if one of his new blond companions was going to accompany him. She hoped not. She wasn\u2019t jealous, she told herself. She just remembered how obnoxious his last two girlfriends were, and she didn\u2019t want to be stuck trying to be polite for twenty hours.</p><p>Aiden did have strange taste in women, she decided, and she once again reminded herself that she was very lucky she had come to her senses and gotten over her ridiculous infatuation.</p><p>After coming on board, Aiden stood just outside the cockpit talking to the pilots for several minutes and then removed his suit jacket and handed it to the male attendant. Loosening his tie, he walked down the aisle and took the seat next to her. He could have sat in any other seat in the cabin, but apparently he would rather crowd her. Was this just one more of his intimidating tactics to get her to do what he wanted? When he turned toward her, she could see the flecks of gray in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe flight? Or Australia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not ready.\u201d</p><p>She closed her laptop in preparation for takeoff. Aiden took it from her and slipped it into the leather pouch attached to his seat.</p><p>\u201cAustralia is a beautiful country,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve read so much about it. I want to take the time to see as much as I can. How long will you be staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I go home, you\u2019re going with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d She was sure she hadn\u2019t heard him correctly.</p><p>\u201cI think you should go home with me. I don\u2019t want to leave you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m responsible for you.\u201d</p><p>She could feel her face heating up. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Aiden knew he\u2019d pushed the wrong buttons. He decided to try another tack. \u201cI know Sydney. I\u2019ll show you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can show myself around,\u201d she said. She was more bewildered than angry. What was going on inside his head? \u201cAnd if I do need any kind of assistance, I can always call Liam Scott. Alec already talked to him, and he\u2019s . . . Why are you shaking your head at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should call Scott.\u201d</p><p>The set of his jaw told her he was digging in on this issue. She couldn\u2019t for the life of her understand why he was acting so . . . territorial. She was determined to get to the bottom of his problem, whether he was stubborn or not. Something was bugging him, but what?</p><p>\u201cHave you ever met Liam?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have no reason to distrust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I don\u2019t know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why . . .\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t finish her sentence. The jet was gathering a tremendous amount of speed for takeoff. Without thinking what she was doing, she grabbed hold of Aiden\u2019s hand. She was a nervous flyer. Takeoffs and landings scared her, but once the plane was in the air or on the ground she could relax. Being the gentleman he was, Aiden didn\u2019t mention that she was gripping his hand with all her might.</p><p>Aiden watched the color drain from her face and did his best to distract her.</p><p>\u201cI promised Alec and Regan that I would look out for you, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d Before she could protest, he continued, \u201cHave you read the background on the Taylor family? Alec did a lot of research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must not have e-mailed it to you. I\u2019ll send you a copy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your goal is to change the subject, it isn\u2019t working. I\u2019m not helpless, Aiden. I\u2019m perfectly capable of seeing the sights on my own.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her protest. \u201cSimone\u2019s father, Julian Taylor, has enormous wealth and power. He doesn\u2019t just control the business. He controls the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have to behave themselves. From what I\u2019ve read, Julian is a stickler for his rules. It sounds as though he\u2019s wound tight,\u201d he added. \u201cHe nearly disowned Simone when he found out she entered a beauty pageant. According to Alec\u2019s notes, Julian thought her behavior was crass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s back in his good graces now, I take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cUnless or until there\u2019s a scandal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m the scandal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be if you decide to ruffle some feathers.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, leaned back against the headrest, and thought about a plan of action once she landed in Sydney. Indecision was making her crazy. She was on her way to Australia\u2014she was in the air, for Pete\u2019s sake\u2014and she still hadn\u2019t made up her mind if or when she would confront Simone. This was so unlike her, and she began to wonder if others thought of her as weak or wishy-washy. Did Aiden think of her as a weakling? Was that why he was insisting he stay with her while she was in Australia? Did he think she couldn\u2019t make her way across the street without his help? If that was how he really felt, she decided she needed to set him straight.</p><p>Aiden interrupted her thoughts. \u201cCordelia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a strong, independent woman, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>Cordie turned to him, ready for an argument. \u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you\u2019ll be needing to hold my hand for the entire flight or if I could get some work done.\u201d</p><p>TEN</p><p>So much for being independent.</p><p>As soon as Cordie let go of his hand, Aiden disappeared into the bedroom, and when she next saw him he was wearing a light gray T-shirt and sweatpants. The clothes had seen better days and should have been put in the rag pile, yet he looked amazing. Only Aiden could be sexy in sweats, she thought.</p><p>After making sure she had everything she needed, he went into his office to work, but he kept coming into the main cabin to check on her. It was as though he was making certain she was still there. What did he expect? That she might step outside for some fresh air?</p><p>A couple of hours into the flight, when he next looked in on her, she was reading a biochemistry book. It was the latest edition by Frederick Full-of-Himself Fulmer. The author\u2019s massive ego came through in nearly every chapter. He took credit for discovering everything but air. Had she been at home, she would have tossed it into the recycle bin.</p><p>\u201cAre you enjoying your book?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>She decided to tone down her opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit pedantic.\u201d Her hand covered the title of the book, but all he had to do was look over her shoulder and read a sentence or two\u2014which he did\u2014to know what the subject matter was.</p><p>\u201cPedantic, huh?\u201d Smiling, he went back into his office.</p><p>The next time he checked on her she had moved to the sofa with her iPad and was finishing a drawing. He sat beside her, leaned into her, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA schematic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA schematic of what?\u201d</p><p>She was embarrassed to tell him. She felt foolish. \u201cI was trying to design a more efficient fuel-injection system.\u201d She erased the drawing and added, \u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>He was sitting so close she didn\u2019t dare look up at him. She would lose her train of thought if she did, and he would know why. She wished to God she had never kissed him, and the second that thought popped into her head she knew it was a lie. She wanted him to kiss her again. God, he smelled heavenly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, it was all wrong. A relationship with Aiden, no matter how brief, could never go anywhere. They were ill suited to each other. While Mr. Sophisticated was buying land and building beautiful five-star hotels, she was immersed in biochemistry and cars. How much more nerdy could she get?</p><p>He wasn\u2019t perfect by any means. He had more than a few irritating flaws. It was just that he was so incredibly handsome, people\u2014women in particular\u2014tended to overlook them. She didn\u2019t have blinders, though. Aiden could be such an arrogant know-it-all, and he was far more stubborn than she was.</p><p>She knew he regretted touching her, but she doubted he would ever admit it. In that moment when his mouth covered hers and he began to caress her, everything had changed between them. There was a tension now that hadn\u2019t been there before, and it was all her fault. She\u2019d practically attacked him. It was mortifying to acknowledge that she had been the aggressor, and she was amazed she could even look him in the eye now.</p><p>Thank goodness she was over her infatuation with him. Yes, right. Over him. That lie was as thin as Saran Wrap. Her move to Boston couldn\u2019t come soon enough.</p> <p>When he remained next to her, she thought he wanted something. She waited for him to tell her what it was, but then they started their descent into Los Angeles, and she guessed what he was doing. She\u2019d grabbed him during takeoff, letting him know she was freaked, and he must have assumed she didn\u2019t like landings either. He was right, for she grabbed his arm and held on until the wheels hit the runway and glided to a stop.</p><p>It was terribly sweet that he didn\u2019t comment or tease her, which was totally out of character for him. Aiden had many positive attributes, but being sweet wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>Refueling didn\u2019t take any time at all, and within thirty minutes they were back in the air and on their way to Sydney. Aiden stayed beside her reading and pretty much ignoring her until they leveled out at thirty thousand feet and she was able to let go of him. Then he went back into his office to finish a report. At least that\u2019s what he told her. She thought he might be staying at his desk to avoid having to entertain her. As if that were necessary.</p><p>She wished they could go back to the way things used to be, when he barely noticed she existed. She\u2019d certainly ruined any chances of that happening. Just fifteen more hours until touchdown, she thought. Then she would go her way and he would go his.</p><p>It had been a long day. She was tired and stressed, but she didn\u2019t think she would be able to sleep. She washed her face, brushed her teeth, and changed into a pink T-shirt and black yoga pants. Maybe watching a movie would help her relax. Aiden was still at his desk working on his laptop. The door to the bedroom behind him was open, and the sheets on the bed had been turned down. She didn\u2019t want to interrupt him, and so she simply stood in the doorway and waited for him to notice her.</p> <p>Aiden knew she was there, of course. He closed out the file he was working on, leaned back in his swivel chair, and looked at her. His pulse skipped a beat and then began to race. God, she was beautiful. And the most sensual woman he\u2019d ever seen. Her hair wasn\u2019t pulled back into a ponytail now but fell in soft waves past her shoulders. Her face was flushed with color, and even though the T-shirt wasn\u2019t fitted, he could tell she\u2019d removed her bra. He remembered how soft her full br**sts had felt, how perfect. She was so soft everywhere, so damn feminine, and right this minute all he could think about was taking her into his arms. He wanted to finish what they had started, but he knew that was impossible and crazy. This was Cordelia, not one of the women he took out to dinner and then home to his bed. He had known her most of her life, and they had become good friends. She was sweet, smart, funny Cordelia. He had never let himself see her any other way.</p><p>How could he go back to being oblivious? He supposed he\u2019d always thought she was a little sexy\u2014he\u2019d have to be dead not to notice\u2014but he\u2019d never allowed himself to do more than notice. Ignoring her had been easy . . . until he\u2019d taken her into his arms and kissed her. Her mouth was so erotic, her lips so soft . . .</p><p>His voice was gruff when he finally spoke. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t put off by his brisk tone. \u201cI\u2019d like to watch a movie. Are the DVDs in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cAll you have to do is turn the television on and pull up the menu. Come with me. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>She followed him into the bedroom. The remote was on a side table next to the bed. He turned on the television, called up the menu, and handed the remote to her.</p> <p>\u201cYou can watch it in here. Picture\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take your bed. You should get some sleep. It\u2019s a long flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going back to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m going to pull up a list of events in Sydney, important fund-raisers, charity balls, and the like, that Simone Rayburn and her husband will most likely attend.\u201d Shrugging, he added, \u201cI can get a list of those invited.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared into his office but came back a minute later with his laptop. \u201cSydney\u2019s a very cosmopolitan city. There\u2019s always something going on. I\u2019ve got a couple of sources in Sydney looking for me.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the bed, leaned back against the upholstered leather headboard, opened his laptop, and began to type. Cordie wasn\u2019t sure what she should do. She wanted to be casual about it all, to convince herself that there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with being in bed with the man she desperately wanted to get away from.</p><p>Oh, he looked good. His hair was messed, a lock falling down onto his forehead. He impatiently brushed it back and continued to read the message he\u2019d pulled up. He was very relaxed. His long legs stretched out, one ankle over the other. He definitely was comfortable in his own skin. Did he know how handsome he was? His appearance probably wasn\u2019t even relevant to him. She doubted he ever felt self-conscious or insecure. She, on the other hand, was a jumble of nerves. Okay, she decided, she could be casual about this. All she had to do was go back to thinking that Aiden was just her friend\u2019s brother. Nothing more. She would forget all about the way he\u2019d held her and kissed her.</p> <p>Giving herself a lobotomy would be easier.</p><p>\u201cHere are a couple of events.\u201d</p><p>She crawled up the bed to sit next to him. He put his arm around her and pulled her closer, then angled the laptop toward her so she could look over the guest list.</p><p>\u201cThe Rayburns are scheduled to attend the Gallery Ball on the twentieth and a university fund-raiser on the twenty-seventh. They\u2019re both formal events. You choose. Unless . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless what?\u201d she asked. She looked up into his eyes and promptly lost her train of thought. She could stare at him the rest of the night. With his strong jawline and his lean, hard body, he could have been a model. She forced herself to look at the screen.</p><p>\u201cUnless you decide to walk up to their door and introduce yourself,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>A shiver of dread went through her. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you hoping to accomplish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to make sense of it, to understand how she could have done it. How she could have discarded her life with my father. She threw us away.\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment and then said, \u201cI want Simone to know she hasn\u2019t gotten away with her deception, that there are people who know who she was and what she did, that she can\u2019t run away and erase the past. But most of all I want her to know . . .\u201d She paused, finding it difficult to say the words.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t erase me.\u201d She dropped her head back against the headboard and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure how I\u2019ll let her know. The idea of talking to her makes me nauseous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t talk to her. There will be around three hundred people at the Gallery Ball. You could see her there without her knowing.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI could blend in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you could never blend in,\u201d Aiden said, a smile in his voice. He didn\u2019t tell her that every eye would be on her. She could attend wearing jeans and a T-shirt, and she would be the most beautiful woman there. Oh hell, he had it bad tonight. He hadn\u2019t slept in more than twenty-four hours, and that was probably why he was having so much trouble controlling his reaction to her. That and the fact that every time he looked at her he remembered how she\u2019d responded when he\u2019d kissed her, how her scent had aroused him, how she\u2019d tasted, and how she\u2019d felt in his arms. She sure as certain had rattled him.</p><p>There had been a mound of work to get done before he left Chicago. Sydney wasn\u2019t on his schedule for another month, and yet on the spur of the moment he had made the decision to take Cordelia there. He didn\u2019t like the idea of her going by herself. Yes, she was a capable adult and usually levelheaded, but she\u2019d lost her father and had found out some damning information about the woman who had given birth to her. Besides, she would be walking into a hornet\u2019s nest. Simone and Craig Rayburn and Simone\u2019s father, Julian Taylor, were considered upper crust in Sydney society, and Julian abhorred scandal. In all the photos taken of them at various events, he was standing with Simone and Craig, but he was never smiling. He appeared to be a real prick. Aiden realized he was jumping to conclusions, but where Cordelia was concerned, he wasn\u2019t taking any chances. If and when she met the family, he would be by her side. He probably should tell her what he had decided, knowing full well she would argue fiercely, but it wouldn\u2019t matter. He would get his way.</p><p>Alec had enlisted Liam Scott to look out for Cordelia while she was in Sydney. Aiden had done a little research on him, too, and he didn\u2019t like what he\u2019d read. There was very little actual information, but there were photos, and in every one of them Liam had a pretty woman on his arm. He was obviously a player, and that was the last thing Cordelia needed now, someone trying to get her in his bed. Aiden knew he was being extremely territorial. She didn\u2019t have to answer to him. It didn\u2019t matter, though. As long as she was in Australia, she sure as hell did belong to him.</p><p>\u201cHow about the Gallery Ball on the twentieth? I\u2019ll be invited, and you\u2019ll be my guest. What do you think?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. Her head was on his shoulder. He nudged her chin up and then smiled. She was sound asleep. Yawning, he asked softly, \u201cWas I that boring?\u201d</p><p>He put the laptop on the table and eased her down on the bed so that her head could rest on the pillow. He started to pull away, then changed his mind. Reaching up, he turned the light off and pulled her into his side with the top of her head nestled under his chin. He rubbed his jaw against her silky hair. The wonderful fragrance of peach shampoo mingling with her own feminine scent aroused him. It was odd to feel strangely content when he was with her. Too tired to try to figure it out, he wrapped his arms around her and went to sleep.</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>Cordie knew she would like Sydney, but as it turned out, it was love at first sight. She had done quite a lot of reading about the beautiful city and the friendly people who lived there, and she\u2019d seen countless photos of the special attractions. The Sydney Opera House, a performing arts center and one of Australia\u2019s proudest icons, was featured in many of the photos Cordie had seen, and she\u2019d thought it was pretty, especially with the lights at night bringing it to life, but the photos really didn\u2019t do it justice. Seeing it in person, Cordie was in awe. It was magnificent. And so was the Harbour Bridge.</p><p>It was closing in on midnight when they circled the city and landed. A car was waiting to take them to the new Hamilton, which overlooked the harbor. Even though she was determined to avoid Aiden whenever possible, she felt it would be disloyal to stay at any other hotel.</p><p>She had made her reservation for a single room, but when they arrived at the hotel, she wasn\u2019t given a choice. She was about to check in at the desk when Aiden grabbed her hand and pulled her in the opposite direction. As they passed through the lobby, every member of the staff smiled, looking genuinely happy to see their boss, and, from the bell captain to the front-desk clerk to the concierge, Aiden greeted each of them by name. Cordie tried to pull away, but he merely tightened his hold and continued on toward the bank of elevators. Unwilling to make a scene, she decided to wait until they were alone to give him a piece of her mind.</p><p>Yes, Aiden owned the hotel, and yes, he was used to getting his way; however, it didn\u2019t make it right for him to be so high-handed with her. He didn\u2019t ask where she wanted to stay. He pushed the button for the top floor and simply told her she would be sharing the two-bedroom penthouse suite with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with you and top floors?\u201d</p><p>He flashed a smile. \u201cI like being on top.\u201d</p><p>Her mind immediately went to sex, and even though she tried, she couldn\u2019t block the image of Aiden na*ed and sweaty on top of her. She could feel her cheeks warming and bowed her head so he wouldn\u2019t notice.</p><p>The elevator doors opened, and they walked into a wide foyer. The suite was gorgeous. Ahead was a large living room decorated with plush sofas and chairs and fresh flowers on nearly every table. To the side was a spacious dining area with a rectangular table of marble and mahogany and a fully stocked bar behind it. The colors in the suite were rich earth tones: creams and browns and bronzes, with accents of black. It was contemporary and masculine yet refined and elegant. But the real attention-getter was the view. One entire wall was glass from floor to twelve-foot-high ceiling, and beyond was the spectacular Harbour Bridge. Cordie was a bit overwhelmed by it all.</p><p>The bellman carried in her two bags and deposited them in the bedroom on the left. Aiden had only a small carry-on and his briefcase. He went into the bedroom on the right and opened a door that revealed a walk-in closet filled with clothes. He set his bag on a chest of drawers and came out to a desk in his bedroom, where he placed his briefcase.</p><p>Cordie stood outside his door watching him arrange his laptop and some files on the desk. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever let guests stay here? Just you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan and Alec can stay here, and Spencer, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Walker?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cNo,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>He obviously hadn\u2019t worked out his issues with his youngest brother. Regan had told her about their troublesome sibling, and Cordie was fairly certain it was all the lawsuits Walker had caused with his careless lifestyle that were weighing on Aiden\u2019s mind. He usually attacked problems head-on. It wasn\u2019t like him to ignore or bury whatever was bothering him, but this was a family matter, and that made it different and more difficult. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you have your schedule for tomorrow?\u201d He asked the question without looking up as he opened his computer and powered it on.</p><p>\u201cMy schedule?\u201d She almost laughed. Rigid schedules and Aiden were one and the same. \u201cI thought I\u2019d rent a car, get a map from the concierge, and see some of the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a car and driver.\u201d Leaving the computer screen open, he passed her on his way through the living room to the bar. He got a bottle of water out of the built-in refrigerator, handed it to her, and reached for another. \u201cTell the truth, Cordelia. You\u2019ve got the Rayburns\u2019 address, and you want to drive by, see their house, right?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey live in a gated community. You\u2019ll have to scale the wall in order to see their house.\u201d He grinned, picturing it.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd how do you know where they live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had one of my assistants look them up,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cI do want to see them without their knowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Gallery Ball will be the perfect time, then,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, I told you the Rayburns will be attending the ball. It\u2019s a benefit for the arts. They have one every year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re invited every year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut I\u2019m a benefactor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning you give them money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure they\u2019ll be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLouis sent me the guest list I showed you. The Rayburns were on it. So was Simone\u2019s father, Julian Taylor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Louis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of my managers. He pretty much runs this hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like to go to the ball with you if that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Aiden returned to his bedroom, went straight to his computer, and pulled up his e-mails, his plan to get some work done. He could operate at full capacity on three hours of sleep a night, and he had almost eighty messages to get through.</p><p>\u201cCordelia?\u201d he called. He looked through the open door and could see she hadn\u2019t moved from her spot in the living room.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You\u2019re standing there looking frozen,\u201d Aiden remarked. Concerned, he added, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I was just wondering if I\u2019m going to cringe when I see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he predicted. \u201cNow, get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Walking toward her bedroom she asked over her shoulder, \u201cWhen is the ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat soon? That\u2019s only three days away.\u201d She was ready to protest but stopped herself. \u201cI can do it,\u201d she said, deciding she could shop for a ball gown tomorrow, beg for quick alterations\u2014nothing ever fit off the rack\u2014and be ready by Saturday night.</p><p>\u201cTwo days, Cordelia. It\u2019s Thursday now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime difference,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cSydney is a day ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten the time change, and she was completely rattled. Only two days to get mentally ready to come face-to-face with Simone. \u201cI\u2019ll have to shop to find something suitable . . . I don\u2019t usually pack a ball gown when I travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLouis knows who to call. He\u2019ll help you tomorrow. Now, get some rest.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue. She was tired and out of sorts, but sleep eluded her. Aiden was the reason. She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him. Boston was going to be her salvation, she remembered. All she had to do was get through this trip. Once she was away from him, she wouldn\u2019t have to see his blond beauty queens hanging on his arm, wouldn\u2019t have to put up with any of that nonsense, and wouldn\u2019t have to constantly pretend it didn\u2019t bother her that he completely ignored her. She would be alone, and that was what she wanted. Right?</p><p>When she finally crashed, she slept hard and didn\u2019t wake until after nine the next morning. Her eyes slowly opened and squinted against the bright sun shining through her window. It took her a few seconds to get her bearings, and then she threw back the thick duvet and sat on the side of the bed, watching a tall ship glide its way into the harbor. She detected the aroma of fresh-brewed coffee coming from the next room, but she wasn\u2019t a coffee drinker. She preferred an icy-cold Diet Coke to wake her up. After she showered and dressed in a short pale-pink dress and nude flats, she put her hair in a ponytail and went in search of caffeine. She walked into the living room and came to a quick stop. Aiden was standing by the window with two other men in suits. They all turned when she entered the room. In his black suit and crisp white shirt, Aiden looked refreshed and completely put together. Nothing new about that, she thought grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. I\u2019ll just get a Diet Coke and be out of your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordelia, I\u2019d like you to meet Louis. He\u2019ll set your schedule for today.\u201d</p><p>A young man with sandy hair and handsome hazel eyes came forward to shake her hand.</p><p>Aiden nodded toward the other man. \u201cAnd this is Cavanaugh. He\u2019ll be your driver while we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Cavanaugh was either a fitness trainer or a bodyguard, and she was betting on her second guess. He was tall and as solid as a hundred-year-old oak and had the neck to prove it. He, too, came forward to shake her hand. Then he gave her his card with his phone number.</p><p>\u201cKeep this with you, please. I\u2019ll be in the lobby,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, call or text me and I\u2019ll bring the car around.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate to argue because Cavanaugh was following orders, but she did not need a driver. It seemed a waste of his time to wait around for her.</p><p>\u201cAiden, may I have a word?\u201d</p><p>He was flipping through some papers but paused to look at her. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he asked impatiently.</p><p>She turned back to Louis. \u201cDid he say you\u2019ll set my schedule?\u201d she asked, wondering what exactly that meant.</p><p>Louis handed her a sheet of stationery with times and locations listed. \u201cI took the liberty of making an appointment for you at Chasnoff\u2019s dress shop first. It\u2019s quite exclusive and isn\u2019t open to the public,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s by appointment only, and you\u2019re scheduled for eleven o\u2019clock this morning. The owner has been given approximate specifications and should have a good selection of ball gowns for you to try on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy \u2018approximate specifications\u2019 you mean measurements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho came up with my measurements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Aiden said, grinning. \u201cI guessed.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say, but the bell saved her from the awkward conversation. Louis opened the door for a waiter who pushed in a cart filled with food. He went to the dining table, set two places, and proceeded to lay out a spread worthy of a king. Besides the usual breakfast fare of eggs, bacon, scones, yogurt, and granola, there was a huge bowl of every kind of fruit imaginable.</p><p>Louis handed Cordie a card with his cell phone number, and then he and Cavanaugh left. She immediately headed to the refrigerator to get her Diet Coke. She put ice in a glass and carried the bottle over to the table and sat. She didn\u2019t realize how hungry she was until she took a bite of the buttery scone.</p><p>Aiden joined her. \u201cI\u2019ve got meetings all day,\u201d he said as he poured himself a cup of coffee from the silver carafe. \u201cBut I wanted to talk to you before I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. What would you like to talk about?\u201d she asked as she popped a plump, ripe strawberry into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThe Rayburns,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re a prominent family here in Sydney, and their status comes primarily from Simone\u2019s family owning Merrick Enterprises. Craig and Simone are a power couple. Craig Rayburn works for Merrick, and he\u2019s become quite wealthy because of it. From the lifestyle he lives, he certainly knows how to spend money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is probably why Simone married him. Money is important to her. It certainly wasn\u2019t because of his looks. Though it\u2019s cruel of me to say, he reminds me of a bulldog.\u201d</p><p>Aiden laughed. \u201cI think the photo of the family that Alec found was fairly recent . . . and now that you mention it, he did look a little like a bulldog.\u201d</p><p>Serious once again, Aiden continued. \u201cCraig and Simone have become pillars of the community. They\u2019re major benefactors to half a dozen institutions, everything from hospitals to universities. They\u2019re often seen together at various functions. By all accounts, the Rayburns are a model family, and the sons treat their mother like a queen.\u201d</p><p>Cordie pushed her plate away. The thought of Simone surrounded by an adoring family made her suddenly lose her appetite.</p><p>Aiden continued. \u201cYou\u2019re about to drop a grenade into their lives. We need to anticipate their reaction.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d included himself in the plan, and she thought that was terribly nice of him. Aiden could actually be very considerate and kind when he wanted to be. In fact, on numerous occasions she\u2019d seen him come to the rescue of someone who needed help. Yes, he was domineering and bossy, but when he let his guard down, there was definitely a softer side to him. Maybe it was jet lag, but right now all she could think about was kissing him. She suddenly realized she was staring at his mouth, so she closed her eyes and took a breath. Get a little control, she told herself.</p><p>\u201cAre you falling asleep on me?\u201d Aiden asked, shaking her from her fantasy.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cJust jet leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the grenade? Yes, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like going in without a plan, so you\u2019ve got until tomorrow night to decide exactly what you want to do. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>She watched him pick up his cell phone and keys, slip them into his pocket. He opened his briefcase and deposited the papers he\u2019d been reading earlier. \u201cIf you need anything, just ask Louis.\u201d He snapped the case closed and walked out the door.</p><p>Cordie checked her watch. It was almost eleven, so she went to her room and called for the car. Cavanaugh was waiting just inside the lobby doors. It was a beautiful day, a bit on the chilly side, in the high fifties, and she was glad she\u2019d carried along a lightweight coat. Cavanaugh reminded her that it was winter now in Sydney, which made her smile. Compared to winter in Chicago and Boston, Sydney was Utopia. Traffic was just as congested, though. It took a long while to get to the dress shop. There wasn\u2019t a name on the door, and there wasn\u2019t a front window with pretty dresses on display. It was almost as though Chasnoff\u2019s was hiding the fact that it was in business.</p><p>Miss Marie, an older woman with a no-nonsense attitude, met her at the door and introduced herself. She took Cordie by the arm and led her into the back of the shop, where a seamstress waited along with two salesladies eager to assist. The room Cordie was ushered into didn\u2019t have any windows, but the white walls and white carpet made it seem quite large. There were three wingback chairs in a semicircle, and directly ahead was a carpet-covered circular platform that faced three huge mirrors guaranteed to show every flaw.</p><p>Miss Marie was thrilled with Cordie\u2019s figure. \u201cIt\u2019s about time I dressed someone who isn\u2019t built like a stick. And those eyes. Your fabulous eyes. You must wear a sapphire-blue gown. I insist. You really are stunning, you know.\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t know, and she wasn\u2019t sure how to respond to the exaggerated compliments. Stunning? Miss Marie was obviously nearsighted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of everything,\u201d she continued. \u201cYour undergarments, makeup, gowns, and dresses, and of course wraps. Shall we get started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need one ball gown,\u201d Cordie explained.</p><p>\u201cThose weren\u2019t my instructions from Mr. Madison,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Cordie tried to argue, but Miss Marie wasn\u2019t paying her any attention. For the next three and a half hours Cordie tried on beautiful gowns and dresses and skirts and wonderful silk blouses. Miss Marie and her staff treated her like a mannequin, tugging and pulling and pretty much ignoring any of her opinions, but once Miss Marie was finished, Cordie had a new name for her . . . Miracle Worker.</p><p>Cavanaugh was waiting for her when she walked out of the shop. He drove her back to the hotel by way of a scenic route. She had wanted to experience some of the city, but jet lag wasn\u2019t through with her. All she wanted now was a hot bath and a bed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see Aiden that night or the next morning. He had already left for yet another round of meetings by the time she awoke, so she called down to Cavanaugh, who took her on a sightseeing tour. They rode the ferry around the harbor. It was drizzling, but Cordie didn\u2019t mind. In her estimation the afternoon was perfect. Seeing the spectacular city from this vantage point only made her want to see more.</p><p>Miss Marie and two assistants arrived at the penthouse at promptly six o\u2019clock. They came in with a rack filled with clothes hidden by garment bags. Cordie was rendered speechless when she was told all of the clothes were for her. Since most of the items had been altered, she couldn\u2019t send them back.</p><p>Once again she was treated like a mannequin. They tugged and pulled, spackled, sprayed, and curled, and by seven thirty the transformation was complete. Her hair was brushed back and fashioned into curls with loose tendrils floating down to the base of her neck. In the past, Cordie had always applied makeup sparingly. She never used eyeliner or shadow. Occasionally she would brush on a little mascara, but that was rare. Miss Marie, however, had her own ideas and went to town with her makeup kit, all the while chastising Cordie for ignoring her incredible features. Never in her career, she said, had she seen such a flawless complexion, such beautiful eyes, such full lips. When she finally let Cordie look in the mirror, she barely recognized herself. Her eyes, her face, her body, had been transformed. Miss Marie really was a miracle worker.</p><p>The gown, in a color that matched her eyes exactly, was exquisite. It had a plunging scoop neckline, and the bodice fit so perfectly it looked as though it was molded to her body. The floor-length skirt was straight with a slit that reached the top of her knee. Cordie had never worn anything so magnificent and didn\u2019t think it could possibly be improved on, and then Miss Marie handed her a hooded cape. It was black velvet with a lining the same sapphire blue as the dress. Miss Marie even provided a small beaded clutch. Cordie couldn\u2019t believe the vision that stared back at her in the mirror and decided she didn\u2019t want to know how much it was all going to cost her. One huge splurge in her life was all right. Besides, she was going to a ball with Aiden. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She felt like a princess in a fairy tale. Too bad Aiden wasn\u2019t acting like Prince Charming. He had knocked on her door several times and reminded her they were going to be late if she didn\u2019t hurry up. From the frown he gave her when she finally joined him in the living room, she concluded he was more of an ogre than a prince. He obviously was irritated at her for making him wait, and his only comment when he saw her was negative.</p><p>\u201cThat top doesn\u2019t cover much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cYou look nice, too.\u201d She smiled as she gave the jab.</p><p>It was an understatement. Aiden in a tuxedo was perfection . . . even with a frown on his face.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Cordelia. That color suits you,\u201d he said, seeming a bit contrite.</p><p>\u201cI should look beautiful. It took a team of women to make this,\u201d she said, putting her arms out as she did a slow turn.</p><p>\u201cA team, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI know. Are you ready?\u201d</p> <p>As he was helping her with her cape, he bent down close to her ear and whispered, \u201cI like your perfume.\u201d</p><p>His warm breath on her neck made her shiver. She wanted to lean into him but took a step forward instead. \u201cShall we go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He pushed the elevator button. \u201cHave you decided what you\u2019re going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve given it a lot of thought. I still don\u2019t want to talk to her, but I have a letter for her. I\u2019ll ask a waiter to give it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wrote a letter?\u201d He waited for her to answer. She was biting her lip and staring down at the bag clutched in her hands as though still weighing her decision. She didn\u2019t answer his question.</p><p>\u201cI want to see the look in her eyes when I give her the shock of her life. If that makes me petty, so be it.\u201d</p> <p>Cavanaugh was waiting for them. He did a double take when he saw Cordie, but Aiden\u2019s frown stopped him from making a comment.</p><p>The Gallery Ball was being held at the Hoffman-Sitz Center, which was located just a few miles south of the hotel. Town cars and limos lined the drive to the front doors in a slow procession. Cordie\u2019s stomach was in knots. She was too nervous to talk, and Aiden must have noticed her unease, because he took hold of her hand.</p><p>\u201cI can feel you trembling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bit anxious,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I might do something to humiliate you.\u201d</p><p>He was astounded by her worry. He looked into her eyes and smiled. \u201cNothing you could do would ever humiliate me.\u201d</p><p>Wanna bet? she thought. It was a terribly kind thing for him to say to her, but also totally untrue. \u201cSo if I lose it completely and go for Simone\u2019s throat, you won\u2019t be bothered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he said with a straight face. \u201cDo you plan to go for her throat?\u201d</p><p>The laughter in his voice made her smile. \u201cI might.\u201d</p> <p>They came to a stop in front of the steps leading up to the doors. A valet came forward, an open umbrella at the ready.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be around the corner waiting for your call to collect you,\u201d Cavanaugh said.</p><p>It was beginning to drizzle, so Cordie pulled the hood of the cape over her head. She took Aiden\u2019s arm and went up the steps, lifting the hem of her gown as she moved along.</p><p>Aiden wanted to find a spot where Cordelia could watch the crowd. He suspected every eye would be on her as soon as she removed her cape, and he was right. He even heard several gasps. In case they needed to make a hasty exit, he didn\u2019t check her cape. He draped it over his arm, took hold of her hand, and led her into the gathering.</p><p>The main ballroom was like a huge and beautiful inverted fishbowl, circular with a leaded-glass dome overhead. Guests entered on the first level, which wrapped around the room, and a ring of steps led down to a round dance floor. Huge pillars soared to the ceiling, and between these were small round tables that sat no more than four people, perfect spots for the guests to observe the orchestra stage at the far end of the room and the dancers below. The colors were muted, which made the colorful gowns the women wore all the more vibrant.</p><p>They had walked halfway around the circle before Aiden stopped. From where they stood, they could easily see the entrance and all of the dance floor. He draped her cape over one of the chairs and turned to the entrance, satisfied that the pillar next to them would conceal Cordelia from the crowd but still allow a wide view.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s chilly in here,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t, but he decided to agree. He put his arm around her and drew her closer. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered, grateful for his warmth and his reassuring hug.</p><p>Aiden knew quite a few of the guests, and as the ballroom began to fill, several couples stopped to say hello. While Aiden was politely shaking hands, Cordie noticed a very good-looking man making his way toward them. He was in his thirties, with brown hair streaked blond by the sun and a smile that would make most women weak in the knees. His hair covered his collar, longer than what was considered fashionable, and she made the deduction that he was a nonconformist. She couldn\u2019t stop staring at him. He looked almost as good as Aiden in his tuxedo. He was every bit as tall, though not as lean. His clear green eyes seemed to sparkle with mischief.</p><p>Aiden had been talking to a young man who was trying very hard to sell his company\u2019s services to the Hamilton Hotels, but out of the corner of his eye Aiden was watching the approaching man. He knew who he was. He dismissed the enthusiastic young man by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not in the habit of discussing business at these affairs. If you\u2019ll call my office and make an appointment, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d He didn\u2019t take his eyes off the man coming their way.</p><p>The man stopped just a foot away from Cordie, and his smile widened. She couldn\u2019t help but notice the adorable dimple in his cheek.</p><p>\u201cCordie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Liam Scott.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand, pulling her to him. Aiden still had his arm around her shoulders and wasn\u2019t letting go. A tug-of-war ensued until Cordie stopped it by extracting her hand from Liam\u2019s and shrugging Aiden\u2019s arm away. Liam\u2019s greeting was not over. He bent down and kissed her on both cheeks. He finally turned to Aiden and shook his hand.</p><p>\u201cAiden,\u201d he said briskly.</p><p>\u201cLiam,\u201d Aiden responded curtly.</p><p>Aiden didn\u2019t have to be reminded of Alec\u2019s warning that Liam was a womanizer. The way the man was looking at Cordelia was all the evidence he needed, and Aiden didn\u2019t like it one bit. He was downright rude when he asked, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it,\u201d he said, keeping his gaze locked on Cordelia. \u201cI\u2019m a patron of the arts.\u201d</p><p>Cordie didn\u2019t know what Aiden\u2019s problem was. There was absolutely no reason to be so antagonistic. \u201cThen you attend these Gallery Balls each year?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is my first.\u201d He added as he tugged on his collar, \u201cAnd hopefully my last.\u201d</p><p>Aiden wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cAgain, why are you here?\u201d he asked, and before Liam could answer, Aiden guessed, \u201cAlec sent you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cHe wanted me to meet Cordie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you chose the Gallery Ball to introduce yourself?\u201d</p><p>Liam shrugged. \u201cFrom what Alec told me about Cordie, I was curious to meet her as soon as I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he tell you about her?\u201d Aiden folded his arms across his chest so he wouldn\u2019t give in to the urge to shove Liam down the steps. He had taken an instant dislike to him and wasn\u2019t in the mood to play games.</p><p>\u201cHe said she was drop-dead gorgeous.\u201d Turning to Cordie, he said, \u201cHe was right.\u201d</p><p>She could feel herself blushing and wanted to turn the discussion away from herself. \u201cAlec mentioned you used to work for Interpol?\u201d</p><p>Liam gave her a quizzical look and then began to laugh. \u201cHe said that, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t work for Interpol?\u201d she asked, confused.</p><p>Evidently he thought her question hilarious, because his laughter grew louder until she could almost see tears in his eyes. \u201cAlec does have a sense of humor. I didn\u2019t work for them. I was wanted by Interpol. It was all a misunderstanding,\u201d he said offhandedly. \u201cA painting was there, and then it wasn\u2019t, but then it was again. See? Just a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>Cordie couldn\u2019t tell if he was joking or not, but she wasn\u2019t given the chance to pursue the subject because Liam grew serious when he turned the conversation to another matter.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn to ask questions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are you going to do when Simone and Craig Rayburn arrive? I\u2019ve already checked. You don\u2019t have a gun, so I know you aren\u2019t going to shoot them. What\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>Aiden answered for her. \u201cCordelia wants to give Simone the shock of her life, but she doesn\u2019t want to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how is she going to shock her?\u201d He turned to Cordie. \u201cDid you bring a Taser? That would shock the hell out of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d Cordie began.</p><p>\u201cBecause if you didn\u2019t,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019ve got one in the car you can borrow.\u201d He looked around at the gathering crowd. \u201cAre you hiding behind this pillar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she said, knowing full well it was a lie. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for the Rayburns to arrive.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSo you can shock them.\u201d</p><p>Liam was having a bit too much fun for her liking. Before she could tell him so, he changed the subject again by asking her how she liked Sydney and then launching into a litany of the attractions she should see. As he spoke, he took her hand and pulled out a chair at the table for her. He sat down next to her and leaned in, focusing on her as though she were the only person in the room. She could tell that Aiden was trying his best to remain composed and polite, but he was not happy about Liam\u2019s intrusion. He looked as though he was about to say something when a man came up and greeted him. From that point on he was distracted by a steady stream of men and women who recognized him. Each man wanted to talk about various projects he just knew Aiden would want to invest in, and each woman simply wanted Aiden. Cordie couldn\u2019t blame the women. Aiden was what she\u2019d heard one of them call a real catch, and from the way they were eyeing Liam, he was just as attractive to females on the prowl. Cordie wasn\u2019t immune to Liam\u2019s good looks and charm, but in her estimation he paled in comparison to Aiden. She thought that was a pity. She desperately wanted to be attracted to another man.</p><p>A waiter appeared with glasses of champagne on a silver tray. Cordie was so nervous she had to force herself not to guzzle the drink. There was a short welcoming speech by the president of something or other\u2014she wasn\u2019t paying attention\u2014and then the orchestra began to play.</p><p>Aiden extricated himself from his growing entourage and walked over to Liam. \u201cI\u2019d like a word with you, Scott,\u201d he said, his tone downright belligerent.</p><p>Liam looked up. \u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve answered my question yet. Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Liam pushed the chair back and stood. \u201cAlec thought there might be trouble, and I owe him a favor, so here I am. He\u2019s worried about Cordie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of Cordelia.\u201d Aiden\u2019s voice radiated anger.</p><p>Liam wasn\u2019t fazed by the heated response. \u201cAnd I can take care of Rayburn and his sons . . . if there\u2019s trouble.\u201d</p><p>Cordie rolled her eyes. She wasn\u2019t impressed by the testosterone throwdown. She stood between the two men and sweetly said, \u201cHow about I take care of myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeads up,\u201d Liam said, looking over Cordie\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Cordie and Aiden turned toward the entrance.</p><p>\u201cThe Rayburns are here,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>Simone and Craig Rayburn seemed to be the in couple.</p><p>They stopped just inside the entrance, apparently oblivious to the fact that they were clogging the pathway for other guests behind them as they greeted friends and business associates. Craig removed Simone\u2019s wrap and handed it to a hovering coat-check lady, then took Simone\u2019s elbow and guided her through the crowd. They slowly made their way to the opposite side of the ballroom, pausing again and again to chat with people vying for their attention. Cordie couldn\u2019t get a good look at Simone because other guests obstructed her view. She saw Craig clearly, though, and the bulldog comparison was even more accurate than she\u2019d imagined. His jutting lower jaw was rather impressive, and his bottom teeth showed when he spoke. He wasn\u2019t an attractive man by anyone\u2019s standards, but from the way people were reacting to him, he obviously had achieved a certain level of stature among the wealthy elite. Shaking hands and kissing cheeks, he worked the room with great finesse. Each person he greeted seemed happy, even thrilled, at his attention, and there was no doubt he relished all the adulation. His smile seemed genuine enough, but there was a hint of arrogance behind it.</p><p>The couple reached their reserved table and took their seats. After a few minutes, their friends gradually drifted away to their own tables, and Cordie saw Simone clearly for the first time. She wore a shimmering silver strapless gown. In person, Cordie didn\u2019t think they looked all that much alike. Simone\u2019s hair was just as dark as hers and she seemed to be the same height, but their body shapes were different. Simone was extremely thin. She didn\u2019t have any curves or an ounce of fat, though judging by her skinny sculpted arms, she worked out daily. Simone turned toward the dance floor. Cordie couldn\u2019t see the color of her eyes, though she guessed they were blue. In the photo Alec had shown her, Cordie saw the resemblance, but now she was having trouble finding the similarities. Some would consider Simone a beautiful woman, but compared to the picture, the angles of her face were sharper and more defined. She was in her forties now, so the lines were probably because of age and stress. No, that wasn\u2019t true. Simone wasn\u2019t affected by stress\u2014she caused it. Others might think they looked alike, but Cordie didn\u2019t want there to be any resemblance at all.</p><p>Aiden put a supportive arm around her shoulders. He leaned down and whispered, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to look like her,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Cordie couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the couple. They were having a fine old time. Craig said something Simone thought was quite funny. She put her hand on his chest, laughed, and shook her head.</p><p>Alec had filled Liam in on Cordie\u2019s situation, and Liam hadn\u2019t really had an opinion until this moment, but watching Simone laughing and carrying on with her husband and her friends, as though she was a queen holding court, he felt a jolt of anger for Cordie. Simone had accomplished the impossible.

He stood and waved to draw their attention. Cordie turned in that direction and saw the Rayburns\u2019 two sons, Glen and Knox, enter the ballroom.</p><p>\u201cThe sons look like their father,\u201d Liam remarked. \u201cThat\u2019s a real shame.\u201d</p><p>The brothers were not handsome, but they were impeccably dressed in their designer tuxedos, and they exuded unusual confidence for such young men. Cordie guessed the older brother, Glen, was around eighteen. They headed straight for their parents, and Simone greeted them with a broad smile as they approached. When each son embraced his mother warmly, Cordie felt a blow, like a fist to the stomach. She was outraged, and the longer she watched the outwardly touching scene of family affection, the angrier she became. This was the woman her father had loved, the one he had ached to see again. She had lied to him and caused him so much pain. All those years were wasted as he pined for Natalie Smith, a woman who didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>Cordie reached for her beaded bag and took out the letter she\u2019d sealed in a hotel envelope. Stopping a passing waiter, she handed the letter to him and pointed across the room to Simone as she gave him instructions.</p> <p>Liam watched with growing curiosity. \u201cI know it isn\u2019t my business, but may I ask what\u2019s in the envelope? Is Simone going to go postal when she sees it?\u201d</p><p>Aiden was just as curious, but he had intended to wait until they were back in the car to find out. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to tell us what you wrote\u2014\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t write a letter,\u201d she said quietly, her eyes still on Simone.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s in the envelope?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cA copy of the letter she left for my father. I thought she might want to read it again. Years have passed since she wrote it, and she might have forgotten some of the cruel things she said. I wanted to remind her and to let her know . . .\u201d Her voice drifted off as her attention remained fixed on Simone and her family.</p> <p>Neither Liam nor Aiden asked any more questions. They kept their eyes on the waiter, watching him weave in and out of the crowd to get to Simone.</p><p>Craig Rayburn had left his wife\u2019s side and was sitting at a table with friends. A couple came up the stairs from the dance floor and stopped to talk to Simone just as the waiter reached her. Smiling, Simone took the envelope and walked a few feet away from her friends before she opened it.</p><p>Cordie watched her pull the letter out and unfold it. Simone didn\u2019t have to read much to know what it was. She stiffened, and there was such a look of panic on her face it was almost as though she had seen something grotesque. She frantically looked to her left, then to her right, as she folded the letter and refolded it. Mindless of where she was, she stuffed the letter down the bodice of her gown. Out of sight, out of mind? Was that her mantra? For a brief second or two she looked terrified. Glancing around one last time to see if anyone was watching, she again plastered a serene expression on her face and rejoined her friends.</p><p>Cordie wasn\u2019t through taking the woman down memory lane. She wanted one more jab to make certain Simone understood that she hadn\u2019t gotten away with her little scam, that the daughter she\u2019d tried to erase knew what she had done. She didn\u2019t intend to cause a scene or confront Simone. She just wanted some vindication for her father, to make Simone realize her deceptions had not evaporated into thin air. They existed. Once she saw that recognition in Simone\u2019s eyes, Cordie would let go of the anger, never say Simone\u2019s name again, and get on with her own life.</p><p>Cordie walked around the table and took a spot in front of a pillar. Standing on the top step, she simply stared at Simone and waited.</p><p>Aiden wasn\u2019t sure what Cordelia planned to do, but he wasn\u2019t going to let her do it alone. Liam followed him. They stood on either side of her.</p> <p>Across the room Simone was smiling and nodding, but her eyes were not on the people in front of her. She seemed to be distracted, impatiently looking around as though waiting for someone to jump out at her.</p><p>\u201cHere comes good old dad,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>Julian Taylor, a tall, thin man who walked with an air of authority, was making his way toward his daughter, stopping to shake a few hands, and deigning to give a rigid smile to only a few people.</p><p>When Simone saw her father, her expression changed. Like someone who was looking for an escape, she glanced around the room in desperation. And that was when she saw Cordie. Her face turned white in an instant. She shook her head as though trying to change what she was seeing. Taking a step in retreat, she looked again at her father, and then stiffly turned back to Cordie, no doubt making sure she was still there. Cordie could detect a hint of anger now, and that surprised her.</p><p>She could almost see Simone\u2019s mind racing. How could she keep her father from seeing what she was seeing? She turned in his direction and her hand went to her throat. Letting out a soft cry, she slowly and dramatically fell to the floor. It was the most graceful and phony faint Cordie had ever seen. She wasn\u2019t the only one who noticed.</p><p>\u201cShould we clap?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to shock her,\u201d Liam reminded.</p><p>Cordie nodded. \u201cShall we go?\u201d</p> <p>Aiden draped her cape around her shoulders and took her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re finished here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m finished.\u201d She looked across the ballroom one last time. A crowd had gathered around Simone, who was still pretending to be in a dead faint. Her husband had her in his arms and was talking to his sons as he nodded toward the entrance.</p><p>Liam walked to the doors with Cordie and Aiden, who had already texted Cavanaugh to tell him to bring the car around. He was suddenly anxious to get Cordelia away.</p><p>\u201cYou could tear that family apart just by telling them who you are,\u201d Liam remarked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to destroy her family. Like I said, I just wanted her to know. Now I\u2019m finished. I don\u2019t ever want to hear her name again.\u201d</p><p>Seeing one of the Rayburns\u2019 sons pushing his way through the crowd and heading to the entrance, Aiden increased the pace.</p><p>Cavanaugh pulled up just as they exited the building.</p><p>\u201cIt was a pleasure meeting you both,\u201d Liam said. He shook Aiden\u2019s hand and then turned to Cordie, taking her hand in both of his. \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Aiden thought the good-bye was lasting longer than necessary, so he took Cordelia by the arm and ushered her into the backseat.</p><p>Cordie was quiet on the way back to the hotel. She was thankful Aiden wasn\u2019t asking her questions, because she wasn\u2019t ready to talk about the Rayburns. The only good thing she could say about them was that they lived on a different continent and she would never have to worry about running into them. She stared out the window. Her hands were shaking and she was spent. Taking deep breaths, she tried to slow her racing heart. She had been so nervous the entire time she was at the Gallery Ball, but now it was over, and she could relax and get rid of her anxiety. She just wasn\u2019t sure how to go about it. Yoga would help. At least that\u2019s what Regan often told her. Yoga was good for stress, she\u2019d said. She had even bought Cordie a yoga mat. Whatever had she done with it? she wondered. She\u2019d have to search for it when she got home.</p><p>Aiden finished listening to his messages and reading his texts, then turned to Cordelia and said, \u201cHave you calmed down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been calm. Why would you think I wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were hyperventilating, and your face was red. It isn\u2019t now, so you must be feeling a bit calmer.\u201d He added, \u201cBut you\u2019re still frowning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to remember where I put my yoga mat.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t buying her obvious attempt to look relaxed. \u201cYou do yoga?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have a mat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Regan gave it to me. Yoga helps with stress.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on top of hers. She was still shaking. \u201cWould you like to go out to eat, or do you want to go back to the hotel and do yoga?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t acknowledge his wisecrack. \u201cBack to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could go out. You could drop me off if you want.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI could? Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Cordie really did relax then. For a while there, Aiden had been a sympathetic, almost loving, man, but now he was back to being his arrogant and impertinent self, and she felt a sense of normalcy again.</p><p>Several minutes passed in silence, and then Cordie said, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to wear this beautiful gown somewhere else so I won\u2019t associate it with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Them\u2019 being the Rayburns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It probably cost a fortune,\u201d she said. Her fingers gently brushed the fabric of her skirt. \u201cMiss Marie\u2019s bill for all the outfits will be astronomical. Oh, I know what you\u2019re thinking. I can afford it, right? My father left me a fortune. That\u2019s true; however, I\u2019m going to be sensible about it. I\u2019m not used to spending that kind of money on clothes, and designer labels are lost on me. My father was a generous man, but I\u2019ve always survived on my own. I taught in a Catholic high school, for Pete\u2019s sake. Do you know what the teachers make? Zip. They make zip.\u201d</p><p>She continued her running monologue until they pulled up in front of the hotel. Aiden helped her out of the car, waited while she thanked Cavanaugh, and then said, \u201cThe bill will be zip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she asked.</p><p>As they crossed the lobby, Aiden twice stopped to answer questions from the staff. He inserted his card in the elevator slot, and the doors opened.</p><p>\u201cThe bill was taken care of,\u201d he said as they entered and the doors closed.</p><p>\u201cBy whom? Oh no, Aiden. I\u2019m paying for my clothes, not you.\u201d</p><p>He was ignoring her while he read a text. She poked him in his chest. \u201cI said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d</p><p>She assumed he had agreed with her. Mollified, she said, \u201cI appreciate the offer. I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m not grateful . . . Oh my God, you\u2019re so rude,\u201d she declared, raising her voice. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t text while someone is talking to you.\u201d</p><p>Her indignation was short-lived. His smile could melt the hardest of hearts. He put his phone back in his pocket just as the elevator doors opened to their foyer.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to eat? You haven\u2019t had dinner,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d She hurried across the living room to get to her bedroom. \u201cMaybe just a hamburger. That would be nice . . . and French fries. I really shouldn\u2019t have fries . . . and a milk shake. Chocolate, please. I deserve it after the night I\u2019ve had.\u201d</p><p>He stood in the middle of the foyer watching her disappear into her room.</p><p>\u201cAnd no cheese,\u201d she called out. \u201cOh, and pickles, please. Lots of pickles.\u201d As she was closing her door, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot to remember. Just wait until I change, and I\u2019ll order.\u201d</p><p>Aiden looked around the living room and shook his head. Her scarf was on the back of the sofa. Her purse, which was the size of a suitcase, was on the floor, and her shoes were under a chair. What looked like a tube of lipstick was on the coffee table next to a pair of reading glasses and a leather-bound book he was sure had something to do with chemistry. On the wingback chair was a packet of tissues. Why in God\u2019s name would she leave tissues on a chair? It looked as though a whirlwind had gone through, but it was just clutter, he told himself. And he hated clutter. Yet her clutter didn\u2019t bother him. What was that about?</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>On her way to the bedroom Cordie pulled the pins out of her hair and ran her fingers through the thick strands. She should have taken off the gown before she washed her face, but she couldn\u2019t wait another second. The Spackle Miss Marie called makeup was making her skin itch like mad. She was careful not to get a single drop of water on the gown, and once she had patted her face dry and applied a little moisturizer, she felt so much better. Cinderella was gone, and plain old Cordie was back, which she much preferred. Dressing like a princess took way too much time and work, though she had to admit that walking into the Gallery Ball on Aiden\u2019s arm had been a little bit magical.</p><p>Carefully she removed the gown, hung it on the special hanger Miss Marie had provided, then zipped it in the garment bag and put it in the closet. It was chilly in her bedroom, so she slipped into a navy-blue silk nightgown. She didn\u2019t think her clingy silk robe would be appropriate, so she put on one of the thick terry-cloth robes the hotel provided.</p><p>Aiden knocked on the door. \u201cFood\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t supposed to have ordered it, but she was glad he had because her stomach was grumbling. She hurried out into the living room. He had changed into a white undershirt and a pair of old jeans. They rode low on his hips, making him look all the more sexy.</p><p>Aiden, phone to his ear, pulled the chair from the table for her and handed her a napkin. She didn\u2019t know whom he was talking to, but from his tone of voice she could tell he wasn\u2019t happy with what he was hearing.</p><p>\u201cWhich leg?\u201d she heard him ask. A few seconds later he said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll tell her hello.\u201d</p><p>He disconnected the call, dropped the phone on the table, and sat down across from her. \u201cSpencer says hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he have bad news?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou sounded angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalker was in another crash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas anyone hurt?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust Walker,\u201d he answered. \u201cHe broke his right leg and destroyed a two-hundred-thousand-dollar Lamborghini.\u201d</p><p>Aiden\u2019s jaw clenched, and she knew the real reason he was so angry. \u201cYou don\u2019t care about the car. Walker could have killed himself. That\u2019s why you\u2019re so upset,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m too angry to be worried. He\u2019s not going to stop until he kills himself or someone else. It\u2019s going to be a disaster. I see it coming, but I can\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cControl him.\u201d</p><p>He nodded; then he abruptly changed the subject. \u201cWhat did Liam mean when he said he would see you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Cordie cut her hamburger in half and said, \u201cThis thing is huge. Would you like some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to eat sushi? That\u2019s not very filling.\u201d</p><p>He reached across the table and took half of her hamburger. \u201cAnswer my question.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhile Liam and I were sitting at the table tonight, he asked me if I would like to climb to the top of the Harbour Bridge. It\u2019s a thing here,\u201d she added.</p><p>Smiling, he said, \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you need to go before dawn.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again. \u201cI know. I\u2019ve done it. It\u2019s impressive, watching the sun come up over the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounded exciting, but I declined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClimbing to the top of anything doesn\u2019t appeal to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of heights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unreasonably so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you declined his invitation, why is he calling you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do some sightseeing,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I would be available or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be going with me.\u201d</p><p>His phone rang. He saw who was calling and said, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve got to take this.\u201d He stood and crossed the room to the window. Cordie ate half the hamburger and a couple of fries, but she didn\u2019t touch the milk shake. Her stomach hadn\u2019t calmed down as much as she had thought. She drank a bottle of water instead. When she was finished, she went back into her bathroom and brushed her teeth. Her mind was on Walker. He was so different from his brothers, Aiden and Spencer, and his sister. They were all hardworking and responsible. Walker wasn\u2019t. He never had been. He was the ultimate playboy, and she worried he didn\u2019t have any sense of right and wrong. She thought about that while she brushed her hair. How could that have happened with such moral siblings? Regan, especially, was such a kindhearted woman, always thinking about the needs of others. Walker seemed to have room to think only about himself. He had never had to work for anything. And maybe that was the problem. Aiden had always felt a certain responsibility for Walker and, as he did in his dealings with almost everyone, he needed to take charge, to make things right. Maybe it was time for Aiden to step back and take a long, hard look at his relationship with his brother. He needed to see that he couldn\u2019t change Walker . . . or save him from himself. She hated to watch the anxiety cross Aiden\u2019s face whenever his brother made another bad decision, but she wanted him to know she understood.</p><p>She went in search of Aiden. His phone was on the coffee table, but he was nowhere in sight. The table with their dinner had already been removed, though she hadn\u2019t heard anyone come in or leave. His bedroom door was open. She knocked and called his name.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he asked. He was around the corner by the window plugging in his laptop.</p><p>She leaned against the doorframe. \u201cWhy do you always ask me that? I don\u2019t need anything. I think I\u2019ll start asking you that question every time you say hello. Then you\u2019ll see how irritating it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordelia . . .\u201d He said her name in what she thought was a warning voice.</p><p>\u201cYou left your phone in the living room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your phone. Mine\u2019s being charged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She was about to tell him what she had concluded about Walker, but she was unable to collect her thoughts or speak. He had the most intense look on his face.</p><p>Aiden couldn\u2019t stop staring. Was she aware of how provocative she looked? Her robe was open, and she was wearing a sexy low-cut nightgown that didn\u2019t reach her knees. God, she had a good body. No, he thought, it was a great body. He\u2019d been fighting the battle to stay away from her all evening, and damn, it was difficult. If he was being totally honest, the battle had begun on the night he\u2019d kissed her. From that moment on, no matter how hard he tried to forget her and block her from his mind, she kept wandering into his thoughts. Whether he was in a meeting, on a business call, or going about his daily routine, she was there in his head, playing with his concentration. Tonight, when she\u2019d walked out in her ball gown, she\u2019d looked like a gorgeous movie star, and he knew every man would fantasize about her. But now, seeing her stand there with her hair down and wearing no makeup, he was certain he\u2019d never seen a more beautiful or more seductive woman in his life.</p> <p>He began to walk toward her. She was like a magnet drawing him to her, and the closer he got, the more he wanted her. Her scent aroused him. And her mouth . . . He couldn\u2019t look at her sweet, full lips without thinking about all the ways she could please him.</p><p>As Aiden approached, Cordie\u2019s legs went weak. The smoldering lust in his eyes sent shivers down to her toes. He wanted her. The realization nearly overwhelmed her.</p><p>\u201cCordelia?\u201d His voice was rough with his desire.</p><p>In a bare whisper she asked him the same question he always asked her. \u201cWhat do you need, Aiden?\u201d</p><p>He was just inches away from her now. \u201cYou. I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d she whispered. She barely had enough breath to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said as he grabbed the lapels of her robe and pulled her toward him. Wrapping his arms around her, he held her tight against him as his mouth came down on hers. He made love to her with his mouth and his tongue, rubbing against hers, desperate for the taste of her again. Touching her had become addictive for him. Her lips were so soft, so sweet, and she was so giving and so damned sexy. All she had to do was look at him and he got hard.</p><p>Cordie wasn\u2019t passive. She threaded her fingers through his hair and kissed him just as passionately. She was as ravenous for him as he was for her. She couldn\u2019t get close enough, fast enough. In his arms all the anxiety and fear she\u2019d felt at the ball were wiped away. Aiden made her forget everything but him. All that mattered was his touch.</p><p>By the time he ended the kiss, she was shaking with desire. He stepped back and stared into her eyes. He was panting as though he had run a long way. An endless minute passed in silence as tension crackled between them.</p><p>\u201cLet me be clear.\u201d His voice shook.</p><p>She let out a long, raspy breath. She didn\u2019t know what to say, and so she simply nodded.</p><p>\u201cI want you writhing under me, Cordelia. I want you to tell me what you like so I can drive you out of your mind. Am I clear?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again. She was so flustered she couldn\u2019t speak. She could barely think.</p><p>\u201cI want you clinging to me. I want your nails digging into my shoulders, and I want you screaming my name when you come.\u201d</p><p>She felt as though her heart was about to leap out of her chest. She was amazed she was still standing. His voice was so passionate, and the way he was looking at her made her hot . . . very hot.</p><p>He pulled his T-shirt over his head and tossed it on the bed. He reached for her robe next. She didn\u2019t resist as he removed it and dropped it on a chair.</p><p>\u201cTake your nightgown off.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a request but a command.</p><p>She could barely catch her breath. She wanted him to take her into his arms again. The bedroom was cast in shadows, and she was thankful the lights weren\u2019t on, because once she removed her nightgown, she would be vulnerable. Her body wasn\u2019t perfect, and she knew Aiden was used to perfection with his women. She didn\u2019t want him to be disappointed.</p><p>\u201cCordelia, take off your nightgown.\u201d</p><p>With unsteady hands she reached for the straps and slowly pulled them down over her arms. She stopped when the material skimmed her breasts.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, Aiden?\u201d She didn\u2019t want him to regret this night. It would kill her if he did.</p><p>Had he not been so aroused, he would have laughed. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and let the nightgown drop to the floor.</p><p>His gaze slowly moved down her body. \u201cMy God, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Anxious now to hold her, Aiden stripped out of the rest of his clothes and reached for her. He lifted her into his arms and carried her to the bed. The sheets were pulled back. He gently placed her on the bed, then came down on top of her with a loud, satisfied growl.</p><p>Cordie was reeling from the contact of his hot muscular body on top of hers. He was all male, hard and hot, and oh, he smelled divine. Her senses were overwhelmed by him. He settled between her thighs, and she rubbed her toes against his legs while she stroked his shoulders. She wanted to touch him everywhere. His skin was so warm, but the muscles rolling beneath were hard.</p><p>Aiden was savoring the sensation of her pressed against him. He could feel her heart pounding under his. He lifted up, shifting his weight on his arms so he wouldn\u2019t crush her. Looking into her beautiful eyes, he saw the passion, and he took her mouth in a wild, wet kiss that held nothing back. He continued to kiss her again and again while his hands caressed her. When she moved restlessly beneath him, he slowly moved down her body, kissing her full breasts. He took one nipple in his mouth. She arched up and moaned. She was so responsive to his touch. He slid the palm of his hand between her thighs. His fingers teased and tormented until she was begging for release.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Aiden, please,\u201d she panted.</p><p>He slid lower, kissing her silky thighs, then moved between them. He knew the second she came apart. She arched up, clinging to his shoulders and crying his name.</p><p>The tremors of her release took Cordie by surprise. Squeezing her eyes shut, she let the waves of pleasure pour over her.</p><p>\u201cI like the way you taste.\u201d He had only gotten started driving her out of her mind. Twice more she cl**axed before his control shattered. \u201cI need to be inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she whispered, her voice shaking with emotion.</p><p>She pushed him onto his back and began to drive him wild. She bit his earlobe, smiling when he grunted in reaction. She kissed every inch of his chest, and when she moved down to take him into her mouth, he moaned. He couldn\u2019t wait any longer to be inside her. He grabbed a condom from a drawer, and when he was ready, he rolled her onto her back and once again covered her. He wasn\u2019t gentle with her, but she didn\u2019t want him to be. He slid his arms under her thighs and thrust deep inside. He exhaled a satisfied moan and wanted to slam into her again and again but forced himself to stay still.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked as he kissed a path down the side of her neck.</p><p>Her nails dug into his shoulders. \u201cOh yes,\u201d she said as she lifted her legs and squeezed him.</p><p>The sensation was so intense he almost cl**axed then and there. He began to move slowly at first and then faster, thrusting deep each time. He could feel her tightening around him.</p><p>Surges of ecstasy ripped through Cordie. She couldn\u2019t stop the orgasm. Clinging to him, she felt a rush she had never felt before, and it seemed to go on and on in waves.</p><p>Her cl**ax triggered his. It was unlike anything Aiden had ever experienced, and it was incredible. He sank deeper and let out a consuming sigh.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t move for long minutes. They were both panting. His body was covered with the gleam of perspiration. Making love to Cordelia had taken all he had to give. And then some. He didn\u2019t have to wonder how long it would take for him to want her again. He was already thinking about it.</p><p>Aiden didn\u2019t give her any lovey-dovey words of praise, but Cordie didn\u2019t expect that he would. He leaned up on his elbows, kissed her long and thoroughly, then rolled out of bed and went into his bathroom. Aiden was just being Aiden, she reminded herself. Abrupt and in control. She wasn\u2019t sure what to do. He wouldn\u2019t tell her to leave his bed, but he might not expect her to sleep with him either.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want it to be awkward. She got out of bed, grabbed her robe, and went back to her bedroom. Her heart was racing. Having sex with Aiden might just kill her if she kept it up. The idea of it made her smile. What a way to go.</p><p>After getting ready for bed, she slipped under the sheets, flipped the light off, and closed her eyes, but sleep eluded her. After several minutes of tossing and turning, she heard a phone ring. Another call for Aiden, she guessed.</p><p>It took a while, but she finally relaxed. She was just about to drift off when she heard a sound beside her bed. She opened her eyes and saw Aiden in the dim light. He dropped something on the bedside table, pulled the covers back, and lay down next to her. He reached for her and kissed the side of her neck. Cordie glanced over his shoulder to see a package of condoms lying on the table.</p><p>\u201cShould I be afraid?\u201d she asked, laughing. He responded by pushing her onto her back and rolling on top of her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She could hear a smile in his voice as he replied. \u201cI told you I like to be on top.\u201d</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>Cordie woke up alone. She opened one eye to look at the clock. It was already ten. She wasn\u2019t used to sleeping this late, but then she wasn\u2019t used to having mind-blowing sex most of the night with an insatiable man. Admittedly, she wasn\u2019t used to ha**ng s*x all night with any man, and she had the sore muscles to prove it.</p><p>She groaned getting out of bed. She needed to work out more, she decided. Yeah, right. Who was she kidding? She needed to start working out so she could get in better shape. How did one get physically fit for sex?</p><p>She glanced down at the indentation on Aiden\u2019s pillow. It must have been almost dawn when she had fallen asleep in his arms, and she hadn\u2019t heard him get up. She listened for any sound coming from the suite but heard nothing. The memory of their night together played out in her mind, and her face grew warm just thinking about it. Never in her life had she been so uninhibited. Never had she felt such passion, such total ecstasy. Aiden was an amazing lover, gentle and giving, yet demanding. She smiled for just a second remembering, but her smile quickly disappeared as reality set in.</p><p>Oh God, what had she done? In one night her entire plan for getting away from Aiden had gone up in smoke. Granted, it was an incredible and euphoric night, but it changed everything. Or did it? What was last night? She sat on the edge of the bed and pondered her situation. Was it a one-night stand? Two people giving in to their desires? Maybe. They were both adults, after all, and it was totally natural under the circumstances for them to be drawn to each other.</p><p>Or was it something more? Aiden had been very tender and affectionate, but there were no words of endearment, no mention of love. Why would there be? He probably had taken dozens of women to his bed in the past; why would she be different? Her heart ached just a little, but she wouldn\u2019t let herself dwell on the negative. Last night had been fantastic. She would file it away as a wonderful memory and move on.</p><p>A hot shower revitalized her . . . sort of, anyway. Aiden had mentioned that he expected her to go somewhere with him today, but he hadn\u2019t told her where. Knowing Aiden, jeans wouldn\u2019t be appropriate wherever he was taking her. She decided to wear one of the lovely dresses Miss Marie had insisted she add to her wardrobe. It was a deep purple dress with a jewel neck, long sleeves, and a flared skirt. She slipped into her favorite nude heels. She didn\u2019t want to mess with her hair, so she pulled it up in a ponytail, applied her perfume, and was ready to go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Breakfast was waiting for her. The table was set for one, and on the place mat were a bottle of Diet Coke and a silver bowl of ice with a container of blueberry yogurt. There was also a basket of croissants and pastries and another basket filled with fruit. She didn\u2019t eat much, just a little of her yogurt, because Aiden had left her a note telling her he was taking her to lunch at the Empire and to be ready at noon.</p><p>While she sipped her Diet Coke she answered e-mails. There were more than thirty of them, several from students begging her to return to school. They were having trouble with their chemistry class and blamed the teachers. Apparently the first teacher Sister Delores had hired for the summer school session had lasted one week before he had had enough and quit. According to one student\u2019s e-mail they were going through teachers faster than they could scarf down a bag of Doritos. The impassioned pleas tugged at Cordie\u2019s heartstrings. The boys could be difficult, but they weren\u2019t impossible to handle. All it took was a firm hand, patience, and a sense of humor. She was surprised by how much she already missed them.</p><p>She saved the longest e-mail she had to write for last. She knew Sophie and Regan were waiting to hear how it was going, and it took a while for her to put her tumultuous thoughts into words. She told them a little about the ball and seeing Simone with her doting family. She also mentioned Simone\u2019s ridiculous fainting spell and promised to give them more details when she got back to Chicago. Cordie was sorry she hadn\u2019t tried to sneak a couple of photos with her smartphone to send, but she hadn\u2019t thought about it until she was on her way back to the hotel. Yes, it was a missed opportunity, and she doubted she would get another chance, because Aiden had informed her they would be returning to Chicago tomorrow after a meeting he had scheduled in the morning. She was ready to go home. She had accomplished what she had set out to do, and now she wanted to get as far away from the Rayburns as possible.</p><p>It was only after she had sent the e-mail that she realized she hadn\u2019t said much about Aiden. Would her friends think that was odd? Even though Sophie and Regan were her closest friends, she didn\u2019t want them to know she\u2019d slept with him. Besides, she had convinced herself that what had happened with Aiden was a fluke, and it would never happen again.</p> <p>The last e-mail she sent was to Alec telling him she had met his friend Liam Scott and how charismatic she thought the man was. She had just one question: Which side of the law was he on?</p><p>At eleven thirty she texted Aiden and told him she wanted to stop in the gift shop and she would meet him in the lobby by the atrium at noon. She tossed her sunglasses and phone into her purse, applied lip gloss, and was heading to the elevator when the hotel phone rang. On the chance it might be Aiden she was quick to answer.</p><p>She didn\u2019t recognize the man\u2019s voice, but it was pleasant.</p><p>\u201cIs Andrew Kane there? I\u2019d like to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>That question got her attention. \u201cWho is calling?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cA friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name?\u201d she pressed politely.</p><p>\u201cA friend,\u201d he said again, but this time his voice wasn\u2019t quite so pleasant.</p><p>All right, then . . . if that was how he wanted to play it. \u201cMr. Andrew Kane is not available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will he be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the daughter? Is she available?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Before she could demand an explanation, he responded with, \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll try again later,\u201d and hung up.</p><p>She replaced the phone and fell back against the credenza. What was that all about? A burst of anger seized her. Simone had to be behind the call. Who else could it be? And evidently she thought Cordie\u2019s father was still alive. The way she had reacted to seeing Cordie at the ball made it perfectly clear she wasn\u2019t going to spread the word anytime soon that she had an illegitimate daughter she had abandoned. If word got out, it would ruin her standing in the community. Women who threw their babies away didn\u2019t win Mother of the Year. The caller was either related to Simone or worked for her, right? That was the only thing that made sense. But what did Simone want?</p><p>Cordie\u2019s hands were shaking. The call had rattled her, but now that she thought about it, she shouldn\u2019t be surprised. She certainly had made it easy for Simone to find her. Not only had she put the letter in a Hamilton Hotel envelope, but she had also been at Aiden\u2019s side, and practically everyone in Sydney society knew who he was. There might as well have been a neon arrow over the hotel pointing to her whereabouts.</p><p>Now what? Cordie couldn\u2019t squelch her anger long enough to think like a logical person. She didn\u2019t know what she should do\u2014if anything. She decided to put it aside for now, until she could think clearly and calmly. The gift shop. She suddenly remembered she was heading downstairs to buy a bottle of the hotel\u2019s special body lotion. Maybe by the time she met Aiden for lunch she could be reasonable again.</p><p>The lobby was crowded with guests checking in and out. She skirted her way around a large group of businessmen and headed to the corridor that led to the gift shop. Adjacent to the hallway was a beautiful floor-to-ceiling crackled mirror and in front of it was a mahogany table with a huge vase of fresh-cut flowers. The colors were spectacular, and Cordie stopped to admire the arrangement. As she was leaning over to take in the wonderful fragrance of the hyacinths, she glanced into the mirror and froze. Over her right shoulder she saw the reflection of Simone Rayburn walking toward the front desk. There were two men behind her, and Cordie couldn\u2019t tell if they were with Simone or not. Wearing dark suits with solid conservative ties, they reminded her of CIA agents she\u2019d seen in movies: stiff and unapproachable. One of them was of medium height with a stocky build and thick, wavy hair. His bushy eyebrows shaded dark eyes with deep lines around them, and his mouth seemed to be dragged down by the Fu Manchu mustache that ended at his jowl line. The other man with him was tall. His head was bald, most likely shaved to give a strong, manly appearance, but his attempt to be macho was contradicted by the round wire-rimmed glasses that made him look like a midlife-crisis Harry Potter. The two men followed at a discreet distance, and when Simone stopped at the desk, they paused, too. They were definitely with her. They were looking around the lobby, and Cordie knew they would eventually spot her once the crowd thinned out.</p><p>\u201cCordelia?\u201d Louis, the general manager of the hotel, was walking toward her from the hallway.</p> <p>She flinched at the sound of her name but quickly recovered and smiled. She didn\u2019t waste time on pleasantries. \u201cI have a favor to ask. Would you please stay in the lobby? The woman in the blue suit talking to the concierge, and the two men she brought along want to talk to me. It isn\u2019t going to be . . . amiable. Will you stay close by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Would you like me to sit in on the meeting with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded, then said, \u201cHere she comes. I believe I\u2019ll post two guards at the front door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully this will be quick,\u201d Cordie said. She braced herself and turned around.</p><p>Simone had recognized her and was waiting for Cordie to come to her. They met in the center of the lobby.</p><p>Cordie\u2019s greeting wasn\u2019t cordial. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Simone didn\u2019t seem fazed by Cordie\u2019s anger. \u201cI thought we could go somewhere private to talk. There\u2019s so much to say.\u201d She motioned to the men behind her.</p><p>Cordie watched them walk past Simone and come toward her. Oh hell no. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you. Why would you think I would?\u201d</p><p>The man with the Harry Potter glasses grabbed Cordie\u2019s upper arm with a tight grip. She was astonished. Did Simone think she could drag Cordie out of the hotel?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wish to be seen with you,\u201d Simone whispered. \u201cWe look so much alike. I know a lot of people, and they\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Cordie looked down at the hand squeezing her as the thug forcefully pulled her away. She tried to yank her arm from his grasp as she screamed at the top of her voice, \u201cLet go of me!\u201d</p><p>Every person in the lobby turned toward her. Several men started forward to offer assistance, including Louis, who was all but running to her.</p><p>Simone gasped. \u201cBloody . . . Charles, let go of her. Arnold, step back.\u201d</p><p>They quickly obeyed. When they moved to stand behind Simone again, Cordie put her hand up so Louis and the others would know she was okay.</p><p>\u201cYou have a choice, Simone. Or should I call you Natalie just for fun?\u201d</p><p>Simone\u2019s face became a mask. She wasn\u2019t giving anything away.</p><p>Cordie pointed to the other side of the lobby. \u201cYou can either sit over there at one of the tables by the bar and talk, or you can leave. Which is it? I\u2019m rooting for the second.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Simone walked to the tables. She chose one cast in shadows and sat with her back to the lobby. The men who came with her stayed where they were. Cordie took her time following. When she finally sat down at the table across from Simone, she stared at the woman and waited. Simone couldn\u2019t quite meet her gaze. She nervously crossed her legs and brushed imaginary lint off her skirt, stalling while she gathered her thoughts and chose the perfect words to say.</p><p>Impatient, Cordie repeated the first words she\u2019d said to her. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Simone finally looked at Cordie. \u201cThat is the very question I have for you. Do you want money to keep silent? How much will it take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want money.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t think Simone believed her, and that guess was confirmed when Simone said, \u201cYour father is a mechanic. Of course you want money.\u201d</p><p>Cordie laughed. \u201cNo, I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Simone demanded, her frustration rising to the surface. She drummed her perfectly manicured fingernails on the tabletop. \u201cDo you want an apology? Does Andrew? An explanation? I was young, very young. I didn\u2019t even know I was pregnant until it was too late to do anything about it.\u201d</p><p>Lovely, Cordie thought. \u201cShould I feel sorry for you because you couldn\u2019t abort me?\u201d</p><p>Simone shook her head. \u201cNo, of course not. This isn\u2019t going the way I thought it would. You\u2019re a very . . . hostile young lady.\u201d</p><p>Cordie wasn\u2019t going to argue. She was hostile.</p><p>\u201cHow is your father?\u201d Simone asked. Her voice was softer now. \u201cTell him I\u2019m sorry if I caused him pain.\u201d In the blink of an eye her voice hardened. \u201cDid he send you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevenge, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come here seeking revenge because I left you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cI had a wonderful childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you come here?\u201d Simone asked with actual bewilderment.</p><p>If Simone weren\u2019t sitting there looking at her so disdainfully, Cordie might have had just the slightest speck of sympathy for her, but the woman was so caught up in her self-absorbed world she didn\u2019t have a clue. There wasn\u2019t an ounce of regret or contrition for what she had done. Her grand deception was a thing of the past, a fluke. If it didn\u2019t impact her life, it wasn\u2019t important.</p><p>The scene Cordie had witnessed at the ball came back to her. Simone was surrounded by her friends and devoted family. By all appearances, her two sons were affectionate, even solicitous, toward their mother. Her husband seemed to genuinely care for her, and her father, the patriarch of the family, obviously had a strong bond with his daughter, because she clearly did not want to upset or disappoint him. She was loved and admired, and she lived in a world that never knew Natalie Smith.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to understand,\u201d Cordie answered, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to me that you know there\u2019s someone out there who sees you for who you really are.\u201d</p><p>Simone leaned forward with a look as cold as ice. \u201cYou asked me what I want . . . ,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home and keep quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I give you my word, how will you know I\u2019ll keep it?\u201d</p><p>Simone paled, but the steely tone in her voice did not change. \u201cI won\u2019t know. I can\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Cordie saw Aiden walk into the hotel and head in the direction of the atrium. He was in a hurry, and since they were supposed to meet at noon, she thought he would be looking for her. Time to wrap up this twisted reunion, she decided.</p><p>She stood to leave, but before she walked away, she got the final word. \u201cI\u2019m going home tomorrow, and it is my sincere hope that I never have to speak to you again. You deceived a good and honorable man, and you abandoned your child. Do you honestly think I would tell anyone about you? You\u2019re an embarrassment.\u201d</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>Aiden was livid. Louis had texted him to let him know about Simone and the two enforcers she\u2019d brought along to the hotel, and when he heard that they had tried to take Cordelia, he went ballistic.</p><p>He all but shouted at her. \u201cThe second that son of a bitch put his hand on you he should have been thrown out of the hotel. What was Louis thinking? Why didn\u2019t he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came running. You can\u2019t be angry with him.\u201d</p><p>Aiden and Cordie were standing together in the security room. She thought she had entered NORAD when she\u2019d first walked in. There were monitors everywhere. The room was the size of their suite\u2014maybe bigger\u2014and one of the technicians was pulling up the footage of what Cordie called the incident. Aiden\u2019s words were a little more descriptive: \u201cI\u2019m going to smash that bastard\u2019s face in.\u201d Cordie had never seen him so furious.</p><p>She had been nervous at first when she\u2019d caught up with him in the lobby. She didn\u2019t know how he would react to her after their passionate night together, and she was feeling self-conscious and a bit unsure of herself. Would things be awkward between them now? She had her answer within seconds. All her concerns were eliminated when Aiden heard about her unexpected visitors. He immediately took charge and began to bark out orders. He was the old Aiden again, confident and in control, and his attitude toward her was no different than it had been. He was still as bossy as ever.</p><p>\u201cHere it is,\u201d the technician said. \u201cDo you want audio, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can listen to conversations in the lobby?\u201d Cordie didn\u2019t know if she should be appalled or impressed. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t listen to other people\u2019s private conversations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Aiden agreed. Then to the technician he said, \u201cIsolate the audio and play it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAiden, that can\u2019t be legal,\u201d Cordie complained.</p><p>He didn\u2019t agree or disagree. His hands shoved into his pockets, he stood behind the technician and watched the monitor. Neither he nor Cordie said another word while they listened to a replay of the horrible conversation she\u2019d had with Simone. She was amazed that the technician could remove background noise just by adjusting some knobs. She kept glancing up at Aiden to gauge his reaction, but there wasn\u2019t any, until Simone whispered that she didn\u2019t want to be seen with Cordie, followed by Cordelia\u2019s scream. He smiled then. Cordie had to admit the look on Simone\u2019s face was priceless. She looked as though she\u2019d just noticed she wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes.</p><p>\u201cFreeze the frames and get two good photos of those men, and send them to this number,\u201d Aiden ordered as he handed a card to the tech. \u201cSend them to me as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, taking Cordie\u2019s hand. \u201cGood work, Harold.\u201d He opened the door for her. \u201cMaybe we should cancel lunch. We can eat here in the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Did we miss our reservation?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI thought you might want to stay in after your encounter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d she answered decisively. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ve got until three thirty.\u201d</p><p>Cavanaugh was waiting in the car. It wasn\u2019t until they were on their way that Aiden asked her what she was doing at three thirty.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to the spa?\u201d he wondered.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied. She looked out the window and sighed. It was a clear, sunny day. The harbor was stunning, with shards of light piercing the sparkling water.</p><p>\u201cThis is a beautiful city,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWhat are you doing at three thirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an appointment at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have guessed that\u2019s where you\u2019d want to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy academic advisor back home has arranged for me to meet a couple of the researchers working on genome sequencing. It\u2019s exciting work,\u201d she said enthusiastically, adding, \u201cand I\u2019m dying to see the DNA-inspired staircase. It\u2019s a spiral. I\u2019ve seen photos, of course, but I want to see it up close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had hoped you would stay inside the hotel until we fly home tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t miss Garvan.\u201d She was appalled by the possibility. \u201cWhat has you worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has me worried?\u201d His tone was curt. \u201cI just watched your meeting with Simone. Did you look at those two men with her? They\u2019re dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Simone had her say, and I made it clear I wouldn\u2019t make trouble.\u201d</p><p>Aiden was annoyed by her naive interpretation of the conversation. \u201cThey were going to drag you out of the hotel. What makes you think they won\u2019t try again? And don\u2019t tell me you trust that woman to leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized how upset he was until she noticed his clenched jaw.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go anywhere without me,\u201d he commanded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m betting you\u2019ll love the Garvan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, I\u2019m going with you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then changed the subject. \u201cWho did you send those photos to? You handed the tech a business card . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam,\u201d he answered. \u201cI figure we might need his help. Besides, he might know those men. He\u2019ll check them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him around you,\u201d Aiden admitted. \u201cBut I trust Alec\u2019s judgment, and he says Liam\u2019s good at what he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you figured out what that is?\u201d</p><p>Aiden laughed. \u201cNot really. I just know we want him on our side.\u201d</p><p>The conversation ended when Cavanaugh pulled up in front of the Empire building. The restaurant was on the top floor, and all the windows overlooked the water. They were shown into a large private room. As it turned out, it was a working lunch for Aiden. There was a group of sixteen men and women waiting for him, and the talk centered on permits and expansion. Cordie was impressed with Aiden\u2019s negotiating skills. He was fair yet got everything he wanted and then some. The women ogled him, but she couldn\u2019t be angry. The man was gorgeous. There had been a time she had ogled him, too.</p><p>The food at the Empire was delicious. She ate every bit of her fish. How could she not? It was so fresh it wiggled on her plate. At the end of the lunch most of the guests lingered, and she was able to meet and talk to some of them. They were an eclectic group of politicians, community leaders, contractors, and business owners, and she was impressed by how cordial and welcoming they were toward her. After a couple of conversations, though, she realized several of the men thought she worked for Aiden. One asked her if she would like to go to dinner; another asked if he could show her some of the city that tourists didn\u2019t know about; and yet another just wanted to \u201chang out\u201d with her. She graciously declined all the invitations.</p><p>Once they were back in the car, Aiden asked, \u201cHow bored were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, I wasn\u2019t bored. They\u2019re interesting people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many men hit on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were just being friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d He was frowning now.</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like hearing that. \u201cThey knew you were with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey thought I worked for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never get anything done if you worked for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a complaint or flattery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA complaint, of course. You distract me.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem at all bothered by it.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re rude,\u201d she said sweetly. Before he could comment, she leaned forward in her seat and said, \u201cCavanaugh, is the Garvan far from here? I don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in ten minutes,\u201d the driver promised. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a little early.\u201d</p><p>Aiden glanced up from answering a text on his phone. \u201cYou\u2019re looking forward to the Garvan, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she said. She could barely contain her enthusiasm. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see their new genome-sequencing machine and talk to some of the researchers. They\u2019re doing such wonderful work. I think you\u2019ll be impressed with the facility, too.\u201d</p><p>As it turned out, he was impressed, so much so he promised to make a donation. He didn\u2019t seem to be in any hurry, and they stayed longer than they probably should have, taking up valuable work time, but everyone was so gracious, and Cordie had at least fifty questions. When they were leaving, one of the directors suggested she send him her r\u00e9sum\u00e9.</p><p>On the way back to the hotel Aiden asked her if she would ever consider working at the Garvan.</p><p>\u201cI think Sydney would be a wonderful place to live, and the people here\u2014most people\u2014are very friendly and kindhearted, but as long as the Rayburns are living here, no. I want to be as far away from them as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you far away from them, too.\u201d</p><p>They returned to the hotel and went directly to their suite. She noticed there were two security guards posted in front of the private elevator. She knew Aiden was responsible but didn\u2019t ask if it was necessary because she knew he\u2019d get huffy about it. One couldn\u2019t be too careful. He\u2019d say that or something similar.</p><p>It seemed to Cordie that Aiden never stopped working. He took his suit jacket off and loosened his tie, which, for him, was casual attire during the week. Then he sat down at his desk, opened his laptop, and for the next couple of hours didn\u2019t move. At dinnertime they ordered room service, and Aiden didn\u2019t waste time on chitchat. After eating, he put on his suit jacket, adjusted his tie, and went downstairs to meet some associates in the bar. He would have dragged her along if she hadn\u2019t promised again and again that she wouldn\u2019t leave the suite.</p><p>She was happy to be rid of him for a little while. She thought the way he worried about her was very considerate, but he was a little overzealous about it. A man had grabbed her arm, yes. And yes, it had been his intention to take her out of the hotel against her wishes. Still, he hadn\u2019t threatened her or hurt her. He was only following Simone\u2019s orders, and all she\u2019d wanted was privacy for their talk.</p><p>After Cordie packed for the trip home, she took a shower and put on a black silk camisole and matching boxer shorts. More than anything she wanted to talk to Regan and Sophie and tell them more about meeting Simone, but she didn\u2019t want to e-mail or talk over the phone. This needed to be an in-person conversation. She put on the terry-cloth robe, grabbed her lip balm and tube of hand lotion, and went into the living room. Restless, she curled up on the sofa and turned on the television with the remote. There was a special program on about great white sharks, and by the time it ended, she swore she would never go into the ocean again. Channel surfing, she found an old Sherlock Holmes mystery on the BBC. She settled in and tried to pay attention, but her mind wouldn\u2019t cooperate. She couldn\u2019t believe how tired she was, and it wasn\u2019t even ten o\u2019clock yet. Stress, she decided, was the culprit. She was anxious to get back home.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Simone. She\u2019d never met such a cold, self-involved woman. How could Cordie\u2019s father have loved her? Was it possible that Simone was different back then, when she was pretending to be Natalie Smith? Cordie doubted it. Maybe she was also pretending to be a decent, loving person. Maybe she\u2019d been pretending all her life, never letting people see what was truly in her heart. Cordie\u2019s encounter with Simone had been tense and upsetting, but it was behind her now. As she seemed to be doing over and over again, she vowed to let go of the past and move on.</p><p>Aiden came back to the suite much sooner than she expected. He looked tired, too. He barely said hello before he disappeared into his bedroom. Twenty minutes later he came back out. He had showered and was wearing sweats and a T-shirt. He moved her feet out of his way and sat next to her. His chest was still damp from the shower, and the T-shirt was molded to him. She tried not to stare, but God, he was ripped. His body was amazing.</p><p>\u201cAre you watching this?\u201d he asked, pointing to the television.</p><p>\u201cNot really. You can change it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe news should be coming on.\u201d He looked around at the tables and down at the floor. \u201cWhere\u2019s the remote?\u201d</p><p>It took a while to locate it. He found her tube of hand lotion wedged between the cushions and her lip balm under the sofa. The remote was caught up in her robe. She stood and untied her belt, and the remote dropped to the floor.</p><p>The instant Aiden saw what she was wearing, all reason went out the window. Their eyes met, and no words were necessary. He gently pulled her down onto his lap. His eyes delved deep into hers as he slowly removed her robe and tossed it on the floor. Her camisole was next. Then he pulled off his shirt, and his gaze moved down to her beautiful breasts.</p><p>Cordie knew with one word she could stop him, but she didn\u2019t want to. After the awful confrontation with Simone, she needed to lose herself in him. She didn\u2019t care that all he felt for her was lust, that she was a convenience, nothing more. No, tonight she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She slid her arms around his neck and traced his lower lip with the tip of her tongue. When his hands roughly cupped her br**sts and his thumbs brushed across her nipples, she sucked in a breath and held it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this all day,\u201d he whispered. One hand moved to the back of her neck. \u201cHow many times do you want to come tonight?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak. It was all she could do to breathe. He didn\u2019t wait for an answer. His mouth covered hers in a long, intense kiss. His tongue slid inside, coaxing her to respond. For long minutes he kissed and caressed her until they were both desperate for more. He swept her up in his arms and carried her into his bedroom and laid her on his bed. Her silk shorts tore in his impatience to remove them. Kicking off his sweats, he covered her body with his. He wouldn\u2019t let her move, pinning her to the bed as he slowly moved down her body to kiss every part of her. He didn\u2019t have to ask her if she was ready for him. Her need was so intense, her nails dug into his skin. When he entered her, the pleasure shattered her into a million pieces, and she cried out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so tight.\u201d He sighed. \u201cSo perfect.\u201d</p><p>He began to move, harder, deeper, and faster until Cordie couldn\u2019t hold back. She tightened all around him and clung to him, letting out a shout as she cl**axed. The sensations coursing through her seemed to go on and on. It was both glorious and frightening. She was spiraling down, letting herself fall into the all-consuming rapture, and she never wanted to come back up. Aiden accommodated her. His endurance was incredible. She had two more orgasms before he finally found his own release.</p><p>It took much longer for Aiden to recover this time, longer, too, to let go of her. He was panting when he lifted up and looked into her eyes. He could see the passion was still there, which pleased him considerably. She was so responsive to his touch, so honest and giving. He kissed her again, long and hard; then, as before, he got out of bed without a word and went into the bathroom.</p><p>Cordie watched him disappear behind the closed door. She dropped back onto the pillow and laughed. No pillow talk, no cuddling, not even a high five. Her legs trembled and she felt weak as she got out of bed and walked into the living room. Dehydration, she decided, was the cause. That . . . and lots of sex. She found her robe, slipped it on, and got a bottle of water from the bar refrigerator, guzzling it down like a teenager at a keg party.</p><p>The phone rang. Normally she would have thought whoever was calling wasn\u2019t very considerate, since it was after eleven, but Aiden got calls from all over the world, night and day.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably Liam,\u201d Aiden called out.</p><p>Cordie answered the phone expecting to hear Liam\u2019s distinct British accent. It wasn\u2019t Liam, but she recognized the voice. It was the same man who had called earlier asking for her father.</p><p>Now he was asking again. \u201cIs Andrew Kane there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he be back soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you his daughter?\u201d</p><p>Should she let him know her father had died? No, she wasn\u2019t going tell him or Simone anything. \u201cYes, I am,\u201d she replied.</p><p>His voice turned sinister. \u201cAre you waiting for a payout?\u201d</p><p>A payout? Apparently Cordie hadn\u2019t convinced Simone she wasn\u2019t here to blackmail her. Of course Simone would think she wanted money. That was all she cared about. Cordie\u2019s answer was emphatic. \u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou came here to make trouble, didn\u2019t you?

If you tell anyone, if you even suggest . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes . . . ?\u201d She deliberately drew out the word to irritate him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll feed you to the crocodiles. I\u2019ll put a bullet in the back of your head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is it?\u201d she asked. \u201cFeed me to the crocodiles or put a bullet in my head? Make up your mind.\u201d She slammed the phone down. When she turned around, she was shocked to see Aiden standing behind her. \u201cWhat are you? A ninja? How long have you been standing there?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think the question needed an answer. \u201cWho was on the phone? Who the\u2014\u201d He stopped himself before he said a foul word. \u201cWho was threatening you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>The phone rang again. \u201cDon\u2019t answer it. I\u2019ll get it.\u201d He frowned at Cordie while he listened to the caller. \u201cNo, we\u2019re both awake. Come on up.\u201d</p><p>Come on up? The second he ended the call she demanded to know who was visiting at this hour.</p><p>\u201cLiam.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh God. I\u2019m naked, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re wearing a robe,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut yeah, you should probably put on some clothes.\u201d He was talking to air. Cordie had disappeared into her bedroom and shut the door.</p><p>\u201cWho was on the damn phone?\u201d he shouted through the door as he put on his T-shirt.</p><p>The bell sounded for the elevator. The door opened and Liam walked into the foyer.</p><p>Aiden greeted him with a question. \u201cDid you go into the security room and look at the footage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cI listened to the audio, too.\u201d He added, shaking his head, \u201cThey really thought they could drag her from the hotel.\u201d</p><p>Cordie rushed out to join them. She\u2019d put on jeans and a white blouse. She hadn\u2019t taken the time to tuck it in, and she hadn\u2019t bothered with shoes either. A quick brush through her hair had taken out the tangles. Aiden tried not to react. Every time he looked at her, she became more beautiful. Her face was flushed, and he thought he could see some slight scratches on her neck from his day\u2019s growth of whiskers. For some inexplicable reason, he liked that.</p><p>\u201cHello, Liam,\u201d Cordie said. She felt the color warming her cheeks and wondered if Liam could see what she was thinking or could tell what she and Aiden had been doing just minutes before. She was relieved when he didn\u2019t seem to detect her embarrassment. He greeted her with a wide grin and a big hug.</p> <p>Aiden felt a surge of possessiveness and thought it might be fun to throw Liam down the elevator shaft. It was crazy, his reaction. What was wrong with him? Fortunately, he was a master at keeping his emotions hidden. He\u2019d done it most of his life.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said hello. Now let go of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d Cordie offered, stepping back.</p><p>\u201cI could use a beer. I\u2019ll get it,\u201d Liam said, and headed to the bar.</p><p>Cordie was about to sit on the sofa when she noticed her black camisole. Mortified, she grabbed it and stuffed it behind the cushion a second before Liam sat down across from her.</p><p>Aiden stood over Cordie as he explained to Liam, \u201cSomeone called and threatened to kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the first call,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Aiden was incredulous. \u201cHe\u2019s called more than once?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI recognized the voice. He called earlier today and asked to speak to my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s dead,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>Exasperated, she replied. \u201cI know. I was at the funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to ask if you told him your father was dead,\u201d Aiden clarified.</p><p>\u201cNo, I just told him he wasn\u2019t here, and he said he would call back later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the second phone call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked to speak to my father again, and then he threatened me. He said if I didn\u2019t keep quiet he would feed me to the crocodiles and put a bullet in my head. He was making me mad, but I probably shouldn\u2019t have taunted him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cI asked him to make up his mind.\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled. \u201cAren\u2019t you going back to Chicago tomorrow? The last time I checked there weren\u2019t any crocodiles in Lake Michigan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she agreed. \u201cSo I guess it\u2019s a bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be flippant about this,\u201d Aiden snapped.</p><p>\u201cWill you settle someplace, please, and stop hovering over me?\u201d</p><p>He dropped down beside her. \u201cWhat did you find out about the men with Simone?\u201d he asked Liam.</p><p>\u201cThey work as bodyguards, and both have squeaky-clean records. Never had a single complaint lodged against them, yet they tried to drag a woman out of a hotel lobby packed with people. Pretty damned gutsy for squeaky-clean bodyguards, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>Aiden nodded. \u201cKeep looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had to have been hired by Simone. She couldn\u2019t very well have asked her husband or her father,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>Liam put his beer on the table. \u201cLet me tell you about the Taylor/Rayburn family and their little empire.\u201d He leaned forward and braced his arms on his knees. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty guarded about their personal lives and their business dealings, so it took some digging to get any information on them. Their wealth and power come from Merrick Enterprises, a company that was built by Simone\u2019s grandfather, Howard Merrick. Some would say he was a ruthless businessman, but you don\u2019t take over in business like he did without getting rid of your competition. He started out investing in real estate and branched out into other areas of construction and manufacturing from there. Estimates say the company\u2019s worth hundreds of millions today.</p><p>\u201cWhen Merrick died, the estate, including his business, went to his firstborn, Alice, who by then had married Julian Taylor. Alice had no interest in business and, by all accounts, was a rather weak, sickly woman. This left the door open for her husband, Julian, to take over. To this day, Julian runs the company. Merrick Enterprises was successful when he took charge, but he\u2019s increased its value many times over. He controls everything and everyone with an iron fist. Simone seems to be intimidated by him. My guess is that she\u2019s become so accustomed to her cushy life, she\u2019s afraid of anything that will disrupt it.</p><p>\u201cSimone\u2019s husband, Craig Rayburn, is second-in-command at the company. Now, there\u2019s an interesting guy. He grew up in a small town in Western Australia and came to Sydney right out of school. His first job at Merrick Enterprises was as an assistant to a regional manager, but he was ambitious. Most would say he was obsessed. Within a few years he had worked his way up to being head of one of Merrick\u2019s real estate companies, and that\u2019s when Julian took a personal interest. If there\u2019s anything that turns Julian on, it\u2019s ambition\u2014that and the ability to take orders, and in Craig\u2019s case, do what your father-in-law demands. Julian began to turn more and more responsibility over to Craig, and it became apparent to everyone that he was the chosen one. Marriage to Julian\u2019s daughter cinched the deal. Craig\u2019s landed in a pot of gold and he\u2019s loving every minute of it. He has all the trappings: big mansion, yacht, vacation home on his own island. You name it. He\u2019s become quite the mogul and is destined to take over when Julian steps down, though it\u2019s a pretty good guess, as long as Julian\u2019s alive, Craig will be his puppet.</p><p>\u201cAnd that brings us to the two sons, Glen and Knox. Grandpa Julian has been grooming them since they were born. Talk about chips off the old block. They go to the best schools and even now are being molded in Julian\u2019s image. I haven\u2019t found the details of their inheritance yet, but they\u2019re most likely going to take over when the time comes. There\u2019s no doubt they\u2019ll be taking orders from Julian and Craig for years to come.</p><p>\u201cSimone, despite her misspent youth, has reinvented herself. While the men are off making all that money, she has become one of the grand dames of society. The role really suits her. She lends her name to a couple of charity boards, and the good people of Sydney have all but canonized her. She was even named Woman of the Year by some philanthropic organization a couple of years ago.</p><p>\u201cJulian puts his family on display as though they\u2019re God\u2019s gift to Australia. Every month or so there will be an article in the news about some charity event the family\u2019s involved in. Ask anyone in Sydney. They\u2019ll tell you Julian Taylor and the Rayburn family are just swell, not a black sheep among them. They\u2019re a little too Stepford if you ask me, but they\u2019re definitely a Julian Taylor creation.\u201d</p><p>Cordie listened to Liam\u2019s report on the family with rapt attention. When he was finished, she sat back and mulled over what he had discovered. \u201cSimone has a lot to lose if her secret gets out,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anyone found out she abandoned her husband and child, her standing in the community would be gone, and her entire family would suffer. The disgrace and humiliation would destroy her.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cSo the question is: How far would she go to keep her secret safe?\u201d</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>Aiden wasn\u2019t quite so hostile toward Liam now. They continued to talk about Julian Taylor and his brood, and the more Cordie heard, the happier she was that she was going home and wouldn\u2019t have to worry about seeing any of them again.</p><p>She left the men to their discussion, said good night, and went to bed. She could hear the low voices in the other room talking about Simone and the members of her family. She didn\u2019t want to think about that vile woman anymore. How long would it take to get Simone out of her head? Regan and Sophie were right. She never should have come here, never should have started this, never should have let her anger control her. It was so unlike her not to be logical. Yet, since she found out the truth about Simone, she had been too enraged to be rational. She hadn\u2019t been thinking at all. As appalling as it was to admit, she had let her emotions control her.</p><p>And then there was Aiden. She knew what was going to happen once they were back in Chicago. He would return to his skinny, flat-chested blondes, and she would finish getting her house ready to sell and move to Boston. Dear God, how depressing.</p><p>Tomorrow she would remember why she was moving on. Tonight she needed him. She wanted to sleep in his arms because with him she felt safe and protected. She thought she heard the elevator bell and was pretty certain Liam had just left. Still, she wasn\u2019t going to walk into the living room without a stitch of clothing. She slipped her robe on, took a deep breath, and opened the door.</p><p>Aiden was taking off his T-shirt again. He noticed her watching him and stilled. \u201cLiam just left.\u201d</p><p>She untied her belt. \u201cI thought I heard the bell.\u201d</p><p>Aiden waited to see what she would do. She was blushing, which he thought was sweet. She was acting shy, but he knew what she was like in bed. She was just as wild as he was, just as crazed.</p><p>Cordie removed her robe and let it drop to the floor. She walked toward him, and the way he looked at her made her feel like the sexiest woman in the world. When she reached him, she put her arms around his neck, stretched up on her tiptoes, and nibbled on his earlobe. \u201cI want to sleep with you.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her into his arms. \u201cYou can sleep on the plane.\u201d</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It was hot and humid in Chicago. Cordie hadn\u2019t gotten much sleep on the way home, and she was feeling jet-lagged and sleep deprived. She didn\u2019t even know what day it was, but she blamed that on the time change.</p><p>Aiden rode with her from the airport. He carried in her luggage, kissed her good-bye, and he was gone. She was too tired to care if and when she would see him again. She knew he wasn\u2019t going to be getting much sleep with all the problems waiting for him. Just before they left Sydney, he\u2019d received a text from his brother Spencer letting him know that Walker, accompanied by medical personnel, had flown back to Chicago and was now recuperating at the Hamilton. He had been scheduled to enter a rehab facility where he would receive physical therapy daily but at the last minute had changed his mind. Spencer ended his message with a warning to Aiden that Walker was being a real pain.</p><p>There was also an issue with the expansion of the Miami Hamilton, and Aiden had mentioned he would be flying out in the next day or two. He didn\u2019t seem to need much sleep, and she worried that one day it would catch up with him. She, on the other hand, needed six hours every night.</p><p>Feeling like a zombie, she crawled into bed and slept for a solid eight hours. She still dragged all the next day. She drove to the supermarket to get milk and bread and a few other necessities and by the time she was finished shopping and on her way back home, she was wiped out.</p><p>Dark clouds were gathering overhead, and she felt the first drops of rain as she hurried up the steps to her door. Shifting the heavy bags to one arm, she fumbled through her purse for her house key and inserted it into the lock, but the door opened before she could turn the key. That was odd, she thought. It was unlike her to forget to lock her door, especially after the lecture Aiden had given her when he\u2019d found it unlocked. She\u2019d learned to be very safety conscious since then. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d been so careless, but then, her head was still fuzzy from the trip home. Balancing the bags in both arms again, she went inside and kicked the door closed behind her. Only a few steps in, she tripped over something in her way. One bag of groceries went flying, and she juggled to control the other as she grabbed the banister to keep from banging her head. Her shin throbbed in pain. When she looked down to see what had caused the spill, she found one of her moving boxes sitting precariously in her pathway. After limping into the kitchen and depositing her bag on the kitchen table, she returned to the front hall to pick up the scattered groceries.</p><p>Puzzled, she stood and stared at the errant box for a few seconds. She could have sworn she had the boxes stacked three high against the wall. How did this one end up on the floor? It was too heavy to topple off the stack by itself, and she certainly didn\u2019t recall taking it down. As she dropped the loose groceries back into the bag and took it to the kitchen, she tried to make sense of what had just happened. True, she\u2019d been in a bit of a fog the last day or so, but she\u2019d never been this careless before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe Aiden was responsible. He was messing with her head. She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him. Where was he now? What was he doing? She had to move on, she told herself. It wasn\u2019t quite so easy, though, especially after the sex-filled nights she\u2019d spent with him. She couldn\u2019t think about that without feeling the heat.</p><p>The remodel in Boston was moving at a snail\u2019s pace. The rooms still hadn\u2019t been painted, and the floors hadn\u2019t been refinished. Nick left a message for her that there was an issue with the roof and he was going to pay for a new one. Unfortunately, the roofers couldn\u2019t start for another two weeks.</p><p>Boston was key to her plan for moving on, but for now she was stuck in Chicago. She vowed to stay away from the Hamilton Hotel so she wouldn\u2019t see him. She didn\u2019t expect him to call her . . . but would he? Was he thinking about her at all? Oh God, she was acting like a teenager.</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Regan and Sophie were anxious to see Cordie but were letting her get some rest. They gave her a couple of days to recover, and then Regan invited her to dinner. She and Alec were renting a tiny house on the edge of Cordie\u2019s neighborhood and were trying to make time to look for a house to buy. Since Cordie lived on the way to the Buchanans\u2019 house, Jack and Sophie picked her up. Fortunately, Jack was behind the wheel, which meant Cordie didn\u2019t have to grip her seat and frantically pray that Sophie wouldn\u2019t get them killed.</p><p>Dinner was ready when they walked in, and after a quick greeting, they squeezed around a table meant for three. Regan was turning into a great cook. She served lasagna and a salad, and tiramisu for dessert. During dinner they talked about Sydney and how much Cordie loved it. She went into great detail about the Garvan and meeting some of the brilliant researchers.</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted to explore a little bit of Australia,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou mentioned wanting to see Melbourne and Perth. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met Simone,\u201d Cordie answered.</p><p>\u201cOkay, she brought it up,\u201d Sophie pointed out. \u201cNow we can talk about what happened with those people.\u201d Turning to Cordie she explained, \u201cRegan made us promise not to grill you until dinner was over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat was she like?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>\u201cVile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart at the beginning,\u201d Jack suggested. Alec nodded in agreement, but other than that he seemed content to sit back and observe and listen.</p><p>Without mentioning what had happened between Aiden and her, she told them everything. It took a long while because they all kept interrupting to ask more questions. Alec laughed when Cordie told them about Liam and how charming he was.</p><p>\u201cIs he with the police over there?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think he knows either,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The only time she mentioned Aiden was when she told them how furious he\u2019d been when he\u2019d learned about the two men who\u2019d accompanied Simone to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cOne of them grabbed you?\u201d Sophie was astounded. \u201cIn the lobby? That takes nerve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can understand why I wanted to come home.\u201d She went on to tell them about the anonymous phone calls.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it was one of the men with Simone who called you?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe threatened to kill you if you told anyone Simone was your mother?\u201d Regan shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty extreme, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s extreme,\u201d Cordie replied. \u201cI think they\u2019re all crazy. Liam said the family\u2019s reputation is on the line. He thinks they\u2019ll do anything to keep it pristine.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018They\u2019?\u201d Jack asked.</p> <p>\u201cSimone; her husband, Craig; and Simone\u2019s father, Julian. He runs that family with a tight fist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big enough scandal to ruin them, I suppose,\u201d Regan said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Cordie replied. \u201cThey\u2019re pillars of society right now. You should have seen the way they were fawned over at the ball. It was nauseating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd getting that kind of attention and adulation can become addictive for some people,\u201d Jack remarked. \u201cAlec and I have seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople have killed for less,\u201d Alec interjected.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine killing to keep a secret,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t think like Simone. Your values are different. The fact is, you\u2019re a threat to the family\u2019s little dynasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet she didn\u2019t believe you when you said you didn\u2019t want money,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you worried?\u201d Regan asked. \u201cYou\u2019re so calm about it all. Why aren\u2019t you freaking out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf the three of us, Cordie\u2019s always been the calm one,\u201d Sophie commented.</p><p>\u201cThe man was just trying to scare me,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as I don\u2019t put it out there and ruin Simone\u2019s perfect lie of a life, I\u2019ll be okay. Besides, you\u2019re forgetting, I don\u2019t want anyone to know I\u2019m related to those freaks. I wouldn\u2019t put it out there no matter what. I thought I made that clear to Simone, but apparently not, if she was asking, \u2018How can I trust you?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cI told her she shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be the reason he called to threaten you,\u201d Jack surmised.</p><p>Sophie carried her plate to the sink, then turned around and said, \u201cCordie, do you realize you just told two FBI agents that someone threatened you? They\u2019ll probably want to investigate.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cProbably?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam will run it,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cRun what?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cThe investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat investigation? There is no investigation,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>Ignoring her protest, Alec took out his phone and began to text. \u201cThere is now.\u201d</p><p>Cordie closed her eyes and rubbed her temples. \u201cCould we please talk about something else? I\u2019ve thought enough about Simone and her family in the last week to fill a lifetime.\u201d She turned to Regan. \u201cHow\u2019s Walker doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettling in,\u201d Regan answered. \u201cHe told Spencer he\u2019s going to start getting involved in the company business. Aiden won\u2019t like hearing that. He\u2019s in Miami now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how he does it. I\u2019m still jet-lagged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was Aiden in Sydney?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>Cordie wasn\u2019t sure what to say. Alec was so good at reading her. \u201cBusy. He was busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always busy,\u201d Regan said. \u201cI wish he would slow down and enjoy life.\u201d</p><p>Cordie couldn\u2019t understand why she was suddenly feeling so nervous. \u201cHe went with me to the Garvan,\u201d she blurted. \u201cHe asked me to send my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>They all looked confused.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Aiden want you to send him your r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>Cordie could feel her face turning red. \u201cNot Aiden. One of the directors asked me to send my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you work there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as long as the Borgias live there,\u201d she said with a shudder. She got up to clear the dishes and bumped her hip on the edge of the counter. Cordie thought living in such a tiny space\u2014even if it was temporary\u2014must be driving Regan and Alec crazy. Her kitchen was at least five times the size of theirs.</p><p>Sophie, Jack, and Regan went in the living room, and Alec stayed behind to help.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the hunt for a house going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI found one I really like,\u201d Alec said. \u201cRegan loves it, but she doesn\u2019t want to buy it.\u201d</p><p>Cordie put the Parmesan in the refrigerator. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense. Why doesn\u2019t she want to buy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she doesn\u2019t want you to move.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and then she laughed. \u201cYou want to buy my house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. He straddled a chair and motioned for her to sit. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy. I bought your brother\u2019s house, and now you\u2019re buying mine.\u201d</p><p>They talked about the house for several more minutes, and then Alec asked, \u201cAre you absolutely certain you want to move to Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better be,\u201d she said. \u201cI own your brother\u2019s town house.\u201d</p><p>Frowning now, he reminded her, \u201cYou love your house here, and you love this city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also love the house I just purchased, and I love Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you like teaching at St. Matthew\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did, but I\u2019m ready for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should take some more time to think about it.\u201d</p><p>She wanted Alec to stop pressing. Did he know the real reason she was leaving? She thought maybe he did. Regan and Sophie believed Cordie had gotten over her silly infatuation with Aiden a long time ago, but Alec was far more observant and not so easily fooled. She told herself it didn\u2019t matter. If he did know the truth, he would never tell anyone. Her secrets were safe with him.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re serious about buying my brownstone, it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>And the question of her moving was finally put to rest. Alec started talking about the changes he would make, and he became ridiculously enthusiastic when he described, in detail, how he would finish the basement and put in a wall-to-wall flat-screen 3-D television. He also had grand plans for the large backyard, quadrupling the size of the patio, for starters, to accommodate his new grill and smoker. Typical man, she thought. It was all about the barbecue. Hopefully, Regan would rein him in.</p><p>Reconnecting with her friends was comforting, and spilling her guts\u2014as Sophie would say\u2014about Simone was cathartic. She didn\u2019t get home until midnight, and, because she\u2019d been so absentminded these days, twice she checked to make sure her doors were locked before she went to bed.</p><p>The home appraisal and inspection were put on the schedule the next day, and aside from measuring for new drapes and choosing different paint colors for the walls, Regan and Alec weren\u2019t in any hurry to close on the house, which saved Cordie from having to put her things in storage. The house in Boston wasn\u2019t going to be ready for at least three weeks, maybe as many as four.</p><p>Since she didn\u2019t have to stage her house to sell it, she decided to do what her father had done when he sold his home and get rid of some of her furniture. The pretty but uncomfortable chairs were the first to go. Watching them being hauled off gave her a new sense of freedom. She got a little carried away then and donated everything but her books, her bed, a small table, and a couple of chairs. The only painting she kept was an abstract Alec\u2019s sister-in-law, Laurant, had painted for her. It was bold and empowering, and she loved it.</p><p>The following week was filled with meetings with bankers and attorneys to work out the financial details of her father\u2019s estate and other less important appointments and errands she needed to get done before she left for Boston. Every day was a whirlwind of activity. She couldn\u2019t pinpoint exactly when she started getting a weird feeling that someone was watching her, but the feeling was there, and it was growing stronger.</p><p>The first time she acknowledged her suspicion was after her dentist appointment. As she was walking toward her car in the parking garage, she heard footsteps behind her, keeping pace with her; but when she turned around, there wasn\u2019t anyone there. She didn\u2019t hear the sound again as she ran to her car. Had she just imagined it?</p><p>The next incident happened at the art gallery. She had gone there to say good-bye to all her favorite paintings and was alone in a large area she called the blue room. All of a sudden she felt a chill on the back of her neck, an intuitive sense that someone was standing behind her, but when she turned around, all she saw was a shadow crossing the doorway to the next exhibit. Was it just her overactive imagination again?</p><p>She got the strongest feeling the day she made a visit to her father\u2019s grave. When she drove into the cemetery, she noticed a dark sedan with tinted windows pull in behind her. It stayed several hundred feet away, and when she stopped her car and climbed the hill to the grave site, the car stopped, too. While she arranged the fresh flowers she\u2019d brought, she glanced over her shoulder several times. No one emerged from the sedan, but she had an intense sensation that she was being watched. She quickly gathered up her things and rushed back to her car. As she drove away, she checked in her rearview mirror. The black car was still sitting there.</p><p>She had no idea if her fears were valid, and without any kind of proof, she wasn\u2019t about to bother Alec or Jack. They were busy with their work, and she didn\u2019t want to become a nuisance. She decided to do a little detective work on her own. Walking down Michigan Avenue she stopped to window-shop and watch people coming and going in the reflection of the glass. That didn\u2019t get her anywhere, so she tried another trick. She pulled out her compact and applied blush to her cheeks, all the while looking in the mirror at the people behind her. She swiveled in a couple of directions to get a panoramic view. No one suspicious was ever there. After employing that method four or five times on her stroll, her cheeks were so red she was beginning to look like a clown.</p><p>On her way home, she decided she had been overreacting . . . or she was becoming paranoid. She couldn\u2019t blame her craziness on jet lag now. At least she wasn\u2019t obsessing about Aiden. That happened only at night when she was in bed and the memories of the way he had kissed her and caressed her made her melancholy. It was an awful way to go to sleep, but a ritual she kept repeating. The only bright thought she could muster was that everything would be better as soon as she was settled in her new home in Boston. Her imagination would stop running rampant, her instincts would get back to normal, and she could start a new life with a new house, new furniture, new everything.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>The phone calls between Sydney and Chicago were short and to the point.</p><p>He followed strict instructions. He was to call Sydney at precisely eleven o\u2019clock in the evening, Sydney time, which translated to eight o\u2019clock in the morning in Chicago. Unless of course there was an emergency. Then he was to call at any time, day or night.</p><p>He stood by the window of his hotel room, his cell phone gripped in his hand. He\u2019d already entered the phone number but waited until exactly eight o\u2019clock to make the call.</p><p>There was no greeting. \u201cWhat have you found out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s meeting with bankers and attorneys.\u201d He heard the indrawn breath, then a blasphemy, and he rushed on. \u201cI followed her to the cemetery the other day. She went to her father\u2019s grave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAndrew Kane is dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he die?\u201d There was no emotion behind the question.</p><p>\u201cNot long ago. There isn\u2019t a headstone yet. I\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the attorneys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re estate lawyers. Her father left her money, a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMillions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. He was a mechanic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you want me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look into her financials. I should have done that already. I had hoped to control her with money. Perhaps I still can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of need. No one can have enough. You know that. Is she talking to anyone about me, about the family? I want to get ahead of this. I need to know what she\u2019s planning. It\u2019s making me very . . . anxious. There\u2019s a lot to lose here.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t agree, but he didn\u2019t dare argue. It wasn\u2019t his place to express an opinion. \u201cYou don\u2019t think she will let it go and move on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course she won\u2019t. She\u2019s planning now. I\u2019m sure of it. That\u2019s what I would do. I\u2019d carefully plan. Is there anything else to report?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe has two close women friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you mentioned them last phone call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could destroy this family, destroy me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something more I\u2019ve discovered,\u201d he said. He\u2019d been holding this information, waiting for the right moment.</p><p>\u201cThe two women friends . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re married to FBI agents.\u201d</p> <p>A long minute of silence followed. Then a hiss. \u201cSomething has to be done before she ruins me. I don\u2019t want to worry that one day I\u2019ll turn on the television and see her giving an interview . . . telling everyone who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I understand.\u201d</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>She\u2019d had little time for her friends, and she was glad to hear from Regan, who called on Friday morning just to chat. She told Cordie that Sophie and Jack were going up north to a friend\u2019s lake house for the weekend. They would be back late Sunday. She also told her that there was a sale at Neiman Marcus. They talked for quite a while, and Regan happened to mention that Aiden was on his way home from the airport\u2014he should be landing any time now\u2014and she expected fireworks when he confronted Walker, who had made a deal with some congressman to build a new hotel. Regan continued with her news, but all Cordie heard was that Aiden was back in Chicago, and her heart skipped a beat. She didn\u2019t want to run into him, didn\u2019t want to chance seeing him with another woman. As long as she stayed away from the hotel, she figured, she would be okay.</p><p>After she ended the call with Regan, she was determined to avoid thinking about Aiden. Focusing on a few chores around her house wasn\u2019t working, so she decided to do some shopping. The weather was hot but bearable. She changed into a pale blue cotton sundress. The humidity was climbing, and her hair was reacting with its usual curl, so she went with her go-to hairstyle and pulled it back into a ponytail. By the time she reached the shops on Michigan Avenue, she was wilting and wondering why in God\u2019s name she\u2019d thought it was a good idea to wear heels. She stood at the curb with a crowd of men and women around her waiting for the light to change. Cars were zooming past. She spotted two former students, Sean Corrigan and Jayden Martin, across the street waiting for the light. She hadn\u2019t seen them since the funeral, when Jayden surprised everyone by giving his rather ambiguous testament to her father\u2019s kindness in the matter of a stolen car. Both were decent boys who struggled with authority. Jayden, especially, had big trust issues. Sean saw her and waved. Jayden gave her an abrupt nod, which made her smile. He still liked to act the tough guy, she thought.</p><p>What happened next defied logic. She had just glanced up at the light. One second she was watching for the signal to turn, and the next she was standing in front of a car barreling toward her. In a crazy attempt to ward off the inevitable, she put her hand out to try to stop it from happening and jumped back. The driver hit the brakes, but it was too late, and the vehicle, brakes screeching, slammed into her.</p><p>The impact threw her into the air. The left side of her body was struck first, and she was tossed onto the hood. Her shoulder and head hit the windshield, and as the car skidded to a stop, she was thrown again and ended up on the ground. She had never experienced such horrific pain. The world began to swirl above her, and she heard people screaming as everything faded to black. She was barely conscious, but she could make out the sounds of worried voices and blaring sirens before she drifted into oblivion.</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The emergency room physician and three specialists all told her how lucky she was to be alive. She didn\u2019t feel lucky. She felt as though she had just been hit by a car.</p><p>Her injuries weren\u2019t all that severe . . . considering. Her left arm was broken, the wrist was fractured, and she was bruised everywhere. She hadn\u2019t suffered a concussion or broken any other bones, which really was miraculous, she supposed. As soon as she was given something for the pain, she became coherent and was able to give the hospital staff the information they needed to fill out the paperwork. A nurse told her that her purse hadn\u2019t made it to the hospital with her. Either it had been left at the accident scene or someone had taken it. Her cell phone was missing, too.</p><p>A few minutes later she was given a shot that knocked her out, and the next time she opened her eyes, she was sporting a cast from her fingers to her elbow. And Aiden was standing at the foot of her bed. How was that possible? She closed her eyes, opened them again, and he was still there.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow did you know? The accident just happened . . . didn\u2019t it?\u201d Had she been asleep for hours . . . or days?</p><p>\u201cAlec phoned the hotel looking for Regan. The staff couldn\u2019t locate her. Spencer and I had just walked into the office and heard the news. We turned around and came right over. You gave me quite a scare. Don\u2019t ever do that again.\u201d He was scolding her, but there was worry in his voice. He added, \u201cAlec and Spencer are here. They\u2019re talking to the police right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did Alec know?\u201d</p><p>She was struggling to sit up, so Aiden walked to the side of the bed and pushed a button until she was upright.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Alec explain,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Horrible, she wanted to say. Really horrible. Her entire body was aching. Her arm throbbed. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said, and even she could hear how pathetic she sounded.</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell.\u201d He actually smiled while he insulted her.</p><p>\u201cLet me run over you with my car a couple of times, and I\u2019ll bet you\u2019ll look like hell, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have two black eyes.\u201d Spencer made the announcement as he pulled the curtain back. \u201cPut on a cape and you\u2019ll look like Zorro.\u201d</p><p>Alec joined them. He winced when he saw her and said what he was thinking. \u201cYou look bad.\u201d</p><p>Spencer stood beside him at the foot of the bed and nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you people know how to be sympathetic?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>All three of them shook their heads. For some inexplicable reason, they made her feel a little better.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want us to lie to you, do you?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I really do.\u201d Turning to Alec she asked, \u201cHow did you find out I was in an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called you on your cell phone to ask you a house question, and some kid answered. He wouldn\u2019t tell me his name. He said that Miss Kane was hit by a car and was on her way to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like one of your students, calling you Miss Kane,\u201d Spencer said.</p><p>She suddenly remembered seeing Sean and Jayden at the stoplight. \u201cDid he say anything else?\u201d</p><p>Alec answered. \u201cHe took your purse and your phone. He said someone was trying to grab it, so he grabbed it first. I told him where to bring it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was either Jayden or Sean, and they both know where I live.\u201d</p><p>Spencer started to say something, but Aiden shook his head and he stopped. What was that about?</p><p>Alec turned her attention. \u201cThe kid on the phone said it wasn\u2019t bad, that you only bounced a couple of times before you landed. Let\u2019s hope he doesn\u2019t go into the medical field.\u201d</p><p>A young policeman came around the corner and introduced himself as Officer Talbot. \u201cAre you feeling up to answering a couple of questions, Miss Kane?\u201d he asked.</p><p>When Cordie nodded, he proceeded to quiz her about the accident. Witnesses reported that there had been a loud bang from a delivery truck backfiring. They were so startled they looked in the direction of the noise, and they didn\u2019t turn back until they heard tires screeching and she was lying on the street. Did she remember the noise? No, she responded, but then everything was a blur from the time she was standing on the curb until she ended up on the pavement. Was it possible she jumped when she heard the explosion? She supposed it was possible, she told him, but she didn\u2019t think it was probable that she would jump so far as to end up in the street. Was there anything else she could report about the incident? She told him she saw her former students across the street, but she assured him she was very aware of the light and the traffic. Other than that, she couldn\u2019t recall what had happened. It was all so sudden.</p><p>After making a few notes, he thanked her and turned to leave. \u201cYou\u2019re a lucky lady, Miss Kane. You could have been killed.\u201d</p><p>The severity of what had happened to her was beginning to sink in, but she couldn\u2019t concentrate. The nurse had given her pain medicine that was fogging her brain. She lay back and closed her eyes. The urge to sleep was too strong to fight.</p><p>A nurse told the men to step outside while she helped Cordie get dressed. The doctor had just signed her discharge papers, and she was free to go, but she could not be alone. There was a long list of what she could and could not do and three prescriptions that needed to be filled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll want to go home,\u201d Spencer said.</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Aiden responded. \u201cShe\u2019s going to the hotel. She can\u2019t handle steps. With all the meds she\u2019ll be taking, she could fall and break her neck. She\u2019s staying with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell her, or should I?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one needs to tell her. She\u2019ll figure it out soon enough.\u201d</p><p>As Spencer was leaving to get his car, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing it wasn\u2019t her right hand. She\u2019ll still be able to write . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordelia is left-handed,\u201d Aiden told him.</p><p>Alec smiled at his comment and said, \u201cWhat else have you noticed?\u201d</p><p>Aiden ignored him.</p><p>By the time Cordie was dressed, she was as white as a sheet, according to the nurse helping her. The doctor had ordered medication for her that would help her sleep and also help control the pain.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be a little loopy,\u201d the nurse said, \u201cbut since you\u2019re not driving anywhere, that\u2019s all right. You need to rest. I\u2019d suggest tonight you get down on your knees and thank God you\u2019re still alive, but you\u2019d probably topple over, so say your prayers in bed.\u201d</p><p>Cordie knew the woman was talking to her, but she couldn\u2019t clear her head enough to make out what she was saying. She felt as though she was at the bottom of a lake, and it was going to take far too much effort to swim to the top. All she could do was give in and sink down into the murky darkness. She was dozing off when she suddenly felt Aiden\u2019s strong arms around her. The way he lifted her was so effortless, he made her feel as light as air. He liked to carry her to his bed, she thought, as she put her head down on his shoulder and went to sleep.</p><p>Once they were at the hotel, Aiden helped her get to his suite. Like the hotel suite in Sydney, there were two bedrooms, one on each side of the living room. He guided her to the guest room. Not wanting her to sleep in her clothes, he removed them and got one of his shirts to put on her, carefully slipping her cast through the sleeve. He was pulling the covers up when Spencer came in with the prescriptions and set them on the table next to the bed.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d he asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou should see her legs and hip. They\u2019re black-and-blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should get one of Walker\u2019s nurses in here,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cYou won\u2019t hear her if she wakes up and needs help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out tomorrow. I\u2019ll stay in here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to sleep with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will freak her out if she wakes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it will.\u201d</p><p>Cordie slept through their conversation. She woke up in the middle of the night, and, disoriented, she looked around and squinted into the dark. Soft light spilled under the door from the room beyond, but she couldn\u2019t figure out what that room was. A closet? A bathroom? She turned her head and saw Aiden sound asleep beside her. Were they still in Sydney? When she tried to lift her arm, she felt the weight of the cast. She looked around, and on the nightstand next to her she spotted a black-leather folder with the letter H embossed on the cover. Clarity came like a bolt out of the blue. The Hamilton. She was at the Chicago Hamilton with Aiden.</p><p>How in the world had that happened?</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>Alec laughed when he read the sign Spencer had taped to Cordie\u2019s bedroom door: Warning. Don\u2019t poke the bear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming Cordie\u2019s the bear,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>Spencer nodded. He was sitting at the dining table with his laptop in front of him, trying to get some work done.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in your office?\u201d Alec asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m babysitting,\u201d Spencer answered. \u201cAiden doesn\u2019t want Cordie to be alone.\u201d Smiling, he added, \u201cThose two really got into it. It was something to see. He can\u2019t intimidate her, though God knows he tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the argument about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants to go home, and he won\u2019t let her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan will be here in a little bit,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>Spencer nodded. \u201cThe nurse just left. She helped her shower and get dressed. Cordie was very appreciative. She\u2019s only taking her wrath out on Aiden and me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take her home. I\u2019m telling you, Alec, this floor is turning into a war zone. Walker\u2019s a hundred times worse than Cordie. She only argues with Aiden. Walker argues with everyone, and now that he\u2019s decided to get involved in the business, it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting involved . . . isn\u2019t that a good thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no.\u201d</p> <p>Alec tapped on Cordie\u2019s door, then went inside. The drapes were open and sunlight streamed in. She was sitting in bed, her back against the headboard. Dressed in a T-shirt, sweatpants, and socks, she had her laptop open, but when she saw him, she closed it and put it aside.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking better.\u201d He told the lie without laughing.</p><p>Exasperated, she said, \u201cI look like a raccoon.\u201d</p><p>He gave up on trying to be diplomatic and dragged a chair over to the bed. Noticing the tray of food on the table, he lifted the silver dome and said, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to eat your lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not now.\u201d</p> <p>He popped a French fry into his mouth and reached for half the club sandwich. \u201cYou should eat. It looks really good.\u201d He then proceeded to devour every morsel.</p><p>She handed him a bottle of water, wincing as she stretched her legs out. \u201cAlec, I\u2019m being held against my will. Get me out of here. I want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should stay here a couple more days. If you go home, you might trip and fall and get blood all over my hardwood floors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not your hardwoods yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you really feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy arm hurts, and I\u2019m sore, but I\u2019m not going to take any more pain pills. They make me too emotional.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t explain that the medication made her vulnerable and she needed to be at her best around Aiden. She didn\u2019t want to let her guard down and unintentionally say something she would regret. Not once had Aiden mentioned any feelings for her. The sex in Australia had been incredible, but there were no loving words afterward. For him it had been purely physical. She\u2019d figured that out early on. But for her it had been love. She was worried sick she would tell him how she felt, and that would ruin everything.</p><p>The nurse, a stunning brunette, returned to check on her. She beamed when she saw the empty tray. \u201cThank goodness. You\u2019re getting your appetite back.\u201d</p><p>Before Alec could contradict her, Cordie said, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be going home in no time at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>After the nurse had carried the tray out, Cordie asked, \u201cAre all the nurses looking after Walker pretty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing Walker, I\u2019d have to guess yes,\u201d he said as he got up and returned the chair to the desk. He went back to the bed and leaned down to kiss her forehead, being careful to stay away from the bruises. \u201cI\u2019ll check on you later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her protest and was turning to leave just as Aiden, followed by two teenage boys, walked in. Jayden Martin noticed Alec\u2019s gun and holster and took a step back. Sean Corrigan didn\u2019t see the gun. He was staring at Cordie and cringing.</p><p>\u201cSean, Jayden, I\u2019m so happy to see you.\u201d She swung her legs over the side of the bed and slowly stood. Her arm was in a sling, but she still tried to protect it by holding it against her chest with her other hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go into the living room and talk.\u201d</p><p>She took a couple of unsteady steps before getting her balance, but Aiden had already walked over to stand beside her. She didn\u2019t want him to treat her like an invalid any longer. \u201cIf you pick me up, I\u2019m going to punch you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He laughed. It wasn\u2019t the reaction she was hoping for.</p><p>Jayden was looking as though he wanted to bolt, and she quickly introduced both boys to Alec. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen Regan Buchanan at school lots of times. She helped me with fund-raisers. This is her husband, Alec Buchanan.\u201d She deliberately didn\u2019t mention that he was an FBI agent.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI remember her. She was real pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe still is,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cI saw you at Mr. Kane\u2019s funeral,\u201d Jayden remarked, casting a wary glance in Alec\u2019s direction. He was holding a plastic shopping bag. He dropped it on the bed. \u201cYour purse is in there,\u201d he told Cordie, following her into the living room. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cThe forty-two dollars is still in your wallet,\u201d Sean volunteered.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThank you for keeping it safe for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome guy tried to take it, but Jayden was faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went for your phone, too, but I got it first,\u201d Jayden said. \u201cMiss Kane, you should change your lock code on your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t take much to figure it out,\u201d Sean agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>Jayden looked at Cordie for approval before he answered. \u201cZero, zero, zero, zero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you need to change it,\u201d Alec told her.</p><p>The boys were so uncomfortable with Aiden and Alec towering over them, Cordie sat on the sofa and motioned for them to sit in the chairs across from her.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but we should probably go,\u201d Jayden said.</p><p>\u201cDid you see it happen?\u201d Aiden asked as he removed his suit jacket and draped it over the back of the sofa. Rolling up his sleeves, he loosened his tie and waited for one of the boys to answer. They glanced at each other and couldn\u2019t seem to make up their minds about who should reply.</p><p>Aiden\u2019s patience was wearing thin and he was about to ask the question again when Sean said, \u201cYou should tell it, Jayden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what happened, Miss Kane?\u201d Jayden asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I remember seeing you two, and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Aiden stood next to Cordie with his arms folded across his chest, frowning as he continued to wait for a response. Didn\u2019t he know how threatening he looked?</p><p>\u201cAiden, sit down,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>Aiden took the hint, but instead of sitting, he strolled over to the tall windows and looked down on the street with his hands behind his back.</p><p>Alec detected the apprehension in the boys. It appeared they knew something more about Cordie\u2019s accident, and he didn\u2019t want them to stop talking. He took a seat in one of the upholstered chairs and leaned back.</p><p>Jayden paused a moment, suspicious of Aiden\u2019s question, and then said, \u201cYeah, I saw it all.\u201d He proceeded to describe in painful detail how she had bounced off the hood of the car. \u201cEveryone was shouting,\u201d he told Cordie. \u201cWhen I got to you, I heard this guy say you jumped right in front of the car. I couldn\u2019t figure out why he\u2019d say such a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d Cordie asserted vehemently. \u201cI did not jump in front of that car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jayden agreed. \u201cYou were pushed.\u201d</p><p>Aiden spun around. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Jayden didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI said she was pushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Sean asserted. He turned to Cordie. \u201cThere was this loud bang and everybody jumped a little, but all it was, was a truck. It didn\u2019t scare me none, and I was looking right at you when you kinda lunged into traffic. I didn\u2019t see who pushed you because it was such a big crowd, and everything went crazy when you got hit.\u201d</p><p>Aiden couldn\u2019t stand still. The possibility of someone deliberately hurting Cordelia enraged him. He paced in front of the windows while he listened to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the guy who shoved you was just scared by the loud boom.\u201d Sean offered the theory. \u201cOr it could have been a woman behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d have to be pretty strong,\u201d Jayden said. \u201cI mean, you were propelled. You know . . . right in front of that car. You should have seen the way you bounced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI experienced it, Jayden,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you didn\u2019t see it,\u201d Sean pointed out.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could see it,\u201d Jayden said. Turning to Alec he asked, \u201cAren\u2019t there cameras at all the lights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. There are,\u201d Alec answered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could call, and they\u2019ll let you see the accident. I\u2019ll bet they would.\u201d</p><p>Alec had already asked for the video, but Jayden was so proud of himself for coming up with the idea, he went along. \u201cGood thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll check into it.\u201d</p><p>Jayden nodded. \u201cIf someone hurt Miss Kane on purpose, you know what you should do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Alec had a pretty good idea what the kid was going to suggest. Most teenagers he\u2019d dealt with subscribed to an-eye-for-an-eye philosophy.</p><p>\u201cYou should throw him in front of a speeding car,\u201d Jayden said with conviction.</p><p>Aiden stopped pacing and nodded. \u201cI like that plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what should be done,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cWe follow the laws here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the time we do,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>The boys weren\u2019t as skittish now, Alec thought, because they were no longer eyeing his gun. \u201cI\u2019d like to ask a couple of questions,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Sean looked worried.</p><p>\u201cAbout the accident,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cWhat else would he want to talk about?\u201d Jayden muttered to Sean before addressing Alec. \u201cGo ahead and ask your questions.\u201d</p><p>Alec wanted to know what the boys had noticed before they spotted Cordie. How observant had they been about the people around them? What were they doing on that corner? A couple of questions turned into quite a few, and he kept circling around to the minutes before the accident.</p><p>\u201cI just remembered,\u201d Jayden said. His voice became animated. \u201cI saw Miss Kane before she reached the light. I didn\u2019t know it was her at first because she was far away, but I was watching her walk down the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you watching her?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . you know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and tell me.\u201d</p><p>The kid\u2019s face turned red. \u201cShe was wearing a dress, and I noticed . . . you know . . . her legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Sean said as though the light had just dawned. \u201cI noticed them, too. And the guy walking behind her sure was noticing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d Jayden said. \u201cI forgot him. He was looking down. He definitely was interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis guy . . . did he follow Miss Kane to the corner?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jayden answered. \u201cThere was a crowd of people squeezing into that corner, and I didn\u2019t see Miss Kane again until she was waiting for the signal.\u201d</p><p>The kids had seen a lot more than they\u2019d realized. \u201cThat\u2019s a big help,\u201d Alec told them.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re finished with your questions . . . ,\u201d Cordie said. When Alec nodded, she turned to Jayden. \u201cHow is your mother doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s much better since the surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell her I said hello. Sean, what about your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s good. We should probably go now, Jayden. I\u2019ve got to get home before Mom does.\u201d Turning to Cordie he explained, \u201cI\u2019m grounded.\u201d</p><p>Cordie struggled to stand so she could walk the boys to the elevator. Sean rushed forward to help, and immediately she thought, oh no. If he yanked her or pulled on her, she\u2019d probably pass out. Fortunately, Aiden got to her first and helped her up. He must have seen the panic in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for keeping my purse safe. All my identification was inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd forty-two dollars,\u201d Sean reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI think I should treat you to dinner. I\u2019ll just get my\u2014\u201d she began, but Aiden stopped her.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to . . . ,\u201d Jayden started to protest, but Sean elbowed him.</p><p>Aiden pulled out his wallet and gave them enough cash to eat for a week, suspecting that most of it would go for video games or something other than food.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss your dad?\u201d Jayden asked Cordie as he stuffed the bills in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cI miss him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cCould I ask you a favor?\u201d Jayden asked, stepping closer.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She realized she was leaning into Aiden and tried to pull away, then decided it was just easier to stay where she was.</p><p>\u201cI got a new car,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really new. Your dad would call it a clunker.\u201d</p><p>After glancing up at Aiden, she turned to Jayden and whispered, \u201cHow did you get the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI paid for it. Honest,\u201d he said. \u201cI saved up, and your dad . . . he gave me a little money for my birthday.\u201d</p><p>Another nice thing her father had done and never told her about. \u201cWhat\u2019s the favor?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you would go for a ride and tell me what you think, maybe next week, when . . . you know . . . you look better.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. His assessment of her appearance may have been a little harsh, but she couldn\u2019t fault the accuracy. She knew she looked as if she\u2019d been in a fight with a wrecking ball. After agreeing to the ride, she said good-bye, and Aiden walked the boys to the elevator.</p><p>As soon as the doors were closed, he said, \u201cYou were worried he might have stolen the car, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of here,\u201d Alec said as he stood to leave. \u201cI want to see what that street camera got, check out the crowd around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should look at the crowd, too,\u201d she said. \u201cI might recognize someone . . . if I was pushed,\u201d she qualified. As she began to take slow steps back to the bedroom, she looked over her shoulder at Aiden and asked, \u201cWill you take me home this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered.</p><p>She refused to let him irritate her. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen will you take me home?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cMaybe next week when . . . you know . . . you look better.\u201d</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>By seven o\u2019clock that evening Cordie was convinced she was never going to get out of there. No one was willing to drive her home, not even Regan. Apparently they all thought they knew what was best for her. Or they were following Aiden\u2019s instructions, which seemed more likely. She thought about asking the doorman to get her a cab, but in order to get to the door, she\u2019d have to cross the lobby in her socks. The tennis shoes Regan had brought her from the house had mysteriously disappeared. She even threatened to call the police, which Aiden thought was hilarious. He had a good laugh while Spencer put the sign back on her door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Around seven thirty she came to the realization that she was acting like a spoiled ten-year-old. She should be thankful she had such good friends who wanted to take care of her. And at the Hamilton she was pampered. Earlier Regan had sent up a member of the spa staff to wash and blow-dry her hair. After she\u2019d taken a lovely bath, the nurse came in to help her change and fix the sling for her cast. She was feeling so much better thanks to all the support she was getting.</p><p>Aiden knocked on her door to announce that he had ordered dinner and asked her to come out to the table.</p><p>\u201cI really can take care of myself,\u201d she told him as he pulled the chair out for her and put the napkin in her lap.</p><p>\u201cYes, you mentioned that a couple of times earlier today.\u201d He lifted the silver plate cover to reveal filet mignon, asparagus, and baby red potatoes.</p> <p>She stared at the mouthwatering steak for several seconds, then said, \u201cYou did that on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d he asked innocently.</p><p>He knew she couldn\u2019t cut the steak, and that was why he\u2019d ordered it, to prove to her she wasn\u2019t self-reliant just yet. He took the steak knife and fork and cut the meat into bite-size pieces.</p><p>\u201cWant me to feed you?\u201d There was laughter in his voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary,\u201d she grumbled as she picked up the fork with her free hand.</p> <p>He sat across from her and uncovered the same meal on his plate. She was surprised he was having dinner with her because she knew he usually went out every evening, sometimes for business, sometimes for pleasure.</p><p>\u201cShall we have an argument-free dinner?\u201d he proposed.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t argue. I simply express my opinion, and you ignore it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s a no,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t argue,\u201d she promised. And to prove it she thanked him for dinner.</p><p>He took a bite of steak and said, \u201cThis is good.\u201d</p> <p>She agreed. It was delicious. \u201cTell me about the congressman making you crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much to tell, and it\u2019s Walker making me crazy.\u201d He then explained what had happened with Rock Point. \u201cSpencer had worked hard on the deal, and the resort would bring that community back to life, but the congressman got greedy and demanded more money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe agreed to one price, then changed his mind.\u201d</p><p>Aiden nodded. He wasn\u2019t used to talking about his frustrations with anyone, and it felt good to get it all out. \u201cThe guy\u2019s a jerk,\u201d he said. \u201cKnow what he said? Giving his word and shaking my hand didn\u2019t mean anything. He hadn\u2019t signed anything, so it wasn\u2019t a done deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did Walker get involved, and why did he negotiate with the congressman?\u201d</p><p>Aiden shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t talked to him yet. I thought I\u2019d get over my anger first, but that\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is Armageddon?\u201d</p><p>The question made him laugh, and his mood was suddenly lightened. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>He then talked about the Houston property and the difficulty getting permits for the expansion. She couldn\u2019t imagine how he kept everything straight in his head. She would have trouble remembering how many hotels there were. Not Aiden. He oversaw every phase, from breaking ground to the grand opening, and he could rattle off numbers faster than a computer.</p><p>\u201cHow do you stay so organized?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of good people I can rely on to get the job done, and Spencer does as much as I do. We split the work,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe\u2019s just more laid-back about it.\u201d</p><p>She thought about what he had just said and decided she might have unjustly judged Walker as a giant liability and a man who refused responsibility. His older brothers had taken over the running of the business, and he had very little to say about it. Maybe Walker had more to offer than they realized.</p><p>\u201cThe four of you have an equal vote,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right? Even though Regan runs the charity foundation, she still has a vote on any new development.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so does Walker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if Walker and Regan vote against you and Spencer?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI figure out a way to get what I want.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re arrogant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>No apology came with the acknowledgment, but then she didn\u2019t expect he would view arrogance as a flaw. Aiden Madison was the ultimate alpha, and she, supposedly a liberated female, shouldn\u2019t be attracted to him. Should she?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get some work done tonight,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cAre you going down to your office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll work on my laptop here.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her chair back and stood. \u201cI won\u2019t bother you. I should answer my e-mails. That will take forever.\u201d She hoped that when her fingers weren\u2019t so swollen she would be able to type, but for now she had to use the one-finger technique. Thank goodness Regan had brought over some of her electronics. Cordie would be lost without her laptop and her cell phone charger.</p><p>She went into the bedroom for her computer, then returned to the living room to find her phone so she could charge it. After a futile search, she picked up the hotel phone and called her cell. Following the ring, she located the phone under a chair. How had it gotten there?</p><p>Aiden leaned against the bar watching her. The living room was beginning to look as though it had been ransacked. The cushions on the sofas were askew; the coffee table was cluttered with Cordie\u2019s laptop, iPad, earbuds, and chargers. One of her robes was draped over a chair, and her e-reader was on the seat. She hadn\u2019t even been in the suite all that long. What would the room look like in a week? She needed to get organized, he decided.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how much time you waste looking for things you\u2019ve misplaced?\u201d</p><p>Cordie was untangling her charger cord from the laptop. She straightened and asked, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>He repeated his question.</p><p>\u201cNo, Aiden, I don\u2019t know how much time I waste looking for things. At home I have a place for my things. Here, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t argue with her because his phone rang. \u201cIt\u2019s Alec,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She waited impatiently for Aiden to finish his conversation and tell her what Alec wanted.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming over with the video,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he just e-mail it to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did he say?\u201d She leaned against the arm of the sofa. She didn\u2019t want to sit, afraid she wouldn\u2019t be able to get up. With all the bumps and bruises, by the end of the day moving was exhausting.</p><p>\u201cHe said it\u2019s official now. Sean and Jayden were on the mark. Someone deliberately pushed you into the path of that car.\u201d</p><p>She was astounded and outraged. \u201cSo it\u2019s for real. Now there\u2019s proof. Oh my God. Someone actually tried to kill me. I could have died.\u201d</p><p>He was surprised by her reaction. \u201cWe already knew you were pushed. This is confirmation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful relaxed about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He still sounded too calm to her. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I should have paid attention. I slacked off. All week I\u2019ve been looking behind me every time I thought someone was following me, and the minute I let my guard down, boom. I almost get killed.\u201d</p><p>Jaw clenched, he said her name in a warning tone. \u201cCordelia, you thought someone was following you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and apparently I let him sneak right up behind me. I can\u2019t believe it. Do you know who\u2019s behind this? Because I do.\u201d</p><p>Aiden wanted to shout at her for not telling him sooner. He decided to wait for Alec to get the entire story out of her. Then he would get to yell.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Simone,\u201d she announced unequivocally. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to dispose of me just like she did with her marriage to my father. That freak of a family in Australia won\u2019t know what hit them when I . . .\u201d</p><p>She stopped ranting as soon as Aiden took her into his arms. \u201cYou know what this means, Cordelia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>He decided to wait until the agreed-on time to call Sydney. He wanted to downplay the incident, and for that reason he didn\u2019t make an emergency call.</p><p>\u201cAnything to report?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cAs instructed, I\u2019ve continued to follow and observe the woman. I didn\u2019t find anything in her house that would connect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for the best time to dispose of the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose were your instructions.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cAn opportunity presented itself on a crowded street, and I made the decision to go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pushed the woman into heavy traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith witnesses? You said a crowded street. People saw you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no one saw what I did,\u201d he rushed.</p><p>\u201cBut something did go wrong. I hear it in your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman survived. She had injuries, but she will recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou idiot! What made you think that would work? I sent you there to take care of this problem and you failed.\u201d</p><p>He stammered, \u201cYes . . . yes . . . I realize I should have found a better way by now. The police believe it was an accident. She should have died, but the car was slowing down . . . I just acted on the spur of the moment because I saw an opportunity . . .\u201d He realized he was making excuses.</p><p>\u201cThis should have been done already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I did fail, but it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt better not. No more waiting. You finish it.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Cordie watched the video at the table with Aiden beside her. Alec had gone to the bar to get a beer before he took a chair across from them.</p><p>\u201cI really did bounce.\u201d She winced.</p><p>\u201cSee what you did there?\u201d Aiden replayed the seconds before impact. \u201cIt looks like you tried to jump up, like a pole-vaulter, onto the hood of the car. That was smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously trying to put a positive spin on this?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it looks like I tried to stop the car with my left arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blinkers were on,\u201d Alec commented. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing the car was slowing down, or you could have been in much worse shape.\u201d</p><p>Cordie knew they were trying to be reassuring, but their attempts to make her see the glass as half full were not working. She backed up the video and watched it again. She saw herself step up to the edge of the curb and the crowd gather around her. Everyone was facing forward, and suddenly their heads turned. Apparently this was the point at which the truck backfired. Within a fraction of a second, Cordie lurched into the path of the oncoming car. When she played the video again, she concentrated on the people behind her. Everyone was crammed together so closely, it was impossible to see faces. She backed up the image once more and watched the pedestrians heading to the corner. There was only one suspicious-looking character. He wore a baseball cap down low over his brow, and he never looked up so the traffic cam could catch his face. He seemed to disappear in the throng. She let the video continue to play. After the crash, some people ran to help her; some stood watching in shock; and others who wondered what was happening walked into the camera\u2019s view. The commotion lasted a couple of minutes before a few onlookers began to drift away. She looked closely as they dispersed and saw the baseball cap disappearing among them.</p><p>Alec and Aiden played the video at least twenty times more, looking at individuals but concentrating on the man in the cap and finally concluding they saw nothing that would identify an assailant.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t watch this again. I don\u2019t recognize anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell Alec how you let him sneak up on you,\u201d Aiden suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cAll week long I\u2019ve had this weird feeling that someone was following me.\u201d</p><p>Alec didn\u2019t say anything for a couple of seconds. He took a long swig of beer. \u201cAll week long, huh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. From the look in his eyes, she could tell he was about to get testy.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me why you think someone was following you? And then maybe you could explain why you didn\u2019t tell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just a feeling,\u201d she said, trying to defend herself. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any proof, and every time I got that feeling and tuned around or looked in a mirror, there was never anyone there.\u201d</p><p>Aiden felt like banging his head against the wall. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Cordelia, the whole point would be to avoid being seen if he was any good at his job, and apparently he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t snap at me. I was going to mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart mentioning it now,\u201d Alec said. \u201cWhen did you first suspect someone was watching you?\u201d</p><p>She went through her week, telling him about the art gallery, the parking garage, and the cemetery. When she was finished, all he said was, \u201cOkay. Is there anything else you want to mention?\u201d</p><p>Cordie couldn\u2019t tell if Alec was irritated with her now or not. Turning to Aiden, she asked, \u201cWhat time is it in Sydney?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to think before he answered. \u201cIt\u2019s after nine here, so it\u2019s after twelve noon there. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to call Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to him,\u201d Alec said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking into a couple of things and will call me back.\u201d</p><p>What couple of things? Before she could ask, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know. You have to be patient, Cordie.\u201d</p><p>That was easier said than done. She wanted to help, but she didn\u2019t know how. It was frustrating, and fatigue was taking a toll. At least she didn\u2019t have to worry about getting dark circles under her eyes. The bruises would hide them.</p><p>\u201cI hate being helpless,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Aiden actually looked sympathetic. \u201cI know, but you have to let us handle this for now. You\u2019ve suffered quite a trauma.\u201d</p><p>The aches and pains she was feeling at the moment told her he was right.</p><p>\u201cRegan and I have a favor to ask,\u201d Alec said. His demeanor had changed. He was no longer the professional and serious FBI agent, but her friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe attorneys still haven\u2019t gotten the papers ready to sign on the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to call them?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, they promised they\u2019ll get it done. But Regan and I were hoping you wouldn\u2019t mind if we moved some of our things into the house now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, of course I don\u2019t mind. Didn\u2019t Regan want to change the paint color in most of the rooms before you moved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust two rooms, and the painters will be there tomorrow . . . if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s okay. Go ahead and do whatever you want to do.\u201d</p><p>Alec left a few minutes later. Aiden walked him to the door, and the two of them stood there talking for several minutes in low tones. They both glanced at her a couple of times, and she knew they were talking about her. She also knew neither one of them would tell her what they were saying, though she was relatively sure it had something to do with keeping her in the hotel.</p><p>Alec had e-mailed the video to her before he left. She opened it on her laptop and watched it again. \u201cThis video is going to stay in my head for a long time,\u201d she told Aiden when he returned to her.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe if you stopped watching it . . .\u201d</p><p>He had a point. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to think about something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a brilliant idea. I never would have thought to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I could help,\u201d he replied, totally unfazed by her sarcasm.</p><p>He walked back to the table with his laptop and sat down to check a file. Several minutes passed in silence. He was so engrossed in his work, Cordie went into her bedroom and sat on the bed while she pondered what she could do to speed the investigation along. She walked back into the living room. \u201cAiden, I was wondering . . . ,\u201d she began sweetly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Abrupt as always.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going back to Sydney?\u201d</p><p>He stopped typing and looked at her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to go with you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her what she could interpret only as the are-you-crazy look. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to hear why I want to go with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you anyway.\u201d</p> <p>He sat back. \u201cI thought you might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to knock on Simone Rayburn\u2019s door, and I\u2019m going to make her admit she sent someone to get rid of me. Then I think I just might do what Jayden suggested.\u201d</p><p>It was difficult for Aiden not to smile. Cordie was really getting worked up. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cRun her over. I might even take out the whole family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordelia, you\u2019re not going to Sydney.\u201d</p><p>She stopped arguing. It felt good to rant for a minute or two about Simone and get rid of some of her anger, but she realized in the end she did need to be patient. Liam was investigating, and maybe soon he would get the proof needed to arrest Simone and the man or men she sent to Chicago. There was absolutely no question in her mind that it could be anyone else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving for an appointment in a few minutes,\u201d Aiden announced. He closed his laptop and took it into his bedroom. When he returned, he was putting on his sport coat.</p><p>He didn\u2019t tell her where he was going or when he would be back, and she didn\u2019t ask. If he wanted her to know, he would have taken the time to explain\u2014which would have been the polite thing to do. He would rather be rude, however. Should she mention that it was already after ten? No, of course she shouldn\u2019t. Teachers went to bed at ten on school nights\u2014at least she did when she was teaching\u2014but millionaire CEOs could stay out all night partying if they wanted. They didn\u2019t have to do things like control teenage boys with raging hormones the next morning.</p><p>Slipping his cell phone into his coat pocket, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a security guard in the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be safe. He won\u2019t let anyone in or out.\u201d</p><p>Or out? In other words, she wasn\u2019t going anywhere. She decided to mess with him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go anywhere. I love it here. I may never leave. Have a nice time tonight.\u201d Without another word she walked into her bedroom and quietly shut the door.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t lied. She was exhausted and wanted only to sleep. It was a luxury to be pampered, and right now that was what she needed. Forget about being self-reliant. She had to have help to get her strength back. Staying at the hotel just a little longer wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing. She\u2019d rest one more day, and then she\u2019d go home.</p><p>She watched television for a couple of hours and relaxed. She fell asleep around midnight but woke up later screaming. Bolting upright, she frantically looked around the room trying to find the threat. She heard a crash, then a curse, and suddenly Aiden was at her side.</p><p>\u201cWhat the . . . Are you all right?\u201d he panted.</p><p>She pushed the hair out of her eyes and squinted up at him. \u201cDid I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard a bloodcurdling scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard it, too,\u201d she explained. \u201cI screamed, and that\u2019s what woke me up. I don\u2019t know why I did that.\u201d She sounded bewildered.</p><p>\u201cBad dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Wearing nothing but boxers, he stood there staring down at her, and as worn out as she felt, she still noticed how sexy his body was, while hers was . . . colorful. Black-and-blue.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to sleep with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He pulled the sheet back and got in bed with her. \u201cPut your head on my shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re even telling me how to sleep now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Cordelia.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Aiden left the suite around seven to work out and didn\u2019t return until after nine. He looked in on Cordelia to make certain she was all right. She was still sleeping soundly. After changing, he left again to get coffee and meet Spencer to discuss what to do about their brother, Walker.</p><p>When Cordie awoke, her room was still dark, but a sliver of sun shone through the gap where the draperies met. She rolled out of bed, opened the draperies wide, and looked out on a beautiful sunny day. She convinced herself she was feeling much better. Her aches and pains weren\u2019t nearly as bad, and once she started moving around, the stiffness in her legs eased. Her horribly bruised hip still burned like fire, but it wasn\u2019t unbearable. She could take care of herself now, and to prove it she would get dressed before the nurse showed up to help. She was sure she could manage the plastic sleeve over her cast so it wouldn\u2019t get wet. A new day, a new positive attitude, she told herself.</p><p>She was feeling pretty chipper until she saw herself in the mirror. She looked like the kraken. The swelling had gone down, but the bruised skin was more vivid, and her hair\u2014dear God, her hair looked as though it had been styled in front of a jet engine. The expression her hair stood on end didn\u2019t do it justice. Maybe she needed a little help after all.</p><p>Patty, the fortysomething nurse who arrived later, was a talker. A little on the plump side, with kind eyes and a maternal disposition, she wasn\u2019t anything at all like the voluptuous nurse who had visited the day before. After she introduced herself, she told Cordie she was happy to have a break from taking care of Walker.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being difficult?\u201d Cordie asked. She couldn\u2019t hide her surprise. Walker was usually the real charmer in the family.</p><p>Because Patty was so soft-spoken, what she said made Cordie laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s a pain in the ass.\u201d She removed Cordie\u2019s sling and folded it. \u201cNever a \u2018please\u2019 or \u2018thank you,\u2019 and he yells whenever we try to help. Moving him from the bed to the wheelchair is a trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had planned to go see him today,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cMaybe I should wait until he\u2019s feeling better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait. He might sweeten up with a friend there. He sure wasn\u2019t happy to see his physical therapist.\u201d</p><p>Cordie hoped Patty was exaggerating. She couldn\u2019t imagine Walker being rude to anyone. Aiden, absolutely. Spencer, maybe sometimes. But Walker? No, never.</p><p>Once she was dressed, she headed across the hall to Walker\u2019s suite. The guard looked as though he thought she was trying to pull something, but he let her pass and, like a shadow, followed a foot behind her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right out here,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be right in here,\u201d she replied, smiling, as she opened the door and slipped inside.</p><p>The suite was dark, and it took a second for her eyes to adjust. All the draperies were closed, and a single lamp on an end table was the only source of light. She took a few steps past the foyer and saw him. Poor Walker. He looked so pale . . . and angry. He was sitting in a wheelchair in the center of the living room next to the coffee table. His leg was straight out in front of him. The cast reached the top of his knee, and Cordie couldn\u2019t tell if he could bend his leg or not.</p><p>He managed a smile for her and said, \u201cI hear you got hit by a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you crashed a car.\u201d</p><p>She thought she would give him a kiss on the cheek, but the closer she got to him, the stronger the foul odor became. She abruptly stopped. \u201cYou smell rank,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t let us bathe him,\u201d Patty said. She walked past Cordie with a stack of towels.</p><p>Walker\u2019s face became a mask of indifference. He glared at Patty until she disappeared into his bedroom and then said, \u201cI wish everyone would leave me the hell alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Cordie demanded. He acted as though he hadn\u2019t heard her. She repeated the question in a much louder voice. She was so focused on Walker, she wasn\u2019t aware that Aiden and Spencer had just walked in. \u201cAfter you have a bath and put on clean clothes, we\u2019ll all leave you alone, for a little while anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to go in the bedroom and lock the door to get some peace?\u201d he growled. \u201cIn fact, I think I\u2019m going to do just that.\u201d He started to back his wheelchair away from the coffee table so he could turn around.</p><p>Aiden was about to step in and give Walker a piece of his mind for acting like a child until Cordie laughed. The puzzling reaction made him hesitate. What did she think was so funny?</p><p>\u201cYou think I can\u2019t get you out of a locked room? It would take me five minutes, tops,\u201d she said.</p><p>Walker scoffed and stopped turning the wheels of his chair. \u201cWhat would you do? Get someone to kick in the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing so barbaric,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cI know a lot of ways to get you to come out. I could use tear gas, I suppose. That\u2019s quick and easy. Your eyes will burn for a week, but I guarantee you\u2019ll open the door. Or I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped her. \u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind. Where are you going to buy tear gas?\u201d</p><p>Exasperated, she asked, \u201cWhat did I do at St. Matthew\u2019s High School?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a teacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did I teach?\u201d</p><p>Before he could guess, she said, \u201cChemistry, Walker. I taught chemistry. I won\u2019t buy tear gas. I\u2019ll make it, and room service will bring me everything I need. Some vinegar, a little baking soda, a few hot spices . . . should I go on? Or would you like to hear what else I could put together to get you out of a locked room?\u201d</p><p>She was bluffing, of course. Yes, she did know how to make tear gas, but she never would, and she didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what she would say if he asked her how she would get the tear gas into the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a ghoul,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d she agreed cheerfully. \u201cNow, are you going to bathe, or do I call room service and start mixing up a few surprises to get you to cooperate?\u201d</p><p>He put his hands up in reluctant surrender. \u201cOkay, you win.\u201d</p><p>Before he could change his mind, Patty swooped in to roll him into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave, Cordie,\u201d Walker called out. \u201cThis won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>The way he smelled? She thought it would take the rest of the afternoon.</p><p>Aiden came up behind her and put his arm on her shoulder. \u201cTear gas, Cordelia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really know how to make that stuff, don\u2019t you?\u201d Spencer sounded impressed.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d she said as she turned around to face them.</p><p>It had been a long time since she\u2019d seen all three Madison brothers in the same place, and she couldn\u2019t help but notice the similarities. There were distinct differences as well. Spencer and Aiden were both tall, and their muscular builds were a testament to the time they spent working out. Spencer was slightly bulkier in the shoulders than Aiden, but Aiden had the more chiseled body. Walker, on the other hand, didn\u2019t show the same signs of physical fitness. It appeared his lifestyle was beginning to catch up with him, because he was thinner than she remembered, and his skin had a sallow hue that suggested living in the fast lane had finally taken its toll. Despite their different physiques, all three brothers were handsome and could be models. Aiden would look right at home in GQ. Spencer would be more suited to Sports Illustrated. And Walker . . . he was different. While at one time he would have been a candidate for the cover of Esquire, he now looked like a subject for a medical journal.</p><p>Spencer patted her on the shoulder. \u201cYou look so much better today. I can barely see the bruises,\u201d he told her. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would even notice. Doesn\u2019t she look good, Aiden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordelia always looks good.\u201d</p><p>She was about to thank them for their lies when a knock sounded at the door, and a big, burly man dressed in white came in.</p><p>\u201cWalker\u2019s cooperating, Edward,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>\u201cEdward\u2019s an RN,\u201d Spencer told her. \u201cHe was going to help us drag Walker into a shower.\u201d</p><p>Aiden introduced the nurse to Cordelia. When he took her hand, he frowned and examined her face. \u201cYou were in the car with Walker?\u201d</p><p>Cordie turned to Spencer and gave him an accusatory scowl. \u201cBarely noticeable bruises, huh?\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cShe was hit by a car,\u201d Aiden explained.</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop Edward when he gently removed her arm from the sling. He checked her fingers and remarked, \u201cNot too much swelling. That\u2019s good. When do you see the doctor?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the faintest idea. She didn\u2019t even know the name of the doctor who had put the cast on.</p><p>Aiden answered. \u201cShe has an appointment with a specialist day after tomorrow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do? How do you know that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI made the appointment for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen were you going to tell me?\u201d she asked, surprised and perturbed that he was making plans for her without her knowledge.</p><p>\u201cDay after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t take the cast off that soon,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just a check to make sure you\u2019re healing properly. I\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden, I might not be here in a couple of days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you will.\u201d</p><p>Cordie wasn\u2019t about to get in an argument with him now. She would wait until they were alone. Then she\u2019d have her say and make him listen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go help with Walker,\u201d Edward said. He turned to Cordie before he left. \u201cIt was a pleasure meeting you. If you have any problems, you let me know.\u201d</p><p>There was a big problem standing in front of her, but she doubted Edward would be able to help her with Aiden.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I have some calls to make.\u201d She crossed the room and stopped. \u201cSpencer, why don\u2019t you call housekeeping and ask them to send someone to clean all this up. It\u2019s a mess.\u201d She saw Aiden\u2019s expression and put her hand up. \u201cYes, I see the parallel.\u201d</p><p>His laughter followed her out the door. It wasn\u2019t at all the same, though. Aiden\u2019s definition of messy was completely different from that of normal people. Leaving a scarf on a table made the room a mess to him. Okay, maybe she left a few more things around the living room than just a scarf, but it wasn\u2019t enough to be considered messy.</p> <p>The security guard walked her back to her door. \u201cMr. Madison was concerned when he couldn\u2019t find you. He calmed down as soon as I explained you were looking in on his brother.\u201d</p><p>Aiden was concerned? Did he think she\u2019d left the hotel? And if so, how would she have accomplished it? She couldn\u2019t step out the door without a guard shadowing her, and if she ever dared to push the elevator button, she\u2019d probably be tackled and dragged back to the suite. As long as Aiden was running things, she wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>She went into her bedroom to get her phone, walked past the closet, and came to a quick stop. The closet had been empty the night before. Now it was filled with clothes. She flipped the light on and walked in. They were her clothes, and not just a few. All the racks were full. On one shelf were three pairs of jeans, all nicely folded. On another shelf were T-shirts.</p><p>Had Aiden done this? And if so, why? Moving everything back or packing it all for the trip to Boston was going to be a real pain. She heard the door to the suite open. Regan was talking on her phone as she walked into the living room. She put her phone on the table along with her purse, then glanced up and saw Cordie.</p><p>\u201cAlec has a box of your shoes. He\u2019ll be here with them in a few minutes. He ran into a friend in the lobby,\u201d she said.</p><p>Thoroughly perplexed, Cordie asked, \u201cWhy is he bringing my shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re going to be staying here for a while, I thought you\u2019d want your clothes and your shoes.\u201d She dropped down on the sofa and patted the cushion next to her. \u201cYou should relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done nothing but relax,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019ll be staying here? I\u2019m ready to go home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I just brought some of your clothes over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018why\u2019? You need your things.\u201d Regan patted the cushion again. \u201cPlease sit.\u201d</p><p>Cordie gave in and plopped down beside her. \u201cRegan, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlec thinks you should stay here awhile longer. You\u2019re safe here, and he thinks it\u2019s going to take some time to figure out who pushed you in front of that car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may never know who did it, although I do have my suspicions. I can\u2019t stay here forever,\u201d she argued. \u201cThis is Aiden\u2019s place, not mine. I\u2019ve intruded long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one who insisted you stay with him, and he\u2019s got plenty of room. The bedrooms are far apart,\u201d Regan pointed out. \u201cYou won\u2019t be in his way because he\u2019s rarely here. And no one can get to you, Cordie. You couldn\u2019t be any safer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also have help here, getting dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can dress myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you put on your skinny jeans with one hand? What about hooking your bra? Maybe when you can move your fingers on your left hand it will be easier, but now you\u2019re kind of stuck, aren\u2019t you? Walker has nurses who will help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I get home, I can hire someone if I need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about security?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll lock my doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you should stay here.\u201d</p><p>Living in such luxury\u2014and yet she felt trapped. If she were being completely honest, she would admit her resistance had little to do with her feelings of independence and more to do with her fear of being alone with Aiden. How could she move on and forget about him if she was living under his roof, seeing him every day, yearning for him to touch her? Cordie wished she could pour her heart out to Regan and tell her what had happened with Aiden in Sydney, but she couldn\u2019t. A couple of nights of insanity in Aiden\u2019s arms didn\u2019t make a relationship, and if Regan knew, she would worry about Cordie, and God only knew what she would say or do to her brother. It wouldn\u2019t matter that they were consenting adults. There was also the fact that Cordie had gone to great lengths to make sure Regan and Sophie believed her infatuation with Aiden was a thing of the past. Boston, she decided for the hundredth time, couldn\u2019t come soon enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not used to being pampered, but I have to admit it\u2019s been very nice. Room service is wonderful, and having my sheets changed is lovely. I don\u2019t have to lift a finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll stay a little longer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, just a little longer,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t complain?\u201d</p><p>Cordie laughed. \u201cI won\u2019t complain. Now, enough about me. What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a little news,\u201d she said. \u201cI took the check over to the horrid woman we rent the cracker-box house from, and she said Alec and I had to sign a year\u2019s lease. We\u2019ve been going month to month while we\u2019ve been looking for a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took my check back and told her we\u2019d be out by next weekend.\u201d</p><p>Cordie knew what was coming. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Regan bit her lip and with an imploring look said, \u201cCould we move into your house now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can. You\u2019re buying the house. Just put my things in the guest room until the movers pick them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Cordie didn\u2019t feel displaced. Things were moving more quickly than she had anticipated, but she was happy her friends were the new owners. Hopefully, everything would work out and she\u2019d be in Boston soon. They talked about the house and the great neighborhood for several more minutes, and then the subject turned to Cordie\u2019s situation.</p><p>Regan shook her head in disgust. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that witch, Simone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe threatened you, didn\u2019t she? I think we can only conclude that she was behind what happened to you. And by any definition, that was attempted murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my conclusion,\u201d Cordie agreed.</p><p>\u201cShe has to be in a panic that her secret will come out, so I say beat her at her own game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it out there. Let everyone in Sydney know what she did to your father and how she abandoned you. Rent a billboard if you have to.\u201d</p><p>Cordie laughed. \u201cA billboard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo whatever it takes,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce the secret\u2019s out, she won\u2019t have any reason to come after you. Hopefully, she\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr she\u2019ll become so enraged she\u2019ll hire ten men to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a possibility,\u201d Regan allowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not okay with Simone getting away with attempted murder. And what about the man who pushed me?\u201d Before Regan could answer, Cordie said, \u201cIf I only expose Simone, what happens to him? I\u2019m not letting him get away with it. He should go to prison with Simone. I want to catch both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the faintest idea. I thought I\u2019d talk to Alec and Jack about it. They\u2019ll come up with something.\u201d</p><p>Regan was pleased. \u201cYou have a lot of faith in my husband and Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. But I know what Alec will say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will I say?\u201d Alec walked in carrying a large box.</p><p>Regan told him to put the box on the floor in Cordie\u2019s closet. \u201cI\u2019ll organize them later.\u201d</p><p>Cordie waited until Alec returned to the living room and then said, \u201cYou\u2019ll say I\u2019m jumping to conclusions without sufficient information and I should look at the whole picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll say.\u201d He walked over to Cordie and kissed her on her forehead. \u201cHow are you feeling, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fine,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cRegan and I love our new house,\u201d he told Cordie.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t exactly own it yet,\u201d Regan reminded him.</p><p>\u201cWe will soon,\u201d he promised. \u201cI heard from Liam, Cordie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he have any news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been checking on those two bodyguards with Simone. They\u2019ve disappeared. He can\u2019t locate them anywhere in Sydney. They haven\u2019t used their passports, but they could be using other identities. If they were on a flight to the United States in the last week, Liam will find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think they followed me to Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a strong possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should set a trap. Waiting is nerve-racking,\u201d Regan offered.</p><p>\u201cLiam will have some information soon,\u201d Alec promised. \u201cBe patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am being patient,\u201d Cordie protested.</p><p>Alec grinned. \u201cI was talking to my wife.\u201d</p><p>Cordie left them to their discussion and went into her bedroom to fetch a couple of magazines she was going to offer Walker. When she returned to the living room, her friends were wrapped in each other\u2019s arms and kissing passionately. Being married for more than a year certainly hadn\u2019t dampened their enthusiasm; they didn\u2019t even notice her walk out the door. There was a different security guard standing in front of the elevator, but he was wearing the same suspicious frown. She nodded to him and continued on to Walker\u2019s suite. The guard rushed ahead to open the door for her.</p><p>Walker was alone, sitting on the sofa with his broken leg in its stiff white cast propped up on a round ottoman. He was wearing clean clothes, gray sweats and white shirt, and had his laptop out.</p><p>\u201cAm I interrupting?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He looked up and smiled. \u201cCome sit with me. You can be my good-luck charm when Aiden and Spencer come back for round two.\u201d</p><p>Cordie was happy to see there were signs of the old Walker, the one she liked, returning. He moved a stack of papers from the sofa so she could sit.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the arm?\u201d he asked, nodding at the sling holding her left arm at a right angle in front of her.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell the truth, Kane.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Walker always called Sophie and her by their last names. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t straighten it and I feel so . . . useless. How\u2019s your leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurts off and on,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t like taking pain pills, though. I don\u2019t like the way they make me feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeer helps,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cWant one?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Walker turned back to his laptop. \u201cI just watched a press conference with Congressman Mitchell Ray Chambers. A reporter e-mailed it to me. The guy\u2019s a real blowhard. Want to watch it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought some land from him and his cousin. Struck a good deal, too,\u201d he bragged. \u201cBut Aiden is fighting me on it.\u201d</p><p>Cordie didn\u2019t usually take an instant dislike to anyone, but the congressman turned out to be an exception. As soon as he smiled into the camera and started talking, she was disgusted. He went on and on about how he had negotiated the deal of the century with Madison and how he had been working on it for more than a year. He stressed that Mayor Green had tried to ruin the sale of Rock Point and then blame him. He wanted his constituents to know he hadn\u2019t allowed that to happen, and he was now thrilled to announce at long last the Hamilton Hotel and Resort was going to be built on Rock Point. It was all thanks to him.</p><p>As soon as the conference ended, Cordie asked, \u201cIs any of what he said true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of it,\u201d Walker answered. \u201cThe congressman did come to me and we worked out a figure to buy the land. I thought it was too good to pass up. It was half the amount Aiden and Spencer had agreed to pay. Half,\u201d he stressed.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you suppose that is? Why would he take so much less?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s up for reelection, and Mayor Green is challenging him in the primary. Her poll numbers are sky-high, and his are in the basement. He\u2019ll do anything to get reelected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said the cousin owns the land with the congressman. He went along with taking less money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did,\u201d Walker said. \u201cMaybe Chambers is giving him his half to make up the difference. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Spencer think about all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he talks about the town adjacent to Rock Point, I can tell he wants the hotel. He said the town\u2019s drying up because there\u2019s no work, and a new hotel and resort would change lives, but he\u2019s with Aiden and doesn\u2019t want to do business with Chambers. Aiden damn well better get behind this.\u201d</p><p>Walker was digging in and ready for a fight. Cordie wasn\u2019t about to get in the middle, but she couldn\u2019t help pointing out the obvious. \u201cI can understand why Aiden and Spencer might be cautious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking their side?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat question is something one of my high school students would ask. No, I\u2019m not taking sides. I\u2019m merely pointing out that you have never, ever shown any interest in the hotel business. Isn\u2019t that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an equal partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho always abstains when there\u2019s a vote.\u201d She nudged him in his side. \u201cAdmit it. Until now you\u2019ve not been that interested, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d he admitted with a sigh of resignation. He leaned back against the cushions, closed his laptop, and dropped it on the seat next to him. \u201cI\u2019ve decided I want to be involved in the family business. They\u2019re not going to let me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cI know they could use the help.\u201d When he appeared to be about to argue, she rushed on, \u201cAnd everyone knows you\u2019re a born negotiator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the charmer in the family, Walker,\u201d she said. \u201cBut do you really want to be a permanent part of the business, or are you doing this until you can go back to racing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m through with racing. It\u2019s time for me to retire.\u201d</p><p>He sounded as though he meant what he said. He\u2019d been racing cars for so long she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever stop, yet she hoped his declaration was sincere. At his core, Walker was a good man. He just needed to slow down long enough to see it . . . and to let others see it.</p> <p>Cordie spent the rest of the day making calls to contractors in Boston, and by the time the nurse helped her shower and put on her blue silk nightgown, she was ready to curl up in front of a television and zone out. Aiden came in around eleven. He locked the door and, without saying a word to her, went into his bedroom. He was probably sick of having her around, she decided. Did he think he was stuck with her? She thought about asking him that very question, then decided he wouldn\u2019t tell her the truth. He was a gentleman. Even if he wanted to, he couldn\u2019t kick her out.</p><p>What was the matter with her tonight? She was feeling restless and out of sorts and having ridiculous thoughts. She knew what was wrong, but it took her a good five minutes to circle around to the truth. She wanted him. She hated being this close to him and being ignored. Cordie was desperate to get out of town. She hated feeling vulnerable and knew she should protect herself. The problem was she didn\u2019t know how.</p><p>A detective show was playing on television. She hadn\u2019t been paying enough attention to be interested and was reaching for the remote to turn it off when Aiden walked in. His hair was wet. He was bare chested and wore a pair of old sweats. He looked good enough to eat. She self-consciously pulled her hair forward, realized what she was doing, and stopped. If a few bruises repulsed him, it was his problem, not hers.</p><p>His expression wasn\u2019t giving anything away. She didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what he was thinking. No wonder he never lost at poker.</p><p>\u201cDid you want something?\u201d Why she\u2019d whispered the question was beyond her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d He came around the sofa and sat down. Then he gently lifted her onto his lap, nudging her legs apart so that she straddled him.</p> <p>Frowning, she leaned up on her knees and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He slowly lifted her nightgown up to her hips. His hands slid over her thighs, and he smiled when he realized she wasn\u2019t wearing underwear. He stared into her eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to make you feel good.\u201d Pulling her toward him, he began to kiss the side of her neck, causing shivers up and down her spine. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to do a thing, Cordelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden . . .\u201d</p><p>His mouth covered hers, and anything she wanted to say was lost in the moment. One kiss, and he made her burn for him. His mouth never left hers as he stoked the fire inside her. When at last they came together, he wouldn\u2019t let her set the pace. He was gentle yet demanding at the same time. Her orgasm was explosive. She cried out and squeezed him tight inside her, triggering his release. He whispered her name when he came; she shouted his.</p><p>He carried her to bed and slept next to her that night, but there weren\u2019t any words of love or praise. She didn\u2019t expect them, and what she found profoundly odd was that she didn\u2019t need them.</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>There were fireworks going off in Walker\u2019s suite, and not the fun kind. Cordie walked into the middle of a colossal argument. All three brothers were there. Aiden was silent, leaning against a credenza with his arms folded as he watched Spencer pace and yell at Walker. The youngest brother seemed oblivious to the uproar. She turned around and tried to leave before she was noticed, but Aiden grabbed her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you I gave my word, and a Madison doesn\u2019t go back on his word,\u201d Walker calmly stated. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Aiden?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did not have the authority to make any deals, Walker,\u201d Spencer railed.</p><p>\u201cCordie, come sit with me,\u201d Walker said.</p><p>Aiden let go of her hand. She didn\u2019t want to sit with Walker; she wanted to leave. \u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo sit,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI\u2019ll stop yelling. I promise.\u201d</p><p>The promise lasted a full minute. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name were you thinking? You\u2019ve never shown the least amount of interest in what we do, and now you\u2019re going to build a hotel? What the hell\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Spencer demanded.</p><p>Cordie noticed Walker\u2019s hands were fisted. She put her hand on top of his and patted him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Cordie?\u201d Walker asked.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re having quite a lively discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLively discussion?\u201d Aiden laughed. \u201cIs that what you\u2019d call this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should let you three have some privacy.\u201d She tried to get up, but Walker pulled her back.</p><p>\u201cTell us your opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cAiden and Spencer won\u2019t bend, and neither will I,\u201d he explained. \u201cMaybe you can make them see what a great deal this is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really, I should leave . . .\u201d</p><p>Walker didn\u2019t let go. She gave up and sat quietly next to him. If he needed an ally, she\u2019d do what she could. She looked around at each of the brothers. \u201cMay I ask a few questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Spencer said.</p><p>\u201cHas a contract been signed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Walker answered. \u201cCongressman Chambers said he\u2019s busy with the campaign right now, but we\u2019ve set a date a week after the primary to sign the contracts. We worked out the terms on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll say he didn\u2019t call,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cTrust me, the bastard will go back on his word. He won\u2019t sell that property for pennies on the dollar.\u201d</p><p>Aiden nodded. \u201cThe congressman is . . .\u201d He caught himself before he said the word he was thinking and substituted, \u201ccorrupt and immoral. I don\u2019t want to work with him. He can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be working with him,\u201d Walker pointed out. \u201cAs soon as he signs the contract, he\u2019s out of the picture. He won\u2019t have anything to do with the hotel and resort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the contract ready to sign?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>Walker nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s basically Spencer\u2019s original contract, but with the lower figure. Congressman Chambers told me he\u2019s gone over every detail and agrees to the new terms. His cousin has also read the contract and is ready to sign.\u201d</p><p>Spencer dropped into a chair facing Walker. He braced his arms on his knees, leaned forward, and said, \u201cHow did this happen? How did you get involved in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. Chambers contacted me. He said he was willing to bargain, but you had shut the door to any future negotiations. I pulled up the original contract you and Aiden had taken to him that he refused to sign\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter giving his word,\u201d Spencer interjected.</p><p>\u201cYes, after giving his word. He said after he thought about it, he realized selling Rock Point would be such an economic boon for the community, he couldn\u2019t stand in the way. He asked me what it would take. I gave him a figure and he agreed. We\u2019re getting Rock Point for half the original price. That\u2019s a hell of a deal.\u201d</p><p>Aiden was trying to hold on to his temper. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to sign the contract,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all a con to beat Mayor Green in the primary. Fallsborough is a one-party town, and whoever wins the primary will win in November.\u201d</p><p>Spencer nodded. \u201cGreen was way ahead until Congressman Chambers held a press conference to boast that he sold Rock Point to us. I\u2019m betting he\u2019ll hold another press conference before the primary to remind voters he saved the day by bringing the Hamilton Hotel to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll sign it,\u201d Walker insisted.</p><p>\u201cNo, he won\u2019t,\u201d Aiden argued, impatient at his brother\u2019s persistence. \u201cHe\u2019s never going to sign it for that amount of money. He\u2019s greedy and he\u2019s manipulative. You can\u2019t trust anything he says. The very fact that he\u2019s scheduled to sign the contract after the primary should have been a warning sign. He\u2019ll wait until he\u2019s won the election and then he\u2019ll back out of the deal. He still thinks he can get more out of Rock Point. He\u2019ll tell the press we changed our minds or he\u2019ll come up with an even better story.\u201d</p><p>Walker wasn\u2019t giving in. He was defiant when he said, \u201cYou think I let him manipulate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Spencer said, and the argument escalated until Spencer was shouting and Aiden was once again stone-faced. After ten minutes of useless back-and-forth, Cordie raised her hand. The brothers stopped talking.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not in a classroom, Cordelia. Did you want to say something?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cThere are two different issues at play here. First is the congressman.\u201d Turning to Walker, she said, \u201cI think agreeing to buy Rock Point for half the original price was brilliant. Now all you have to do is wait for Aiden to force the congressman and his cousin to sign the contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can he do that?\u201d Spencer wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to surprise him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d A hint of a smile softened Aiden\u2019s expression.</p><p>She slowly nodded. \u201cYou know what to do.\u201d She didn\u2019t think she needed to spell it out for him. Aiden\u2019s mind was every bit as devious as hers.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she said, and stood to leave. \u201cSophie\u2019s coming over soon, and that\u2019s going to turn into a whole . . . thing.\u201d</p><p>Walker stopped her. \u201cYou said there were two issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. The other issue is you, Walker. Spencer and Aiden are having difficulty dealing with the fact that you want to be part of the team. I suggest you three sit down and figure it all out.\u201d</p><p>Walker was nodding his agreement as she walked toward the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Aiden said to his brothers as he rushed around Cordie to open the door for her. Once they were in the hall, he smiled at her. \u201cYou\u2019re very shrewd, Dr. Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Madison,\u201d she replied, somewhat surprised by his praise. Aiden didn\u2019t hand out compliments readily.</p><p>There was a different security guard in front of the elevator. He wasn\u2019t wearing a name tag, but Aiden knew him.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your brother doing, Josh?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cReal good,\u201d the young man answered. \u201cHe\u2019s going to run track in the fall. He\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019ll make the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d Aiden replied.</p><p>How did he keep everyone straight? Cordie wondered. He had hundreds of employees. He couldn\u2019t possibly know all of them, and yet she had a feeling he did.</p><p>After introducing her to Josh, Aiden took her arm and turned her toward their suite. Looking over his shoulder at the guard, he said, \u201cYou know the rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I do.\u201d</p><p>Cordie stopped in the middle of the hall. \u201cWhat rule?\u201d she asked. Aiden was trying to get her into the suite, but she wasn\u2019t budging.</p><p>Josh didn\u2019t seem to notice the struggle and answered her. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave this floor unless you\u2019re with Mr. Madison.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at Aiden as he dragged her into the suite. \u201cI can\u2019t leave the floor unless I\u2019m with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was speaking English, Cordelia. You heard what he said.\u201d He picked up a folder from the table and turned to go back to Walker\u2019s suite.</p><p>She followed him to the door. \u201cI have to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re so nice to everyone else and so rude to me?\u201d</p><p>His answer didn\u2019t please her. He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait around to hear if he had anything to say about her comment, knowing it would probably set off her temper. Aiden was arrogant, bossy, and a know-it-all. And she was still hopelessly in love with him.</p><p>Crap.</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Cordie spent the rest of the day with Sophie and Regan. Her friends had taken some time off from work to be with her. She knew they were worried about her, and she tried her best to calm their fears. She kept insisting she was on the mend and was safe. She also insisted that soon Alec and Jack would come up with a brilliant plan to get the man who tried to kill her.</p><p>Regan surprised her and Sophie with spa treatments. Since Cordie couldn\u2019t go down to the spa, the spa came to her. Regan handed her a pamphlet and told her to choose the treatments she wanted. Cordie didn\u2019t know what half of them were, so Regan made the choices for her. While she and Sophie had facials, Cordie\u2019s hair was shampooed, trimmed, and styled. She was also waxed everywhere, it seemed. After that, she was plucked and then slathered with the most wonderful scented lotion. Last but certainly not least, she was given a lovely pedicure with Mula Red polish. While she was most appreciative, she couldn\u2019t help but feel like a car up on a rack getting a lube job. When she made the comment aloud, Regan wanted to know what kind of car, which instigated a whole other conversation among the friends.</p><p>As they were sitting quietly waiting for their nails to dry, Sophie wanted to hear the details of Cordie\u2019s near-death experience once more.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me go over it again,\u201d Cordie begged. \u201cAnd FYI, it wasn\u2019t a near-death experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I write about it for my newspaper, it will be,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>\u201cYou do the cooking column,\u201d Regan reminded her. \u201cWhich I still find hilarious. How are you going to work in the near-death angle?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy,\u201d Sophie said. I\u2019ll write something like: \u2018When you eat this chocolate souffl\u00e9, you\u2019ll think you\u2019ve died and gone to heaven . . . and speaking of dying, my friend Cordie . . .\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you come up with new recipes, Sophie?\u201d Cordie asked. \u201cWe know you can\u2019t cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m getting better. But I have a secret weapon.\u201d</p><p>Regan guessed. \u201cYour husband.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cHe loves to cook, and he\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>Cordie was feeling so serene she sat back against the soft cushions of the sofa with her feet propped up and dozed off while her friends chatted around her. She woke up when Sophie nudged her.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I what?\u201d Cordie asked, startled from her slumber.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Regan\u2019s brothers will ever get married?\u201d</p> <p>She thought about it for a minute and said, \u201cSpencer will. Of the three, he\u2019s the most compassionate. Walker . . . maybe. He\u2019s vulnerable now, and I think it would be difficult for him to trust anyone outside his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Aiden?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know about him.\u201d She did know, though. He was too driven to settle down . . . too busy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll marry,\u201d Sophie surmised. \u201cBut then, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever get married, and look what happened.\u201d</p><p>Regan smiled. \u201cJack happened,\u201d she said.</p><p>Sophie blew on her fingernails and tapped one to make sure it was dry. \u201cHow are you getting along with Aiden?\u201d she asked Cordie. \u201cIs it weird sharing a suite with him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook how big this place is,\u201d Regan said, throwing her arms wide. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of room for both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get along just fine. He\u2019s rarely here, and I hardly notice him when he is,\u201d Cordie asserted, knowing full well that wasn\u2019t true. Now she was lying to her friends, and the more questions they asked about Aiden, the more lies she would tell. Not wanting to continue the conversation, she jumped up and reached for the hotel phone. \u201cLet\u2019s order room service. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea,\u201d Regan said. \u201cI\u2019m suddenly in the mood for a chocolate souffl\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>Cordie decided she was going to have to give up sex. To be more specific, sex with Aiden. Not that being specific mattered. Before Aiden, she hadn\u2019t had sex with any man in such a long time she thought there must be something wrong with her. Had she turned into a female eunuch? Or had her hormones taken a sabbatical?</p><p>Saying no to the sexiest man alive . . . how hard could that be? She\u2019d given up sugar and caffeine for Lent last year, and she\u2019d gotten through the forty days without cheating. Granted, the first week had been rough. She\u2019d had a horrid headache, and the boys at school ran the other way when they saw her coming, but she\u2019d gotten past it.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t at all the same. She\u2019d already given up on her \u201cI\u2019m over him\u201d mantra. How could she possibly get over the man while she was living with him? She could walk away from him, though. She could go into her bedroom and shut the door.</p><p>Oh, who was she kidding? Just thinking about the way he touched her made her breathless. The erotic words he whispered in her ear were so hot.</p> <p>She had it bad, all right, and she didn\u2019t know what in the world she could do about it. He hadn\u2019t given her any promises, and she didn\u2019t have any expectations of a future together. For him it had just been raw sex, and she was okay with that.</p><p>It was closing in on midnight when she gave up trying to sleep. She\u2019d been tossing and turning so many times she felt as though she were on a trampoline. It was all the caffeine she\u2019d had today, she decided. That was the reason she couldn\u2019t doze off. It had nothing to do with the fact that Aiden wasn\u2019t home yet. Home? She was calling the suite home now?</p><p>She went into the living room and turned on the television. She had a game plan. She would channel surf until she found something boring, like golf or fishing, and that would make her sleepy.</p><p>Who knew learning how to gut a walleye could be interesting? The next program did the trick, though. Fishing with Larry was exactly what Cordie needed. Everyone on the show whispered so they wouldn\u2019t disturb the fish. It was incredibly boring. She drifted off but woke up sometime in the middle of the night. She was wrapped in Aiden\u2019s strong arms and sleeping in his bed. He smelled so good, and his body was hard and warm, and oh, did she want him. All she had to do was kiss the side of his neck, just under his ear, and whisper his name. He did the rest. He was gentle with her, taking care to protect her injured arm, yet he was forceful, pushing her to the brink and then pulling back until she was writhing in his arms and begging. He was more out of control this time, and when he cl**axed, she was there with him.</p><p>Cordie slept soundly in his arms all night long, and when she awoke, Aiden had already left the suite . . . most likely to go down to his office, she supposed. She went into her bedroom, put on her robe, and padded to the bathroom to brush her teeth. Nurse Patty knocked on her door a minute later, and Cordie was thankful the woman hadn\u2019t found her in Aiden\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cMr. Madison will be back here to pick you up at twelve thirty,\u201d Patty announced. \u201cHe said to tell you that he and two FBI agents will be taking you to the doctor today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack and Alec are good friends. You\u2019ve met them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll watch out for you. They won\u2019t let anyone push you into traffic today. I don\u2019t think you really need them, though, not with Mr. Madison around. I know he doesn\u2019t carry a gun, but he could take on anyone who tried to harm you. He plays sports, you know.\u201d She added with a nod, \u201cHe\u2019s quite competitive and strong.\u201d</p><p>Cordie knew how strong he was. She\u2019d caressed and kissed nearly every inch of his magnificent body. She had trailed her fingertips across his chest and shoulders and down his upper arms. She had felt the heat from his muscles, the sinewy strength just below the surface. Thinking about him made her pulse race. She realized she was holding her breath and slowly let it out.</p><p>Patty stared at her with a quizzical expression. \u201cWhat were you thinking about just now? You had the sweetest look in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Cordie wasn\u2019t about to tell her the truth. \u201cI was thinking that normally I can take care of myself. Aiden taught Regan and Sophie and me a few tricks.\u201d</p><p>Patty helped her put the plastic sleeve over her cast so it wouldn\u2019t get wet while she showered; then she gathered the soap and shampoo and towels and placed them within easy reach, keeping up a constant chatter as she worked. An hour later Cordie was dressed and ready for the day. She wore a simple white blouse and a blue-and-white skirt with ballet flats. Patty helped her brush her hair and then left to tend to Walker. There was still some time left before Cordie had to leave for her doctor\u2019s appointment, so she set up her laptop on the table. While she ate a bowl of yogurt with fruit and granola, she worked on answering e-mails. There were several from her former students, and she replied to them first. She might no longer be their teacher, but she didn\u2019t want to lose touch.</p><p>Aiden came into the suite ten minutes early. He gave her the once-over and asked, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>She shut down her computer, picked up her purse, and walked to the door. \u201cWhat about Alec and Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting in the lobby.\u201d He turned her toward him and adjusted her sling. \u201cYou stay close to me,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>His hand was on the doorknob, but he stood there, waiting. She assumed he wanted her agreement. \u201cYes, I will.\u201d</p><p>Before she could guess what he was going to do, he leaned down and kissed her. It was a long, thoroughly hot kiss, and when he pulled back, she sagged against him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said in his brisk, abrupt voice.</p><p>He obviously wasn\u2019t having quite the reaction she was. She straightened away from him and walked by his side around the corner to the elevator. The guard was holding the doors open. When they emerged in the lobby, she spotted Alec and Jack standing in front of the hotel\u2019s tall revolving doors. She moved closer to Aiden, trying to look at every face as they crossed the lobby. Was someone waiting to grab her? Unless he wore a sign, she wouldn\u2019t be able to tell if anyone was there to make trouble. She didn\u2019t know what to look for.</p><p>Jack drove them, and Aiden sat next to Cordie in the backseat. He put his hand on top of hers and asked, \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Do you think the doctor will give me a shot?\u201d</p><p>It took a couple of seconds for him to realize she was teasing. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny, Cordelia. I was asking if you were nervous being outside. This is serious . . .\u201d</p><p>He was getting angry, and she could feel the tension in him. \u201cI\u2019m not nervous, because I\u2019m in good hands. You did say you wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to me, and I believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d He was appeased.</p><p>Alec turned toward them, noticed Aiden was holding her hand, but didn\u2019t comment of course. He said, \u201cCordie, I talked to Liam last night, and he wants you to get a DNA test as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he explain why?\u201d Aiden asked. \u201cDoes he have a plan in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s working on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason for a DNA test is to legally prove I\u2019m related to that witch. What\u2019s he going to do with it? I don\u2019t want or need proof,\u201d Cordie protested.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll get the test anyway, won\u2019t you?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be quick and easy,\u201d Jack told her.</p><p>\u201cOver before you know it,\u201d Alec added.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, I\u2019m getting the test, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cI never really had a choice, did I?\u201d</p><p>Alec told her the truth, but he said it with a grin. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Cordie stared out the window. It was a beautiful sunny day and as hot as the devil, which she loved. She tried to sit back and calmly watch the passing scenes on the street, but she couldn\u2019t. There were too many thoughts racing through her mind that needed to be sorted out. She was about to have a DNA test. What did Liam plan to do with it? What was the connection to the man who tried to kill her? Was he still out there, and would he try again?</p><p>She could feel her stomach tightening, and she leaned into Aiden\u2019s side. Just being close to his strength and his confidence was comforting. He was getting one phone call after another, and usually he would be on his phone nonstop doing business, but today he let the calls go to voice mail. The texts were also piling up, but he ignored those as well. It suddenly occurred to her that she had assumed he would go with her to the doctor. Now, why had she done that? He had to know she was safe with Jack and Alec, yet he\u2019d either canceled or rescheduled his appointments to go with her. It was so thoughtful of him, so caring. Her mood lightened, and she suddenly wanted to kiss him. Unfortunately, the feeling didn\u2019t last. Aiden ruined it when he said, \u201cIt won\u2019t be long before this will all be over, and we can get on with our lives.\u201d</p><p>Had they been alone, she would have told him he could get on with his damn life right this minute. She wasn\u2019t his responsibility or his obligation. They weren\u2019t alone, though, and she knew Alec and Jack were listening to the conversation. She chose a more subtle response. She moved away from him and turned to look out the window again.</p><p>They were in and out of the specialist\u2019s office in record time. The waiting room was packed, but as soon as the receptionist saw two armed men with badges, she quickly ushered all of them into an exam room. Cordie felt ridiculous sitting on the exam table with three big men surrounding her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m safe here,\u201d she told them. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you all go sit in the waiting room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going out there,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI might catch something.\u201d</p><p>Alec nodded in agreement.</p><p>Cordie laughed. \u201cBroken bones aren\u2019t contagious.\u201d</p><p>Alec looked skeptical, but he relented. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right outside the door.\u201d</p><p>Jack followed him, but from Aiden\u2019s stance it was apparent he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. He stood with his back to the wall and his arms folded across his chest. He stayed with her while the doctor, who didn\u2019t have a humble bone in his body, looked at his handiwork and praised himself for the fine job he\u2019d done. He ordered an X-ray, was pleased with the film, and told her she would be in the cast another four weeks. Next came the DNA test, which was quick and easy. They were on their way back to the hotel in a matter of minutes.</p><p>Jack pulled up in the circle drive, parked in front of the hotel steps, and motioned to the guard who was waiting just inside the doors.</p><p>Alec got out of the passenger seat and opened the door for Cordie. \u201cWe\u2019re going to check in with security before we take off,\u201d he said. He was about to say something else, but his cell phone rang. \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve got to take this,\u201d he said.</p><p>Aiden wouldn\u2019t let Cordie stand there any longer. He took hold of her arm and pulled her along. Once inside the doors, he motioned to the security guard, and the two men flanked her sides as they crossed the lobby. Cordie appreciated the protection, but she was beginning to feel like some paparazzi target being shuffled away from the crowd. The hotel guests stepped aside as the men rushed her through the lobby. She did her best not to look conspicuous, but it was difficult.</p><p>Even though she was walking at a fast clip, she spotted Patty near the bellman desk talking to a man holding a huge vase of calla lilies, and she wondered which one of Walker\u2019s admirers had sent the impressive get-well surprise. The arrangement was spectacular, so large the deliveryman had to hold it with both his arms around the vase. She couldn\u2019t see his face, but she could see Patty\u2019s clearly. It was flushed. Was she flirting? It seemed so. The nurse was so wrapped up in keeping the man\u2019s attention, she didn\u2019t notice Cordie waving to her. Cordie stepped into the penthouse elevator, and as the doors were closing, she heard the man\u2019s booming laughter and smiled in reaction. So he was flirting, too. Ah, the power of love. Did most men and women want to fall in love? she wondered. Opening their hearts and becoming vulnerable made them either very brave or stupidly naive, and at the moment she believed she belonged in the stupidly naive category. Loving Aiden was god-awful painful, and she had had enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the elevator doors opened onto the penthouse floor, she turned to Aiden. \u201cThank you for taking the time to go with me today. I know how busy your job is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the job right now,\u201d he said.</p><p>The guard on duty opened the door to the suite for them, but Aiden didn\u2019t follow her in, explaining that he needed to check in at his office. Before he left her, he said, \u201cI have to go out of town tomorrow, but you can\u2019t be alone, Cordelia. We\u2019ll work out a schedule tonight.\u201d</p><p>The door closed before she could protest. Did he think she still needed a babysitter? He was being ridiculous. Once she was inside the suite, she was as safe as could be. Time for another talk, she decided, and this time she would make him listen. She dropped her purse on the sofa, then reconsidered and took it to her bedroom. She didn\u2019t want Aiden, Mr. Neurotic, to hyperventilate if he saw it. She took out her cell phone before setting the purse on a side table and checked her messages. There were five texts in all. She sat on the edge of the bed and scrolled through them. Four were from contractors in Boston. One was from Sophie asking about her doctor\u2019s appointment, so she called her to give a report. Ten minutes later, they were still chatting. Sophie was filling her in on the fishing trip she and Jack had just taken.</p> <p>\u201cI can teach you how to gut a walleye,\u201d Cordie offered.</p><p>Sophie was taken aback. \u201cYou . . . what? When did you learn that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other night I was . . . oh, never mind.\u201d</p><p>After the conversation ended, Cordie went back to her texts and discovered one from Alec, sent a few minutes ago. He said he was just leaving the hotel and realized he forgot to ask her if she was up for dinner tonight with Regan and him. She decided to call him right away. Dinner with her friends would cheer her up.</p><p>He answered on the first ring. \u201cHi,\u201d she said as she walked back into the living room. \u201cDinner sounds great. Make sure Jack and Sophie . . .\u201d</p> <p>Her head was down, but out of the corner of her eye something caught her attention. Her head snapped up and she saw the flowers. Then she saw him. Immediately she recognized the angry determination in his eyes, the scowl, the Fu Manchu mustache. She did the only thing she could do. She screamed bloody murder. He dropped the flowers\u2014the vase shattering into a thousand pieces\u2014and came at her fast as the door to the suite was closing behind him. She kept screaming. She knew she had to get to the hallway to get help. If she ran into the bedroom, she would be trapped. She circled the table and made a run for it, but he caught her before she reached the door, his hands on her throat, cutting off her air supply.</p><p>Jack had just put the car in drive when he and Alec heard her scream through the phone. He slammed the gear back into park and was out of the car and up the steps in record time. Alec was already ahead of him.</p><p>Aiden also heard her. He had just stepped off the elevator when Cordie\u2019s ear-piercing scream hit him like a lightning bolt. He raced to get to her.</p><p>Cordie was not going to die without a fight. She made a fist and punched the man as hard as she could in his Adam\u2019s apple. It slowed him down, but not for long. He gagged and released his grip for a split second, then grabbed her again. Realizing she was no match for his strength, she went limp and slumped to the floor, but he had such a strong hold on her, he pulled her back up. Time slowed in her mind, and she was about to black out when suddenly he was ripped away from her. Gasping for air, she slid down the wall. The world was spinning, but all she could see was Aiden, and she was terrified he was going to get hurt. When she finally could focus, she realized Aiden was pounding the hell out of the attacker. Good God, he was going to kill him.</p><p>Time was suspended in her mind. Suddenly Alec was there, and Jack was right behind him. She watched Alec pull Aiden off her attacker while Jack lifted her and carried her to the sofa.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a look,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAre you hurt anywhere?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. Her voice was so hoarse she didn\u2019t recognize it. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>The second he let go of her she jumped up and lost her balance. Her legs had turned to rubber. Grabbing Jack\u2019s arm, she took a deep breath to calm herself. She couldn\u2019t stop staring at Aiden. The look in his eyes was chilling. If Alec had let him, she thought Aiden would have beaten the man to death. It wasn\u2019t temper she was seeing, or anger. It was fury.</p><p>While Alec was handcuffing him, the man said something Aiden took offense to. Aiden tried to grab him, but Alec blocked him with his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. Call her a bitch again. See what happens,\u201d Aiden taunted, his voice deceptively calm. When he tried again to push Alec out of his way, Jack moved in front of him\u2014no small trick, to be sure\u2014and began to pat down the man while Alec recited his rights.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Jack asked. The man shrugged and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s one of the men who was with Simone,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cHis name is . . .\u201d</p><p>Alec finished her sentence. \u201cArnold Jenkins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know\u2014\u201d Cordie began.</p> <p>\u201cLiam,\u201d Alec answered.</p><p>Cordie was too shaken to think it through. Everything was happening so fast.</p><p>\u201cIs your buddy Charles Kendrick with you?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>Jenkins\u2019s response was obscene. Alec had had enough of his filthy mouth and slammed him into the wall. \u201cStop talking,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Jack searched Jenkins and found no identification, just a hotel key card in his back pocket. He pulled a fierce-looking knife out of his left boot. There was a small pistol tucked in the other. As soon as he held up the weapons for Alec to see, Jenkins demanded a lawyer.</p><p>\u201cWho do you want to call first?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cA lawyer or Simone?\u201d</p><p>Jenkins looked at him blankly for a second and then grinned up at him with an arrogant smirk. The action was not lost on Jack and Alec, who exchanged a what-was-that-all-about glance.</p><p>Aiden went to Cordie and put his arm around her. She could feel him shaking when he gently pulled her down to sit on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d he asked her. \u201cWe should get a doctor here to look at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she insisted. \u201cHe just choked me a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChoked you a little?\u201d Aiden was so inflamed he could barely get the words out.</p><p>Jack crossed to the sofa and squatted down to look at Cordie\u2019s neck. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad,\u201d he said. \u201cHis neck looks worse than yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hit him in his Adam\u2019s apple with my fist,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>Alec had pushed Jenkins into a chair by the door and was on the phone. He finished the call and said, \u201cJack, five, maybe ten, minutes away.\u201d</p><p>Jack explained. \u201cAlec has a couple of agents swinging by to get Jenkins. We\u2019ll instruct them to lock him in isolation until we get around to interrogating him and letting him call a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that legal? Putting him in isolation?\u201d Cordie whispered so Jenkins wouldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cProcessing a suspect takes time,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd Alec and I don\u2019t like it when someone hurts one of our own.\u201d</p><p>They considered her one of their own. She was touched and suddenly feeling very emotional. She wiped a tear from her eye. \u201cMake him sweat,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s a given.\u201d He patted her hand, then walked over to Alec and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got this. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll go ahead and ride with Jenkins, make sure he\u2019s put where I want him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you interrogate him, I want to be there,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>Alec shook his head. \u201cSorry, but no.\u201d</p><p>An argument started and didn\u2019t end until Jack left with Jenkins in tow. As he was walking out the door, he told Aiden, \u201cYou better figure out how he got up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do that right now,\u201d Aiden assured him. \u201cAlec, are you staying here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a little while. Then I\u2019m heading over to Jenkins\u2019s hotel room with Jack. The crew should already be on their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait until I get back,\u201d Aiden told him. \u201cWalker and his nurse must have heard Cordelia. I want to tell them she\u2019s okay.\u201d His voice turned hard. \u201cAnd I want to find that guard.\u201d He paused at the door to smile at Cordie. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a wicked scream.\u201d</p><p>After the door closed behind him, she asked Alec, \u201cWas that a compliment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you excuse me a moment?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for permission but went into her bathroom to splash cold water on her face. When she looked in the mirror, she was pleasantly surprised. The skin on her neck was red, but she didn\u2019t think there would be much of a bruise. Her sling was torn. She couldn\u2019t remember that happening. Jenkins must have grabbed it when he tried to drag her up to her feet. The memory was way too fresh. She pressed her back against the wall and took several deep breaths. She was her father\u2019s daughter, she reminded herself. No time for tears or tantrums. She needed to stay tough, to keep it together. She could break down tonight when she was alone.</p><p>She took a few minutes to clean up. After tossing the sling into the trash, she changed into a new blouse, combed her hair, and applied a little lip gloss. At the moment, that was the best she could do. She sat on her bed for a while, willing her heart to stop racing, and when at last she felt composed, she took a notepad and pen from the nightstand drawer and returned to the living room.</p><p>Aiden was already back and standing at the bar talking to Alec. She went to the dining table, pulled out a chair, and sat down.</p><p>\u201cCordie, would you like something to drink?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cDiet Coke, please.\u201d Her voice was still raspy, and her throat was sore from the man\u2019s hands squeezing it closed.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want something stronger?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>Aiden filled a glass with ice and poured the drink for her. He put it on the table and pulled out the chair adjacent to her while Alec took the seat across from him. Both men were studying her. Cordie was acting as though nothing out of the ordinary had happened, and Alec was impressed by how she was able to hold it all together. Aiden, on the other hand, was worried. He knew she needed to let out her feelings, not squelch them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the paper and pen for?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d make notes and write down Liam\u2019s phone number. I want to call him.\u201d She picked up the pen and looked at Alec. \u201cMay I have his phone number?\u201d</p><p>He had the number memorized and rattled it off to her. It was only when she started to write the numbers that she realized her predicament. She was left-handed, and unfortunately her left arm was in a cast. She wasn\u2019t ambidextrous, but she tried to write Liam\u2019s name with her right hand, giving up after three letters. The scribbles looked like a preschooler\u2019s work.</p><p>She pushed the paper and pen to Alec, who said, \u201cWhere\u2019s your phone? I\u2019ll program Liam\u2019s information in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I had it when he\u2014\u201d She stopped suddenly, took a breath, and asked Aiden to call her cell phone.</p><p>They found it under a chair. After adding Liam\u2019s contact information, Alec handed the phone to her. \u201cI want to know why you want to call him,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you can explain later. Right now I want to hear what happened. Did you let Jenkins in? Did you open the door for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He was walking into the suite when I came out of the bedroom. I saw the flowers . . . then him.\u201d Frowning, she looked around the room. \u201cWhat happened to the flowers?\u201d</p><p>Alec pointed to the foyer. The flowers were strewn all over the marble floor, and the vase was in scattered shards. She thought it odd that she hadn\u2019t noticed the mess until now. Had he thrown them? She couldn\u2019t remember. She\u2019d been busy at the time trying to keep the maniac from choking her to death.</p><p>\u201cHow did he get past security?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>Aiden had the answer. Patty had gone to the lobby on her break to make a few personal calls. Jenkins approached her with flowers and asked if she knew where the penthouse elevator was located. He was dressed in navy pants and a navy shirt with the name of the florist shop on the back, and he also wore a baseball cap with the florist\u2019s logo. She offered to carry the flowers up but realized the vase was too heavy for her. Without thinking, she took him up with her. That was the first mistake.</p><p>The second mistake was made by the guard on duty. Walker was pitching a fit because he couldn\u2019t get into the wheelchair without help. The guard left his post in front of the elevator and went into the suite to help.</p><p>Third mistake: Patty rushed to Cordie\u2019s suite and opened the door for Jenkins, not realizing Cordie was back from the doctor yet. Telling Jenkins to just put the flowers on the table, she ran around the corner to help Walker.</p><p>Aiden wanted to fire everyone, including Walker\u2014if that were possible\u2014for being impatient and demanding everyone\u2019s attention. He wasn\u2019t thinking like a businessman now because he was still having an emotional reaction to almost losing Cordelia. He wouldn\u2019t allow himself to acknowledge why he was out of control when it came to her, or why just thinking about anyone hurting her sent him into a rage. He found it impossible to be reasonable.</p><p>Cordie talked him off the ledge and saved a few jobs in the process. She pointed out that yes, while mistakes were made, everyone would now be more vigilant. In the end Aiden compromised to keep the peace. He would let Patty continue to take care of Walker and to help Cordelia when she needed her assistance, and he would transfer the guard to another less stressful position in the hotel. He told Alec, if he had to hire his very own SWAT team to keep Cordelia safe, then, by God, that\u2019s what he would do.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when Regan was in trouble?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cShe was being stalked, and you investigated. Once the nightmare was over, we were stuck with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the time she was temporarily living at the hotel, and you posted a guard.\u201d</p><p>Aiden nodded. \u201cYes, I did. I was worried about my sister.\u201d</p><p>Alec was walking to the door as he continued. \u201cYou were upset, but you were in control. It\u2019s different with Cordie, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The door closed without an answer.</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Jenkins had been staying at an upscale hotel, but his room was a pigsty. There was a Do Not Disturb sign on the door, letting housekeeping know they were not to enter. His clothes were on the bed, the chair, and the floor. There were a few items hanging in the closet. Wet towels covered the bathroom floor, and carryout containers spilled out of every trash can. They found a Glock hidden under the mattress. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack held it up and asked, \u201cWhere did he get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to ask him,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>On the desk in plain sight were three Testor burner phones. Two were fully charged but hadn\u2019t been used. The third was just a shell.</p><p>Alec showed it to Jack. \u201cHow much do you want to bet he was using this one to call Australia?\u201d</p> <p>Gloves on, they went through all the trash hoping they\u2019d find the guts of the phone, but they didn\u2019t. It would have helped their case to have evidence of a link between Chicago and Sydney, to hit redial and see who answered. No such luck. Nothing about this was easy.</p><p>TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>Before heading to pick up carryout, Alec and Jack dropped their wives off at the hotel. The men had told them what had happened to Cordie, and Sophie and Regan wanted to see for themselves that she was all right. Cordie answered all their questions while they helped her change into comfortable yoga pants and a top.</p><p>\u201cHow come you have so many workout clothes, and you don\u2019t work out?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to start as soon as I get settled in Boston. I used to get such a workout at St. Matthew\u2019s running up and down the stairs a hundred times a day. Now I sit like a blob.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t work out, Sophie,\u201d Regan reminded her as she was brushing Cordie\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cI do now with Jack. I\u2019m actually starting to like it.\u201d</p><p>Regan and Cordie laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Regan said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a bad liar,\u201d Cordie added.</p><p>Sophie shrugged and nodded in agreement. \u201cI really am.\u201d</p> <p>Cordie stood. \u201cLeave my hair alone, Regan,\u201d she said, taking the brush from her hand. \u201cI\u2019m starving. When will Alec and Jack be here?\u201d she asked as she headed to the living room.</p><p>\u201cAnytime now,\u201d Regan answered. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing carryout. Alec wouldn\u2019t tell me where they\u2019re getting the food. He just said it was something exotic and we\u2019d love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPizza.\u201d Sophie and Cordie said the word together.</p><p>Regan nodded. \u201cYes, pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack told me they\u2019re getting healthy food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPizza,\u201d Cordie said again as she took a seat on the sofa and folded her legs under her. Sophie kicked off her heels and joined her, and Regan curled up in a chair across from them.</p><p>\u201cYou should have seen this place earlier. There was glass everywhere and flowers. Housekeeping made it spotless again.\u201d When she saw her friends exchange a fearful glance, she quickly added, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about what happened.\u201d</p><p>Regan nodded in agreement. \u201cI\u2019ve got a huge favor to ask you, Cordie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019ll do it,\u201d Sophie said confidently.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Summerset Ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe always go together,\u201d Sophie insisted. \u201cThe Summerset Foundation helps a lot of people, and the ball is their big event. Regan\u2019s working on the committee this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have fun, don\u2019t you? It won\u2019t be the same if you aren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a month. You could stay here that long, couldn\u2019t you, before you move to Boston?\u201d Regan pleaded.</p><p>Sophie patted Cordie\u2019s knee and said, \u201cA month isn\u2019t long at all, and didn\u2019t you tell us you were having work done on your Boston town house before you moved in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlec told me they haven\u2019t even started refinishing the floors. Something about a union fight. Nothing to do with your town house, but that was the reason for the delay. I guess the dispute is still going on, and they won\u2019t go back to work until it\u2019s settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, you can\u2019t go anywhere as long as people are trying to kill you. Right?\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>The reminder was given in such a blas\u00e9 voice, Cordie began to laugh. \u201cRight,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut that will be resolved soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound confident,\u201d Regan remarked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Summerset . . . ,\u201d Sophie began.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m already in Boston, I\u2019ll fly back for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Aiden?\u201d Regan asked the question and looked around the room as though she expected her brother to pop up from behind a chair.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cSo you can stop looking for him.\u201d</p><p>Her comment set them off, and Alec, Jack, and Aiden walked in to the joyful sound of laughter. Jack carried a stack of pizza boxes from Tony\u2019s Pizzeria. Alec had beer. Aiden was taking off his tie. He took a bottle of beer from Alec, opened it, and took a long swallow.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Spencer?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>\u201cMeetings,\u201d he answered but didn\u2019t embellish. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked Cordie.</p><p>\u201cMy arm\u2019s a little sore, but I\u2019m fine, thank you. You should go get Walker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>Her question made him smile. She\u2019d sounded so suspicious. \u201cHe\u2019s just busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves Tony\u2019s pizza. You should take him a couple of slices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordelia, he\u2019s with someone, a female someone.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand why, but the realization that Walker was entertaining a woman embarrassed her, probably because Aiden had to spell it out for her.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Aiden laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re blushing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordie,\u201d Sophie called. \u201cAlec brought Kelly\u2019s root beer. I know you love it.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s was a locally owned company, and their root beer was hugely popular. Jack opened a cold bottle for Cordie and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cMy boss, Mr. Bitterman, is addicted to the stuff,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>Aiden followed Cordie to the table. \u201cWhen is Liam calling?\u201d he asked Alec.</p><p>\u201cTen o\u2019clock. I\u2019ll set up the computer so we can see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to see him,\u201d Aiden said, his irritation obvious in his voice. \u201cI want to know what the hell he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>Cordie understood Aiden\u2019s frustration. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll have made some progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome progress? I want to hear that there\u2019ve been arrests and confessions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden, you should be more patient,\u201d Regan said.</p><p>\u201cThe hell with that. Has Jenkins said anything yet?\u201d he asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but he will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d Cordie wondered.</p><p>Alec answered. \u201cHe\u2019s being charged with attempted murder. We\u2019re letting that fact settle in his mind, and when we next talk to him, we think he\u2019ll want to make a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, he\u2019ll give you Simone for a lesser charge?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>Aiden knew that Alec and Jack were excellent at what they did. They had the commendations to prove it, but he still wanted to take over and tell them what to do. None of his suggestions were legal, though, but in his mind, after seeing that bastard\u2019s hands on Cordelia, he didn\u2019t think that mattered.</p><p>\u201cCordie, where\u2019s your sling? Shouldn\u2019t you be wearing it?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was torn up when Jenkins . . . you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you another one,\u201d Aiden promised. He had his phone to his ear as he walked into the bedroom.</p><p>Dinner was relaxed. There was no more talk of Simone or Jenkins, and Cordie was thankful. She ate two slices of veggie pizza and listened to Alec as he enthusiastically explained how he was going to remodel the basement of his and Regan\u2019s new home. It seemed the only thing he wasn\u2019t putting in was a basketball court.</p><p>\u201cHave you signed the papers yet?\u201d Sophie asked Cordie. \u201cBecause if you haven\u2019t and you still own the house, Jack and I would like to make an offer to buy it.\u201d</p><p>The stunned look on Alec\u2019s face made everyone laugh.</p><p>Sophie patted his arm. \u201cI was just teasing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really ought to get things moving and transfer the money,\u201d Regan said. \u201cThe papers should be ready tomorrow afternoon. If you could go with us to the bank . . .\u201d</p><p>Alec shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring the papers to you, Cordie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you get the cast removed?\u201d Regan asked her.</p><p>\u201cA month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s perfect. Since you have to stay to see your doctor, you might as well go with us to the Summerset Ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard there are doctors in Boston,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cYou should stay,\u201d Sophie urged. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t bounce around from doctor to doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have to go to that ball, you should have to go,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cYou look so handsome in a tux,\u201d Regan told her husband. \u201cAnd you love going. You . . .\u201d She sighed then. \u201cOkay, I can\u2019t sell it.\u201d</p><p>Alec laughed. \u201cI go because it\u2019s important to you, sweetheart. And that\u2019s why Cordie will go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Cordie said in the hope her friends would be appeased.</p><p>She felt trapped, trapped in paradise, and she was beginning to feel sorry for Aiden. He would go nuts if she continued to stay in the suite after arrests were made and the threat was over. She didn\u2019t want to think about that now. Her friends were here. She was having a wonderful time, but fatigue was beginning to take over and her arm was starting to throb. She excused herself and went into her bathroom to get a Tylenol. When she opened the door, Aiden was waiting in her bedroom with a new sling.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was just delivered,\u201d he answered. \u201cStand still and let me fix this thing.\u201d</p><p>Once the sling was in place, he moved her hair out of the way. His hands stayed on her shoulders as he stared at her. And then he said something that shocked her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Cordelia.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to respond. He kissed her then, but once wasn\u2019t enough. His mouth covered hers again, and he pulled her into his arms. The kiss wasn\u2019t at all gentle, but raw, carnal in its intensity, and she was so aroused that, when he pulled back, she desperately wanted to rip his clothes off and fall into bed with him.</p><p>Sophie\u2019s laughter from the living room pulled her back to reality. Cordie realized her hand was on the zipper of Aiden\u2019s jeans. She jerked back and took a deep breath. She wagged her finger at him, patted her hair as though that would straighten it, and all but ran into the living room. She tried to ignore him the rest of the evening.</p><p>A few minutes before ten, Alec looked at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time to hear from Liam.\u201d He went to get Aiden\u2019s computer and set it on the coffee table so everyone could see.</p><p>Liam checked in at ten on the dot. He appeared on the computer screen wearing a T-shirt that said Bob\u2019s Beer and Babes Bar on it. The background wasn\u2019t in focus, but it appeared he was sitting on a deck or patio with waves lapping at the shore behind him. He asked who was there, and Alec identified everyone and quickly introduced him to Regan and Sophie, who stepped away from the computer screen and mouthed the word wow to each other. Liam\u2019s good looks had obviously impressed them, because they gave Cordie the why-didn\u2019t-you-mention-how-hot-he-was look. She shrugged in response.</p><p>Jack watched the silent exchange. Fascinated, he whispered to Sophie, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to my friends,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Liam greeted the group. His demeanor was courteous and businesslike, and it irritated Aiden that he could be charming and polite to Sophie and Regan, but he\u2019d been a lecherous flirt with Cordelia.</p><p>Alec had already talked to him about Jenkins\u2019s attack on Cordelia, and Liam wanted to see for himself that she was all right.</p><p>She stood in front of the computer screen. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any more information for us?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Aiden interrupted. \u201cWhat about the other man who was with Simone? The one who tried to drag her out of the hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharles Kendrick.\u201d Alec supplied his name.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still here in Sydney,\u201d Liam said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything to report?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I do have something interesting. Documents,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve e-mailed them to you, Alec. I think, once you\u2019ve read through them, you\u2019ll understand why I can\u2019t stop smiling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good, huh?\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cYes, that good. It\u2019s dry reading but worth it. Just don\u2019t ask me how I got them.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Liam ended the call, Aiden suggested that he, Jack, and Alec go down to his office to print out the e-mail and start reading.</p><p>\u201cThis will probably take a while,\u201d Jack told Sophie.</p><p>\u201cThe hotel limo driver will take both of them home,\u201d Aiden offered.</p><p>Jack and Alec kissed their wives good-bye, then waited at the door for Aiden, who had crossed the room to Cordie.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare leave this suite,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She acted shocked. \u201cBut we were going pole dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny. I mean it, Cordelia. You stay put.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>And he was gone.</p><p>\u201cYour brother is like a general. I know he means well, but he\u2019s beginning to get on my nerves,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been on my nerves for years,\u201d Regan said.</p><p>Sophie spoke up. \u201cI love him. He can do no wrong as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all love him,\u201d Regan conceded. \u201cCordie and I just recognize his flaws.\u201d</p><p>Sophie was in a nostalgic mood. \u201cI never told you what happened to me when I was nine years old. It was pretty awful. Aiden became my champion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>\u201cMy dad was in trouble with the law . . . again. I was home with the housekeeper when two scary-looking men with guns and badges came in and took me to the police station. I was so frightened. This one detective kept threatening to put me in foster care, and no one would ever know where I was. He\u2019d make sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was he threatening you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted me to tell him where my father was. I didn\u2019t know the answer, but even back then, if I had known, I wouldn\u2019t have told. He also wanted to know if there was a safe hidden in my house. The questions went on and on. To this day I don\u2019t know how Aiden found out what was happening. Maybe the housekeeper called him. I asked her, but she insisted she hadn\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>\u201cHe saved me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I saw him, I started crying and ran to him. He put his arm around me and told me everything was going to be all right. He brought a couple of attorneys with him, and he threatened the detectives with all sorts of things. He swore if they ever came near me again, he\u2019d have their badges, and from the way the attorneys were backing him up, I think he could have done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you want us to know?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>\u201cBack then it was because I cried, and I thought you two would think I was a baby. Time passed, and I just never got around to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you realize how young Aiden was? He couldn\u2019t have been twenty yet,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cI wish you had told me when it happened,\u201d Regan said. \u201cTalking about it would have been therapeutic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew,\u201d Cordie said.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Sophie asked, surprised. \u201cAiden promised me he wouldn\u2019t tell anyone, so I know you didn\u2019t find out from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were having a sleepover at Regan\u2019s house, and back then I had such a crush on Aiden. Remember?\u201d</p> <p>Both Sophie and Regan laughed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know,\u201d Regan said. \u201cNot then. Not until you told us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard the housekeeper tell Aiden he had a phone call from his family\u2019s law firm. I was such a worrier, like you two were, and I thought Aiden might be in trouble, so I listened to the conversation. That\u2019s how I found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I figured that if you wanted me to know, you\u2019d tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe driver will be here in a minute. Why don\u2019t we help you get ready for bed before we go,\u201d Regan suggested.</p><p>Cordie appreciated the help, and while they were in her bedroom, they continued to chat.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with Liam?\u201d Sophie asked as she turned down the comforter.</p><p>\u201cHe and Alec have been friends a long time,\u201d Regan said. She opened a drawer and brought out a pair of pajamas. \u201cI think Alec arrested him once. That might be how they met. I still haven\u2019t gotten the whole story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordie, don\u2019t you think he\u2019s gorgeous?\u201d Sophie asked. \u201cDid you notice how he smiled at you and how his voice softened when he was talking to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t notice, and yes, he is good-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love his accent,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>\u201cHe lives in Australia. Would you like me to move there so I can go out with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Make him move here. You\u2019re worth it.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock on the door.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s our driver,\u201d Regan said. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>The friends gave Cordie a hug and left.</p><p>Cordie was exhausted. She settled into the soft bed and turned on the television. She scanned a few channels and found Fishing with Larry on one of the cable stations. Cordie thought the show would put her to sleep, but she actually became interested. An hour later, she decided Larry was turning her into a fisherman.</p><p>She heard the outer door open and the men laughing as they came in. Curious to find out what was going on, she got out of bed. It took her a few minutes to put on her robe and sling, but by the time she padded barefoot into the living room, they were opening beers and toasting one another. Aiden dropped a stack of papers on the table in front of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d she asked.</p><p>All three looked at her and smiled.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell her?\u201d Jack asked Alec.</p><p>Alec pulled out a chair for her to sit. \u201cAs it turns out, there\u2019s more than just a scandal driving Simone to get rid of you.\u201d</p><p>They started laughing again. \u201cAiden, you explain,\u201d Alec suggested.</p><p>He pushed the papers toward her. \u201cWhen we\u2019re done with the Taylors and the Rayburns, you\u2019re going to own their company.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-SIX</p><p>You\u2019re the firstborn,\u201d Aiden explained.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen you turned twenty-one, you inherited twenty percent of the Merrick company stock. It was in Merrick\u2019s will.\u201d He shook his head and continued. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it. I can\u2019t imagine why Merrick set up his inheritance this way. I guess we\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty percent doesn\u2019t sound like much,\u201d Jack said, \u201cbut in fact it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s worth millions. Simone inherited her shares of Merrick Enterprises from her mother, Alice. Simone wanted the perks, but she didn\u2019t want the responsibility, so she handed over the management to her father. According to the will, you now own twenty percent of her share, which is just enough for her to lose majority control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why Simone or someone else in the Rayburn family wants you out of the way,\u201d Alec reasoned.</p><p>\u201cSomeone else in the family? No,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cSimone wouldn\u2019t have told anyone about me. She used a fake name when she married my father. She was Natalie Smith back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was pregnant with you when she married your father, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky she didn\u2019t try to abort you,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>Cordie sat on the edge of the chair, her back ramrod straight, with her right hand fisted in her lap. Thinking about Simone made her sick to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cShe told me she wanted to get an abortion, but she was too far along. She was past five months.\u201d</p><p>No one said anything for a long minute; then Alec commented, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing she didn\u2019t stay around while you were growing up. I can\u2019t imagine what your life would have been like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why your father couldn\u2019t see what she was,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cHe wore blinders, I guess,\u201d Cordie replied. \u201cHe loved her almost to the day he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds more like an obsession,\u201d Jack remarked.</p><p>\u201cSimone\u2019s sons seem to adore her,\u201d Cordie said. \u201cAnd she doted on them when they were at the ball.\u201d She smiled when she added, \u201cUntil I ruined her night.\u201d</p><p>Aiden laughed. \u201cYou did do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sons are still in their teens, but they\u2019re already being groomed by the patriarch, Julian Taylor,\u201d Alec said. \u201cObviously he thinks the older one is the firstborn.\u201d</p><p>Jack tapped on the printed pages lying on the table. \u201cThe way I\u2019m reading this convoluted document\u2014which, by the way, reads like it was written in the Middle Ages\u2014when you turned twenty-one, you not only rightfully owned part of the company, you completely changed the power structure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut am I a legitimate heir, since she was using a false identity when she married my father?\u201d Cordie wondered.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no stipulation for it in Merrick\u2019s will,\u201d Aiden told her. \u201cFirstborn simply means the first child born to Simone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer sons don\u2019t inherit it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Jack answered. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get property and a lot of cash, maybe other assets, but no Merrick stock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sell it or give it away,\u201d Alec told her. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t claim it?\u201d</p><p>Aiden answered her question. \u201cThere have already been two attempts on your life. Do you think they\u2019ll stop? You could run and hide, or you could walk into Julian Taylor\u2019s office, drop the DNA results on his desk, and tell him you\u2019re going to destroy him and his entire family. I\u2019ll be real happy to help you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Simone gets away with hiring someone to kill me?\u201d</p><p>Alec shook his head. \u201cLet us worry about her.\u201d</p><p>Jack stood and stretched. \u201cLiam did have a suggestion to speed things up,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting for the right time. We\u2019ll talk about it then.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to talk about it now, but Alec and Jack were ready to go home. Aiden walked them to the door, made sure the dead bolt was in place, and then followed her into her bedroom. She was removing her sling so she could take off her robe when he turned her toward him and said, \u201cLet me help you get ready for bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am ready for bed,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>He removed her robe and began to unbutton her pajama top. In seconds it was on the floor with her pajama bottoms. She was stark naked, and he was fully clothed. She wasn\u2019t at all self-conscious, though, because the way Aiden was looking at her made her feel beautiful. His hands caressed her heavy br**sts until the ni**les were hard. He kissed her, slowly, leisurely, acting as though he had all the time in the world. He felt her tremble and whispered, \u201cNow you\u2019re ready. Get into bed, Cordelia.\u201d</p><p>She lay down and tried to pull the sheet up around her, but he wouldn\u2019t let her. She watched as he removed his clothes and then covered her with his body. His skin was so hot.</p><p>Aiden groaned with the contact of his body pressing into hers. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about this all day. You make me crazed.\u201d His arms slid under her knees, and he lifted her. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you as hungry for me as I am for you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed every inch of her stomach before moving lower. His day\u2019s growth of whiskers rubbed her sensitive inner thighs. He made good on his promise and proceeded to drive her out of her mind. She begged for him to let her cl**ax, and only when she threatened to hit him over the head with her cast did he give her what she wanted.</p><p>Aiden was just as greedy. Cordie lost count of the number of times during the night that he reached for her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to miss me when I\u2019m gone,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>A long while passed before he answered her. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Aiden didn\u2019t go out of town the next day. She assumed there was a business reason for the cancellation. She didn\u2019t see him or anyone else except the hotel staff for the next four days and nights. She knew Aiden was still around because she heard him leave in the morning, and late at night, she heard him come in. He slept in his own bed. Maybe he had decided to distance himself from her. She should mentally do the same in preparation for Boston, shouldn\u2019t she?</p><p>Sophie and Regan were both swamped at work, and she didn\u2019t want to bother them. It wasn\u2019t their job to entertain her. She did talk to Alec a couple of times. Still no news from Australia. He\u2019d told her Liam had a suggestion for speeding things up, but he still hadn\u2019t told her what it was. She decided if she didn\u2019t hear something today, she would call Liam and ask him.</p><p>She was beginning to feel like a caged animal. The walls of the suite were closing in on her, and she was fantasizing about all the ways she could sneak outside for a few minutes.</p><p>There were a few diversions. The swelling had gone down in her fingers, and she was now able to type with both hands. She received an e-mail from one of the doctors at the Garvan Institute, telling her he had read her dissertation and was quite impressed. He asked her several questions about her research, and a spirited debate resulted, which was fun and challenging. In the end she\u2019d more than proven her thesis, and when he conceded, he offered her a job.</p><p>Jayden Martin was another diversion. He called her in a panic. After several weeks in a summer school class, he was certain he was going to fail chemistry again. How did he know? she asked. His reply was direct: The teacher told him so. Cordie, knowing that Jayden was a very smart young man but lazy, was about to ask him if he had even bothered to open his chemistry book when his mother got on the phone to plead on her son\u2019s behalf. Cordie couldn\u2019t say no to her, and the first tutoring session was scheduled for the following afternoon at five. In preparation Cordie called the concierge and requested a few items she would need, including an Introduction to Chemistry textbook.</p><p>Jayden, like a lot of other teenage boys, never went anywhere alone. He and three other young men showed up at her door fifteen minutes early for the session. Each of them had a book in hand, and each of them needed help.</p><p>Aiden had been in meetings the entire day, and all he could think about was getting home to Cordelia. He had barely had a minute to himself the last few days, and he wanted to spend some time with her. Just knowing she was there made him breathe easier. He told himself it was concern for her safety that made him want to be close to her, but lately even he couldn\u2019t buy that one.</p><p>He got back to the suite a little after six. He walked through the door and came to a quick stop. There were four teenage boys sitting at the dining table with papers and pens and books strewn in front of them. Cordelia was standing at a portable chalkboard. She introduced Jayden\u2019s friends to him, and after saying hello, he went into his bedroom to change. He was smiling as he walked away. The boys were hanging on Cordelia\u2019s every word, and it sure as certain wasn\u2019t because they loved chemistry. They looked so enamored he wondered if anything she said was sinking in.</p><p>By the time he returned to the living room, the boys had left. The chalkboard had been tucked in a corner, and Cordelia was organizing all the supplies and neatly stacking them inside the credenza.</p><p>Alec arrived a minute later. \u201cI just talked to Liam,\u201d he reported. \u201cHere\u2019s what he suggested. Julian is taking Simone and Craig to dinner Friday night at the Shade House. Liam is going to be there with gun and badge, and when they get up to leave, he\u2019s going to make sure Simone sees him take a clean cloth and very carefully pick up her water glass. He wants her to see him put it in a plastic bag. He said to tell you he\u2019s going for dramatic CSI stuff. If Simone watches any television at all, she\u2019ll know why he\u2019s taking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will send her into a tailspin,\u201d Aiden predicted.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what she does,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jenkins? Is he talking yet?\u201d Aiden asked. The picture of the bastard\u2019s hands around Cordelia\u2019s neck flashed through his mind, and his entire body tensed in reaction.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to make a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll charges dropped, and he\u2019ll tell us everything he knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Aiden prodded. He knew Alec would never go for such a deal.</p><p>\u201cWe laughed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking . . . ,\u201d Cordie began.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get out of here for a little while.\u201d</p><p>Aiden shook his head at her. It wasn\u2019t the thing to do at the moment. She turned to him and grabbed hold of his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m losing it,\u201d she said. She let go of him and took a step back. \u201cStop smiling. I mean it. I\u2019m really losing it.\u201d She raised her hand in front of his face and put her finger and thumb close together until they were almost touching. \u201cI\u2019m this close to writing Larry a fan letter, for God\u2019s sake. This close, Aiden.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho the hell is Larry?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>She whirled around to face him. \u201cLarry the fisherman.\u201d Her tone suggested he should already know that.</p><p>Alec put his hands up in surrender. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>His promise calmed her. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said with as much dignity as she could muster.</p> <p>TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>Aiden was standing in the doorway of his office reading a printout his assistant had handed him when he happened to look up and see Cordelia walking past. He did a double take, dropped the paper, and rushed after her. \u201cCordelia.\u201d</p><p>She turned around just as Alec caught up with her. \u201cYes, Aiden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn order to get here you had to take the private elevator to the first floor, cross through the lobby, and take another elevator to the third floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I had to do.\u201d</p> <p>The muscle in his cheek flexed. \u201cWho let you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me out?\u201d</p><p>Alec could almost see smoke coming out of the top of Cordie\u2019s head. \u201cI let her out,\u201d he said. \u201cI promised her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the record, this isn\u2019t out,\u201d she argued. \u201cI\u2019m still inside the hotel. I would like to go outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Aiden snapped.</p><p>\u201cThis is a compromise,\u201d Alec explained. \u201cUntil it\u2019s safe. Come on, Cordie. Let\u2019s go find Regan. She should be in her office.\u201d</p> <p>Aiden walked down the hall with them. \u201cLet me know when Cordelia is coming back upstairs. I\u2019ll go with her.\u201d He grabbed her hand and pulled her toward him. Frowning intently, he stared into her eyes. He acted as though he wanted to say something to her, but he kept silent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come get you,\u201d she promised.</p><p>He let go of her, nodded, and went back to his office. He walked past the paper he\u2019d dropped on the floor, seemingly unaware that it was there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making him crazy,\u201d Cordie whispered. \u201cI almost feel sorry for him. He likes a calm, peaceful, uncluttered environment when he\u2019s at home, and since I\u2019ve been here, it hasn\u2019t been calm or peaceful. It\u2019s been chaotic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to miss you when you leave.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe that nonsense for a second. Maybe he\u2019d miss the sex . . . the mind-blowing, incredible sex. \u201cWhen will I be leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Alec promised. He looked at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s ten in the morning in Sydney, and tonight Liam will be busy at the restaurant trying to shake things up with Simone. He\u2019ll put on quite a show pretending to collect her DNA. I wish we could see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she know what he\u2019s doing and why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, she\u2019ll know. The only reason to get her DNA would be to match it to yours and prove you\u2019re her daughter. Unless she\u2019s a complete moron, she\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam told us he already had Simone\u2019s DNA and the results. How did he really get it?\u201d</p><p>Alec opened the door to Regan\u2019s reception area. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask, and he didn\u2019t tell. It\u2019s better that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam\u2019s CIA, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Alec laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She knew he wasn\u2019t going to volunteer the information, but that didn\u2019t stop her from prodding. She put the issue of Liam\u2019s job aside for now and said, \u201cSimone\u2019s going to freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll see an immediate reaction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think we will.\u201d</p><p>As it turned out, he was right. There was an immediate reaction.</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Aiden shook Cordelia awake at seven in the morning to tell her Alec was coming over with some news, but before he could say anything, he became distracted. He hadn\u2019t touched her in what seemed an eternity, and when she rolled over and moaned, still more asleep than awake, he couldn\u2019t resist the temptation. She wore a little silk-and-lace nothing that barely covered her, and he desperately wanted to tear it off her. He turned into an animal with her. There was no control, no discipline. He pulled the sheet back, stripped out of his clothes, and made love to her. She more than matched him with her wild and uninhibited response.</p><p>After he caught his breath, he leaned up on his elbow. Looking down and tracing the contented smile on her lips with his finger, he said, \u201cAlec should be here anytime now.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, pushed the hair out of her eyes, and asked why.</p><p>\u201cHe said he has some good news for you.\u201d There was a knock on the door. \u201cThat\u2019s probably him now.\u201d</p><p>She flew out of bed. \u201cPut some clothes on,\u201d she said in a furious whisper. She picked up his jeans and tossed them at him. \u201cDo you have any idea . . . We shouldn\u2019t have . . . I don\u2019t want him to know that we . . . you know.\u201d She took a quick breath. \u201cDo you have any idea how frustrated I am?\u201d</p><p>He pulled on his jeans but didn\u2019t bother to close the zipper. Ignoring another knock at the door, he walked around the bed to where she stood. \u201cFrustrated? How many times did you come? Two? Three times? If you\u2019re still frustrated, then we need to get back in that bed and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She put her hand over his mouth and started to laugh. \u201cNot that kind of frustration. Go open the door.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately Alec wasn\u2019t at the door. Room service was delivering breakfast.</p><p>Aiden called out to her, but she was already in the shower. She had become a pro at showering with the use of only one hand. By the time she was dressed, she was starving and ready to take on another day in paradise prison. Later, as she was drinking a glass of orange juice and sitting across from Aiden, who was buried in what looked like a stock report, it suddenly occurred to her how surreal it all was. They were behaving like an old married couple.</p><p>Alec arrived a few minutes later. He took the cup of coffee Cordie offered and sat down at the table. \u201cI\u2019ve got some good news,\u201d he said. \u201cCharles Kendrick is on his way to Chicago. Liam reported that he boarded a plane in Sydney using the name Charles Ford and is carrying a passport with that identification.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s good news? I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s coming here to kill me. Right?\u201d Cordie asked, trying to keep the panic out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Alec agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t let him get near you, Cordelia,\u201d Aiden assured her.</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack and I are going to be at the gate to welcome him to Chicago with a gift . . . handcuffs,\u201d Alec said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking him in as soon as he steps off the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you catch him in the act? You can\u2019t charge him with attempted murder if he doesn\u2019t try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the love of God,\u201d Aiden muttered, appalled by the idea.</p><p>\u201cNo, we have enough to get what we want,\u201d Alec said. Once again he refused to expound, and no matter how much she nagged, he wouldn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>Aiden could see how discouraged she was. Living day to day with the unknown was unnerving. After Alec left, he tried to cheer her up. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long now until you can go anywhere you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will be nice,\u201d she said, appreciating his optimism but almost afraid to hope.</p><p>\u201cTonight we\u2019ll have a good dinner and watch a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She picked up a bagel and tore it in half. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans. What did I do with my orange juice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drank it. What plans? You aren\u2019t going out. Stop messing with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m playing cards with Walker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have just said that?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Of course she could have, but it wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as much fun.</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Charles Kendrick wasn\u2019t happy to see two FBI agents waiting for him. As soon as he got over his shock, he became surly. Alec thought the man believed he could bluster and intimidate his way out of an arrest. They put him in an interrogation room and let him sweat while they went through his duffel bag. In one of the pockets, wrapped in socks, were three Testor phones. One of them already had a Sydney number programmed in. To Jack and Alec, the find was better than Christmas morning.</p><p>Liam had already gone through all the phone logs on every cell phone, home phone, and business phone owned by the Rayburn family, and there weren\u2019t any calls to or from Chicago, which meant the number programmed into the phone they held most likely went to another burner in Sydney. The only way to find out whom it belonged to was to call.</p><p>Jack led the interrogation. He sat across from Kendrick at a metal table in a small, windowless room. Wanting Kendrick to feel closed in and trapped, Jack had handcuffed him to the table, and Alec leaned against the wall behind him, observing. Every once in a while he\u2019d circle the room and stand behind Kendrick, all but breathing down his neck. Kendrick fidgeted in his seat. Sweat trickled down his forehead, steaming up his round Harry Potter glasses. The first words out of his mouth were expected. \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>Jack sat back in his chair and couldn\u2019t have looked more easygoing. \u201cYou have a unique opportunity here, Charles. You can help yourself by giving us the name of your boss. All we want to know is who hired you to kill Cordelia Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy? No one hired me to kill anyone,\u201d he blurted. \u201cI\u2019m just here to see the sights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I misunderstood,\u201d Jack said apologetically. \u201cWell, now that you\u2019ve cleared that up, you can be on your way.\u201d</p><p>A flash of relief crossed Kendrick\u2019s face before he recognized the sarcasm in Jack\u2019s comment. He slumped down in his chair.</p><p>Alec moved to stand close behind him again. \u201cIt would save time if you told the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to this unique opportunity,\u201d Jack suggested smoothly. \u201cIf you tell Detective Buchanan and me now, if you work with us, we\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you squat,\u201d he muttered. \u201cLawyer. Get me a lawyer.\u201d There were beads of sweat on his forehead.</p><p>Jack acted as though he hadn\u2019t heard his demand. \u201cIt\u2019s a sweet deal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing. There\u2019s a time limit. Once we call the number you have programmed into the burner, we won\u2019t need your help. The deal goes away then, and Detective Buchanan and I will do all we can to make sure you get the maximum sentence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? You\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with a forged passport,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThat alone will put you away. If you don\u2019t cooperate with us, we\u2019ll see that you go to prison for a very, very long time.\u201d He pushed the chair back. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get you a lawyer now.\u201d</p><p>Alec followed him to the door. He turned back and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got five minutes before we make the call.\u201d</p><p>They left Kendrick to sweat\u2014and hopefully panic\u2014and headed to another interrogation room, where Jenkins waited. They\u2019d had him brought up to the fourth floor so they could have another chat with him . . . or, as Alec called it, round two. The plan was to play one suspect against the other.</p><p>In the hall Jack said, \u201cFive minutes? You gave him five minutes to decide what he wants to do? Where did that come from? We agreed to tell him he had twelve hours, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember, but five minutes sounded more dramatic. Twelve hours didn\u2019t have the same kick.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to call that number now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too, but we have to wait. We\u2019re working blind here, but doesn\u2019t it make sense that Kendrick wouldn\u2019t call his boss an hour after landing? He wouldn\u2019t have anything to report. So we wait a little longer, maybe five or six hours. If the boss is spooked and doesn\u2019t answer the phone, we\u2019re screwed, and easy becomes hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless Kendrick and Jenkins tell us what we want to know.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the day Alec and Jack rotated between the two interrogation rooms, hoping to wear down one or the other of the two suspects, but neither Jenkins nor Kendrick was giving up anything. Threats of longer prison sentences for their crimes didn\u2019t seem to faze them. As though they had rehearsed their denials, each separately insisted they were not taking orders from anyone.</p><p>Jack was the last to question Kendrick. When he walked out of the room, Alec was waiting for him. \u201cThe tech is ready.\u201d</p><p>A minute later they stood next to a technician as he played a recording that sounded like electrical static. \u201cWill that work?\u201d he asked them.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Jack told him.</p><p>\u201cKendrick\u2019s going to cry entrapment, you know,\u201d Alec said. \u201cThis will never fly in court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Jack admitted. \u201cBut it might give him the motivation to open up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to make the call,\u201d Alec said as he picked up Kendrick\u2019s burner phone, touched the screen, and laid the phone in the center of the desk so everyone could hear.</p><p>The men hovered over it, listening. One . . . two . . . three . . . four . . . five . . . the phone kept ringing. They glanced at one another. No one was answering. Six . . . seven . . . eight . . . Alec shook his head and was about to pick up the phone when suddenly there was a click. A few seconds of silence followed, as though whoever was on the other end was waiting for the caller to speak first. Finally, the silence was broken.</p><p>Julian Taylor answered. \u201cIs it done?\u201d</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Jack and Alec couldn\u2019t wait to have yet another chat with Charles Kendrick. They were both smiling as they entered the interrogation room. Kendrick was sitting next to his attorney, a forty-year-old man with a sour face and a disposition to match. His posture was that of someone who had been beaten down by disappointments.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you anything,\u201d Kendrick stated defiantly. \u201cMy lawyer here, Mr. Kale, says I don\u2019t even have to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Alec and Jack pulled out chairs and sat facing them. Kendrick\u2019s smug expression was about to change.</p><p>Addressing the attorney, Jack said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be adding to the charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat charges are you adding?\u201d Kendrick demanded before his attorney could say a word. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alec answered. \u201cWe know you came here to kill Cordelia Kane, and we can prove it.\u201d</p><p>Kendrick leaned forward. \u201cHow?\u201d he asked with self-righteous indignation. \u201cHow can you prove it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you asked,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe called the number on your burner and talked to Julian Taylor.\u201d</p><p>Kendrick didn\u2019t look so cocky now. \u201cHe talked to you? I don\u2019t believe it. He talked to you?\u201d he repeated.</p> <p>Jack answered. \u201cHe didn\u2019t actually talk to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t,\u201d Alec confirmed.</p><p>Jack explained. \u201cHe thought he was talking to you. He made the assumption, and we didn\u2019t correct him.\u201d</p><p>Kendrick seemed confused. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re FBI agents,\u201d Alec stated authoritatively. \u201cWe never lie.\u201d He was somewhat surprised he got that out without laughing.</p> <p>\u201cWe recorded the conversation,\u201d Jack told the attorney. \u201cWould you like to hear it?\u201d He put the phone down and pushed the button.</p><p>Julian\u2019s voice was loud and clear. \u201cIs it done? Is Cordelia Kane dead? Answer me.\u201d</p><p>Static muffled the answer. \u201cNo . . . not yet.\u201d</p><p>Kendrick\u2019s eyes widened when he heard a response. \u201cYou should have told him who you were. You tricked him by not identifying yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sure did,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI guess you could say we\u2019re tricky.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the button again to continue the recording.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting the rest of the money until that gold digger is dead. It needs to happen fast. I thought I conveyed the urgency here. They collected my daughter\u2019s glass for her DNA. Get it done.\u201d He repeated the demand in a near shout. \u201cAnd if you run into that coward Jenkins, tell him he\u2019s fired.\u201d</p><p>The conversation ended.</p><p>\u201cThe static we put in there helped sell it, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Alec asked.</p><p>\u201cIt will never hold up in court,\u201d Kale blustered. \u201cNever. It\u2019s entrapment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, maybe not,\u201d Alec said. Since they had no intention of using the tape, they didn\u2019t care if it would hold up in court or not. They wanted Kendrick and Jenkins to talk.</p><p>\u201cI know the law,\u201d Kale snapped.</p><p>\u201cSo do we,\u201d Jack replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll file a motion\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe also have Arnold Jenkins. He\u2019s giving you up, Charles. He\u2019s answering all our questions. We already played the call for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seized the opportunity. You didn\u2019t,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re through here.\u201d Jack picked up the phone and stood to leave.</p><p>Alec followed him. They walked out into the hallway, and just as the door was closing behind them, they heard Kendrick yell, \u201cWait a minute.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>The news shouldn\u2019t have surprised Cordie, but it did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain it was Julian Taylor on the phone?\u201d</p><p>Alec nodded. \u201cLiam confirmed it, and so did a lot of other people. It was Julian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cWith Simone\u2019s shares, Julian now controls fifty-one percent of Merrick stock. He can overrule the board whenever he wants. As soon as twenty percent is transferred to you, Cordelia, his power is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I weren\u2019t around, he would lose it to Simone\u2019s son when he turned twenty-one,\u201d she pointed out. She walked over to the bar where they were standing and sat down on a stool.</p><p>\u201cSimone gave Julian her shares to control, and I\u2019m sure he could get his grandson to do the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Both Aiden and Alec were being very calm and matter-of-fact about this latest development. Cordie, on the other hand, wanted to start screaming. She now understood why children had tantrums. It was a thoroughly satisfying way to let out pent-up frustration. She wanted to pick up objects and hurl them across the room. Nature seemed to empathize. The weather complemented her mood. A hard rain was pelting the windows of the suite, and every other minute a clap of thunder could be heard rumbling in the distance. The wind was gathering momentum.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as Kendrick and Jenkins found out we knew who they were working for, they understood they\u2019d lost their leverage. We can\u2019t get them to stop talking now. They\u2019ve turned on each other and on Julian, both trying to get a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were with Simone when she confronted me at the hotel in Sydney. I assumed they worked for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did work for her, but they also reported everything she did to her father. That\u2019s when he found out you were back in the picture. According to Kendrick, Julian has known about you for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you were a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She all but fell off the stool. \u201cThis just keeps getting creepier and creepier.\u201d</p><p>Alec was rummaging through the refrigerator behind the bar. He took out a bottle of Kelly\u2019s root beer and opened it. \u201cThere are some real serious trust issues in that family,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHe spies on his daughter. Why would he do that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s protecting his interest,\u201d Aiden explained.</p><p>\u201cKendrick was more of a confidant than Jenkins was,\u201d Alec said. \u201cHe would sit and drink straight vodka shots with Julian a couple of times a month. That\u2019s when Julian would talk about family. One night he told Jenkins that Simone had run away when she was a teenager. It took him some time to find her, and when he did, he got the shock of his life. He couldn\u2019t believe what she had done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she know she would inherit stock when she turned twenty-one?\u201d Cordie asked. She looked to Aiden for an answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be another reason she used the name Natalie Smith,\u201d Alec said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she had any intention of staying with your father. She gave birth, and a short time later she took off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian told Kendrick he was about to send a couple of men to drag her back to Australia, but it wasn\u2019t necessary. She came home, apologized for making him worry, and went on with her life. She never mentioned you or your father to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens to Julian now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been arrested,\u201d Alec said.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had been there to see him taken in,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>Alec agreed. \u201cWhen the Australian press gets hold of this, they\u2019ll have a heyday. I\u2019ve got a strong feeling Simone won\u2019t win Woman of the Year again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God, I\u2019m genetically linked to those people,\u201d Cordie declared. \u201cI wish I had never started this, but at least it\u2019s over now. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d Alec told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. Who else wants to kill me? Simone? Her husband? The teenagers?\u201d She grabbed a long swizzle stick and slid part of it under her cast.</p><p>\u201cCordelia, what are you doing?\u201d Aiden asked, looking appalled.</p><p>She pulled the swizzle stick out. \u201cIt itches,\u201d she explained before turning to Alec again. \u201cWho\u2019s after me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one that I know of, but we are going to continue to be cautious until the stock is officially transferred to you, which will be in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian will try to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be able to,\u201d Alec assured her. \u201cLiam has your DNA results now. He has people who can make it happen.\u201d</p><p>She absentmindedly reached for the swizzle stick again. Aiden stopped her. \u201cYou could lose one of those in there.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to tell him she already had.</p><p>TWENTY-NINE</p><p>Congressman Mitchell Ray Chambers was prepared to dazzle his constituents. He had set up a press conference a week before the primary to remind the good people of Fallsborough that he was saving their town by working so diligently for the past year to get the Hamilton Hotel and Resort to Rock Point.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t signed the contract Walker Madison had FedExed to him. He had cleverly scheduled the signing for a week after the primary was over. Chambers had agreed to accept a ridiculously low offer and had, in fact, suggested the amount, but he had no intention of ever signing the contract. He still believed he could get a considerably higher price, and now that Walker Madison was involved, he was more confident than ever. It was going to be much easier to manipulate the youngest brother. All Mitchell needed to do was convince his constituents that he had been willing to do whatever it took to make Fallsborough wealthy and prosperous. Then, once he had the primary in his pocket, he would do whatever it took to make himself wealthy and prosperous. He was absolutely certain, with the Madison brothers back at the negotiating table, he could bargain his way into a sweet deal. His constituents didn\u2019t need to know any of those particulars, however.</p><p>Mayor Green didn\u2019t stand a chance against him now, and he was assured of a reelection victory in November. Politics was all about manipulation.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to worry about his cousin Lester whining and complaining or embarrassing him in front of the cameras, because he\u2019d bought him out and was now the sole owner of Rock Point. The high price he\u2019d paid Lester was going to be well worth it.</p><p>He dressed in red, white, and blue for the press conference: a navy suit, a crisp white shirt, and a bright-red tie. He pinned a tiny American flag on his lapel and was ready. The press conference was choreographed in his mind. He had worked out how he would make his grand entrance, where he wanted the podium placed, and, most important, where the flag would be positioned. He wanted it behind him and a little to the left so that on camera the flag would be in every frame with him. He had even practiced a couple of different expressions in front of a mirror. He needed to look humble yet at the same time stately and intelligent. He would brag, of course, but it would be veiled behind his explanation of how hard he\u2019d worked to get the hotel. He was sure he had it all figured out.</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The double doors were open to the campaign office. Aiden stayed in the lobby out of sight, but he could see Chambers up on a small stage. A large crowd had gathered to hear what he had to say. Microphones and cameras were capturing every word. Aiden planned to wait until the questions began before walking in. He wished Cordelia were with him. She\u2019d be as disgusted as he was with the congressman\u2019s antics, trying to look self-deprecating while taking credit for everything but inventing the Internet. As he spoke, he kept putting his right hand inside his suit jacket over his heart. Was he trying to look like Napoleon? Worse than his phony smile was his speech. Every word out of his mouth was a lie. Every damn word. If Cordelia were standing at Aiden\u2019s side, she\u2019d want to challenge Chambers with facts and figures.</p><p>As Aiden stood there listening to all the empty campaign rhetoric, he couldn\u2019t help but think how much the congressman and Julian Taylor were alike. They were both controlled by power and greed. Julian had proven he would do anything to hold on to his empire, and the congressman was proving he would do anything to get reelected. How long had he been dealing with people like Chambers? he wondered. It made him tired just thinking about it.</p><p>The congressman was ready for questions. Mayor Green pushed forward and raised her hand. \u201cCongressman, we are all wondering if you have signed the contract with the Madisons for Rock Point.\u201d Before he could answer, she continued. \u201cOr is it going to be like the last time when you changed the terms and pulled out?\u201d</p><p>His tone was condescending when he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where you got that information, but it\u2019s wrong. You should check your sources, Mayor, before you make accusations.\u201d</p><p>He took another question on the other side of the room, determined to avoid eye contact with the mayor. The questions were all about the hotel and resort. How many jobs did he think would be available? How long did he think it would take to build?</p><p>Aiden could see the desperation in the local residents. Spencer was right. These hardworking people needed a break. He was amazed by some of the congressman\u2019s answers. Chambers acted as though he\u2019d drawn up the plans for the hotel and could even give them the dimensions for each of the rooms. He spoke with such authority.</p><p>The mayor drew his attention once again. She was now in front of the crowd, demanding with her hand waving in the air that he acknowledge her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question,\u201d she blurted when he had to stop talking to take a breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat question did you want answered?\u201d He sounded weary.</p><p>\u201cHave you signed the contract with the Madisons? Last time we heard you changed your mind. It was on the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t believe everything you see on television,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question,\u201d someone called out. \u201cDid you sign it? Are we getting the hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re getting the hotel,\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cDid you sign the contract?\u201d the mayor demanded once again.</p><p>The smile plastered on the congressman\u2019s face was beginning to crumble. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The crowd turned on him in a heartbeat. Bolstering the smile again, he put his hands up and said, \u201cHold on, hold on. I\u2019ve read the contract, and everything is in order. Walker Madison and I have decided we should meet in person and both sign. It\u2019s the right thing to do. I let Walker set the date at his convenience. I know you all heard about his terrible car accident.\u201d He abruptly stopped, swallowed loud enough for the microphone to pick up, and finally lost the plastic smile. Eyes wide, he watched Aiden Madison walking toward him.</p><p>The look on the congressman\u2019s face was priceless, and Aiden once again thought that, if only Cordelia were here, she would be laughing now. She would also love what was about to happen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it for today, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d Chambers blurted. \u201cI\u2019ve got to hurry back to Washington for an important vote.\u201d</p><p>Aiden stepped up to the microphone and promptly captured the crowd\u2019s attention. They all knew who he was.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Aiden Madison, and I have a great surprise for you and for the congressman.\u201d He scanned all the curious faces and glanced over at Chambers before continuing. \u201cI have the contract with me, and you\u2019ll get to watch both of us sign. My brothers and I are anxious to get started on this project, and I know you are, too.\u201d</p><p>The cheers were deafening.</p><p>The congressman put his hands up to silence the crowd and said, \u201cNo, no. I promised Walker that I\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aiden cut him off. \u201cWalker has already signed, and so has Spencer. It\u2019s up to you and me to finish this.\u201d He took a pen from his breast pocket and shoved it in front of him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sign first, Congressman?\u201d</p><p>His mind racing, Chambers tried to think of a way out of this fiasco, but he drew a blank. He was trapped, and he knew it. The crowd\u2019s cheers grew louder as they began to chant his name. The people were looking up at him almost adoringly, they were so grateful for what he was doing for them. Maybe there was some good to come from this disaster after all. He had them in his pocket now. Every one of them would vote for him because he was their savior. With a flourish he took the pen, bent down, and signed his name.</p><p>Only Aiden could see the anger in his eyes when they shook hands. The man was seething, which, all things considered, was an expected reaction.</p><p>The congressman was patted on the shoulder a dozen times and had to shake hands with most of the people there on his way out the door to go back to Washington for his important vote. He wanted to linger and lap up the adulation, but he worried they\u2019d catch on that he\u2019d lied about having an important vote. He had no idea what he would say if they asked him what the vote was for. Losing the fortune he could have made from Rock Point definitely stung, but despite it all, he was actually feeling good about the future. He wouldn\u2019t need to spend much money on additional campaigning now. He\u2019d just won the hearts of the voters.</p> <p>Kalie, the young reporter who had talked to Aiden and Spencer the last time they were in town, waited outside the doors. She had her microphone in hand and a cameraman behind her as Aiden approached.</p><p>Mayor Green intercepted him. \u201cThank you again for the generous donation to my campaign,\u201d she said, \u201cbut after the congressman\u2019s press conference, I don\u2019t think I have much of a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the woman for the job,\u201d Aiden said, motioning for Kalie to start recording. People gathered around as he looked into the camera and said, \u201cMayor Green cares about the people of this town. If it weren\u2019t for her, the Hamilton Hotel and Resort wouldn\u2019t be built here. Although your current congressman is taking credit, he had nothing to do with it. Your mayor worked for more than a year, calling and writing and sending photos of this beautiful area, to convince us to build here. She should be your next representative in Congress. I certainly would vote for her if I lived in this district. Just like she fought to get the Hamilton, she\u2019ll fight for you in Washington. Do the right thing. Vote for Mayor Green.\u201d</p><p>He turned to Mayor Green and began to laugh. She looked flabbergasted. Fortunately, Kalie had just given the cameraman the signal to stop taping.</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>An hour later Aiden was back on the plane and on his way home. He hadn\u2019t seen Cordelia in more than a week. He couldn\u2019t believe how much he missed her. He knew her cast had come off three days ago, and he\u2019d heard from Regan that the doctor wasn\u2019t happy to see a swizzle stick stuck inside.</p><p>He felt travel weary. He\u2019d flown from San Diego to Houston and then up to Rock Point. Months ago he had made up his mind to slow down, to stay home more, but it wasn\u2019t until he had to deal with the congressman and other men just like him that he realized how tired he was.</p><p>He wanted off the fast track. And he wanted Cordelia.</p><p>Thanks to Liam\u2019s connections and hard work, along with a top attorney and the court in Sydney, Cordelia was now the owner of Merrick stock. It was expected that she would go back to Sydney to meet the board and sign additional papers. Aiden told her there was no way he would let her go there without him. He\u2019d learned then not to use those exact words. Telling her he would \u201clet\u201d her do anything set her temper off. He smiled thinking about it.</p><p>He\u2019d heard Julian Taylor\u2019s arrest had started a firestorm in the press. Liam told him Simone and her family were on holiday, which he translated to mean they were hiding until things calmed down. Simone\u2019s past was such a juicy story, Liam didn\u2019t think that would happen soon. So far, they were leaving Cordelia alone. Aiden knew they would eventually want to interview her. He also knew she wouldn\u2019t talk to any of them.</p><p>It was closing in on one in the morning by the time Aiden got back to the hotel. He went to Walker\u2019s suite first. His brother was a night owl. He was going over notes Spencer had left for him when Aiden walked in, dropped the contract in his lap, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all yours and Spencer\u2019s. He\u2019ll take the lead and show you how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to run it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t worried Walker would screw up. The team wouldn\u2019t let him. They had been doing this long enough that they had gotten rid of the wrinkles. It was a well-oiled machine now. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about the congressman\u2019s press conference tomorrow. I\u2019m beat. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>He went down the hall and opened the door to his suite. It was spotless. There wasn\u2019t anything out of place. No phone under a chair, no scarves draped across the sofa, no chemistry books. No Cordelia.</p><p>She\u2019d left a note propped up against a vase of flowers on the table telling him she was leaving and thanking him yet again for his help. He held it in his hand as he stood in the doorway of her bedroom. It was just as spotless and sterile as the living room. He didn\u2019t know where she was or what she was doing. There was only one certainty. He wanted her back.</p><p>Coming to terms with his misery took time. He paced around the living room, and at two o\u2019clock he called Alec. He was sound asleep, of course. It was the middle of the night.</p><p>Alec stirred at the sound. He carefully eased Regan off his shoulder so he wouldn\u2019t wake her and fumbled for the phone. \u201cAgent Buchanan,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Aiden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Cordelia?\u201d He repeated the question in a firm voice.</p><p>Alec yawned. \u201cShe\u2019s sleeping in the guest room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she didn\u2019t leave for Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Long seconds passed before Aiden spoke again. \u201cShe\u2019s all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is she leaving for Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days,\u201d he answered. \u201cTomorrow is that Summerset thing, and she leaves the next morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d Aiden sounded relieved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you finally figured it out,\u201d Alec said on a long, drawn-out yawn. \u201cI\u2019m going back to sleep now.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY</p><p>Cordie had just taken a grueling two-mile ride around her old neighborhood with Jayden Martin in his new used car. He didn\u2019t mention that it was a stick shift until she was in the passenger seat, nor did he mention that he didn\u2019t know how to drive a stick shift. She had whiplash before they rounded the first corner.</p><p>He was proud of his car and wanted her assessment and approval. She was diplomatic as she went over the repairs she thought he needed. First was the muffler. It was about to fall off. Then there were the tires. They were as bald as an eagle\u2019s head and needed to be replaced. She also mentioned that he needed someone with experience to teach him how to drive a stick shift because he was stripping the gears.</p><p>By the time she got back to the house, she was late getting ready for the Summerset Ball. Alec and Regan officially owned her house now, and it felt strange to sleep in the guest room. Since her bed fit in it perfectly, she decided she would leave it and buy a new one in Boston.</p><p>Cordie had deliberately been crazy busy all week so she wouldn\u2019t have time to think about Aiden. Once she was on the road, she could cry her way to Boston if she wanted, even though her father wouldn\u2019t approve of that behavior. Crying upset him, and whenever he saw tears, he would tell her to man up, which, all things considered, didn\u2019t make a lick of sense.</p><p>There were a few good things she could concentrate on. The students she was tutoring suddenly figured it out. At first she could almost see the confusing chemistry problems tumbling around in their minds, and when things actually clicked, she felt a rush similar to euphoria. That \u201cgot it\u201d moment was the reason she became a teacher. She would still be doing her job at St. Matthew\u2019s if it weren\u2019t for Aiden, but she was desperate not to follow in her father\u2019s footsteps and long for someone she couldn\u2019t have. Life was too short to waste, and she was ready for a fresh start.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in the shower?\u201d Regan stood in the doorway of the kitchen with her hands on her hips. Her hair and makeup were done, and she wore her robe. \u201cYou\u2019re not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not ready,\u201d Cordie countered.</p><p>\u201cAll I have to do is put on my dress. Hurry up, Cordie. You\u2019re going to have fun tonight.\u201d</p><p>Cordie rinsed her glass and put it in the dishwasher. \u201cHow do you know I\u2019ll have fun?\u201d</p><p>Regan shrugged. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to try to kill you. That\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got grease on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jayden had popped the hood and wanted her to look at the engine and check the connections. \u201cI\u2019m getting in the shower,\u201d she promised and hurried up the stairs.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in the mood to pretend to be happy and smile and make inane conversation, but she was going to do exactly that, and no one, not even her best friends, would know her heart was breaking.</p><p>The sapphire blue gown she\u2019d worn in Sydney had been cleaned and was hanging in the closet. Unfortunately, Miss Marie wasn\u2019t there to oversee Cordie\u2019s makeup and hair. She smiled thinking about the bossy woman and hoped one day she\u2019d see her again.</p><p>After she\u2019d dried her hair, she put on a little makeup\u2014nothing as artful as Miss Marie\u2019s work, but at least she looked more like herself. She left her hair down because the only other option she had was a ponytail, and she didn\u2019t think that would be appropriate. When she was ready, she stood in front of a full-length mirror to check that everything was tucked in. Miss Marie was right, she decided; the gown was the exact color of her eyes.</p><p>Regan and Alec were waiting for her in the foyer. Regan was fixing Alec\u2019s tie. They both turned as she came down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Regan said.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, too, Regan,\u201d she replied. It wasn\u2019t an idle compliment. The deep burgundy gown was stunning on her friend.</p><p>Cordie was quiet on the way to the country club where the charity ball was being held. She sat in the backseat watching Alec tug on his collar.</p><p>Regan noticed. \u201cTwice a year, Alec. You only have to wear a tux twice a year, so suck it up.\u201d</p><p>Her husband laughed. \u201cSuck it up?\u201d</p><p>The mood lightened, and by the time they walked into the country club, they were all ready to have a good time.</p><p>The club was one of Chicago\u2019s older establishments, but it had recently been remodeled, and the ballroom had been expanded to nearly twice the original size. It was beautifully appointed in a contemporary design. Two-story-high windows overlooked the lake and golf course. Crystal chandeliers shaped like glistening waterfalls hung from the ceiling and cast a soft light on the guests who mingled on the dance floor in the center of the room. Round tables decked out in white linens and gleaming crystal and silver lined the perimeter.</p><p>The band was tuning their instruments on the stage at the far end of the dance floor. Quite a crowd had shown up, and the laughter and champagne were flowing. It was a festive occasion, Cordie reminded herself, and time for her to stop being melancholy and get with it.</p><p>Alec found their table. Cordie thought she would sit and watch the couples dance, but that didn\u2019t happen. As soon as the music started, she was pulled onto the dance floor by one of the most aggravating men. His name was Elliott, and he had chased after her all through college. He didn\u2019t know how to take no for an answer, and like a pesky rash, he wouldn\u2019t go away no matter how many times she tried to excuse herself. Forcing a smile, she tried to pay attention to what he was saying, but the romantic song the band was playing kept intruding.</p><p>The music finally ended. She stepped away from her partner and, politely refusing another dance, turned to go back to the table. She suddenly froze. Aiden was there, in the doorway talking to Jack and Sophie. Aiden in a tuxedo\u2014there wasn\u2019t anything in the world that could take her breath away like Aiden in a tuxedo. She stood in the center of the dance floor, all alone, watching him. Her mind was telling her to turn around and walk\u2014or run\u2014but her legs weren\u2019t cooperating. She had thought she\u2019d be able to get out of town without seeing him again. It had actually become a hope.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>She could do this, she told herself. She would thank him yet again for taking such good care of her, kiss him on the cheek, and run like lightning. It seemed like a good plan of action until she reevaluated. Being a coward wasn\u2019t such a bad thing, was it? Maybe she should just run now.</p><p>The music began\u2014another romantic song, of course\u2014and Elliott was back asking for one more dance. Before she could answer him, Aiden was there telling him no and taking her into his arms. Pressing his body to hers, he glided her away.</p><p>One dance. She could do one dance. Then she\u2019d run.</p><p>\u201cHow is your arm?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGood. It\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her closer. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>His reaction was puzzling. He laughed and released his hold so he could look in her eyes. \u201cYou know what else I miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d</p><p>She was totally unprepared for his answer. \u201cThe sounds you make when I\u2019m inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you\u2019re begging me to let you come\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her hand covered his mouth. \u201cStop talking like that,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPeople will hear.\u201d</p><p>Her blush delighted him. \u201cYou know what else I miss?\u201d</p><p>She buried her face in his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say it . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss the way your nails dig into my back, and I miss the way you say my name when you\u2019re writhing in my arms.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cPlease stop.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard you say that.\u201d</p><p>Her knees were going to buckle. Fortunately, he was holding her up. She realized she needed to get the upper hand.</p><p>\u201cWe have established that you like sex. I don\u2019t need to hear any more reasons why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like sex with you. No, that\u2019s not right. I love sex with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tried to push away from him. \u201cYou like skinny blondes,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>\u201cI . . . what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like skinny blondes.\u201d</p><p>He was looking at her as though he thought she\u2019d lost her mind, and she was beginning to think she had.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving for Boston in the morning,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>They were swaying to the music now, unaware that the band had stopped playing.</p><p>\u201cNo? What do you mean, no?\u201d Did he think she needed his permission?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me?\u201d</p><p>He could have sworn he saw sparks in her eyes. \u201cI went to Congressman Chambers\u2019s press conference.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou did? What did you do? Was it good?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYeah, it was.\u201d</p><p>When he told her what had happened, she was ecstatic. \u201cThe mayor had no idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe only person who knew I was up to something was the reporter, Kalie. I told her to be ready.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think the mayor could beat him in the primary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she has a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I had been there to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you there with me,\u201d he admitted, his tone serious now. \u201cCordelia, I need to talk to you . . . to tell you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back to the hotel with me. We\u2019ll have privacy there.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, Aiden. I\u2019m going to Boston tomorrow, and if I go back to the suite with you, we both know what will happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you leave.\u201d He sighed. \u201cYes, I heard it. I meant I won\u2019t let you leave.\u201d</p> <p>He tried to kiss her, but she turned her head. \u201cWe\u2019re in public, for Pete\u2019s sake. Behave yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t go with me to the hotel where we could have privacy,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cSo I guess we\u2019re going to do this here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cIf we were in my suite, first I would kiss you, and then, if I could keep my hands and my mouth off you long enough, I would tell you I love you.\u201d</p><p>She was so stunned, it took her several seconds to react. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. I was just convenient. Yes, convenient,\u201d she insisted when he looked so incredulous.</p><p>\u201cWhat goes on in that mind of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love me,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, Cordelia.\u201d His smile was filled with tenderness. \u201cI love you. Do you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Boston.\u201d She was shaken and was having trouble holding a thought. He loved her? When did that happen?</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve bought a town house. I have to move there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordelia, answer me. Do you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was a whisper, but he heard her. She poked him in the chest. \u201cThat town house was expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll move to Boston with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t move to Boston; your whole life is here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhere you go, I go,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how marriage works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you not understanding here? I love you, Cordelia.\u201d He wrapped his strong arms around her and kissed her so passionately her whole body went weak.</p><p>When the kiss ended, Cordie, still wrapped in Aiden\u2019s embrace, looked around. \u201cThe band\u2019s not playing,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, leaning in to kiss her again.</p><p>She put her fingers on his lips to stop him and nodded her head to the side, motioning for him to look at something. He turned and smiled. Regan and Sophie were standing there staring at them with their mouths open in shock.</p><p>Aiden laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll let you explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me?\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Cordelia and Aiden were married at St. Matthew\u2019s Church three months later. Neither of them wanted to wait, and although there hadn\u2019t been much time to plan, they managed to pull it off without any glitches. Sister Delores was so happy Cordie had decided to come back to St. Matthew\u2019s to teach and so grateful for the scholarship fund Cordie had set up in her father\u2019s name, she actually got teary-eyed during the ceremony. The newlyweds honeymooned in Australia, and Cordie got to see all the wonderful places she had read about. Julian and his daughter couldn\u2019t ruin her love for the country, but she avoided Sydney until it was time to meet the board and sign the papers. She didn\u2019t want the stock, yet according to the will she couldn\u2019t give it up.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do with it?\u201d she asked Aiden.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure out something,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>When they reached Sydney, they stayed in their suite at the Hamilton, of course. According to Liam, the scandal of the year was finally dying down. He went with them to the company headquarters to meet the board. He wore his weapon on his hip, but Cordie didn\u2019t see a badge.</p><p>\u201cDo you expect trouble?\u201d she asked. She walked between Aiden and Liam up the steps to the entrance of the office building.</p><p>\u201cJust a precaution,\u201d he explained.</p><p>The board members were waiting for her. There were eleven at the long table, all men, and all of them trying to mask their unease. The twelfth board member, Craig Rayburn, was noticeably absent, and Cordie was thankful she didn\u2019t have to be in the same room with him. The men stood when she entered.</p><p>\u201cMiss Kane is here,\u201d the man at the head of the table said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dr. Madison.\u201d Aiden made the correction.</p><p>\u201cDoctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d There was a hard edge to Aiden\u2019s voice, and Cordie presumed he was telling them to respect her.</p><p>Each board member introduced himself. She didn\u2019t shake hands with any of them. Aiden handed her a pen. She appreciated that her husband had gone to law school, because only after he had read over the documents did he allow her to sign. Liam, acting like a bodyguard, stood watch behind her.</p><p>\u201cDo you plan to be active . . . with your stock? Will you be voting?\u201d the man in the chairman\u2019s chair asked.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Thirty long minutes later, Liam was driving them back to the hotel, and Aiden was trying to talk him into having dinner with them as a thank-you for all his help.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the offer,\u201d Liam said, \u201cbut I have to be in Melbourne tonight. There\u2019s a . . . situation I have to clean up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam, may I ask you a question?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>He looked at her in the rearview mirror. \u201cSure you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you work for?\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he said, \u201cDepends on the day of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, today who do you work for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe government.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich government?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to drop you off at the hotel and be on my way. I have a plane waiting for me,\u201d he said, effectively putting an end to the topic of his employment.</p><p>Giving up, she turned to Aiden. \u201cWhat did you think of the board?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t made a judgment yet. Not enough information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they liked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think so?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cI can tell when I\u2019m being played,\u201d she said with authority.</p><p>Liam thought that was quite funny. \u201cYou can tell, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can. I\u2019m used to people trying to con me. I teach high school boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you knew all those delays on the floors of your Boston town house didn\u2019t really happen. Alec was scheming up one excuse after another to keep you in Chicago . . . but you figured that out, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what? Why would he want to keep me in Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to him, you two were clueless. Those were his words, not mine. He thought Aiden needed time to figure it all out, and so did you.\u201d</p><p>She was astounded. She had been played. \u201cThen the floors . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were finished the first week.\u201d</p><p>That devil. \u201cI\u2019m going to be having a little chat with him when we get home.\u201d</p><p>She was still thinking about Alec\u2019s tricks when Liam pulled up in front of the hotel and got out to say good-bye. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure,\u201d he said, shaking Aiden\u2019s hand.</p><p>When he turned to Cordie, she hugged him and said, \u201cThank you so much for everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d he said. He winked at her and got back in the car.</p><p>As he was driving off, Aiden took Cordie\u2019s hand. \u201cI could use a drink. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds lovely,\u201d she replied.</p><p>They entered the lobby and were heading to the bar when Aiden asked, \u201cDo you see her? Simone is here.\u201d</p><p>Cordie looked at the far end of the lobby and spotted Simone sitting stiffly in a wingback chair near the bank of elevators. \u201cWhat does she want?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk to her, Cordelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll go away. Let\u2019s get it over with.\u201d</p><p>They continued into the bar, conscious that Simone was watching. When she stood and followed them, Cordie felt as though she was heading for a showdown at the O.K. Corral. Taking a seat at one of the tables, she waited.</p><p>Simone didn\u2019t try to hide her anger. There was a round table between them, and for a second Cordie thought the woman might lunge at her.</p><p>Simone\u2019s voice shook. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019ve done to me? To my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m the one who did anything. It was your father who tried to have me killed. He belongs in prison, and I\u2019m not so sure you don\u2019t belong there, too, but unfortunately, it\u2019s not a crime to be a coldhearted bitch.\u201d</p><p>Simone couldn\u2019t restrain herself. Her hand flew at Cordie, but Aiden grabbed her wrist.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d Cordie asked.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to know the terrible, terrible thing you\u2019ve done to me. You\u2019ve destroyed me and my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow have I done that?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t hold our heads up, thanks to you. The shame . . . the humiliation is too much to bear. I\u2019ve been asked to resign from every board, every charity. I\u2019m being shunned and cut out of every social function in the city. Your hate did that to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you. I feel sorry for you. The scandal will fade, and in time it might even be forgotten. I promise, you\u2019ll never have to worry about seeing me in the future. And you can forget all about me once again.\u201d</p><p>Cordie\u2019s promise seemed to calm Simone. She nodded and, without another word, walked out of the bar.</p><p>Leaning into Aiden, Cordie watched her leave. \u201cShe was very young when she had me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an excuse for her behavior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said. \u201cI do feel sorry for her. She made me realize how very lucky I am. I was raised by a loving father, and I doubt Simone got much affection from her father. Julian was more interested in keeping her in line.\u201d She put her arms around Aiden\u2019s neck. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a wonderful father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She kissed him and whispered in his ear, \u201cShall we go upstairs and get started?\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
